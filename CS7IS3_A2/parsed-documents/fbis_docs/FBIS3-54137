The continuing arms build-up among Arab countries, the spread of Islamic fundamentalism, and an anticipated increase in terrorist activity require Israel to maintain its strength and alertness, says Shahaq. The deputy chief of staff was speaking at a meeting this morning with military reporters, where he reviewed the IDF's plans for 1994. With more, reporter Alan Ben-'Ami: Taking an overall look at Israel's strategic situation, the IDF sees three positive trends in three major areas for concern. On the plus side, the peace process continues, Israel's international standing and relations with other countries are getting better all the time, and the country's economic situation is steadily improving. Against this, a wary eye needs to be kept on the continuing arms build-up of Iran and Arab countries, especially with regard to nonconventional weapons. The spread of Islamic fundamentalism and the likelihood of increased terrorist activity are dangers to be addressed. For the time being, then, the IDF will keep both eyes open and its powder dry. No significant changes will be made in its order of battle this year, and all branches of the armed forces will acquire sophisticated new weaponry and equipment. This will include planes and helicopters for the Air Force, antimissile systems for the Air Force and the Navy, the first of the Saar 5 type missile boats which are now under construction, and improved tanks, armored personnel carriers, and advanced artillery guns and rocket launchers for the Army. The emphasis will be to widen even further the all-weather and around-the-clock fighting capabilities of all three branches. In addition to the training programs and exercises for the IDF's standing forces, training of reserve forces -- which has been erratic in recent years due to budgetary restraints and operational duties in the territories -- this would be stepped up and put on a more even keel. At the same time, reservists are likely to find themselves being called up for duty much less, although those in combat units will continue to bear the brunt of reserve service. Antiterrorist activity and maintaining the security along Israel's border with Lebanon will continue to play a major role in the Army's day-to-day operations. Guerrilla and terrorist operations by Palestinian and Lebanese groups doubled in southern Lebanon last year, compared with 1992. There were 330 hostile acts of one sort or another, compared with 170 the previous year, with Hizballah well ahead of other groups in attacks of one sort or another against the IDF and the South Lebanon Army. The forecast is for increased terrorist activity in the year ahead, both from Lebanon and also in the territories.
