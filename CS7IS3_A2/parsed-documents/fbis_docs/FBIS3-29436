The book contains travel notes written by the members of a delegation of the Aomori Prefecture Solidarity Committee of Japan for supporting Korea's reunification who visited Korea last year and photographs taken by them. Reitaburo Sagawa, who led the delegation, in his travelogue says the DPRK has registered phenomenal achievements under the wise guidance of the great leader President Kim Il-song. The policy of believing in the masses and relying upon them is the driving force of socialist construction in the DPRK, he notes. He states that the policy centred on the masses in Korea proves the superiority of socialism. "The demand of the International Atomic Energy Agency for a 'special inspection' of the military sites of the DPRK, is, no doubt, based on the manoeuvres of the United States, Japan, etc. The United States seeks in this to keep its forces in South Korea for a long period and disarm the DPRK," he says.
