FR941205-2-00092 FR941205-2-00050 6. Various fees and charges are deducted under the Contracts. An annual policy maintenance charge of the lesser of 2% of Contract Value or $35 per Contract Year will be deducted prior to the Annuity Commencement Date, and upon a full surrender on any date other than a Policy Anniversary, to compensate AUSA Life for contract administration. A daily administrative expense charge, equal to an effective annual rate of .15% of the net assets of each Subaccount in which the Contract Owner has invested, will be deducted prior to the Annuity Commencement Date and, if a Variable Payment Option is selected, may be deducted after that Date. No charge currently is made for transfers among the Portfolios; however, the right is reserved to impose a charge of up to $25 for the thirteenth and each subsequent transfer thereafter during a single Contract Year. AUSA Life does not expect a profit from these charges. AUSA represents that it will monitor its administrative expenses and the proceeds of these charges on at least an annual basis to ensure compliance with Rule 26a&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act. 7. AUSA Life will deduct applicable premium taxes from the Policy Value on the Annuity Commencement Date, or upon full surrender or payment of the Death Benefit. No charges currently are made for federal, state or local taxes, other than premium taxes; however, such taxes may be deducted in the future. 8. No sales charge is deducted from premium payments. However, certain full or partial surrenders will be subject to a maximum 7% contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC''), which will be imposed on a declining basis during the first seven Contract Years after payment of the premium being withdrawn. The CSDC will compensate AUSA Life for expenses relating to the distribution and sale of the Contracts. For purposes of computing the CSDC, the earliest premium payments will be deemed to be withdrawn first. No CSDC will be applied after the first Contract Year to that portion of the first surrender in the Contract Year equal to 10% or less of the Contract Value. The CSDC also will not apply under certain circumstances if the Contract Value is applied to provide an annuity under one of the Annuity Payment Options. AUSA Life does not anticipate that the CDSC will generate sufficient revenues to pay all its distribution costs. Excess distribution costs would be paid out of AUSA Life's general assets, which may include profits derived from the mortality and expense risk charge assessed under the Contracts. 9. A daily charge equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets in the Separate Account will be deducted to compensate AUSA Life for bearing certain mortality and expense risks under the Contracts. Of that amount, approximately 0.45% is for mortality risks and approximately 0.80% is for expense risks. This charge applies prior to the Annuity Commencement Date and, if a Variable Payment Option is selected, after that Date. 10. The mortality risk arises from AUSA Life's contractual obligation to make Annuity Payments (determined in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions provided in the Contracts) regardless of how long any individual Annuitant or all Annuitants may live. This undertaking assures that neither an Annuitant's own longevity, nor an improvement in general life expectancy, will adversely affect the monthly annuity payments that the Annuitant will receive under the Contracts. A mortality risk also is assumed in connection with the Death Benefit Guarantee, for which there is no extra charge. 11. The expense risk assumed by AUSA Life's actual administrative costs will exceed the amount recovered through the administrative and policy maintenance charges. 12. AUSA Life currently anticipates that the mortality and expense risk charge will be more than sufficient to cover its costs. Accordingly, any excess will be profit to AUSA Life and may be available to pay distribution costs for the Contracts that are not covered by funds derived from the CSDC.
