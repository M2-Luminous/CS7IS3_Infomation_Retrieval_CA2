The Philippines is expected to buy 200,000 tons of 25-percent broken rice and 300,000 tons of 35-percent broken rice from Thailand. The Philippines will ask for a four- month credit for the purchase of this rice. If the negotiations are successful, the private sector will be allowed to carry out this rice deal, because the government does not intend to interfere in rice exports. Chaiyot revealed that even with the delivery of 150,000 tons of Philippine fertilizer, the Philippines still owes Thailand some 475 million baht. The National Rice Policy Committee, he said, is responsible for this debt and will decide whether or not the Philippines should pay compensation to Thailand in case debt repayment is delayed. Asked about the proposal made by Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan, chairman of the National Rice Policy Committee, for Thai investors to pay the money they intend to invest in the Philippines to the committee and withdraw the same amount from the Philippine Government, Chaiyot said the proposal is practical and there should not be any problem with it. The deputy minister noted that the committee will take care of the debt while the Commerce Ministry pursues its efforts to sell Thai rice.
