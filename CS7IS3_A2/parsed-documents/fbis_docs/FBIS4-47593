The demands of participants in the strike are not very different from the ultimatums to the government stated by miners, oil field workers or communications workers. ``We want payment of what is owing to the RAS for 1993, payment of the shortfall for January and February of 1994, compensation for inflation due to late allocation of funds for the pay raise in 1993, and also reimbursement for incomplete compensation of increased cost of communal payments for the period from 1 April 1993 through 1 February 1994.'' So goes the printed statement of the Trade Union of Workers of the RAS addressed to Sergey Dubinin, acting ministry of finances of Russia. According to calculations of union bosses of the RAS, the total indebtedness of the government to the Academy of Sciences is more than 108 billion rubles per year. But this time, they did not strike, preferring talks with the government. However, unfortunately extreme forms of protest (strikes and the like) have become a very popular ploy among Russian scientists. More precisely, among their trade unions. There might be more of them on strike than miners. And so what? A whole series of demonstrations put on by scientists, draping the statue of General Lomonosov in rags and symbolically burying science, have not wrested a single copeck from the budget. As the noted economist Nikolay Shmelev recently remarked, the government has no money to be found, even on the night-table of the minister of finances. In return, the very theoretical and research activity for which the RAS is fighting has suffered considerable losses because of these actions. In the words of Professor Granit Fedorov, one of the organizers of picketing of the Ministry of Finance and of a proposed subsequent nationwide protest, member of the Russian council of the trade union of the RAS, for the last two decades the rate of doubling of human knowledge has grown by a factor of more than 50, and the loss of each day of creative activity is in proportion. In answer to the question of SEGODNYA's correspondent whether trade unions of scientists are capable of any forms of protecting the interests of their members that are more constructive than pickets and strikes, Vladimir Khlebodarov, director of trade unions of the RAS, stated that the trade union is ``ready to talk about the substance of the demands.'' But it would seem that in this country at this time, the outcome of such talks is foreordained.
