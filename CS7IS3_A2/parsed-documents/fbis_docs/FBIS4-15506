FBIS4-15506 "drsov068_a_94033" FBIS-SOV-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Gas Supplies to Turkey Increased Gas Supplies to Turkey Increased LD0704220894 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1359 GMT 7 Apr 94 LD0704220894 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Russia has granted Turkey's request to bring the annual volume of natural gas supplies up to 10.5 billion cubic meters by 1998. 2.5 billion cubic meters of this volume are to be used by the heat-and-power plant to be built in Turkey under Russian project. In addition, the two sides began to consider a project for building Turkey's first nuclear-power plant with Russia's direct participation. This might involve equipment supplies worth hundreds of millions of dollars. These and other issues concerning business cooperation between Russia and Turkey were discussed in detail at the session held on Tuesday and Wednesday in Moscow by the joint intergovernmental commission on trade and economic cooperation. The session was chaired by Russia's Minister for external economic relations, Oleg Davydov, and by the Turkish Minister for construction and population centers, Onur Kumbaracibasi. The Turkish minister informed participants in the session of his country's willingness to increase the worth of its requests for the purchases of special property in Russia to 600 million dollars. However this can happen only if Russia agrees to supply Turkey with 260-million-dollar worth of helicopters and other military equipment to repay Russia's debt to Turkey which amounts to 320 million dollars. As Interfax learned from a reliable source close to government circles, a tentative agreement on such supplies has been reached. However initially their volume will be somewhat lower -- 60 million dollars. Participants in the session paid great attention to the ways to expand bilateral cooperation in the area of conversion, investment and power engineering. They noted with satisfaction that the turnover between the two countries grew rapidly and reached 2 billion dollars last year. Speaking at the ceremony of signing the final documents, Russia's Minister for external economic relations, Oleg Davydov, said that in the current year the volume of Russian-Turkish trade may more than double and surpass the level reached in Russia's trade with the USA.
