A major report published by the quasi-official Prognostic Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences presents a gloomy view of rising unemployment, falling productivity and continuing high inflation in Slovakia. But many Czech economists who have reviewed the report say that it may even be a bit optimistic. The report, written by economists Pavol Karasz, Juraj Rencko, Iveta Pauhofova and Edita Bauerova, contains some hard-hitting predictions, many of which run counter to the Slovak government's official position. Among the report's predictions: Falling productivity. The gross domestic product in 1994 is projected to be between 0.8 and 3.3 percent lower than it was in 1993. The report predicts that the 1994 GDP will total 166.4 billion-170.6 billion Sk ($4.8 billion-4.9 billion). That would be the fourth annual decline since the 1989 revolution, though the rate of decline seems to be slowing. Using constant values, the GDP totaled 172 billion Sk in 1993, 180 billion Sk in 1992, 194 billion Sk in 1991 and 227 billion Sk in 1990. The report does forecast a dim light at the end of the tunnel: zero GDP growth in 1995, which would be an improvement over the continual decline. But Anton Marcincin of Prague's Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education (CERGE) said the institute's projections are too optimistic, adding that Slovak GDP could easily fall by as much as 6 percent in 1994. Rising unemployment. The report projects that unemployment, which hovered around 12.9 percent in 1993, will jump to 15.6-17.3 percent this year, and could possibly climb as high as 20 percent. Between 390,000 and 433,000 people could be out of work by year's end. Marcincin, however, predicts that unemployment will reach 20-25 percent. Deficit spending. The Slovak government projects that it will run a deficit of around 14 billion Sk, equaling 3.7 to 3.9 percent of the expected GDP. But the Prognostic Institute report predicts that the deficit will reach 4.2-5.4 percent of the projected GDP. Nevertheless, that's still better than last year's rate of 6.2 percent. Rising inflation. The report predicts that inflation will be 14 to 16 percent in 1994, even though real income will either continue to fall or, at best, remain flat. But Jiri Schwarz, president of the Liberal Institute, a Prague-based think tank, warns that the inflation rate and budget deficit could both go much higher if Slovakia has early elections this year, as politicians spend more money on public works in order to trim the growing unemployment rate. CERGE economist Marcincin predicts that inflation could reach 22 percent. Growing poverty. The report indicates that many young families, especially those with several children, a single parent, unemployed parents or parents who work in a recession-hit sector of the economy, have joined the group that lives at or below the poverty line, previously made up predominantly of pensioners. The "social patience" of Slovakia's man in the street is gradually running out, the report warns. The report concludes that no fundamental turnaround in the Slovak economy should be expected this year. And even if the GDP flattens out next year, it remains to be seen whether it will then be replaced by growth or simply by long-term stagnation. That depends to a large extent on just how able Slovakia is to change the structure of its economy. Czech economist Zdislav Sulc, an adviser to the first post-1989 Czechoslovak government, said the Slovak economy in general is too "spontaneous," since the government still has not formulated a clear, well-defined economic policy for the country. Sulc also says the privatization process has come to a virtual halt in Slovakia.
