Although it has existed for 17 years, the Security College, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, represents a limit on the admission of college-educated people into the police, except for detectives, who are narrowly focused personnel without "horizontal" mobility to other parts of the state administration. People at the Security College are asking whether hastily trained lawyers or economists can fight crime. The Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] Assembly's meeting three days ago, when the "Proposal to Adopt a Law on Establishing a Training Center for Personnel in the Field of Security" came on the agenda, revived once again the dispute that has existed for almost a year between the Interior Ministry and representatives of the present Security College. The basic dilemma, which is also extremely debatable for a considerable number of parliamentarians (at least according to their statements at the meeting) is whether the Security College, which has existed since 1977, should be abolished, since the most fundamental innovation in the government's proposal is the elimination of this college and the establishment of a Center, whose basic task would be to create personnel for the uniformed portion of the police (the present police secondary school). The Assembly epilogue of the draft offered is well-known: By a majority of votes, the deputies decided that the law would be handled in two phases, with the government charged with preparing a bill. Invasion of the Police by Unemployed Lawyers The Assembly debate revived the dispute begun somewhat less than a year ago, with the notification by Minister Ljubomir Frckovski, sent to the Security College, which suspended the enrollment of students for the upcoming (1993) academic year. Several months later, on 18 June, Agis Sajnoski, then dean of the college, convened a news conference at which he called the Interior Minister's decision to suspend the enrollment of students an arbitrary action, behind which lay the interests of a group of professors at the Law College, well deployed in the government, the University's rector, and the ministers of internal affairs and education, whose intentions were to wipe out the education of detectives in order to create room for the employment of lawyers in the Interior Ministry, which has recently been done intensively. Interior Minister Ljubomir Frckovski responded that the reactions by the group of professors from the Security College were an attempt to attract public attention by staging "street fights," although in doing so they did not have the support of a single competent institution. "On the whole, one can understand their reaction," Frckovski said then, "which is due to fear for their own jobs and the high salaries that professors have." In the meantime, the Macedonian Government completed the procedure for preparing a new draft on the transformation of the present Center (without the college), which was reviewed this fall by four Assembly commissions, and three days ago at the Macedonian parliament's meeting. What are the differences between the two opposing sides, and what are the arguments "for" and "against" eliminating the Security College, since it is more than clear that this is actually the most fundamental change in the government draft that was offered? The explanation of the Proposal to Adopt a Law on Establishing a Training Center for Personnel in the Field of Security, for example, says that for almost 15 years the Interior Ministry, in its personnel policy, focused on the admission of "detective" personnel from the Security College, which exists within the framework of the Center. This kind of personnel orientation, the explanation then says, represents a limitation, and restricts the admission of college-educated people with other professional backgrounds, since these are narrowly specialized personnel, without "horizontal" mobility into other parts of the state administration. It then says that experiences with the quality and adjustment of personnel to work in the Ministry are in favor of employees with ordinary highly professional training--lawyers, economists, computer scientists, sociologists, chemists, and so forth. What still remain extremely controversial are the way in which this college was even founded--imposed on the Republic of Macedonia for the needs of the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] internal affairs authorities--the method and selection of personnel for the needs of a completely different system, which could by no means be described as democratic. At the same time, the explanation of the Proposal to Adopt a Law says, several meetings were held with representatives of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Science, the Cyril and Methodius University, and the Center, at which there were discussions of these issues, and in which agreement was reached in principle on the transformation project, with which only the Security College's representatives did not agree. Conflict of Conceptual Differences In contrast to the position of the government and the Interior Ministry, the current dean of the Security College, Dr. Ivanco Stojanov, has a completely different view of things. "Our college is a member of the Cyril and Methodius University," Stojanov said, "and it cannot be abolished without a decision by the University Council. Accordingly, the position stated in the explanation of the draft, that meetings were held at the University and that some sort of agreement on abolishing the college was reached, does not correspond to the truth. On the contrary," as Stojanov emphasized, "criminology is a special science, and differs from the legal, economic, and other sciences, and consequently a criminal scientist is in a different profession. The fact is that crime itself is a complex phenomenon, and only a suitably trained individual can cope with it, who will be able to cope with the primary function--preventing, detecting, clarifying, and proving crime. Can that be done by a hastily trained person, and can he be equipped by a course several months long to perform these things?" Stojanov asked. "I maintain that during the last three years the Interior Ministry has hired about 1,000 graduate criminal scientists, but three or four times more lawyers," the dean of the Security College emphasized. According to him, this has radically violated the criterion of professionalism or competence, since it is impossible for people with different professional qualifications to conduct the police's basic activity. "And as for the claim that personnel from this college have proven to be of poor quality and unable to adapt," Stojanov stated categorically, "let someone tell me where the present chiefs of the Interior Ministry's regional units came from, the direct of the Center for Training Security Personnel, and several managers in the police services and sectors. If they are poor-quality personnel, then why are they assigned to management positions?" our interlocutor asked. The main argument for the special status of the Security College, according to its dean, is its very curriculum, which consists of 24 subjects, which are not studied at any other college in the University. Among others, they are: detective tactics, social pathology, criminal psychology, special physical education, the basics of security science, detective techniques, detective methodology, police tactics, forensic medicine, transportation criminal science, the criminology of unconstitutional acts, the methodology for investigating crime, victimology, the statistics of crime, ecological criminal science, criminological information science, economic criminal science, and so forth. From what has been stated above, it can be seen clearly that there are substantive conceptual differences over the (lack of) justification for the continued survival of the Security College. On one hand, the Interior Ministry's position is that in the spirit of the new times and the role of the police, narrowly focused and "horizontally" immobile personnel are not needed, but rather more narrowly specialized individuals from several scientific areas and disciplines. The college's position, on the contrary, is that the basic activity of a detective cannot be conducted by lawyers, economists, or chemists, since they are trained for other fields. In other words, a specific problem like crime inevitably requires expert personnel who would be able to oppose it successfully. Whatever the case, the Republic of Macedonia's Assembly will have the last word. The latest news associated with this issue is the announcement by the Interior Minister that the enrollment of students at the Security College has been frozen for this year as well.
