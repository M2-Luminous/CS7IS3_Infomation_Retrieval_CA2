FR940418-1-00003 FR940418-1-00001 SFAS 115 SFAS 115 applies for all debt securities and certain equity securities that have readily determinable fair values. The statement establishes new accounting and reporting requirements for such securities effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993, but banks have the option of adopting the statement as of the end of an earlier fiscal year. For most banks, that would be as of December 31, 1993. SFAS 115 requires banks to divide their securities holdings among three categories: securities held-to-maturity, trading securities, and available-for-sale securities. Each category of security is accounted for differently. Held-to-Maturity The held-to-maturity category replaces the existing held for investment category. Presently, securities held for investment are recorded at amortized cost. Under SFAS 115, securities in the held-to-maturity category will be recorded at amortized cost. However, only those securities that a bank has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity may be included in this account. This change will restrict a bank's ability to carry securities at amortized cost. For example, if a bank has the intent to hold a security for only an indefinite period, the security cannot be classified as held-to-maturity. Consequently, if a security would be sold in response to (1) changes in market interest rates and related changes in the security's prepayment risk, (2) liquidity needs, (3) changes in the availability of and yield on alternative investments, (4) changes in funding sources and terms, or (5) changes in foreign currency risk, then it must be assigned to either the available-for-sale or trading categories. Nonetheless, changes in circumstances may occur that cause a bank to change its intent to hold a security to maturity. SFAS 115 notes that a sale or transfer of a security from the held-to-maturity account in response to events that are isolated, nonrecurring, and unusual and that could not have been anticipated, would not necessarily call into question the bank's intent to hold other securities to maturity. Trading Securities The accounting for trading securities has not changed. Trading securities are those debt and equity securities that a bank buys and holds principally for the purpose of selling in the near term. Trading securities will continue to be recorded at fair value with unrealized changes in fair value reported directly in the income statement as part of the bank's earnings.
