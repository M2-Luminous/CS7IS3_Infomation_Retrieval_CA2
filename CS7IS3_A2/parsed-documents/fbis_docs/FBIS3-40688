International trade is a fearsomely technical subject. This may be why the P.V. Narasimha Rao government seems to have believed GATT could be quietly slipped through Parliament without fuss. Given the Dunkel draft touches on such emotive subjects as medicine, seeds and textiles this was a remarkable bit of wishful thinking on the part of South Block. The consequences of this attempt to avoid debate has been an intellectual vacuum now filled by emotional rhetoric and irrational fears. Much of the scaremongering about GATT by leftwing critics is wholly unfounded, particularly the claims regarding seed patents. Thanks to official silence about what GATT will really mean it is the bogeys that have come to dominate the popular vision of the Dunkel draft. It is necessary India sign on the dotted line in Geneva next April. Among other things it is essential to the survival of economic liberalisation. Leftists who believe India should strike out on its own echo the hoary economic xenophobia that has given India over 40 years of splendid stagnation. Any international agreement impinges on a country's sovereignty. The question is what benefits will accrue to India from signing the GATT treaty. Because India is only marginally plugged into the world economy it will initially gain little and lose less because of GATT. However the world's largest trade treaty opens many doors. A nation with intelligence and perspicacity can benefit hugely. China alone is expected to reap some $40 billion in exports over the next decade. There is no reason India cannot drink from the same trough. It needs only to put its own economic house in order and be less fearful of the outside world. India's long isolation from the global economy has meant trade is still looked upon as something akin to colonialism. From Adam Smith onwards it has been shown that the exchange of goods and services between nations is a two way street, mutually beneficial. Victorian England and the US enhanced rather than diluted their national standing by being merchants to the world. Burma is the dingy example of a trade me not. What makes GATT important to a nation still finding its export feet is that it provides regulations, ensures a modicum of fair play and allows for independent adjudication in case of disputes. Outside GATT is a wild and woolly realm of unilateral sanctions and embargos. The West holds all the cards in the latter scenario. China, for example, accepted a patent regime much stricter than that present in the Dunkel draft because it negotiated a bilateral agreement with the US. The two sides were so mismatched Beijing left with its "sovereignty" in a sling. India needs to comprehend globalisation is not a mantra that will change reality by mere repetition. It requires a commitment to meet the standards and norms of a world that has raced far ahead. Catching up requires hard work, not histrionics.
