[Gaydar] I do not think that the newly formed government will be so unwise as to completely destabilize the financial and monetary situation over the next few months. Therefore, I do not fear an imminent economic catastrophe with hyperinflation and collapse of the levers of market control of the economy. I know my colleagues to be quite cautious people and I think that they are now to a very great extent concerned not to allow events to develop in that way. But there is something else which I greatly fear. I fear constant fluctuations in economic policy, the adoption of contradictory decisions, the government undertaking financial obligations, under the influence of various lobbying structures, which will prove to be impractical, the constant creation of financial crises, and rates of inflation rising and slightly falling around a level of 20-25 percent per month. That is, to put it briefly, the reappearance of that situation which is neither one thing nor the other in which market instruments are not totally destroyed but cannot work in a way conducive to economic development -- the preservation of that extremely unpleasant and unstable situation between a normal planned economy and a normal stable market economy which continues to exist in Russia and which costs us dear in social and economic terms. [Correspondent] Yegor Timurovich, these fluctuations which are indeed very tiring and annoying to the population have existed for a long time, for many months. They existed when you were in the government, also. Why have you decided to depart, so definitely to depart, precisely now? [Gaydar] Indeed, the policy which has been conducted in Russia was rather integrated and consistent during the first half of 1992, the first half-year of the work of our government. Afterwards the policy was always a compromise one, it was always formed under the influence of various groups, and we continued to conduct this policy, among other reasons because we wanted to make the changes irreversible, we wanted to move market regulation forwards as far as possible into the tissue of Russia's real economic life. Over the past year and a half in the work of the government and the organs of Russian power there was a fight between two different tendencies. On the surface it was manifested as a combat between inflationists and supporters of financial stabilization, between those who considered that the main thing was to halt the rise in prices and those who believed that it is possible in some way to raise the volume of production when there is galloping inflation. But I think that the main thing was something else, the question of the role of the state in Russian society. Our policy has always been oriented towards an economical, small, modest state where officials are few, where they do not enjoy too many rights as far as personal allocation of resources is concerned, and where their work is strictly supervised by the law. Another line envisaged a large, plentiful state which interferes extensively in economic life, where officials have broad opportunities to take personal decisions -- for example, to grant credits on preferential terms, subsidies, quotas, licenses -- in a word, to do things at their discretion. We allocate enormous credits on preferential terms to agriculture, we spend crazy amounts of money -- even now, after preferential crediting has been abolished -- on subsidizing interest payments for the credits granted in 1993, and in the meantime this money goes to a large extent, not into agriculture but to the currency exchange, on hard currency speculation. This is what it is all about. Well, it recently became clear to me lately that we cannot consistently defend our viewpoint any longer -- for instance, decisions such as that on the construction of a parliamentary center worth sums of money simply incomparable with the amounts allocated to many of the most important branches of the economy -- with this money we could solve the problem of the dumping of liquid radioactive waste into the Pacific Ocean 20 times over; or take the decision on setting up the ruble zone with Belarus -- this is a manifestation of the policy chosen, of a certain turn in economic policy. The blueprints for a large, plentiful, and expensive state have already been clearly laid out. This is unacceptable to me on principle, I simply do not think that this is for the good of Russia; therefore, I had to leave. [Correspondent] Yegor Timurovich, if we are talking in terms of huge amounts of money spent on preferential credits and so on, does this not turn out to be one of the main sources of inflation, and not at all of developing production etc? [Gaydar] Of course, preferential credits were one of the major sources of inflation in 1992-93. The money that we allocated to these needs cannot really be compared with much else. There's nothing in Russia with which to compare it, apart from defense expenditure. [Correspondent] But Viktor Stepanovich [Chernomyrdin] has just said that there will be no more handouts and that easy credit will be ended. As far as I know, it was ended precisely when you came into the government in September. [Gaydar] That's quite right. [Interviewer] Right, so there will be no more easy handouts, and so on. Admittedly, it is necessary to return debts to the agro-industrial and military-industrial complex and elsewhere, and, at the same time, it is necessary to boost production. Is it realistic to combine these aims? [Gaydar] Well, it seems to me that it's extremely hard to do. The problem of the state's debts is primarily a problem of inability to precisely match up one's possibilities and requirements. When people talk of economic romanticism or financial romanticism, that's a rather strange term to me. After all, if romanticism is a clear-cut desire to live according to one's means, then apracticism [apraktitsizm] is the wish to handle non-existent money. So this somewhat alters my traditional approach to the use of these terms. Perhaps you will excuse me for making use of a character who is traditional in Russian culture. Professor Preobrazhenskiy [a character in Bulgakov's play "A Dog's Heart"] used to point out that, if one regularly missed the toilet, the toilet would be a shambles. A financial shambles is simply the result of the constant adoption of decisions that are not backed by real sources of finance. Until such decisions are taken by the government and legislative bodies, we will still have a shambles in Russian finances, our ruble will be weak, and the state will constantly seek to justify itself to one group after another for having debts. [Correspondent] Yegor Timurovich, your decision to go is probably, nevertheless, a political decision first and foremost, and I think that it is also linked to the setback suffered in the elections by the Russia's Choice bloc that you lead. [Gaydar] Undoubtedly. Of course, I must say honestly that the results of the elections on 12 December came as a very serious blow to me, because they put a question mark for me over the axiom that I have always taken as a starting point in my life and work. That is the axiom that we have a reasonable and rational people, full of common sense. I found it very hard to understand how my fellow citizens, men and women, could vote for a party that is preparing to send their children off to fight in Turkey and Iran. On the other hand, one must understand the realities. Our country has passed through vast and very serious social changes, a cataclysm. The whole way of life is changing. It really is very hard. Nevertheless, after some thought, I came to the conclusion and conviction that this is only a short-term black-out of reason. I am absolutely convinced that common sense is very deeply rooted in Russia and that it will be triumphant, that people really do not want wars or military adventures or new revolutions. They want a normal, calm life. They want a normal, calm life; they do want everyone to be turned into entrepreneurs; they do not need that. In a normal, calm life in a market economy, the overwhelming number of people simply work normally and calmly and live on their perfectly adequate wages. Russian big business, including the new businesses, is essentially divided on questions of economic policy. This big business includes structures and people who have a stake in being closely linked with the state apparatus, who have a stake in decisions being taken by individuals, who have a stake in the allocation of advantageous resources in one form or another and of course who, categorically, have no interest in financial stabilization. [Correspondent] Excuse me, Yegor Timurovich, advantageous decisions taken by individuals -- this is, simply speaking, when a specific person... [Gaydar, interrupting] Simply speaking, this is when there is an official sitting at a table with a long line of people in front of him. People come to see him, and as a result he can sign a paper, a quota, for example. Such a quota is worth $5, 10, or 15 million, and he decides who among these hundred people in the line gets 5 millions, who gets 7 million, who gets 10 million, and who gets nothing. I think that there can be no situation more conducive to corruption. I cannot imagine any state apparatus set up without fear or reproach which will not take bribes in such a situation. [Correspondent] I see. This is the part of business which you tried to wage war on. [Gaydar] I did not try to wage war on it but I tried to wage war on behalf of a policy which rules out these forms of enrichment. But there is, of course, another side to Russian business. That is the side which is oriented toward the long-term aim, which well understands that such a form of business is a dead end, for the country at least, which in effect asks for one thing: Give us stable conditions in which to work, give us predictable and comprehensible rates of inflation, give us a firm ruble, give us taxes which are not probitively high -- and these prohibitively high taxes are a direct result of the state's handing out so much on an individual basis -- and in general we will cope with our problems, ourselves. That is the side of Russian business which in my view supports the wise policy which is the only possible policy for Russia if we really want to bring our country out onto a normal path of development. [Correspondent] It is difficult to imagine a party which would go into the elections with a program that declared: We are creating a state in which bureaucrats allocate vast favorable credits for commercial banks under the pretext of supporting production. Usually the program looks different and, as far as I know, it is always other words which are used, words about national greatness, about the renaissance of the Soviet Union and so on. That is, the more, let us say, complicated the real policies and the real interests behind it are, the finer the slogans sound. As far as I know you had virtually no such fine slogans during the election campaign. [Gaydar] You are right. Usually, such a policy proposing the strict combination of interests of corrupt officialdom and parts of the domestic bourgeoisie uses as a cover slogans of national greatness or national imperial slogans. If internal policy is impossible to defend, in frank talk, in frank discussion, they always try to sway people with the chimera of imperial greatness, and as far as the chimera of imperial greatness is concerned, it is quite a simple matter; it should be remembered that the Soviet Union collapsed when the monetary system collapsed, when the Soviet ruble began to be worthless. Ukraine ran away from it, everybody ran away from it. And as soon as, with all the inconsistency of our policy, the ruble became convertible, as soon as signs of stability arose, they reached out to Russia, lines formed of those wanting to deal with us, wanting to create a common economic space, and attitudes to integration with Russia changed immediately and radically. Unfortunately, defeat in the elections on 12 December objectively stopped us from resolving these tasks. In the end, we lost the battle but I am convinced that we will win the war.
