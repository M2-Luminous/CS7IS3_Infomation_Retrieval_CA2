Tinned chillies from the Jianghua Autonomous County of the Yao nationality sells well on world markets. The product was the winner of a gold medal for new products at the fifth Chinese Commodity Fair. Changsha, Yueyang and Hengyang cities exported 1,300 tons of tinned mushrooms last year, and more mushroom-growing villages and towns have emerged. Guidong, Pingjiang and Lengshuijiang cities have succeeded in growing non-polluted vegetables for export.

Meanwhile, advanced storage, processing and package techniques are being stressed.
