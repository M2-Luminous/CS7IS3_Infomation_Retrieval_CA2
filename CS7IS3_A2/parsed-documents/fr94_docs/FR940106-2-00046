FR940106-2-00046 FR940106-2-00030 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION Revised Jurisdictional Thresholds for Section 8 of the Clayton Act AGENCY: Federal Trade Commission. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Federal Trade Commission announces the revised thresholds for interlocking directorates required by the 1990 amendment of section 8 of the Clayton Act. Section 8 prohibits, with certain exceptions, one person from serving as a director or officer of two competing corporations if two thresholds are met. Competitor corporations are covered by section 8 if each one has capital, surplus, and undivided profits aggregating more than $10,000,000, with the exception that no corporation is covered if the competitive sales of either corporation are less than $1,000,000. Section 8(a)(5) requires the Federal Trade Commission to revise those thresholds annually, based on the change in gross national product. The new thresholds, which take effect immediately, are $12,092,000 for section 8(a)(1), and $1,209,200 for section 8(a)(2)(A). EFFECTIVE DATE: January 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Mongoven, Bureau of Competition, Office of Policy and Evaluation, (202) 326&hyph;2879. (Authority: 15 U.S.C. 19(a)(5)). By direction of the Commission.
