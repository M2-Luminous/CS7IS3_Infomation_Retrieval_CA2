It calls itself Total Democracy [Democracia Total] or Radical Democracy [Democracia Radical]. According to the DAS [Administrative Department of Security] Intelligence Department, the organization is made up of former members from the M-19 [19 April Movement] and Faith, Peace, and Freedom [EPL] who are dissidents from the peace process. The new organization's military targets are the presidential candidates, congress members, bankers, industrialists, and their former comrades, whom they accuse of treason. The director of the DAS Intelligence Department pointed out that documents found during an operation carried out by the DAS anti-kidnapping group disclosed that the guerrillas were planning multiple attacks to announce their subversive organization. [Begin DAS Intelligence Director Ricardo Villarraga Franco recording] They think the subversive struggle should be transferred to the cities; that their support in the rural areas is not as large as they would like. They want to carry out selective attacks, as they themselves say, against the bourgeoisie in the country. [end recording] Villarraga Franco insists this new guerrilla organization has recruited at least 20 percent of the former fighters of the four subversive organizations that demobilized. In addition, he said they are opposed to the tactics used by the National Guerrilla Coordinating Board. The main topic of the most recent Security Council held at the Defense Ministry was the appearance of Total Democracy. The authorities feel this group cannot be underestimated, because it has grown in strength and military capability.
