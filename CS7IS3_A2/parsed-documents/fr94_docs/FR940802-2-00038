SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response Title: Application for Reimbursement to Local Government (EPA ICR # 1425.03; OMB # 2050&hyph;0077). This ICR requests renewal of the existing clearance. Abstract : Section 123 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, allows any general purpose unit of local government to apply to EPA for reimbursements for costs incurred in carrying out temporary emergency measures necessary to prevent or mitigate injury to human health or the environment associated with the release or threatened release of any hazardous substance contaminant. The intent of the local government reimbursement program is to alleviate significant financial burden in carrying out temporary emergency measures. This information collection requires applicants for reimbursement to submit an application package demonstrating the financial burden, and the consistency of the response with program eligibility criteria. The package contains four sections: Section 1 identifies the name and location of the local governmental unit; Section 2 describes the date and time of the incident, the location, source and cause of the release, identify of the hazardous substance involved, and the threats to human health and the environment; Section 3 asks for specifics on the response action, response participants, contacts with EPA, and the temporary measures for which reimbursement is sought; Section 4 contains the cost information (e.g., invoices, sales receipts, rental agreements) needed to determine the amount of potential reimbursement, as well as evidence of attempts to recover costs from the responsible parties, insurance, or the State. Burden Statement: The estimated public reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is 20 hours per reimbursement application. This estimate includes time to review the instructions, gather existing information, and prepare and submit the form. Respondents: Local governments carrying out temporary emergency measures resulting from the release, or threat of release, of a hazardous substance. Estimated Number of Respondents: 90 local government units. Estimated Number of Responses Per Respondent: 1. Frequency of Collection: On occasion, when needed for response reimbursement. Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 1,800 hours. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this information collection, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to: Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. Jonathan Gledhill, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20530. Dated: July 26, 1994. Jane Stewart, Acting Director.
