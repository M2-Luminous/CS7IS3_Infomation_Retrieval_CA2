FR940413-1-00021 FR940413-1-00006 (b) MMS Proposal To preserve the required records until an audit begins, MMS proposes that the current NPSL operator furnish all records on the NPSL capital account to the Deputy Associate Director for Audit as they are created, on an annual basis. Or, the operator could sign an agreement to maintain the records for 6 years after cessation of operations and provide them for audit as needed. Then the operator would keep the records until notified by MMS that they are no longer needed. The MMS already has signed such agreements with a majority of the current NPSL operators. The proposed rule would require the operator to provide MMS all NPSL capital account records the operator now holds that are older than 6 years_unless the operator agrees, in writing, to maintain them and furnish them to MMS on request. Also, ยง220.031(c) would be changed to clarify NPSL reporting and payment requirements. Lastly, the existing ยง220.033 would be removed and ยง220.034 revised and redesignated as a new ยง220.033. (c) Public Comment The MMS's policy is to give the public a chance to take part in the rulemaking process whenever possible. So, you may send written comments or suggestions about this notice to the location shown in the ADDRESSES section of this preamble. Comments must be received by the date identified in the DATES section of this preamble. V.
