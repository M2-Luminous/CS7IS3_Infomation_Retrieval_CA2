These include Jewish commandos who disappear for hours during these exercises and conduct surveys by going to Pakistan's nuclear center in Kahuta. It is surprising how these Jewish commandos manage to enter Kahuta where even a bird is not allowed to fly over. No one is there to stop them. This makes us suspect that the government has decided to roll back its nuclear program and is not worried about it now. Mr. Nawaz Sharif as the opposition leader should also raise his voice against these mysterious activities of the U.S. commandos. However, he is silent. The nation would not have learned about it if Qazi Hussain Ahmed, the newly elected leader of Jamat-i Islami, had not revealed this information.
