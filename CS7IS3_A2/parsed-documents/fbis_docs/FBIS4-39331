Large surface ships with powerful arms enabling them to perform a broad range of tasks have ended up the most vulnerable and, as is the case in any war, the most tempting "targets," albeit only financial. At one time there were not even the funds to finish construction of the last in a series of four ships -- the nuclear-powered missile cruiser Petr Velikiy. The hull of the fifth ship in this class was cut to "ribbons" shortly before the scheduled commissioning of the Petr Velikiy. Thus, the ship bearing the name of the founder of the regular Russian Navy has turned out to be the last cruiser that the Navy hopes to receive in the coming years. Instead of taking to the seas back in 1991 the Petr Velikiy was "frozen" in the waters of the Neva until last spring. Then in April 1993 First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin personally took charge of the allocation of funds for the cruiser's completion. Certain representatives of Russia's business class also displayed commercial patriotic sentiments. Thus, the leadership of "Inkombank" expressed the desire to donate 10 million rubles to the ship's construction -- free of charge -- reviving the traditions of Russian patronage and sponsorship of science and the state's defense programs. Just over a year later, last May, the State Duma Committee for Defense took charge of the Petr Velikiy's completion. At working level -- according to the Russian Defense Ministry Press and Information Directorate -- the work is being monitored, in light of the extremely limited military budget, by the Defense Ministry leadership, the Navy command, Viktor Glukhikh, chairman of the Russian Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry, and other officials who have been aboard the ship. What is the significance of the ship, completion of whose construction the Russian Defense Ministry describes as the priority in shipbuilding in recent years? Conceived in the late sixties, the nuclear-powered missile cruiser first took concrete shape in 1980. Since then the state maritime interests of first the Soviet Union and then Russia have gained a major defensive tool -- with unlimited range, autonomy, and highly powerful armaments. But Russian construction schedule overruns are unknown to foreign navies, and the United States now regards its Navy as the only one to hold sway in the oceans of the world. The Petr Velikiy is necessary today in order to talk to them on an equal footing and in order to ensure that Russia's shipbuilding industry does not break up once and for all. For three years now KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has been keeping a careful eye on the fate of the cruiser, on which the "Baltiyskiy Zavod" Joint-Stock Company, under the direction of chief construction worker Gennadiy Starshinov, is completing the installation of equipment and arms. Regrettably, we did not in the past succeed in inducing our rich fellow citizens to provide material assistance in the completion of the Varyag, although the poor were willing to give their last cent to produce the Navy's last aircraft carrier. But international relations intervened then and the Varyag ended up outside Russia. The Petr Velikiy is within Russia's borders and the schedule for the completion of the work on it has stabilized, although the pace of the work is slower than what is desirable. Nevertheless, the cruiser can be expected to start mooring trials and a shakedown cruise this year and it should certainly be commissioned in time for the 300th anniversary of the Russian Navy. However, it would still be in order for entrepreneurs to help with its completion. This tradition -- patronage of new ships -- is worthy of revival, just as a powerful ocean-going Russian Navy is worthy of revival.
