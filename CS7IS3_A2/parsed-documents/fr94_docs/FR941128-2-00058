FR941128-2-00058 FR941128-2-00044 In 1994, the Minneapolis Office introduced ``option'' prices for its Other Fed and city fine sort products. 4 The Minneapolis and Richmond Reserve Banks also adopted option pricing for some electronic payor bank services. The Board has determined that there is no empirical justification to support the use of option pricing for paper check products. As a result, the Minneapolis Office will eliminate its option prices for Other Fed and city fine sort products. Further analysis of the cost structure for electronic products is in progress. At this time, the Board will permit the Richmond and Minneapolis Banks to continue using the option prices adopted for electronic check products in 1994. 4 Under option pricing, depositors have a choice of paying a relatively low cash-letter fee and a relatively high per-item fee, or a relatively high cash-letter fee and a relatively low per-item fee. Payor bank service revenue is estimated to have grown approximately 16 percent in 1994 and is expected to expand at the same pace in 1995. In 1995, Reserve Banks will continue to encourage the use of basic electronic check presentment products by setting fees for those products at lower levels than fees for electronic information products. In addition, several Federal Reserve offices will be offering electronic cash-letter (ECL) deposit products, which reduce Reserve Bank processing costs by reducing the number of rejects, adjustments, and other exceptions. To encourage the use of ECL deposit products, Federal Reserve offices will offer either lower per-item fees or later deposit deadlines to depositors than they offer for deposits that are not accompanied by electronic data.
