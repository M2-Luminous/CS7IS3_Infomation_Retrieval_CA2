FR940711-2-00138 FR940711-2-00055 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34298; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;13] Self-Regulatory Organizations; The American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Filng and Order Granting Approval on an Accelerated Basis of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Trade-Day Comparison July 1, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') on May 6, 1994, the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;13) as described in Items I and II below. The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from interested persons and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule change will allow Amex to implement a program, in conjunction with the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') and the National Securities Clearing Corportion (``NSCC''), to compare all Amex equity trades on trade date. Amex will phase-in the program commencing June 30, 1994, with full implementation scheduled for June 30, 1995. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filings with the Commission, Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changes and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change Since 1988, Amex has sought to improve its clearing operations and to reduce exposure to loss through market volatility by reducing the comparison cycle in stocks and in options. The Amex has reduced the comparison times first from five business days to three business days and then to one business day after the trade date. For the past five years, the Amex, in conjunction with the NYSE, has been working with the member firm community and the NSCC to establish operational parameters, systems, and rules for shortening trade comparison time frames. In 1989, the Amex adopted Rule 719, which requires next-day comparison (``T+1'') of exchange transactions, and developed its Intra-Day Comparison (``IDC'') System, which is an electronic system designed to match trade sides and to resolve uncompared trades known as ``don't knows'' or ``DKs.'' 2 The IDC System is used by Amex for both equities and options. 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27851 (March 27, 1990), 55 FR 12759 [File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;89&hyph;05] (order approving proposed rule change). The Amex now proposes to implement, again in conjunction with NYSE and NSCC, trade-date comparison of Amex equity transactions. Trade-date comparison will be implemented in phases with a final target date of June 30, 1995. The first phase of this program is scheduled to be implemented by the end of June 1994. When the first phase has been implemented, the Amex will require all member firms to input equity trade data into the IDC System every two hours on the date of the trade rather than once daily. Input times will be 12:00 noon, 2:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. Amex member firms already are submitting option trade data into the IDC System on trade-date on an hourly basis. The IDC System will continue to be the main processor of the comparison data. The Amex will transmit the compared trades to a registered clearing agency in order to complete the process. The Amex is not proposing any written changes to its rules at this time. Amex Rule 719(a), which currently requires each transaction effected on the Amex to be compared or closed out no later than close-of-business on T+1, will remain in effect for the present time. The Amex believes that its Rule 719(c), which requires members to submit trade data as may be required by the Amex, provides it with sufficient authority to require clearing members to submit trade data in listed stocks and options for comparison by such times as Amex may prescribe. However, as the final implementation date of June 30, 1995, approaches, Amex will file any other rule changes with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act 3 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder 4 as are necessary or appropraite to implement the trade-date comparison program. As indicated above, any such Amex rule changes will be developed in conjunction with the NYSE and NSCC, and Amex will work with the NYSE and NSCC to achieve uniformity and to monitor the implementation of each phase of this program. 3 Supra, note 1. 4 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). The Amex states that it believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act 5 in general and with Section 6(b)(5) 6 in particular because it will help prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, will promote just and equitable principles of trade, and will foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities. 5 15 U.S.C. 78f (1989). 6 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition Amex believes that the proposed rule changes will impose no burden on competition.
