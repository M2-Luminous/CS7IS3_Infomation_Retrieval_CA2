It ruled that the residents be paid an additional 190 million yen in addition to the 330 million yen for past suffering ordered by the lower court, bringing the total compensation to 520 million yen. Some 600 residents near the base on the outskirts of Tokyo filed a suit demanding the Japanese Government ban flights at the base between 9 PM And 7 AM, and pay compensation for their suffering from noise both in the past and in the future. In March 1989, the Hachioji branch of the Tokyo District Court rejected the suit's demands for a ban on night flights and compensation for future annoyance but ordered the government to pay 330 million yen in compensation for past noise nuisance. Both sides appealed the ruling. The supreme court ruled in two earlier noise pollution suits in February 1993 that the U.S. Forces are using the base in accordance with the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the Japanese Government has no jurisdiction over the management of the base, rejecting a ban on the night flights and compensation for future suffering. In November last year, Japan and the United States agreed that flights and ground activities at the base between 10 PM And 6 AM should be restricted to those which are essential to the U.S. military's operations. In the same month, the Tokyo high court presented a compromise to the two sides in the present suit including a proposal that flights not be permitted between 10 PM and 7 AM. The government and the residents had talks over the court's compromise proposal but failed to reach agreement. Presiding Judge Kiyoshi Uetani said about 40 percent of the noise from air drills occurs during the night or early morning. The plaintiffs living near the base "have disturbed sleep and daily life, and suffered from damage that may include physical injury, including difficulty in hearing and ringing in the ears," he said. Uetani, however, rejected the demand for a ban on operations, saying the Japanese Government, the defendant, cannot control activities of the U.S. military forces under Japan-U.S. security arrangements. Upon handing down the ruling, Uetani asked the plaintiffs and the defendant to abandon distrust of each other and to continue negotiations. "It is hard to solve such a matter through law or a trial," he said. The Yokota base is one of the most important U.S. bases in the Asia-Pacific region. It is about 40 kilometers from Tokyo, covering about 7 million square meters. It includes the headquarters of the U.S. military in Japan and has a 3,000-meter runway.
