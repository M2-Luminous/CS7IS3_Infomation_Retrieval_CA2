While it may seem unusual, it is not the percentages of the two biggest parties, which are more or less as expected. The "unknown factor" is the percentage of the Political Spring party, which could be decisive for political developments. A top government official estimates that if Andonios Samaras' party [Political Spring] gathers a percentage in the double digits (last October it gathered almost 5 percent), it will then become a regulator in political affairs. There are three reasons for government concern over such a possibility: 1. It will become more difficult, if not impossible, to realize [Prime Minister] Andreas Papandreou's goal of jumping over to the Republic's Presidency. 2. Elections in the spring of 1995 will be inevitable, as Samaras has every reason to seek them. 23. The government will be in a very difficult position when it comes to accepting a compromise solution on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], as the reaction of a reinforced Political Spring cannot be ignored. According to the estimates of government officials, the only positive point from a possible big electoral increase for Political Spring, is that the conservative faction will finally be divided and in that way unable to seek the Presidency. "First place for PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement in the European Parliament elections] is certain," they said. These calculations by government officials are mainly based on the (hypothetical) certainty that Samaras' party will cause greater damage to New Democracy, while PASOK will be first despite the "logical and natural loss" expected by a party in power. A vote ranging from 42 to 43 percent is considered a "good result" for PASOK. [passage omitted]
