Historian and Deputy Eusebio Leal issued an appeal to act without delay against "scoundrels and speculators" according to the revolution's legal system. In a special session of the National Assembly of the People's Government (parliament) held today, Rolando Lao, parliamentary member for Plaza de la Capital Municipality, emphasized the need to adjust the taxes imposed on self-employed workers according to the income they earn. "We must not expect miracles. The deputies, government, and public administration officials are responsible for preventing the diversion of state resources to the black market," he said, adding that he endorses the gradual enforcement of measures that will affect a majority of the population. The deputies argued for and against changing the currency as an instrument to put finances on a sound basis and to control and penalize illegal enrichment. Deputy Lazaro Barredo proposed changing the currency, freezing funds, and the eventual confiscation of assets owned by citizens who cannot justify their incomes. Osvaldo Martinez, chairman of the parliament's Economic Affairs Commission, said that changing the currency can be another measure used but that it is not a solution per se. He did not link it to the policy against the so-called "currency hoarders," citizens whose wealth stems from the black market or from speculation. He said: These people converted a sizable part of their funds into assets a long time ago, so changing the currency would not be efficient. He said there are other options available without resorting to a change of currency. He reminded everyone that if you analyze savings accounts, you will see that 62 percent of the population has money deposited in the national banking system. An exchange measure can be traumatic because it would entail establishing a limit on the money that can be exchanged and freezing funds, with the subsequent negative effects on people who have not necessarily grown rich illegally. Under the Cuban economy's current situation, when no substantial short-term increase is foreseen in the production sector, the change of currency would not have a permanent effect on the black market, the economist said. President Fidel Castro also spoke about this issue. He said that changing currency is one weapon in the arsenal of measures that may be used, but it must never be exclusively aimed at the eradication of the so-called "currency-hoarders." He said that the parliament's final decision, whatever it may be, cannot allow these speculators to walk away scot-free for their illegal activity. The assembly, which is being attended by 551 deputies plus dozens of foreign guests invited to the 1 May celebrations, has only one topic: the analysis of measures to put internal finances on a sound basis.
