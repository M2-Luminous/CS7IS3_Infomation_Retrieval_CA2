The agreement was reached in a Moscow meeting between visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and his Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev. The two ministers also discussed the question of President Kim Yong-sam's planned visit to Moscow in June. Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said in Seoul that during the meeting, Minister Han asked Kozyrev to give positive assistance in case those North Korean loggers who had escaped Pyongyang-run logging yards in Siberia wish to come to South Korea. "Minister Han also stressed that escaped North Korean loggers should not be repatriated to North Korea against their will, asking Russia to see to it they remain under Russia's legal protection," Hong said. The vice minister said Minister Kozyrev made it clear that Russia will positively cooperate in having North Korean loggers lawfully go to a country or countries of their choice. They also agreed on the need to obtain cooperation from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) so as to buttress the fairness and objectivity of the way North Korean loggers will be handled. On President Kim's official visit to Russia, the two ministers in effect confirmed the time of his visit, June this year, and discussed the agenda topics of a Korea-Russia summit meeting to be held during kim's visit, Vice Minister Hong said.
