A majority of the theses expounded by Andrey Kozyrev have already been heard--during both the recent visit of the minister in the countries of Central Asia, which complicated the mutual understanding of the Kremlin and Almaty even more, and during the preelection speech of one of the leaders of Russia's Choice bloc in Murmansk. However, at that time, such rhetoric was explained by the impending elections, and the necessity to seize the "patriotic initiative" from such politicians as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. And although the results of the elections convincingly demonstrated that on the field of "patriotic initiative," there is no way at all for democratic politicians to beat Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Sergey Baburin, the minister of foreign affairs of Russia considered it necessary again to repeat his preelection program. Obviously, it is now becoming the concept of Russian foreign policy, and the ambassadors of Russia in CIS and Baltic countries will have to accept the directives of the minister for implementation. The main priority of Russian foreign policy remains as before the protection of the Russian-speaking population in the countries of the "near abroad." This is a well-considered policy, arrived at by the minister with much agonizing. A large if not an absolute part of the citizens of Russia living in the former Union republics already gave their votes to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in the elections. The energetic protection of the rights of noncitizens, in the final analysis, could lead to the introduction of the institution of dual citizenship in a number of republics, the emergence of new Russian citizens, and an increase in the voting electorate in Russia by more than a third. The minister probably expects that the position of the MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] will lead to the popularity of the bloc that is being supported by Andrey Kozyrev among these potential voters. The game on the field of "patriotic initiative" is continuing. The winner is already known. The whole Commonwealth has been declared a zone of vital interests of Russia and, as a consequence of this, a zone of potential threat for it. However, in contrast to the representatives of the military department, which sometimes comes out with poorly reasoned initiatives of a force nature, the leader of the Russian diplomats advised supporting a balance, having called extremists both those who want to introduce new tanks into the republics and those who want to withdraw the old ones. Andrey Kozyrev associated this concept of his with the possibility of military cooperation between Russia and the CIS and Baltic countries (!), which, probably, will especially touch the Baltic politicians, who have not yet forgotten the recent assurances of Boris Yeltsin at a press conference with Bill Clinton on the need to withdraw Russian troops from the Baltic countries. But as Grigoriy Yavlinskiy observed, true, in another connection, "Clinton has departed--we can change the decor." A large portrait of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in a gilded frame could occupy its own place in the new decor of Russian foreign policy. If it were not for this remarkable person, how difficult it would be for many Russian politicians to preserve the reputation of a "dove." But everyone is against a background of a moving portrait of a "dove," gushing power energy. Including Andranik Migranyan, the political scientist from the president's circle, who appeared in the pages of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA with a variety number on the subject of the Monroe Doctrine for the former Union. And Galina Sidorova, political adviser to the Russian minister of foreign affairs, who responded to the medieval ideas of Migranyan in the spirit of new political thinking of 1980's, with a selection of quotations from Andrey Kozyrev. Concerning the CIS as "the only possible form of a revived Union," and concerning "the tough, including forceful, methods of defending Russian policy." Andrey Kozyrev, under the Damocles' sword of resignation, appeared with these ideas at the Russian deputy congress, and they were perceived as a compromise with the "irreconcilable"--if only to retain the liberal minister! But now they were useful for something else--to justify the perennial dominion of the Russian MFA.... Andrey Kozyrev himself looks like a dove--and he will continue to look like one no matter what. But let us recall his famous "hilarious" speech in Strasbourg and compare it with current speeches in order to be convinced: Andrey Kozyrev at that time was not expounding a program of irreconcilable opposition, but a variant of his future program. And if the Zhirinovskiy factor made it possible for Russian diplomacy to easily change the cherished policy of equality of rights in relations with the former Soviet republics, then changes with the very same flavoring can also be predicted on other flanks: Not to let Vladimir Volfovich get into a position of power. This is the way Zhirinovskiy's regime is being formed without Zhirinovskiy. Or: If Vladimir Volfovich comes to power, he will not have to change a thing. Including the minister of foreign affairs as well.
