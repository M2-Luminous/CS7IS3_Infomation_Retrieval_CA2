The paths of the formation of federalism in Russia were reflected in the president's report which Boris Yeltsin delivered to parliament. Sergey Shakhray, minister for nationalities and regional policy, member of the Government of the Russian Federation Presidium, and deputy of the State Duma, and Emil Pain, leader of the group for nationality policy of the Presidential Council, an interview with whom we publish today, took part in the preparation of one of its sections. [Zamyatina] The treaty between Russia and Tatarstan has set "at odds" two positions on the further formation of the Federation. Is it a step forward and a renunciation of unitary approaches or is it, as Sergey Baburin declares, a weakening of the positions of the center? Your viewpoints, gentlemen? [Pain] My viewpoint is that all regions should in principle have equal rights, but they have different conditions for their realization. It is for this reason that they will to a dissimilar extent delegate authority to the center, and this means that treaty relations are in the future inevitable with all regions. In this sense I welcome the agreement with Tataria as the first swallow of such treaty relations. [Zamyatina] That is, you believe that bilateral treaties are needed with each component of the Federation? [Shakhray] There is a legal and economic possibility of the conclusion of treaties similar to that with Tataria with each component of the Russian Federation. And this is not Shakhray's opinion. This is Article 11 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, clause 3 of which says that the terms of reference shall be delineated "by this constitution and the Federal and other treaties." A government program and state approach are needed on this issue. In addition, a federal law on the principles of the delineation of terms of reference and authority is needed urgently to ensure that the bilateral treaties not look like backstage bargaining. As far as Tataria is concerned, its leadership has earned the title of "locomotive" of federal relations. Whoever is prepared to negotiate this path and to scrupulously prepare a similar treaty--certainly, the next in line. I believe that a treaty will be signed with Kaliningrad Oblast. This, again, is not just my desire, it is the position of the president and the Government of the Russian Federation. [Zamyatina] In speaking of treaty relations, you have cautiously sidestepped the problem of the Chechen Republic. Is it possible to achieve a similar agreement with Chechnya? [Shakhray] The example of Tataria has shown that neither unilateral declarations nor one-sided pressure nor rulings of the Constitutional Court work in the relations of the center and components of the Federation. Only the voluntary delegation of authority is acceptable. The treaty with Tataria formulated the sole possible procedure of the removal of the contradictions between constitutions of the republics and the Constitution of the Russian Federation. In respect to the Chechen Republic not the same text but the procedure of the treaty with Tataria is applicable, I believe. [Pain] We both believe that a million Russian citizens, inhabitants of Chechnya, are today hostages to separatist-minded politicians, have been deprived of protection on the part of the Russian Constitution, and are living under conditions of growing crime, and thousands of families have already been forced to leave their native parts. This situation is, naturally, intolerable. But there is a solution only on a strictly legal basis. Russia must strive for democratic elections in Chechnya with the participation of all ethnic, social, and political groups of society.... [Shakhray] ...opposition included. [Pain] But negotiations between the federal authorities and the authorities of Chechnya on a delineation of power are now possible and necessary also. [Shakhray] Debate here on the subject of what sovereignty and competence mean and what is eaten with them is unpromising at the start of negotiations, particularly if the political and economic situation is exacerbated. You can speak for as long as you like about who invests the "sovereignty" concept with what meaning. But each party understands by these words a sum total of practical rights: in the foreign economic sphere, in the management of state property, in budget and tax relations. But in the consciousness of a politician these concepts should be out of the frame, as it were. It is necessary for a start to negotiate on practical matters. Here we have oil industry, for example, here we have rail transport, here we have the activity of the law enforcement authorities, here we have tax rates. And when a specific agreement has been signed on each of these questions, the political component of the dispute, it transpires, and its seriousness and debatability disappear. And, as a result, it transpires that the tasks for the sake of which the concepts of sovereignty and independence were invented have already been accomplished, and it is possible to reach agreement according to other formulas. [Zamyatina] Why are attempts not being made to realize this model in relations with the Chechen Republic? [Pain] A common ideology of the approach to a resolution of this problem has yet to be formulated at the level of the Russian leadership. Attempts were made to approach it from positions of strength, as did Rutskoy, and, on the other hand, to forget about it altogether, a Bermuda triangle, in which everything "cooks" itself, as it were, having been created. But in real life the stereotyped patterns do not work, they prove unrealistic. In respect to Chechnya, therefore, I find absolutely comprehensible today merely the impermissibility of an armed solution of the problem, which would be madness. [Zamyatina] The two years of Chechnya's independence have revealed a certain threshold of readiness not only of the politicians but also of the population of the republic for a settlement of the situation. Actual steps and action are needed. What do the Russian authorities think in this connection? [Shakhray] The authorities are the president, parliament, and the government. Any minister or the leader of any department feels himself to be in an ambiguous position when on the one hand he is told: "give pensions to the population of Chechnya" or "allow the transportation of freight," and, on the other, there is, seemingly, sovereignty and independence there. By the decisions of the former Supreme Soviet the federal authorities deemed the elections in Chechnya illegal, and the regime, illegal, but have not further identified their position. And for this reason any minister, myself included, not having an official position, would in embarking upon negotiations be doing so at his own risk. [Zamyatina] But you are not "any minister," you are minister for nationalities and a member of the government presidium.... [Shakhray] I will hold consultations, I am prepared for the start of negotiations, as soon as the appropriate political decision is made. [Zamyatina] In a forecast for 1994 you, Sergey Mikhaylovich, expressed the fear that the present year could be one of interethnic conflicts. Your reasoning? [Shakhray] There are a minimum of three reasons for this. First, an unconcealed political struggle among democrats, communists, nationalists, and so forth continues at the federal level. The regions have been left to their own devices. It is easy to take advantage of this situation to raise the national banner or the problem of economic independence. The second reason is to be found in the text of the new constitution, from which at the final stage of modification many provisions that were by nature federative were ejected. This has engendered a certain tension in some republics. The treaty with Tataria provided a very big release in this connection, incidentally, showing that the center is taking the path of the country's conversion into a genuine federation. Speak with any Tatar in Moscow (and this is Russia's second biggest nation in terms of numbers), and it will be confirmed for you that this treaty is for the Tatars a grand occasion signifying that Russia's relations with their ethnic homeland have at last been normalized. The third reason for a possible exacerbation of interethnic problems lies in the fact that the Russian population could with weapon in hand be a party to interethnic conflicts. Note that thus far the conflicts have been Ossetian-Ingush, Georgian-Ossetian, Abkhaz-Georgian. But now Cossacks unhappy at the problems of the redistribution of land and the purge of personnel in the authorities of practically all national regions could, for example, be involved in them for the first time. It should be said for fairness' sake that the unconcealed supplanting of national personnel, Caucasians primarily, in various ministries and departments is taking place in Moscow also. If they are not actually being dismissed, they are, in any event, being put in a position in which they are being forced to leave of their own accord.... [Zamyatina] What paths of an alleviation of these tensions did you attempt to put into the president's report? [Shakhray] We have already spoken of one possible method in the example of Tataria, making it understood to the national republics that there will no longer be a return to voluntarism. In the report, on the other hand, we tried to explain convincingly that federation, as a form of state arrangement, protects the small peoples and nationalities from the pressure of the central and local bureaucracy. Another form of protection of the interests of the populace is the transition from debate to the realization of the concept of national and cultural autonomy. The time is coming for the abandonment of the principle of "for each nation--its own state." It is necessary to proceed along the path of recognition that Russia is the common form of state self-determination of all 15 of our national groups. [Pain] There is an objective contradiction between two types of organization of the state: national-territorial and territorial-administrative. But national-territorial formations cannot be abolished by decree. They are, meanwhile, the sole form of preservation of the national culture and demographic self-preservation of the nations. But the national republics in their present form, while ensuring the possibility of self-preservation of the titular nation, far from always create such conditions for a nontitular nation. Various forms of cultural autonomies are needed for the national minorities also. And, finally, all national processes are to a considerable extent grounded in economics. When truly market relations take shape, the differences between the national republics and other components of the Federation will be supplanted. [Zamyatina] I shall permit myself to quote the classics: "It is a pity only that neither I nor you will live in this splendid time." And I would like to bring you, my esteemed partners, back from the future to the present day--to the search for practicable solutions to the interethnic problems of the North Caucasus, for example. You, Emil Abramovich, last year received the Woodrow Wilson International Center prize for the theory of prevention of interethnic conflicts. Is it applicable on native soil? [Pain] We propose three basic principles of approach to the nationality problem. The first is the main national parity. Its essence lies not only in equality between components of the Federation and not only between people in relation to the law but also in the fact that no ethnic group on the territory of the Russian Federation has a monopoly right to resources, to institutions of power, and so forth. We put this formula of national parity into the text of the president's report. The other two principles represent instruments of realization of the first, as it were. They concern the self-organization of the nations on the basis of local government and state paternalism in respect to national groups which are particularly in need of care--the small peoples of the North, for example. [Shakhray] And I would mention that in a country in which Russians constitute 83 percent of the population, all politicians need to constantly bear in mind that the general feelings of all the other peoples of Russia depend on the general feelings of the Russian nation. [Pain] And the fate of Russians is still determined to the greatest extent by how stable society is. I say all this to spite some artificial forms of the protection of Russians of the Russian Republic type, which are being put forward frequently. [Shakhray] As far as Russians in the near abroad are concerned, Russia has legal, including international-legal, commitments to them. And the essence of my plan for the protection of Russians in the near abroad, which will evoke irritation in some people, consists of Russia being the successor of the USSR internationally, and of citizens with passports of the USSR who have not acquired the citizenship of another state, being under the jurisdiction of Russia. I believe also that the Russian Federation cannot be fenced off by economic or border barriers from the republics of the CIS. This would create an environment for the subsequent departure from there of the Russian population. And, the final point: The Russian Federation should not be embarrassed at maintaining military bases in these regions on a treaty basis. Because, as events in a number of former Union republics have shown, other ways of preserving civil peace and harmony and of preventing conflicts are insufficient. This argument could be continued, but humanism in quotation marks leads to hundreds of thousands of people dying on account of it. [Pain] I am disturbed in this argument by the fact that the talk about the protection of Russians is partially reminiscent of the former Soviet campaigns--like Protection of Children Month. Whence all kinds of backing and forthing. [Shakhray] It has reached the point in the State Duma of a vote on the formation of a committee for the protection of Russians in Russia. Imagine, this proposal had the support of 140 deputies. [Zamyatina] And how do you see the protection of the rights of Russians in the near abroad? [Pain] As I have already said, the need for such protection is frequently being discussed today in the spirit of the former Soviet campaigns. Much in the way of posturing, distortion, and insincerity. After all, no less urgent than the protection of rights for the Russian diaspora is the task of self-organization. More than three-fourths of the Russian diaspora of the near abroad lives in Ukraine, in Belarus, in Kazakhstan--on land on which Russians have lived for centuries--and they have no desire to leave their native parts. For this reason the strategic line of Russia's policy should be promotion of the full-fledged inclusion of the Russian diaspora in the life of the new independent states. In some cases such integration is possible in the form of cultural autonomy, in others, administrative autonomy, like the Crimean Republic, but support for the idea of the reunification of the lands with Russia is absolutely impermissible. Under the present conditions such demands could result merely in most acute conflicts, and the first casualties of these are, as experience shows, the national minorities. Another important principle of Russia's policy in relation to the near abroad should be an extra-ethnic approach to the defense of human rights. Democratic Russia is simply duty bound by its international status to prevent the infringement of the rights both of the Russian diaspora and of all other ethnic minorities. As the state which is the successor of the Soviet Union, it must display a readiness (for certain transitional period) to accept on its territory any citizen of the USSR, regardless of his nationality. And, finally, the basis of a civilized policy is always the principle of equivalence and parity. If Russia is seeking an improvement in the conditions of the cultural life of Russians in the near abroad, it should itself do the same for the minorities residing on its territory. In Ukraine, for example, there are dozens of functioning Russian theaters, but in Russia, in which Ukrainians constitute the third group in terms of size, there is not a single Ukrainian theater. If Russia is seeking the right of dual citizenship for Russians in Kazakhstan, it is obliged to grant the almost 1 million Kazakhs on its territory a similar right. It is useful to imagine here a situation in which citizens of another state constitute the majority in certain areas on the border with Kazakhstan. [Zamyatina] How is your idea of Russians' adaptation to the conditions of the new independent states to be combined with the fact that they are simply being squeezed out of there? [Pain] There are two sides to this coin. There is a situation in which representatives of the Russian diaspora are not being admitted to citizenship, and there are regions where they themselves are still choosing and thinking, so to speak. The choice is frequently complicated by the idea of restoration of the Soviet Union. Many problems could be resolved were it possible within the framework of the CIS to agree on cooperation on assurance of the rights of the national minorities and to remove the restrictions on freedom of the residence and movement of people which ensue today from the difference in their citizenship. [Shakhray] I agree that it is essential that the Russians in the near abroad display greater assertiveness for self-organization. But in the regions where there are political and psychological barriers to such adaptation we should determine what is meant by protection of the Russian-speaking population. It is here that the possibilities need to be differentiated. As far as the Baltic is concerned, chiefly economic forms of pressure and appeals to international standards are applicable there. In Central Asia other solutions are needed. On the whole, however, a systemic approach to this problem is needed. Summing up our discussion, I would like to mention that federalism is for Russia the sole way to preserve the territorial integrity of the state. The dilemma here is perfectly straightforward: Either the disintegration of the country or genuine federalism. There is no other way. [Zamyatina] The final question, Sergey Mikhaylovich. How adequately are the ideas for a strengthening of federalism in Russia proposed by you and your Party of Russian Unity and Accord being received by the president and the government? Do you entertain hopes of these ideas being practicable? [Shakhray] I will say this: There has been progress. Neither the president nor the prime minister are any longer rejecting these problems as incomprehensible, they recognize increasingly that real control of the economy and the territories is possible only on the principles of federalism. The problem is that a lack of translation of conceptual ideas into the language of laws and practical organizational forms in respect to delineation of authority is perceived as yet. The leaders of the regions, seeking independence, are demanding of the center, as before, the solution of, say, questions of housing and municipal services in their republics, krays, and oblasts. They forget that the powers of the components of the Russian Federation should be exactly as many as may be realized at the regional level without disruption of the unity of the Russian state and its constitutional principles.
