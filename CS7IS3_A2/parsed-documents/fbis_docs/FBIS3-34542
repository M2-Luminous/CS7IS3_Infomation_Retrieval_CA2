Apparently 50 Turkish jets participated in the operation, which resulted in civilian casualties in Iraqi Kurdistan. Turkey's Kurdish Workers' Part [PKK] has denied that even one of its members was killed. Meanwhile, the Turkish military did not spare Iranian civilians and killed and wounded 28 people in the two villages in Sardasht. The two villages of Tuzhaleh and Nukan in (Qasemrash) area were hit by missiles. This situation cannot be assessed without taking into consideration Turkey's plans for the future of Iraqi Kurdistan. In Europe, and specifically in Britain and France, steps have been taken to dismember Iraqi Kurdistan and to form a Kurdish state. The United States conditionally approves of this. America's condition is that this process not benefit Iraq and Iran and benefit Turkey. The Turkish Government is pursuing a vague stance of double standards. On the one hand, by accepting the continued presence of U.S., British, and French forces on its territory, it paves the way for the formation of a Kurdish government while on the other it knows that because it has the largest Kurdish population in the area it will be the one mostly harmed by the formation of this government. Recently, Turkey signed a border security agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran with the intention of crushing the PKK. If the concern felt by the Ankara Government over PKK activities inside Turkey is removed, it will give in to the objectives of the Western governments in this region more easily. Therefore, the insistence by the officials in Ankara for signing a border agreement with Iran has nothing to do with their goodwill, and once the threat of the PKK against Turkey is removed, the Kurdish counterrevolutionaries' pressures on Iran is expected to increase. At any rate, the Turkish air raid on Iranian territory should not be considered an ordinary act. The Turkish Government wants to first send a committee to the bombed region to study the situation and then to make a statement. Ankara cannot simply close the issue by merely expressing its apologies. The casualties that the Iranian border residents have suffered is high. If this is the outcome of the two countries' border cooperation, then the entire principle of the issue should be doubted. There should be security either for both governments or none in the Iranian and Turkish Kurdish-inhabited areas. Some time ago, Talabani's forces in coordination with the European governments started to crush the Muslim Kurds in Iraq. This was an attempt to form a secular government in Kurdistan. One can see the role played by Turkey's security forces in this incident. The Turkish Government should be made to understand that any type of action by the European governments in its territory, which will lead to the dismemberment of Iraqi Kurdistan and the formation of a Kurdish government, will be to the detriment of the entire region and should be halted as soon as possible.
