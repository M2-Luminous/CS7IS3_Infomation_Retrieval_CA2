In response to a query by newsmen in New Delhi, the External Affairs Ministry spokesman said Islamabad has denied democratic rights and violated the human rights of the people of the region, which was occupied by it through aggression four decades ago. The spokesman said the recurring violence including sectarian strifes speak of the political alienation, economic deprivation, and backwardness of the people in the region.
