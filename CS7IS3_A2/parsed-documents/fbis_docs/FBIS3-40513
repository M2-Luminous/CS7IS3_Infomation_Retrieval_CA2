Although commercialization of the space development industry is actively pursued in the leading space development nations, including the United States and some European countries, the idea behind the survey is that it sees a need for Japan to more aggressively study the policies on space commercialization and the issue of how the space industries should be developed from this point on, identify the obstacles in the course of that, and then seek ways to overcome those obstacles. MITI is said to have commissioned the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies (SJAC) to investigate the above-mentioned subjects and to produce a report by March 1995 based on the results of the investigation. The market size of the Japanese space industry is only about Â¥300 billion (FY92). Moreover, the bulk of the business comes from government or public undertakings that are also much smaller in scale than those in the leading space development nations. Any space development project inherently involves a gargantuan financial need, long lead time, and R&D risks, so that it is often beyond the capabilities of private firms; there are a great many problems to be dealt with in the nurturing of the space development industry. In the spring of 1993, MITI established a private study group called Forum for the Institutionalization of Space Industry, consisting of the selected members of industry, government, and academic circles, to seek the proper direction to be taken in nurturing and developing the space industry. The reason MITI is starting a similar study for the space industry commercialization at this time is that it sees a need to respond to the shift occurring in the leading nations in connection with the end of the Cold War away from the use of space technology for national or defense interests to commercial applications. Also, while the majority of the commercial space business is already captured by overseas vendors, several international competitions are expected to take place in the coming years. MITI believes that Japan has to be prepared for such a future. The United States has already established a specific policy, which is already in effect, for commercializations in five designated areas -- namely, launch services, satellite communications, satellite remote sensing, in-orbit materials manufacturing and processes, and infrastructure for in-orbit businesses. In Europe, various space industries have also been established, and commercialization is under way in many fields, led by launch services and remote sensing. Furthermore, as a result of a severe need to earn hard currencies, Russia is offering the service of conducting in-orbit experiments on the Mir space station and Foton recovery capsule, while China has established a commercialization office to promote its launch services. The above-mentioned survey on commercialization will investigate and study such items as: (1) trends in space commercialization policies, their problems, and the industry's responses in each developed nation; (2) how a commercialization policy is to be established and how the industry should be structured in Japan -- specifically, a policy transferring government-owned technologies to the private sector, risk reduction measures to be taken by private firms, determination of which space technologies should be transferred, etc.; (3) various tasks and problems that will be encountered in the promotion of commercialization, and proper solutions to them.
