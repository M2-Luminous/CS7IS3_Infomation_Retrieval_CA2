As the long-overdue state budget for fiscal 1994 was finally approved by the Diet earlier in the day, the ministry started work on setting the ceiling for next year's budget requests from government ministries, agencies and related sectors. The ceiling is likely to be announced sometime in July, the sources said. They said the ministry expects the government's fiscal position to remain tight next fiscal year, starting April 1, 1995, as revenues from corporate taxes are likely to decline amid the continued recession. The balance of government bonds, expected to top 200 trillion yen at the end of next March, will also keep the ministry tight-fisted, they added. They said the ministry plans to set a 10 percent cut in general operating spending earmarked for policy objectives from the budget ceiling for the current fiscal year. It will be the 12th straight annual cut in the general operating outlays minus expenses such as personnel expenses, investment expenditures and spending for Official Development Assistance (ODA). In addition, the ministry plans to curb government subsidies and review allocations of public-works investment to avoid criticism that it has become inflexible in budget appropriations. Aside from the budget ceiling, the ministry wants to circulate a request in government ministries and agencies to cut in principle office expenses by around 10 percent each, the sources said. In allocating public-works investment, the ministry will put emphasis on construction projects for housing, sewage and public parks. But spending on projects for industrial infrastructure will be tightened, they added. The ministry wants to curb growth in expenditure on public-works investment itself, but has not decided on the matter because of opinions that such spending should be increased to stimulate the economy. In fiscal 1994, the budgetary ceiling on public-works investment was increased by 5 percent from the previous year. The ministry, meanwhile, plans to set separate-account spending on agricultural projects in fiscal 1995, as Japan partially lifted a rice import ban in line with the agreement in December 1993 of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the sources said.
