FBIS4-68678 "jpusr053___94026" FBIS-USR-94-053 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 8 April 1994 RUSSIA REGIONAL AFFAIRS Tyumen Oblast Duma Holds Plenary Session Tyumen Oblast Duma Holds Plenary Session Work of Duma Detailed 944F0688B Tyumen TYUMENSKAYA PRAVDA in Russian 8 Apr 94 p 1 944F0688B Tyumen TYUMENSKAYA PRAVDA Russian CSO [Article by Vitaliy Snisarenko: "Potential of the Duma Is High; The Paramount Question: `How To Realize It?'"] [Text] As we have already reported, the first plenary meeting of the representative body of state power in Tyumen Oblast was held, and the deputies chose to call themselves the "oblast duma" (only 5 of the 17 deputies voted for the name "legislative assembly"). I believe that the motivation of Deputy V. Yudin regarding unity of the Russian land was well argumented: There is a state duma in the capital of the Russian Federation, so then why should every oblast or kray think up its own specific name?! I also believe that Tyumen residents who are southerners should not react painfully to the election of northerners as the duma chairman and his deputy--N. Baryshnikov and V. Tretyakov. They are not northerners above all, but rather they are Tyumen residents first and foremost. In their very first brief speeches, both spoke primarily about unity of the oblast and about those pressing problems which the oblast duma is capable of solving only by being united. The speech "on results of work," presented by the head of administration of Tyumen Oblast was also in the same vein. Specifically, L. Roketskiy synonymously emphasized that he sees the new duma as the main body of state power in the oblast, and that it is necessary to speak not so much about the natural and necessary separation of powers as about the parity of responsibility for the fate of the oblast's present and future. "You have been elected from the entire territory, and this in itself is a guarantee of its unity. Let us serve Tyumen Oblast together!", said the governor. We should mention also the farewell speech of the ex-speaker of our former soviet, V. Ulyanov, in which he noted most correctly that Tyumen Oblast was that region of Russia where, fortunately, the transfer of power from the "old" soviets to the new duma took place painlessly and in a civilized manner. And now allow me to express certain strictly matter-of-fact and specific notions about what I expect from our duma and... what can be expected of it. At the same time, returning to the headline of the present material, I will emphasize once again that I believe the domestic potential of our oblast parliament to be really high. And it is not at all frightening that we see there a rather multi-layered "administrative stratification." Just as strong is another stratification--"first hand" economic managers, and next to them are teachers and doctors (I only regret once again that no representatives of higher education were elected to the duma). Yes! One could sense that at its first session, some of the regional heads in the duma "looked askance" in the direction of their chief to whom they were directly subordinate. But I will also say that L. Roketskiy himself immediately and in rather strict form put a stop to their efforts at "consulting" and "sharing opinions." Yes! One could sense that the economic managers who had won their relative independence tried already at the first meeting to stage a cavalry charge against the executive power. That happened too... But I believe--and hope!--that this is merely the price of development and growth. Our duma members must realize the main thing: They must not follow the lead of the executive power in trying to patch up the holes in our badly torn coat. Rather, they must think about how to sew a new strong one which will last a long time--that is their task! And this task is not an easy one. It is tremendously difficult. Especially since very little time has been left for it--some year-and-a-half or two. And if the "first convocation" of the duma proves unable to cope with the main task of waging a mental attack on the slogan, "For our bright future!", then it will not be able to break the ground for those who come to replace it in 1996, when we--well, we simply must!--will have to not simply follow the path of reform, but will finally have to see its positive results. A colossal weight of responsibility is being placed today on the "full-time" leaders of the duma, N. Baryshnikov and V. Tretyakov. We do not envy them. God forbid that they become regular stately bureaucrats of a new model! It is they who will determine today how strongly and effectively the work regimen of duma activity will be organized, and I stress this last word. It is they who must reorganize the technical apparatus which we have inherited from yesterday's soviet into a highly productive instrument for the realization of the thoughts and ideas of the deputies, or more precisely, the members of the new duma. I am not speaking now of trifles, such as when at the first meeting "every and all" were crowded, perspiring, into a little hall, where it was difficult to hear some of the speeches because there were not enough microphones. We are speaking of something else. What we need are not blind executors, but a system of analysts which most fruitfully organizes and realizes the ideas and thoughts of the duma members. I may even be so bold as to equate these two forces--the duma itself and its new apparatus. If this does not happen, then the duma will spin its wheels in place... It is enough to give at least a cursory review of the plan for the duma's standard-setting activity: Here we have that very same draft of the Tyumen Oblast Charter and its Administrative Code, other codes--land and water and statutes on the national settlement and local self-government. We cannot list them all, but these questions may be resolved only in a creative manner, and with a scrupulously pragmatic and rational approach. After all, that same "administrator" V. Bugayev was correct in his "farewell" criticism of V. Ulyanov, when he cited the latter's lack of preparation in regard to the totally unclear mechanism for realization of the last message of the Minor Soviet addressed to the RF Federal Assembly. Let us consider this criticism as the first sign of efficiency in the work of our Tyumen Oblast Duma which has just begun.
