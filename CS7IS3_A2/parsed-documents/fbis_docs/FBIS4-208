In Luanda, this aspect was taken lightly by the United Nations, which, a few days before elections were held, hurriedly "decreed" the existence of a single armed forces and the disbanding of troops of the warring factions. This was something that only existed on paper because in practice, as everybody knew, both the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] kept the "crack units" of their respective military forces in place, as a precaution for what could come afterward. What did "come" afterward was an armed conflict of consequences even more serious than the previous ones, with FAPLA [People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola] and FALA [Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola] emerging on the ground better equipped than ever before. It was a new and bloody civil war that shattered, as if it were a soap bubble, the fragile and theoretical "intention" of a single national army that Unavem [UN Angola Verification Mission] decided to bring about at full steam. Thus, before one debates the reasons that one or the other of the contenders on the Atlantic coast gave to resume the mutual slaughter, we will have to attribute to the UN's criminal precipitation and hasty "washing of hands" the main responsibility for the bloodbath that continues in a country once again deprived of a future of progress and peace. Meanwhile, in Mozambique, the United States, the Unomoz [UN Operations in Mozambique], and the government are together traveling down a "path of disaster," similar in all aspects to the one traveled in Angola. Taking advantage of its status as the only superpower, Washington insists that elections ought to be held in October, alleging lack of "patience" and resources to finance the process, while shrugging its shoulders about the possibility of pushing Mozambicans to a pre-electoral abyss. The United Nations is servilely attuned to that rationale, closing its eyes both to the facts and the government's sabotage of the process, while keeping itself busy arranging and rearranging timetables -- in fact manipulating the lives of millions of Mozambicans as if they were mere pawns in a chess game. The government is sticking to the "scheduled delay" in confining its forces, hindering the emergence of the FADM [Mozambique Defense Armed Forces], and giving strong indications that it is forming a "stand-by army" that would be on hand in case of an electoral defeat. This very serious violation of the AGP [General Peace Accord] and this true blow to the prospects of future peace and democracy is still being taken lightly by Unomoz, which, right now, might have visualized an FADM suitable for passing out parades on public holidays as sufficiently good for backward Mozambicans for the sake of the sacrosanct adherence to timetables. The rest can be neglected -- the prospects of the loss of a few more thousands of lives and the continued existence of various armies in tandem with a national army that is still on the drawing board. What matters is to adhere to the dogma originating from the "U.S. boss," as inspired on its "promising" Somalia adventure. which was like a bull in a china shop. Aware of Frelimo's [Mozambique Liberation Front] methods and "tricks," we know too well the government's hidden intentions in delaying the confinement of its troops: to secure the practical neutralization of Renamo Defense Force's soldiers while keeping in place its army's "elite" units. Afterward, it would be just a matter of using any violation of the AGP as a pretext to annihilate what is left of Renamo, and then return to the good old days of a single party to which half a dozen of smaller tamed political groupings would lend a "democratic" and "pluralist" facade. This frightening return to the past is, however, something which we will oppose with all the means at our disposal, regardless of where the pressure may come from.
