"We believe that the most efficient means to achieve this goal is to link up the lifting of sanctions against Serbia with an understanding between Belgrade and the Kosovo legitimate leaders on a status of that territory," he noted. Kosovo, the diplomat stressed, is a component part of the Yugoslav crisis, harbouring a real danger of a new eruption of the conflict. A solution of the problem of ethnic Albanians making up 90 per cent of that territory's population and experiencing pressure from Serbs, is a must to achieve a lasting and final peace on the Balkans. Albania is situated next the the conflict zone, Cici continued. Therefore, it is interested in establishing peace and stability in the region as soon as possible. Efforts of Albanian diplomacy are aimed at this goal. Mindful of this, we welcome any initiative or action, no matter wherefrom it comes. The only condition is that these actions should stop war, establish a lasting and stable peace and lead to a just political settlement of the crisis. Albania has always offered assistance and sincere cooperation to international organisations and states who have friends, influence and interests on the Balkans and who will assume an unbiased obligation for a just settlement of the conflict and prevention of its proliferation. Their role and responsibility in this respect are invaluable. Russian diplomacy has peculiar features and advantages permitting it to play an important role in the Balkan region, the Albanian ambassador stressed.
