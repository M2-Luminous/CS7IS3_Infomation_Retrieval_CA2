This new transmitter will allow optimum signal quality on 840 khz and it will cover a transmitting range which is almost three times the current range. In other words, it is three times superior to the current equipment. This is the first 10-kilowatt Canadian-made transmitter installed in the country. The work was begun last week by a group of Communications Ministry engineers and technicians. In addition to the Villa Clara CMHW transmitter, a similar one is being installed for Radio Rebelde on 1180 khz. This will improve the signal of this national radio station in our territory [no specific location given].
