The outgoing prime minister announced this himself, saying that as of 11:00 today his government was ending its activity, resigning and together with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS, of which Meciar is chairman) was moving into opposition as a "shadow cabinet." At the same time, Meciar declined Kovac's formal offer that the HZDS, as the strongest political movement in parliament, establish a new cabinet. "The last meeting has taken place of a government which emerged from democratic elections as the will of the people and which today has ended its activity," Meciar said after midday at a press conference. He said that none of the government members accepted Kovac's proposal that they temporarily manage their ministry, adding that this was not a political gesture, but a question of the Constitution, since temporary management of ministries would only be possible if the government had formally handed in its resignation. Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak had formally become an HZDS member on March 12 "in protest," Meciar said. (Andrejcak used to be an independent deputy.) Meciar said all state secretaries and leaders of offices would be dismissed by March 18. "There will be one week for the other parties to propose new candidates to the president," he said. "This was a government of the founders of the state... if we did not have time to finish everything that we had planned to do in four years, that does not matter. We will ask the citizens if they want us again," the ex-prime minister for a second time announced. Meciar was ousted for the first time three years ago. "In the interest of the state, we shall try to return again," added Meciar, counting on victory for the HZDS either in early election or in regular elections, which are to be held in 1996. Meciar also expressed doubt in the opposition's willingness to hold early elections and its ability to create a majority government. "The result (of the recent events) is a change of people, and not support for a new government. It will be a minority one again, and even more than before. Congratulations," he added. Clarifying this, he said that in the 150-member parliament 56 HZDS deputies and nine deputies of its coalition partner, the Slovak National Party (SNS) would go into opposition. Furthermore, he said, "nobody wanted" the 14 Hungarian deputies in a government coalition. All that had united the opposition before was resistance to him, and a conflict of interests now threatened, Meciar believed. Meciar is also counting on a split in the opposition parties, above all in the strongest of them, the Democratic Left Party (SDL). He accused SDL leaders Peter Weiss and Milan Ftacnik of not respecting the agreements which had been concluded with the HZDS, keeping information from their own deputies and betraying the contents of confidential talks. He said that last year the SDL had received five offers to enter the government, and that before the vote of no-confidence the government posts had already been shared out: 11 for the HZDS, six for the SDL and one for the SNS. Meciar ruled out the possibility of the HZDS giving parliamentary support to a constitutional bill allowing early elections to be held in autumn, saying that he was prepared to press for a referendum on the "immediate" holding of early elections, on the loss of mandates for deputies who had left their parties during the electoral term, and on the evidencing of money during the privatization process. "Immediate" elections meant a date of June 24 and 25, he said. Only if a referendum was unsuccessful would he be prepared to negotiate with parties, he said. A condition for holding elections would have to be a change in the electoral system, which would prevent deputies "pouring" from one party to another. "Our conditions are as follows: To respect the will of 15 percent of citizens (who signed the petition for a referendum), to change the electoral law, to hold a referendum and then elections," he said. "The point of a referendum is to change the constitutional conditions... a referendum can step outside the constitutional framework, because it is the most democratic," Meciar said in reply to doubts concerning the acceptability of questions concerning deputies' mandates. Meciar said he saw a way out of the present political instability as lying in "anchoring" the results of the next election in parliament, perhaps introducing a presidential system, or in a move to a winner-take-all electoral system (instead of a proportional representation one) so that people had the opportunity of dismissing their deputies.
