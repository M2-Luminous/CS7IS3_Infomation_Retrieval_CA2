After the experiment the border guards decided that a stricter regime was needed in the Dagestan section. Major General Aleksandr Baranov, the deputy chief of main staff of the RF Border Troops, is certain that channels of illegal crossings of people and cargo over the Azeri border with Iran and Turkey exist. Just in those 4 days when the border checks were made more carefully, 57 violators from Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Pakistan were detained attempting to penetrate illegally into the Russian Federation through Azerbaijan and bring in tons of smuggled goods. Border troops confiscated 44,500 bottles of alcoholic beverages. Smugglers attempted to take 200 refrigerators out of Russia. Two Russian border detachments, Nakhichevan and Lenkoran, which were withdrawn from Azerbaijan in 1992, are now stationed in the cities of Makhachkala and Derbent. All of last year the border troops busied themselves with their own accommodation. Control of the Russian-Azeri border, which runs along the Samur River, was selective. But now they are ready to begin serving full time. This OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent was told by the press service of the Russian Border Troops that stricter control shouldn't create any obstacles to border crossings by citizens of the CIS. However, contrary to the assertions, now that the status of the border is changing, the procedure for crossing into a contiguous country will be as close as it can to the regulations existing on Russia's borders with countries of the far frontier. Which means a lot of red tape. Moreover, how they intend to solve the problem of the Lezgins is unclear. At present these people, who live in Southern Dagestan and in the north of Azerbaijan, are divided by the Russian-Azeri border. Are half a million people to expect repetition of a kind of "Berlin Wall," albeit of a less severe form? When he arrived in Azerbaijan in January, Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, commander-in-chief of the RF Border Troops, tried to persuade President Aliyev to give his consent to locating Russian Border Troops along the Azeri-Iranian border and in the 11-kilometer section of the Turkish border in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. By returning to positions they occupied long ago, they could dependably protect the southern borders of Azerbaijan, and restrain the onslaught of smugglers and messengers of the international drug mafia, who have transformed Azerbaijan into a transloading point en route to Russia and back. However, Nikolayev's mission failed, and the consent was not obtained. Lieutenant General Aleksandr Bespalov, deputy commander-in-chief of the Border Troops, met with leaders of the Lezgin National Council in Derbent. LNC Chairman Nariman Ramazanov told this OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent about this meeting. Because Azerbaijan joined the CIS, the Lezgins were certain that the danger of their becoming a people divided in half by a border was past. But now the position of the border guards is such, the LNC chairman said, that they will apparently close the border soon, because its "transparency" was doing significant damage to Russian interests. "This in turn will divide the Lezgin people for all time: The governments of Azerbaijan and Russia are attempting to solve the problem without our participation," said Nariman Ramazanov. He is frightened by the growing separatist sentiments among the Lezgins. Kakhrimanov, who served as chairman of the LNC before Ramazanov, and his supporters are appealing to their people to take up arms and fight for establishment of an independent state of Lezgistan, which would include land to the north and south of the Samur River. Formerly the chief of the political directorate of the Northern Caucasian Military District, Kakhrimanov enjoys significant authority among his fellow countrymen. It became known to this OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent from one of these close associates of the retired general that large amounts of weapons were concentrated in regions adjacent to the Russian-Azeri border. If a compromise is not reached shortly in the matter of the Russian-Azeri border and the status of the region's Lezgin population, these weapons may begin to speak.
