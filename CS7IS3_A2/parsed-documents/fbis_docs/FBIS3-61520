Korableva, Institute of Natural Resource Management and Environmental Problems at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Dnepropetrovsk; UDC 574.5+502.3(282.2)] [Abstract] Comprehensive uses of the Zaporozhye reservoir accompanied by a heavy man-caused burden due to agroindustrial agglomeration increase the urgency of the task of assessing the ecosystem's capability of assimilating the ingress of contaminants and determining the level of their environmentally permissible concentrations. In particular emphasis must be placed on assessing the constantly increasing intake of heavy metals which accompany man-caused pollution due to their mutagenic, teratogenic, and toxic effects. A formula for calculating the environmentally permissible or critical concentration of the contaminating elements is derived, and the year-to-year dynamics of heavy metals in the Zaporozhye reservoir, their Clark values, and concentration in the water-soluble fraction, the year-to-year dynamics of bottom sediment contamination in the Zaporozhye reservoir with heavy metals and their Clark values, and concentration in the water-soluble fraction, and a calculation of the ecologically permissible copper concentration and assimilation capacity of the Zaporozhye reservoir ecosystem for Cu are summarized. The analytical critical Cu concentration of 9.0 ï¿½g/l is lower than the commonly accepted MPC in the fishery industry (10.0). The findings show that the Zaporozhye reservoir ecosystem is at the limit of its ability to assimilate man-caused copper contamination. Tables 3; references 35.
