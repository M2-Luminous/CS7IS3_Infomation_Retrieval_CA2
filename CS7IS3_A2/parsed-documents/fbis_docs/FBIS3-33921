Peres disclosed that Yasir 'Arafat informed him in Davos that the PLO leadership does not work toward establishing a Palestinian state, but seeks to set up a confederation with Jordan. Peres added that 'Arafat told him that Fatah and other Palestinian organizations, such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], led by Ahmad Jibril, support confederation. George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], said that this stand reiterates that the Gaza-Jericho accord constitutes, to the PLO leadership, the ceiling of the final solution to the Palestine question. The PFLP-GC categorically denied that it has informed 'Arafat of its support for confederation. Our correspondent Sana' al-Imam reports from Damascus: [Begin al-Imam recording] The PFLP-GC has denied Peres' statement in which he cited PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat [on PFLP-GC's support for confederation]. A PFLP-GC official spokesman said: What 'Arafat is saying is absolutely baseless. He added that 'Arafat has no right to speak on behalf of the PFLP-GC or any Palestinian citizen after all active factions and forces in the Palestinian arena have deprived him of his legitimacy. The PFLP-GC spokesman added that the organizational and political relationship between the front and 'Arafat has been severed since 1982 and that the PFLP-GC's position is still based on the strategy of armed struggle to liberate the Palestinian territory and restore the national and historical rights. Commenting on the issue of confederation and 'Arafat's relinquishment of establishing an independent state, PFLP Secretary General George Habash noted that this reiterates that the Gaza-Jericho accord constitutes, to 'Arafat and his team, the ceiling of the Palestinian solution. He added that the Palestinian people will not agree on setting up a confederation or federation with Jordan or any other Arab state, noting that 'Arafat's remarks mean transferring administrative rule to Jordan and aim at reassuring Israel.
