This was stated by Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] after the 20th round of talks in the Chancellor's Office on the east German economy in Bonn on Monday [28 February]. Thus, the way has been paved for the investment of tens of billions of German marks [DM]. Regarding the announcement that the French oil concern Elf Aquitaine will partly withdraw from the large Leuna refinery, Bonn insists on the fulfillment of the contract. Both the Laubag brown coal enterprise and the VEAG electricity enterprise will be taken over by a west German consortium, which, apart from the major energy suppliers, RWE [Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerk], Bayernwerk, Preussen Elektra, also includes various smaller electricity companies, and, in the case of Laubag, the RWE subsidiary Rheinbraun. Friedhelm Gieske, head of the RWE concern, said that the price for Laubag was DM2.1 billion. In the year 2000, Gieske expects a production of 50-55 million tonnes per year. The current work force of 12,000 will, however, have to shrink by another 4,000 by then. According to board member Klaus Schucht, the sale of VEAG AG will bring a cash value of DM8 billion into the Trust Agency purse. In the new laender, the VEAG intends to boost the output of the existing power plants by 4,000 megawatt (MW), while there are plans for the construction of new brown coal-fired plants with an output of 4,000 MW. In the eyes of Bayernwerk head Otto Majewski, the participation in VEAG, which has been demanded by laender such as Saxony and Brandenburg, is only a "fictitious problem." The enterprises, however, are against a participation in the capital, while Rexrodt did nor rule it out. Trust Agency board member Schucht proposed a participation by the laender in the board of supervisors or in advisory councils. Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl has urged a solution of the problem by the end of March. While the privatization of Laubag and VEAG should be concluded by the middle of the year, the future of the large Leuna refinery is still uncertain after Elf Aquitaine announced that it would reduce its two-thirds share, to which it is bound by a contract, to some 30-40 percent. The Federal Government, however, strongly insists on fulfillment of the contract. Only then could one talk about new industrial partners, Rexrodt said. He could not imagine that Elf would resign from the contract it concluded. The news conference did, however, lay bare differences of opinion between Rexrodt and Schucht. While the minister regarded the resignation of Elf from the contract only as a theoretical possibility, Schucht said that a withdrawal "would not surprise us." Schucht said that the Trust agency would claim some DM1.5 billion in damages. Schucht is obviously planning to initiate negotiations with British Petroleum to have a new investor in stock if Elf Aquitaine really were to resign from the Leuna refinery project. According to information received by SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, the Trust Agency has already sent a letter to Elf pointing out that the Berlin agency is not intending to make any further concessions to the French. "Declaration of Divorce" An insider from the Federal Government has described this document as a "declaration of divorce." Whether British Petroleum, which made an offer for the modernization of the existing refinery in Leuna even during the tender procedure, is still interested, is dubious. Originally, the new refinery was to go into operation in the middle of 1996. Elf's partner, the Thyssen Handelsunion AG, of Duesseldorf, will stick to the contract, but, according to press reports, will not not increase its stake for the time being.
