FR940610-2-00037 FR940610-2-00031 Proposed Decision and Order of the Department of Energy Implementation of Special Refund Procedures Name of Firm: Mt. Airy Refining Company. Date of Filing: February 3, 1994. Case Number: LEF&hyph;0121. Dated: June 3, 1994. On February 3, 1994, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy filed a Petition requesting that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement Subpart V special refund proceedings for crude oil overcharge funds. Under DOE procedural regulations, special refund proceedings may be implemented to refund monies to persons injured by violations of DOE petroleum price and allocation regulations, provided DOE is unable to readily identify such persons or ascertain the refund amount each person should receive. 10 CFR 205.280. We have considered ERA's request to formulate refund procedures for the disbursement of $2,226,782.70 remitted by Mt. Airy Refining Company (Mt. Airy) and its former shareholders, William P. Boswell, W. Luke Boswell, Lindsay B. McLean, David P. Boswell, P. Wilson Boswell II and Ellen W. Boswell, in connection with a Consent Order Mt. Airy and its former shareholders entered into with DOE and have determined that such procedures are appropriate. The Mt. Airy Consent Order funds were remitted to DOE to remedy the firm's alleged violation of the Mandatory Petroleum Allocation Regulations published at 10 CFR part 211 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedures and Sanctions Regulations set forth at 10 CFR part 205. These funds are being held in an escrow account established with the United States Treasury pending a determination of their proper distribution. This Decision sets forth OHA's tentative plan to distribute those funds. The specific application requirements appear in Section III of this Decision. Because these procedures are set forth in proposed form, refund applications should not be filed at this time. Comments are solicited.
