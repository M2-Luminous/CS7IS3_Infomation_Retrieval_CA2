[Butrus-Ghali] We have received a request from NATO in Brussels to study what could be done in Srebrenica and Tuzla. But the situation is more complicated than it appears. We have already had two preparatory meetings and we hope to have a blueprint very soon, in the next few days. [Mather] Why is all this taking so long? You have been considering military action for months. [Butrus-Ghali] It is a completely new situation. Until now we have been involved with protection. NATO also wants the rotation of troops in Srebrenica -- the replacement of the Canadian battalion by Dutch troops -- to be carried out. This is an operation of a different nature. There is also the question of the chain of command. Today, for instance, I had a long telephone call from Cairo saying the impression there is that NATO is ready to use air strikes, but that I want to prevent it from doing so. What can we do when we are dealing with disinformation? The chain of command is for the military command on the ground to ask for air support. But I cannot take a decision by myself. I am not on the ground in Bosnia. And during the past two months I have not received any demand for air strikes. [Mather] What about the position of the individual governments that would carry out the attacks? [Butrus-Ghali] That is another aspect. Today I received a note from the Russian federation saying: "We want to remind you that you cannot take any decision before consulting the Security Council." So even after I have received a request for air strikes and supposing that I am in favour, I have to consult the Security Council, according to one of its permanent members. This has added a new echelon to the chain of command. [Mather] At the recent NATO summit in Brussels President Mitterrand made it clear that he wants force to be used. [Butrus-Ghali] Let us be perfectly clear. Supposing that I have overcome all the obstacles and I send a message to NATO saying "Use force," I have no way to compel NATO governments to use force. They are free to do so or not. Who will decide within NATO? The member states. [Mather] You have proposed that UN member governments should allocate troops permanently to the UN. [Butrus-Ghali] Yes. We have received a positive response from many countries, from France and from the Scandinavian countries. We are proceeding and working very hard on it. But then you have the financial element. If you want to send 50,000 troops to somewhere in Asia or Africa it will cost you a few billion dollars. Who will pay? We have a financial crisis in the United Nations. [Mather] Is the crisis anywhere near an end? [Butrus-Ghali] No. [Mather] Have governments offered any financial help? [Butrus-Ghali] No. As a result of economic crises and "donor fatigue" member states are less ready to contribute financially to the peacekeeping operations. The chief problem from my point of view is one of education. The same member states that were prepared to spend $100 billion every day to sustain the Cold War are not willing to spend $100 billion or $200 billion to sustain the UN system. That is a contradiction. [Mather] Are the UN's peacekeeping efforts actually being impeded by the financial crisis? [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, because the member states do not pay their contributions on time. The result is that the UN is not able to pay on time the member states who contribute with contingents of troops. Some states can afford to wait one or two years before being paid. But others cannot. So they may withdraw their troops. I have received complaints from Tunisia, Uruguay, Jordan, Egypt and Bangladesh, to name only some of the countries which are not able to continue to provide troops because they are not being paid. This is a problem. If countries that belong to the developing world cannot participate in peacekeeping operations for financial reasons it will diminish the multinational dimension of UN forces. [Mather] Are some countries guiltier than others? [Butrus-Ghali] The United States and Russia. But out of 184 countries only ten per cent pay their contributions in January. They are supposed to pay all their contributions in the first month of the year. But they pay at the end of the year so we have to find cash for 12 months and we are not allowed to borrow from banks. [Mather] Can you not do more within the UN organisation itself to save money? [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, we are trying to. But the cost of peacekeeping forces has risen from $600 million to $3.6 billion. The UN used to have only a few peacekeeping operations. Today we have 23. We have also just agreed to send 1,600 observers to the South African elections. We have been asked to participate in monitoring 46 elections. All this is new. In the post-Cold War era the UN has a new credibility. Everybody is asking for assistance in the diplomatic field, in the field of security, in the field of the environment and of health and of technical assistance. All these different kinds of assistance cost money. [Mather] Do you see any possibility of changing the rules of engagement so that UN troops can play a more active military role? [Butrus-Ghali] It is not a question of changing the rules of engagement but of asking whether the member states are ready. Do they accept the need for confrontation with its military consequences? Do they accept the likely cost in human lives? There is confusion because public opinion regards the UN as an independent body. But the UN is an instrument which depends on the political will of the member states. If they have the political will to pay the military and financial price for an operation then it can be done. [Mather] Returning to Bosnia: in addition to the financial problems, there are other difficulties. The writ of the UN is not respected by the warring parties. Supplies are not getting through, UN troops are being shot at and killed. Does all this make you feel frustrated? [Butrus-Ghali] This has been the case in all UN peacekeeping operations. The UN operations in the Congo had the same problems. I don't want to underestimate the problems we have in the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia. But we have to accept that this happens when the UN is conducting its operations.
