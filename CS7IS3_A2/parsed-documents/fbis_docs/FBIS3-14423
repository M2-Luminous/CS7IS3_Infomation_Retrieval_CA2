No force was used. Hundreds of Qiryat Arba' residents yesterday tried to reach the Cave of the Patriarchs to hold the Passover seder there. The Army prevented their exit from Qiryat Arba'. There were clashes between the soldiers and the settlers, and nine of them were transferred to the Hebron police. Later in the evening it was decided to detain five of them, and they were transferred to a Jerusalem detention center. They were dispossessed of their arms. Moledet Knesset Member Ba-Gad told our correspondent that the number of detainees is 15. According to Ba-Gad, Rabbi Waldman held the seder on the road since he was not allowed access to the Cave of the Patriarchs. The residents of Bet Hadassah in Hebron told Rabbi Ba-Gad that they are not allowed to leave their place of residence. The settlers in Hebron are afraid to leave the town lest they will be forbidden to return and thus the number of settlers in Hebron will decline. Rabbi Hayim Druckman, one of the National Religious Party leaders, told our correspondent Mikha'el Tuchfeld that the security forces desecrated the holiday by erecting barbed-wire fences at the exit from Qiryat Arba', by bringing in hundreds of male and female soldiers by bus, and by carrying out other work in the area. [passage omitted] Two border policemen and three Israeli civilians were slightly injured by stones during incidents in the territories today. They were treated and released to their homes. Twenty six Arab residents were wounded by soldiers' fire in Tulkarm, Ramallah, Hebron, and Gaza.
