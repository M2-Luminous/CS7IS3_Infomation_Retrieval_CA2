The source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that these reports are absolutely baseless and unfounded. The source added that he had no information about reports that Jordanian security forces had arrested a Palestinian group armed with shoulder-mounted rockets prepared for launching in the direction of 'Arafat's aircraft as it landed in Amman civilian airport. For their part, Jordanian security sources have declined to comment on the report, which was published by a local newspaper.
