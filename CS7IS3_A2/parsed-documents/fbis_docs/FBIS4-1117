FBIS4-1117 "drafr078_e_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 WEST AFRICA Cote d'Ivoire Cabinet Warns Against Disturbing `Social Peace' Cabinet Warns Against Disturbing `Social Peace' AB2104191194 Abidjan Radio Cote d'Ivoire Chaine Nationale-Une Network in French 0700 GMT 21 Apr 94 AB2104191194 Abidjan Radio Cote d'Ivoire Chaine Nationale-Une Network French BFN [Report on cabinet meeting by Communication Minister Daniele Boni-Claverie in Abidjan on 20 April] [Text] At today's cabinet meeting the government examined the country's current situation, and expressed satisfaction with the international community's reactions to the fact that the crisis has been brought under control and properly managed. We are also pleased with the increasing interest that financiers are steadily showing toward us concerning the way Cote d'Ivoire is implementing its structural adjustment program. A number of achievements already allow us to assert that the expected economic recovery is not a vain hope, that it will become a reality in the months ahead. The government is satisfied with the regular payment of salaries, the increase in the producer prices for cash crops, the payment of students scholarships, and the payment of retirement pensions. Other achievements include the gradual repayment of national debts, support to financiers -- as I have already pointed out -- in funding development projects, and the implementation of social welfare programs. These are some of the many achiements which, in so short a period, have restored hope to our compatriots and the entire nation. The government especially wants to praise the determination and commitment of our citizens, and thanks them for their support, as the efforts demanded from each citizen can only be continued with the understanding of all, thanks to the continuing social peace. That is why the government is astonished by the ill-timed statements, calls for violence, disorder, and disturbances orchestrated by a certain portion of the media. The only thing that should prevail is national solidarity. The government wants to emphatically reassure the Ivorian people that no one will be threatened -- neither the leader of the Ivorian Popular Front nor its activists. However, since Cote d'Ivoire is a country where the rule of law prevails, nobody, whatever his political leaning or profession, can be above the law. When citizens violate the laws of the country, they have to face the consequences of their acts without trying to sow confusion among public opinion. The prosecution of Abou Drahamane Sangare, publishing manager of the newspaper LA VOIE, and Souleymane Senn, a journalist for that same paper -- even if they are influential members of a political party -- is only in line with the enforcement of the law. Cote d'Ivoire has always defended freedom of speech, as well as individual and collective freedoms, on the condition that they are exercised legally. It is in this regard that the government warns all those making appeals likely to disturb the social peace and law and order, and calls on all Ivorians to remain as calm and collected as they have always been -- which has so far been a guarantee for the harmonious development of our country. In this period of political and social instability in many African countries, Cote d'Ivoire will continue to demonstrate that disorder is not an unavoidable condition.
