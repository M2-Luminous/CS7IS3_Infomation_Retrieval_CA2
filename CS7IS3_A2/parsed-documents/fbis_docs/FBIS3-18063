During the press conference which capped his visit, Spadolini observed "there was the aim to reduce the number of parties, but the decision to leave a twenty-five percent share of seats to be elected by the proportional system will not simplify the position of parties, at least in the next parliament." Nevertheless, the Senate speaker added, the winner-take-all constituencies will increase contact between the elected and the electors and a candidate will more likely be judged by his record, experience and political clout. Turning his attention to the political kickbacks scandal in Italy, Spadolini underscored how "this painful affair has shown how Italian democracy has the strength to cleanse the errors made over past years." The moral question, he added, "...has returned to the center of the political life. I had made it the basis of my government twelve years ago. I can say now that I was long-sighted and I am sure that it will mark the political life in the coming years."
