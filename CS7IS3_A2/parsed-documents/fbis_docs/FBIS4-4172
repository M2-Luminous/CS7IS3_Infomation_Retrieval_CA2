At the meeting, on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal party committee, Gao Dezhan first expressed his welcome to the delegation. He said: We are very glad to know that Vietnam is conducting innovations to speed up the pace of economic construction. The cooperative ties between our two parties and between our two countries are developing smoothly. Now, our country is further carrying out reform in an all-around manner, opening itself to the outside world, and promoting the progress of the modernization drive. Under these circumstances, it is of extreme importance to strengthen the cooperation between the two parties and between the two countries. He introduced to the delegation the basic situation of Tianjin. According to the guidelines of the central authorities and the actual conditions of the municipality, Tianjin is further speeding up the pace of reform and construction and further expanding the scale of opening itself to all directions. Our goal is to build Tianjin into a technologically advanced industrial base; a north China commercial, trade, and monetary center; and a large international port city opening itself in all directions. The work in various spheres of Tianjin is very good. However, there are many difficulties. The municipal party committee, the municipal government, and all people of the municipality are carrying forward the spirit of waging an arduous struggle and blazing new trails and making efforts to elevate economic construction, as well the spiritual civilization, to a new height. We experienced that the key to achieving this is to improve the leadership of the party, to strengthen party building, and to promote the work in various spheres. The Vietnamese Communist Party and the personages of the enterprise circles in Vietnam are welcomed to visit Tianjin, to hold economic and trade cooperation talks with us, and to extensively establish contacts. He wished that the cooperative ties between the two parties and between the two countries would further be developed. Secretary Hong Ha said: I used to understand Tianjin from papers, periodicals, and books. This is my first visit to Tianjin. I am very glad. The Vietnamese are very fond of Tianjin's products. Some Vietnamese students and technical cadres have studied in Tianjin. The Tianjin steel tube company, which I visited today, left a deep impression on me. He said: At the time of developing the cooperative ties with the Chinese party and China, Vietnam is extremely willing to develop the cooperative ties in the economic sphere with Tianjin. Tianjin has great potential. With many enterprises and famous products, Tianjin can develop cooperation with Vietnam. He is willing to promote the cooperation between all localities in Vietnam and Tianjin. Zheng Zhiying, standing committee member and secretary general of the municipal party committee; Geng Jianhua, chairman of the municipal foreign affairs office; and Dang Nghiem Hoang, Vietnamese ambassador to China, were present at the meeting.
