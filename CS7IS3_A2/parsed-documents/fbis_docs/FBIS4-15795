Boris Pastukhov, personal representative of Russia's president and deputy foreign minister, believes that there may be a repeat of the Abkhazian tragedy unless resolute actions are taken by Russia and the United Nations. Other equally important elements should be considered in the current alignment of forces. Despite the start of the summer vacation season in Abkhazia, which has been widely advertised by the mass media, every sensible person realizes that there will be no season. And the statement that sunworshippers on the beach at Pitsunda and tour buses on the road to Lake Ritsa will be protected by riflemen is simply laughable if, of course, you forget how much blood and tragedy is behind all this. However, you cannot forget. Nor do the agreements that have been signed bring oblivion either. Whereas you can somehow understand naive working people nostalgic for the sunshine of Gagra, you cannot understand those who call themselves politicians. Country Cornered A different -- gloomy and cheerless -- picture arises behind the glossy advertising mirage. Even a cursory analysis of the situation provides convincing evidence that a fresh bloodbath is inevitable if the peacemaking process breaks down once and for all (once again, you cannot forget that the agreements on Abkhazia have been wrecked six times). Following Georgian leader Shevardnadze's recent visit to New York, where the Security Council, having given him a sympathetic hearing, effectively then refused to carry out a peacekeeping operation under its auspices in Abkhazia, the bulk of the Georgian public, primarily refugees from there, questioned the head of state's foreign policy course and his efforts to settle the conflict peacefully. There is drama behind Shevardnadze's reserved response to the new agreements. "Unless we unravel the Abkhazian knot, our country has no future," that is the opinion of Nodar Natadze, Shevardnadze's political adversary, extremely radical leader of the Georgian People's Front, and a parliamentary deputy, an opinion shared by virtually all Georgian politicians and public figures today regardless of their views. "The point is not only that Georgia has lost a considerable part of its age-old territory and living space," Givi Lominadze, former Abkhazian minister of internal affairs and now chairman of the Committee for the State of Emergency in Western Georgia, said. "If the Abkhazian problem is not settled, I have difficulty picturing a solution not only to the political but also primarily to the economic crisis. After all, the most convenient and virtually the only rail and road routes linking Georgia and Russia, routes that are crucial and vitally important, pass through Abkhazia. Everyone has now forgotten that it was the threat to these routes, a noose around Georgia's neck, that made it necessary to take emergency measures to protect them in August 1992. Separatist leaders in Abkhazia and their patrons in Russia used this as an excuse for war. Now that control of the routes has been lost we are threatened with being totally cut off." According to statistics, the average wage in Georgia is around 20 U.S. cents. Notwithstanding what are virtually world prices for essentials, barring bread. The birth rate is falling disastrously. All industry is virtually at a standstill. People spent the whole of last winter without heat and light. The crime rate is still threateningly high. And as a result in the last six months alone, according to various estimates, between 500,000 and 800,000 people, over one-third of them ethnic Georgians, moreover, have left the country. Some 99 percent of the emigres, regardless of ethnic origin, are not leaving the country on political grounds. Mafia clans are infiltrating top state spheres. According to Igor Georgadze, head of the Georgian security service, the drugs mafia has stepped up its activity of late. "We have information from which it emerges that Georgia is already one of the main transit routes for the international drugs mafia. Drugs going West via Georgia mainly come from Azerbaijan, Central Asia, and the North Caucasus. Severe pressure from local clans, which often operate via structures of authority, and, paradoxically enough, the conflict in Abkhazia, which diverts our best forces, are preventing us from effectively resisting this. Deprived of firm foundations the authorities are sometimes forced to close their eyes to the human detritus in their corridors where incompetence goes hand in hand with unscrupulousness." On the Other Side of the Inguri River The way is barred to your correspondent. However, the way is not barred to information crossing the Inguri River via informal communications channels, the press, and eyewitnesses who disagree with the Gudauta regime. The simple formula of "the Abkhazian people's great victory over the Georgian aggressor" prevails in the mass consciousness there today, acting as an ideological foundation for mass purges and the deportation of the Georgian people. However, the euphoria of victory is giving way increasingly noticeably to a sobering up process. North Caucasus "volunteers" are demanding payment -- homes, apartments, plots of land. Their demands are being bolstered by weapons. Banditry, robbery, and looting -- the accompaniments of "victory" -- are keeping pace with the exacerbating struggle for power between family and mafia structures. Winning the war and relying on powerful allies outside Abkhazia enable Vladislav Ardzinba to take a politically radical and uncompromising approach. However, his Abkhazian opponents believe that this policy is fatal for the Abkhazian people. One of them, who once held a fairly high position in the Abkhazian political establishment, told me: "He is bound to realize that this is a Pyrrhic victory but, being a charismatic leader, he is continuing to sail on the tide of events. However, in the course of the war the Abkhazians have already lost over one-third of their gene pool. A people numbering just 80,000 is threatened with physical degeneration. Moreover it is clear that Georgia will never put up with the loss of Abkhazia." In the opinion of my interlocutor, a crucial factor in the Abkhazian military success is the domestic political situation in Russia and in Georgia itself at the time the conflict started. "Were it not for Gamsakhurdia and Russia's equivocal policy, I don't know how it all would have ended," he said. Nevertheless Ardzinba still has firm support -- the enemy image in the shape of Georgia completely holds sway in the mass consciousness. However, Abkhazia's leaders, perfectly well aware of the danger they are in, are trying to take preventive security measures. This is illustrated by the escalation of military operations in Abkhazia's Svanetia at the end of March. This operation, which Abkhazian sources themselves admit was planned in advance, was allegedly aimed against Georgian subversive groups. However, it is well known that the current Abkhazian leadership is holding talks with regard to driving a six-kilometer road tunnel to directly link Abkhazia and the North Caucasus. With its commissioning Abkhazia would obtain a direct outlet to the North Caucasus bypassing Krasnodar Kray. One small point is causing problems however: This route lies through villages in the Kodorskoye Gorge where the Svanetians live and which are controlled by their people's militia. After the agreement was signed 4 April, these people communicated the following from their positions: "Are we now outlawed then? Are we, the defenders of our own homes and villages, not entitled to live in our own homeland?" -- these questions in one form or another are being asked by virtually all refugees, most of whom have taken part in the fighting and very many of whom have died. Another War? Imagine a crowd of thousands of refugees among whom amputees predominate. Shaking their arm stumps they are yelling: "We have all fought! Fought for our land! Who is not allowing us to go home?" In the opinion of these people, and you cannot help but take it into account, the agreements signed in Moscow do not resolve the problem of a peace settlement in Abkhazia. And the vaguer the prospects of such a settlement, the stronger the militarist sentiments. The most radical section of the refugees from Abkhazia has formed the Abkhazian Liberation Union. Its leader Boris Kakubava believes: "Neither the United Nations nor Russia nor the Lord are helping us. I do not know of a single case of territory being returned by means of talks. We have one option -- to get our homes back with weapons in hand." Needless to say, by no means everyone hews to such radical positions, but there is tremendous skepticism regarding the chance of resolving the problem through talks. And although the most farsighted politicians are still banking on Russia, the following view does prevail: Until the political squabbling in Russia has subsided, one should not expect salvation. Ultimately, many people think that the Abkhazian problem will be resolved as Russia wants. A great deal was done in Moscow to ensure that talks resumed between the Georgians and Abkhazians. "Some kind of progress at least" has been made thanks to Russia's efforts. Staggering progress in terms of the negotiating table. But it looks extremely shaky in the eyes of yesterday's shepherds and tea growers, unwilling war veterans, whose road home is barred today.
