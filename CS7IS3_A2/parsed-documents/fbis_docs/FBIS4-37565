Yemeni Official Says Recognition `Not Far Off' PM2006155694 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Arabic 20 Jun 94 p 2 PM2006155694 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Arabic BFN [Interview with South Yemen Presidential Council member 'Abd-al-Qawiyy Makkawi by Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given] [Excerpts] [Abu-Husayn] To begin with, will the dialogue between you and the north lead to unity again, or are there new proposed formulas? [Makkawi] Unity is not subservience and annexation by force of arms, nor is it the return of a branch to the origin, as they say. Unity is equality, justice, and parity between two regimes. Unity can only be forged amicably in order to promote love and brotherhood, not the use of arms. And that can only be achieved when intentions are sincere and trust between the parties consolidated. As for recognition of the democratic state, it will inevitably and without doubt come from all peace- and stability-loving states, and it is not far off. I have learned from consultations conducted between officials and the Security Council states that these states are currently consulting among themselves in preparation for announcing their recognition. If the other side continues to try to capture and occupy Aden by force, it is impossible for it to achieve that. The time of occupation, hegemony, and colonization has gone forever. Our people will defy death and bravely defend their land and fight the invaders to the last drop of blood. We have seen women, children, and young men carrying guns to defend their territory. It is also noted that we have named the new state the Democratic Republic of Yemen. We have not called it the Republic of South Yemen. And we have appointed a number of northerners in the government -- which means that we have not ruled out the possibility of returning to unity, but on the basis of sound democratic foundations and a new formula based on reality. [Abu-Husayn] If the fighting continues and the northern leadership backtracks on the dialogue, will you seek military assistance to rescue Aden? [Makkawi] We do not want any foreign military intervention. We want to rely on ourselves, which is why we have formed a national defense council to take charge of the state of mobilization with a view to continuing the steadfastness and the defense. [passage omitted] [Abu-Husayn] Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that a unified state could be stronger at the international level and better than partition. What is your opinion? [Makkawi] I do not think so. I disagree with the Russian president. We are not against unity. We are still for unity and not against it, but in better conditions. It was President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih who imposed partition through the war he is currently waging. Unity is not annexation. Actually the unity, which lasted formally for four years, had not been completed. For example, the currency, ports, civil aviation, and education curricula were not unified, nor were the Armed Forces merged...and above all, the war came to destroy what was left of the unity and to perpetuate secession.
