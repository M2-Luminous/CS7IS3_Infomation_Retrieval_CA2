In an interview with NEUE PRESSE (Friday [11 March] edition), which is published in Hannover, the foreign minister stated that "it is correct: There are essential points in foreign policy where we are indeed in complete agreement with the SPD." Kinkel cited European policy as an example. However, the controversy about international Bundeswehr missions is an absolutely central issue that threatens to harm Germany because of the SPD blockade, the FDP politician said. There, the SPD must "bring itself to change course." Even a clarifying ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court does not release "the SPD from its share of responsibility for finding a political solution for the necessary amendment to the Basic Law regarding Bundeswehr missions." Germany has every reason to strengthen the United Nations in terms of organization, personnel, and finances, Kinkel said. (The interview was prereleased to DPA in an editorial version).
