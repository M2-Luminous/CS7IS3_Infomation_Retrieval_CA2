This was said in the address to the heads of state and governments of Russia, Ukraine, and Romania (the members of the quadrilateral group on a peaceful settlement of conflicts in Transdniester) and to UN Secretary-General Butrus-Ghali published on Wednesday. Snegur pointed out that the socio/political situation in the Moldovan left-bank regions had significantly deteriorated. The leadership of the Transdniestrian anti-constitutional bodies continues to hamper possible settlement of this conflict regardless of the efforts to resolve the conflict by peaceful political means displayed by Moldova, the Moldovan president said. According to the Moldovan leadership, the main goal of the Transdniestrian leaders is to prevent the inhabitants of Moldova's left-bank regions from participating in the early parliamentary elections in Moldova, planned for February 27. Snegur addressed the Russian, Ukrainian, Romanian, and UN leaders with a demand to use all their authority and other means in order to influence the Tiraspol anti-constitutional bodies and to create conditions necessary for normal preparations for parliamentary elections. According to the Moldovan president, this could be a move forward toward a final settlement of the conflict in Transdniester.
