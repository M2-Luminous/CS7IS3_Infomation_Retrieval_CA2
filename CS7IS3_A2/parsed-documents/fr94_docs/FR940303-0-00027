FR940303-0-00027 FR940303-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 178 [Docket No. 91F&hyph;0023] Indirect Food Additives: Adjuvants, Production Aids, and Sanitizers AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of 2,2 ’-(1,2-ethenediyldi-4,1-phenylene)bis(benzoxazole) as an optical brightener for food-contact polymers. This action is in response to a petition filed by Eastman Chemical Co., Eastman Kodak Co. DATES: Effective on March 3, 1994; written objections and requests for a hearing by April 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written objections to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Hortense S. Macon, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;216), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;254&hyph;9500. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In a notice published in the Federal Register of February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5415), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 1B4240) had been filed by Eastman Chemical Co., Eastman Kodak Co., P.O. Box 511, Kingsport, TN 37662, proposing that the food additive regulations in §178.3297 Colorants for polymers (21 CFR 178.3297) be amended to provide for the safe use of 2,2 ’-(1,2-ethenediyldi-4,1-phenylene)bis(benzoxazole) as an optical brightener for food-contact polymers. Subsequently, after a company reorganization, Eastman Chemical Co. is no longer part of Eastman Kodak Co.; it is now referred to only as Eastman Chemical Co. FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed food additive use is safe, and that 21 CFR 178.3297 should be amended as set forth below. In accordance with §171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making the documents available for inspection. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before April 4, 1994, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered, and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
