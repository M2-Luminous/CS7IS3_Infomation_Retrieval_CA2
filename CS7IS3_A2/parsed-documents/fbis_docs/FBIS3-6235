Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the LDP's Diet Policy Affairs Committee, told a party panel of directors that Hosokawa had claimed "he repaid 100 million yen by 10 installments," but the panel never received any proof. "Hosokawa should present us with a detailed copy of at least one installment," said Ozato. He said the LDP has sought verification that Hosokawa repaid his debts to the scandal-tained Sagawa Kyubin Co. as a condition of opening deliberations of the House of Representatives budget committee. Meanwhile, Hosokawa told his coalition partners on Tuesday afternoon that he has already released all documents in connection with the Sagawa Kyubin case. The LDP has demanded that the prime minister's former secretary testify to the Diet as a sworn-in witness to verify that he did not receive a backhand political donation from Sagawa Kyubin Co. Hosokawa has indirectly acknowledged that he received 100 million yen from the firm in 1982, when he was governor of Kumamoto Prefecture. However, he has claimed that he repaid the loan, which he said was used to purchase a condominium in central Tokyo, to repair his home in Kumamoto and to fund a gubernatorial election campaign in 1983. Hosokawa served as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture for two consecutive terms from 1983 until February 1991. In the meantime, the lower house budget committee remained idle Tuesday morning due to the LDP's refusal to attend. In a related development, the governing coalition's directors of the lower house Diet affairs committee and their LDP counterparts held a three-hour meeting in the Diet in an attempt to break the deadlock and open deliberations. After the meeting, Koken Nosaka, head of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) Diet administration committee, told reporters he will ask Hosokawa to submit to the Diet proof that he did not receive a backhand political donation from Sagawa Kyubin Co. Tomiichi Murayama, head of the SDP, the largest party in the coalition, said it is not necessary for the prime minister's former secretary to testify in the Diet as a sworn-in witness. He said the Diet will be able to investigate the matter by receiving satisfactory answers from Hosokawa himself.
