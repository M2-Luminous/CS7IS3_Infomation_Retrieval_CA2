They began to undergo medical tests designed to reveal drug abusers. As Interfax learned from the Georgian leader's aides, state counsellors, chiefs of departments and ordinary members of the office had their urine tested, showed doctors their blood vessels and answered questions. All this aims to rid government institutions of drug addicts. According to an official, such examinations will be regular. On February 5th Eduard Shevardnadze signed a decree which said that "the growing trend toward drug addiction jeopardizes people's health, poses a threat to national security, and discredits government institutions." In this connection a governmental commission was formed. It is led by Deputy Premier Irakly Menagarishvili. The check-up will spread to other government institutions, above all to the Defence and Interior Ministries, some of whose members have been caught abusing or trafficking narcotics.
