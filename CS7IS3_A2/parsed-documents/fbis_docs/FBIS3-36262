Atkinson at a recent session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. According to Demurin, the British MP rather unceremoniously linked the problem of Russia's joining the Council of Europe with the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of foreign states, specifically, Baltic countries. Atkinson's "ultimatum" was regarded by some mass media organs as the putting forward by the Council of Europe of additional conditions for Russia's admittance, which are hampering and making more difficult the settlement of the problem of Russia's membership, he said. The Russian side hopes that Atkinson's statements reflect his own opinion and not the feelings that predominate in the Council of Europe. "This is the only way it should be, because the attempts to link artificially two entirely different problems are just senseless," the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed.
