The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) representative at the United States, Nasir Al-Qudwah, indicated that talks scheduled for Washington this week could collapse if the UN Security Council [UNSC] did not adopt a resolution condemning the killings and if Israel did not take steps to protect Palestinians from Jewish settlers in the occupied territories. The United States, which is in constant contact with Israel, has agreed to go further than just condemning the assault but rejected any reference to Jerusalem as an occupied territory or offering international protection for Palestinians, a PLO representative said. [passage omitted] "We believe that it is very unfortunate that the Council failed to fulfill its responsibility," said al-Qudwah, a nephew of PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat. "We reached a deadlock." Asked if the Mideast talks scheduled for this week were threatened by the failure to agree on resolution, al-Qudwah responded: "We appreciate the efforts of President Bill Clinton to save the peace process. "But to resume the talks and (for) success to be achieved, certain measures should be taken by the Security Council as the representative of the international community and by the Israeli government." The PLO required a "serious change in policy" from Israel, which should start disarming settlers, he said. Also Saturday, UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin proposing that the United Nations send observers to the occupied territories, a spokesman for the secretary general said.
