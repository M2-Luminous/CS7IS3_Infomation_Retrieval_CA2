FR940203-0-00022 FR940203-0-00009 B. Subpart G of Part 207 Chapter 19 of the NAFTA establishes a mechanism for resolving disputes between any two of the NAFTA countries with respect to antidumping and countervailing duty cases. The central feature of the mechanism is the replacement of domestic judicial review of determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports from another NAFTA country with review by binational panels. The NAFTA countries will continue to apply their own national antidumping and countervailing duty laws to goods imported from the other country. In such cases, binational panels, consisting of five panelists chosen by the countries involved in the dispute, will expeditiously review final determinations under these laws to decide whether they are consistent with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination. The NAFTA also provides for review of a panel decision by an extraordinary challenge committee (``Committee'') when the government of one of the NAFTA countries alleges that a panelist materially violated the rules of conduct, or that the panel seriously departed from a fundamental procedural rule or exceeded its powers, authority or jurisdiction. The NAFTA requires that the NAFTA countries protect sensitive business information against unlawful disclosure in both the panel review and extraordinary challenge processes. Title IV of the NAFTA Implementation Act amends U.S. law to implement chapter 19 of the NAFTA by limiting judicial review in cases involving Canadian or Mexican merchandise, establishing procedures whereby private parties may appeal for binational panel review, providing organizational structure for administering U.S. responsibilities under chapter 19 and making other conforming amendments to U.S. law. More specifically, section 402(g) of the NAFTA Implementation Act authorizes the Commission to issue regulations to implement chapter 19 of the NAFTA, including extraordinary challenge committee proceedings. These regulations are intended to implement certain administrative procedures required by chapter 19 of the Agreement involving administrative responsibilities of the Commission that continue during and after panel review. The regulations address release of business proprietary and privileged information under administrative protective order during a panel review, and sanctions for violations of the provisions of such protective orders. Since January 1, 1989, the Commission has had in effect either interim or final rules governing the Commission's administrative responsibilities under the U.S.-Canada Free-Trade Implementation Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;449 (September 28, 1988) (``CFTA Implementation Act''). See 53 FR 53248, Dec. 30, 1988 (interim); 54 FR 36295, Sept. 1, 1989 (interim); and 57 FR 34825, Aug. 6, 1992 (final). The amended interim rules issued herein, which govern the Commission's administrative responsibilities under the NAFTA Implementation Act, for the most part track the existing rules applicable under the CFTA Implementation Act. Unless otherwise noted, these rules are technical in nature, for example, replacing references to Canada with references to the NAFTA country or references to the CFTA Agreement with references to the NAFTA agreement. These amended interim rules are intended to replace the existing rules as of January 1, 1994. C. Implementation of Interim Rules Under Part 206 and Subpart G of Part 207 Commission rules to implement new legislation ordinarily are promulgated in accordance with the rule making provisions of section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. ), (``APA''), which entails the following steps: (1) Publication of a notice of proposed rule making; (2) solicitation of public comment on the proposed rules; (3) Commission review of such comments prior to developing final rules; and (4) publication of the final rules thirty days prior to their effective date. See 5 U.S.C. 553. That procedure could not be utilized in this instance because the new legislation was enacted on December 8, 1993, and became effective on January 1, 1994. Thus, it was not possible to complete the standard procedure prior to that date. The Commission thus determined to adopt interim rules that go into effect as of January 1, 1994 and will remain in effect until the Commission can adopt final rules promulgated in accordance with the usual notice, comment, and advance publication procedure. In addition to the requirement in the NAFTA Implementation Act that Commission rules be amended by the effective date of the legislation, the Commission's authority to adopt interim rules without following all steps listed in section 553 of the APA is derived from two sources: (1) Section 335 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1335) and (2) provisions of section 553 of the APA which allow an agency to dispense with various steps in the prescribed rule making procedures under certain circumstances. The Commission has determined that the statutory requirement to have rules in place by the effective date of the NAFTA constitutes appropriate circumstances to forego the steps listed in section 553 of the APA. Specifically, the Commission has determined that the requirement that amended rules take effect as of January 1, 1994 makes the notice, comment and advance publication procedure impracticable in this instance and that the amended interim rules constitute agency rules of procedure and practice for which notice of proposed rule making is not required. Further, the Commission has determined that the requirement that amended rules be in place by the enactment date of the legislation constitutes good cause to publish interim rules without providing thirty days notice prior to their effective date. The Commission has also determined that these rules do not constitute major rules for the purposes of Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193, Feb. 17, 1981), because they do not meet the criteria described in section 1(b) of the EO. Finally, the amendments, as interim rules, are not subject to the filing requirement of section 3(c)(3) of the EO. The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to these rules because they do not affect a large number of small entities, and because the rules were not required by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act or by any other law to be promulgated as a proposed rule before issuance as a final rule.
