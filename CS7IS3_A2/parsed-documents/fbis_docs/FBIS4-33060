[Begin Lugo recording] We welcome any one who wants to come and visit us to see what the national situation is like. We ask him to be objective in his observations based on the general reality of our country and not based only on the events of a specific time span, to prevent this person -- or any other visitor -- from reaching conclusions that do not reflect the truth about the real situation we are experiencing here, both domestically and abroad. [end recording] Most Mexicans are bothered by Robert Torricelli's presence. This is the same U.S. congressman who always opposed NAFTA and has even proposed even stricter and stronger border restrictions for immigrants, particularly Mexicans, to our northern neighbor's Congress. Important high-ranking officials and public leaders say Robert Torricelli is not welcome in Mexico, including former Mexican Foreign Minister Fernando Solana, a candidate for the Senate. Fidel Velasquez, secretary general of the Confederation of Mexican Workers, said there is nothing lost because of the Torricelli visit. He said he is not violating national sovereignty with his statements. This happens in Mexico, because Mexico is a very generous nation. In any case, Don Fidel still is not very pleased with the visit.
