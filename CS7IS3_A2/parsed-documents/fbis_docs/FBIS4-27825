FBIS4-27825 "dreas107_c_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 31 May 1994 North Korea Party Leader on National Conference Party Leader on National Conference SK3105105194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1029 GMT 31 May 94 SK3105105194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- Kim Yong-ho, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party, released a statement today urging the political parties of South Korea to respond to the proposal for the convocation of a national conference at an early date. He said the convocation of the conference on the occasion of August 15 this year with one year away from the 50th anniversary of the country's liberation, is the most positive and realistic measure for sidestepping the difficulties at present and opening a way out for the nation. He accused the South Korean authorities of taking a negative stand toward the proposal, alleging that it is "a peaceful offensive," and, at the same time, keeping political parties, organizations and individual figures of South Korea from responding to the convocation of the conference. The statement says: "The political parties in the North and the South, which are responsible for the destiny of the nation and the prospect of the country, are obliged to play their role in the convocation of a national conference to remove the danger of a nuclear war and achieve national reunification in the '90s with concerted efforts. "At a time when scholars, men of the press, religionists, women and even students in the North and the South want to meet with each other for reunification and are striving to realize dialogue for reunification, not caring for their personal safety, it can never be justified on all accounts that the political parties shun contacts. And it means avoiding their responsibility for the nation that they give each other a wide berth, putting too much stress on ideology and idea. "The Korean Social Democratic Party, whose main political idea is independence, sovereignty, democracy, peace and defense of human rights, urges early bilateral contacts with political parties of South Korea to discuss the convocation of a national conference, considering it is the most positive and realistic measure for overcoming the difficulties at present and opening a way out for the nation." The statement expresses the hope that contacts with political parties of South Korea will be held in Pyongyang, Seoul, Panmunjom or any other place in early June.
