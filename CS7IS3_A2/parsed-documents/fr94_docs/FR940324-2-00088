Because of its nature as a pilot project and because of the limited number of applications to be funded, introducing too many variables into this current effort would be counter-productive. The instruction regarding cultural groups is not relevant to all the identified replicant projects, as some of them are multicultural. CSAP will accept applications which propose to reproduce the identified projects in their entirety, unless advised by the replicant project that replicating all components would not be practicable within the context of the replication. CSAP legislation did not require the original replicant projects to address tobacco use prevention. However, replications will be expected to address tobacco use prevention if the replicant project addressed this issue. This initiative should increase CSAP's knowledge of the mechanics of demonstration project replication_its costs, pitfalls and probability of success_as well as increase knowledge in the general area of preventing ATOD use and abuse by high risk youth. CSAP invites applications that will provide information regarding: 1. Whether interventions and techniques that have been promising in modifying ATOD use under a given set of circumstances can be as or more promising with a change in circumstances, e.g., a different administering agency, a different geographical/demographic area, different personnel, etc. 2. How minor alterations in program objectives or implementation will affect replicability and outcomes. 3. How the general replication process may be effected and evaluated both from CSAP's standpoint and the standpoint of the organizations implementing the replications. This Announcement requires, in addition to the outcome evaluation, a process evaluation that includes an evaluation of the overall replication process as well as other areas generally addressed in a process evaluation. Program Goals and Objectives: CSAP's overriding program goal is the elimination of ATOD use among high risk youth and of the problems associated with such use that interfere with the achievement, maintenance, and restoration of optimal health at the individual, family, and community levels. As part of its mission to decrease the incidence and prevalence of ATOD use and the resulting problems, CSAP is dedicated to identifying and disseminating strategies that prevent or delay the use of alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and other drugs among youth. The identification of effective replication models will add to this knowledge. If CSAP can demonstrate that promising interventions and strategies can be replicated in diverse areas and, ultimately, among diverse populations, and if CSAP can determine the effectiveness of these promising approaches, the field of ATOD prevention will have been advanced and youth will be better served. Recommended Approach: CSAP subjected all of its High Risk Youth grantees' projects to a multi-level screening process, the criteria for which included comprehensiveness, theoretical foundation, empowerment of served populations, cultural appropriateness, strength of evaluation design, accessibility to the target population, coordination, and overall readiness for replication. The selected projects represent a spectrum of completion that includes projects now in their fourth year, as well as projects which are completed and no longer receive CSAP funding. Through this process, CSAP has identified the replicable projects listed in the matrix that follows. Abstracts for each of the identified projects have been included in the complete application kit. All of the identified grantees have been contacted and have agreed to be included in the replication effort. They have developed manuals describing their projects and containing information regarding their specific aims, target population(s), approach/methods, project management and implementation plans, project staffing and organization, staff skill levels (including job descriptions), financial resources required, participant protection plans, and an overview of their perceptions of what the necessary ingredients are to effectively replicate the project. High Risk Youth Replicant manuals are available to potential applicants through the National Clearinghouse on Alcohol and Drug Information (NCADI), 1&hyph;800&hyph;729&hyph;6686. CSAP suggests that organizations who anticipate applying to replicate any of the 12 following projects look first at the abstract(s), and then obtain and examine carefully the applicable manual(s) from NCADI. If, after scrutinizing the information prepared by potential replicants, applicants desire additional information, they may call the project they wish to replicate. Replicant organizations will participate in Technical Assistance Workshops sponsored by CSAP. These workshops are planned to take place within a 60-day period following publication of this announcement. Upon award of a Cooperative Agreement to replicate a project, a grantee may obtain further technical assistance and training from the replicant agency. Upon request of the applicant (in the application budget), provision will be made in the individual awards for projects funded to reimburse the replicant agency for such assistance. Negotiations will be conducted directly between the grantee and the replicant agency. It is strongly recommended that the applicant discuss such technical assistance with the replicant agency prior to writing the application in order to provide an accurate estimate of the required cost.
