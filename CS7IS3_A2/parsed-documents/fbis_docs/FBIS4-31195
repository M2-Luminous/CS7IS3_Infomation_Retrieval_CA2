Ladislav Pittner warns that, as a result of the bill's defeat on 3 June, irrendentism could become stronger. The Bratislava paper UJ SZO has written that the reason the bill on bilingual place-names failed was that, among the members of the Miklos Duray-led Coexistence Movement, one had voted against the bill and two abstained. Because of this, Coexistence made sure that Slovakia would not get closer to Europe and that the Hungarians and the Slovaks would further distance themselves from each other, the Bratislava paper writes.
