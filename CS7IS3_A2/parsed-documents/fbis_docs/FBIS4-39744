According to his plan, the administration's structure should have a subdivision (some 120 people in number) that would already now launch a campaign for a new president of Russia -- Boris Yeltsin. According to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's information, many "democratically" oriented former people's deputies of the Russian Federation have received an invitation to join such a service. Some of them have refused, in unprintable form.
