China has already ordered about 100,000 tons of the material from Nippon Steel Corp., NKK Corp., Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. and Kawasaki Steel Corp. for deliveries in the February-July period, compared with actual shipments of 120,000 tons a year earlier, they said. There is speculation in the industry that Chinese orders for the half year will rise to a level of 150,000 to 200,000 tons. Increased exports in the coming months are likely to bolster the Japanese steelmakers' money-losing seamless pipe manufacturing operations, the sources said. Despite booming exports of ordinary rolled steel to China, Japan's seamless pipe exports to the country have been sluggish in recent years, falling to a range of 150,000 to 200,000 tons from a peak of about 700,000 tons in the half-year period of 1985. The sources attributed the active Chinese orders to a series of oil development projects in China's inland areas and a reduction in Chinese stocks of the material. Japan, which exports more than 70 percent of its seamless steel pipe production, has been losing money on the operations due to the yen's appreciation on the foreign exchange market.
