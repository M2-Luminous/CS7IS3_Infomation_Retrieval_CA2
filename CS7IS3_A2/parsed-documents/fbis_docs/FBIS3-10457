An undetermined number of individuals were injured. According to Jorge Martinez, president of Chapare's five coca producers' federations, "some peasants" died during the clashes, a report that was denied by Interior Minister German Quiroga who said that only one police agent and two members of the official Coca Reconversion Directorate (Direco) were injured. Some 50 peasants armed with machetes, stones, and sticks clashed on 5 March with some 100 Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas (Umopar) and Direco agents who intended to eradicate coca leaf plantations which, according to authorities, were being used for drug trafficking. The peasants set various Umopar vehicles on fire, but Umopar forces repelled the attack with machine gun fire from helicopters. This is the second violent clash with peasants in the Chapare region within the past 10 days. The clashes are the result of the government's determination to destroy excess coca cultivation that is being used for manufacturing cocaine and not for the traditional and legal coca leaf consumption. The interior minister today told Radio Panamericana of La Paz that the Umopar agents' operation in Chapare on 5 March only intended to eliminate coca plantations that include maceration pits, which are used for cocaine production. Quiroga said the Bolivian Government does not intend to eliminate all excess coca leaf plantations by force, adding that police only seek to eliminate plantations that include facilities for cocaine production. According to the minister, other excess coca plantations must be eradicated voluntarily by peasants with the cooperation of local authorities and through the alternative development program. Chapare region peasants, however, accuse the government of trying to forcefully eliminate all coca leaf plantations. The Bolivian Government is committed to eradicating a certain number of coca leaf plantations annually in exchange for substantial U.S. economic assistance. Bolivia is the second largest coca leaf producer in the world, after Peru, and the second largest cocaine exporter in the world, after Colombia.
