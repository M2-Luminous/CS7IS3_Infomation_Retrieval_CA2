Brazauskas how he would today reply to the question as to what path Lithuania has chosen and what course it will continue to follow. [Brazauskas] This will be the continuation of the course that Lithuania followed last year. We are conducting reforms and trying to make well-considered moves. One must always see our weaknesses and losses. I pose very many requirements to the executive power, because state management is difficult. These issues are difficult to resolve, although some people used to think differently in the past. It does not matter what people will be in power in the future. The important thing is that the state must be run by professionals. Decisions of the executive power, their quality and rate of adoption -- this is what the authorities must care about. Recently, there has been much talk about government officials. I have become strongly convinced that we must not only speak about them but also create a basis for the adoption of government decisions. I am speaking about the activities and the quality of the executive power. I do not maintain, however, that we must replace the latter and elect a new one. I am for the stability of the government and its institutions. If one cannot perform one's duties well today but wants to learn this, he or she must receive support. I see from many facts that we are unable to do many things, but we are willing to learn. My goal is to achieve considerable improvement in this sphere in 1994. I want us to adopt the law on government officials and other indispensable acts, impart responsibility, and define the functions of ministries and departments. [passage omitted] [Svirbutaviciute] The president, as number-one person in Lithuania, is often observed as if through a magnifying glass. This observation started long before the Seimas and, particularly, the presidential elections. It has continued until now. How have you managed to reconcile this, and how do you assess the reprimands concerning the rejected draft law on the declaration of property and income of government officials and employees? [Brazauskas] By using the right of legislation, the president's office is currently drafting a new law. We intend to promulgate it. This law must correspond to the spirit of the Lithuanian Constitution. One cannot single out one group of persons, think that they are "swindlers," and prepare the law specially for them. This is not the case in the world. We are drafting it based on the experience of the world where the declaration of property is commonplace. I have always said that I will be the first to declare my property and income. I suppose that the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction in the Seimas [parliament] did not adhere to its principles in voting for this law. Such a law cannot exist. The concept of family is particularly confused there. It follows from this law that both my parents and my children, who have not lived with me for more than 15 years already and who have their own families, are accountable for my property. It is paradoxical that even minor children must declare their assets: The pants that a mother buys for her son will have to be declared. The majority of those who accuse me most blatantly for rejecting this law have never read it. For example, during my visit to Klaipeda I asked the people there whether they had read it, and the reply was negative. So why are they accusing me? All people must declare their property and income. This is not easy and cannot be achieved immediately. Let us adopt this law by stages and steps. The president, the government, and Seimas deputies must declare their income in the first place, and later be followed by others. This law is not an instrument for catching crooks. The target of such laws throughout the world is to collect taxes from citizens which they owe the state. That is why I vetoed this draft law. [passage omitted]
