The Iranian Government, which sent four delegates to supervise the national elections in South Africa, is waiting for the announcement of the results of the South African elections, in order on that basis to organize relations with the next government in Pretoria. Iran's political relations began with South Africa in 1349 [21 March 1970-20 March 1971]. In that year the governments at that time in Iran and South Africa opened consulates in Johannesburg and Tehran. Following that, economic relations between the two countries also developed to the extent that 90 percent of the Pretoria regime's oil needs were met by Iran. Several years later, with the participation of the Iran National Oil Company, construction began on the [?Natruf] refinery in South Africa. In addition to its participation in the construction of this refinery, at the outset Iran also owned 17.5 percent of its shares. The remainder of the refinery's shares were owned by the French [?Gugal] company, with 30 percent, and the South African SASOL [South African Coal, Oil and Gas Corporation] company, with 52.5 percent. In the beginning this refinery's capacity was 50,000 barrels per day, and after a time it increased to 78,000 barrels. Thus Iran's shares in the Natruf refinery in 1974 increased from 17.5 percent to 33.3 percent of the entire refinery. Based on a separate contract signed between the Iran National Oil Company and South African officials, the Iranian side was required to supply 70 percent of the oil needed by the Natruf. Based on this contract, Iran was required to deliver 25 million tons of crude oil to South Africa over a 15-year period. By the time of the triumph of the Islamic revolution, 12 million tons of crude oil had been delivered to this country. In an interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, an expert on foreign affairs discussed the fall of the apartheid regime in South Africa. He said: Since the Natruf Oil Refinery was designed based on the characteristics of Iran's oil and Iran cut off its oil exports to South Africa after the triumph of the Islamic revolution, the Natruf Refinery suffered losses that were such that several years later the Government of Iran sold its shares to the South African SASOL company to recover its losses and prevent further losses. Nevertheless, if the South African elections produce a democratic government, the Iranian Government can resume its relations with this country. These experts added: In addition, the former Iranian regime's oil cooperation with the apartheid government and South Africa made Iran the Pretoria regime's second-largest trading partner after Israel. The governments of the time in Iran and South Africa cooperated on mining matters and in the extraction of uranium. Likewise, companies affiliated with the private sector in the two countries were active importing and exporting and selling Iran's dried fruits and South Africa's industrial materials.
