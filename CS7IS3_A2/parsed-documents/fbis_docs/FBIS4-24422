Of them, 473,000 persons obtained employment through the introduction by employment service centers, 186,000 persons were placed in urban areas, and more than 70 percent of them were employed through the two-way choice between the employing units and employees. This shows that the province has basically defined the dominant position of market-oriented employment. Since the beginning of last year, labor departments at all levels in the province have further emancipated the mind, renewed ideas, and continuously expanded the employment sphere based on the characteristics of market-oriented employment, thus making the province's employment work witness a new situation of reform and development. The old employment concept that existed for scores of years has begun to be broken, and new employment ideas and modes have occupied a dominant position. Instead of squeezing in state-owned units, urban job-seekers have vied with each other in working for nonstate-owned sector of the economy, such as urban collective enterprises, foreign-invested enterprises of three types, and township and town enterprises. Along with the changes in the people's employment ideas, flexible employment forms have also begun to emerge. In the past, once a person was employed, he obtained a life-long job. And most workers were long-term fixed workers, and the form of employment was unitary. At present, the province is experiencing the coexistence of diverse and flexible employment forms, such as contract workers, temporary workers, seasonal workers, odd-job workers, and hour-based workers. The employment pattern of separating urban areas from rural areas has also been broken. Instead of mainly employing urban job-seekers, the province has begun to employ job-seekers in both urban and rural areas. According to the unified arrangement of the state, the province has conducted [words indistinct] for employment of rural people and has begun to manage in a unified manner the transfer and flow of the 10 million surplus laborers in rural areas.
