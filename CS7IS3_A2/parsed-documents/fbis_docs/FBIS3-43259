The foundation of this new strategy is community policing. The SAP will strive to make the nature of its policing in all respects community oriented. This is a report from our political editors. The police force's new strategic plan includes seven focal points: Safety of the community; legitimacy of the police; training of the police; state of mind of the police; the optimal use of resources; adjustment to the new national allocation; and management skills-leadership of the SAP's management cadres. As far as the safety of the community is concerned, the intent is to bring crime and violence to more acceptable levels and to restore a feeling of safety within the community through continuous presence, countrywide consultation forums between police and community, and optimal cooperation. To this end, all available resources will be effectively activated in consultation with the community. Official structures will be expanded to ensure consultation and community involvement. Crime prevention and solutions to deeper problems of law and order will be given greater attention. And the overall policing authority of the police will be expanded. The SAP's goal is to be an impartial, representative, and accepted community police service. Therefore they want to establish a streamlined and community friendly policing style, to promote openness, to ensure the provision of equal services to all communities and the equal treatment of all individuals, to live up to a value system based on the principles of the police behavior code as included in the national peace agreement, to enhance the language skills and cultural sensitivity of its members, to maintain a sound and easily accessible complaint procedure, to not allow itself to be politically abused, and to be made up as representatively as possible. The SAP's training must aim at being coordinated and in agreement with internationally accepted principles. This training must be geared toward competency, ability, professional and community need. In order to improve the state of mind of the police, fear and political uncertainty will be tackled through better internal communication. Better and tougher discipline will also be implemented. The selection in hiring personnel will become more strict. Training will focus on positive attitude and human rights. And each member of the SAP will have to live up to the behavior code. In order to achieve the best possible distribution and use of all available human, logistic and information resources to meet to the extent possible the policing needs of the community, a good computerized management information system will be implemented. The subjects of management courses will be adapted. The SAP will also ensure that it will be efficiently and fully included in the new national model and that its policing will function effectively and acceptably within such a new national model. To this effect a continuous restructuring and positioning of the SAP in accordance with national changes, and a review and adjustment of laws, regulations and prescriptions in accordance with these changes will be necessary. The strategy is also aimed at the professional training of all police officers so that they will have the necessary skills and abilities to ensure that they will provide an acceptable communi ty oriented service. In order to achieve this, a representative management body must be entrusted with the maintenance of standards. Skills will be developed through transitional programs. All members of the SAP, but especially management personnel, will be encouraged to better equip themselves academically. In order to create a favorable climate for the development of this strategy, the SAP has committed itself to: - Recognize the basic rights of all people; - Protect/secure the community by providing quality service; - The principle of responsibility toward the community; - Impartiality and credibility; - Provide speedy, simple and professional services; - Proactive action and maintenance of initiative; - Consultation with the community, negotiation and a participatory style of managment; $And to respect the needs of the community. This strategy was developed by the governing board of the SAP in consultation with the Police Council following a determination of the needs of the broader community. This will be available to the public for perusal at all police stations. The Police Council functions under the leadership of Mr. Johan van Vuuren, former head of ARMSCOR. A variety of groups from the broader comunity is represented in it.
