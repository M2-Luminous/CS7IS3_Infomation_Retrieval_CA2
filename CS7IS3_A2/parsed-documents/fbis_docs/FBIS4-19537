Will the solidarity surcharge be limited to three years after all, as has been suggested by the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]? [Waigel] No. In the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU], the FDP, and the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] unanimously adopted the solidarity surcharge without any limitation. Revenues of about 30 billion German marks [DM] per year are necessary for the foreseeable future because of the burdens caused by the fund for repaying debts inherited from the GDR. It would be unprincipled to say now that the solidarity surcharge can be abolished by this or that date. [Weckbach-Mara] The Federal Constitutional Court demands that the government no longer tax the subsistence level. When will you accordingly reduce taxes? And where is the money for this measure to come from? [Waigel] The current transition regulation has made the subsistence level exempt from taxes until the end of 1995 anyway. For the final regulation, which the court demands as of 1996, I have established a committee to work out proposals. Before the summer recess I will also present our tax policy concept for the next four years. This includes, among other things, improvements in the equalization of burdens for families and the continuation of the corporate tax reform. All that must be financed through savings and subsidies cutbacks. Neither tax increases nor an increase in new debts must be used for this purpose. [Weckbach-Mara] Not an increase in the inheritance tax, either? [Waigel] Most definitely not. Inheritances will not be further taxed by changing the bases for assessment. Even if the Federal Constitutional Court were to force us to change the basic values, I want to compensate that with tax-exempt amounts or by reducing the tax rates. I do not want additional taxes for the heirs. Otherwise, there would be considerable problems, in particular in medium-sized businesses, not least of all in agriculture and forestry. [Weckbach-Mara] Transportation Minister Wissmann has announced a "careful" increase in petroleum tax and is preparing road use fees. Does he really need DM8 billion more as of 1996? [Waigel] As of 1996 there is indeed a gap of DM8 billion in financing railroad reform. I leave it, as agreed, to clever traffic politicians to close this gap. [Weckbach-Mara] The FDP has made its coalition statement in favor of the CDU/CSU. Material demands are to follow. Will you accept conditions for continuing the coalition? [Waigel] The FDP can make demands as an independent party, but so can we. [Weckbach-Mara] So can we. [as published] [Waigel] We demand a correction in legal and domestic policy with the introduction of the great bugging campaign so that in the future the police will be permitted to monitor discussions of new serious crimes. We will insist on that. If the FDP is smart, it will already decide to agree to the great bugging campaign at its next party congress, in time before the elections. I also expect the FDP to vote for our candidate Roman Herzog by the third ballot of the elections for the German president at the latest. This would be a very positive signal for the coalition. In addition, the FDP would be well advised if, next week, it were to withdraw its complaint in Karlsruhe against Bundeswehr participation in NATO AWACS flights. Then the foreign minister can finally openly advocate the policy he really wants instead of continuing to sue his own government in the highest German court. [Weckbach-Mara] In your opinion, has the SPD's candidate for the chancellor's office, Scharping, been able to improve his prospects of being elected as a result of his trip to the United States? [Waigel] Certainly not, he just followed Helmut Kohl. But at least now he knows how great Helmut Kohl's reputation is in the world. On the other hand, Scharping was reproached by the U.S. Treasury because of his unbidden comments on U.S. monetary policy. [Weckbach-Mara] The CSU is in a slump. Will Edmund Stoiber remain Bavarian minister president? [Waigel] Yes. Edmund Stoiber is and remains minister president with my full support. One cannot blame the current situation on him. He has acted correctly and he is doing very well. I am sure that we will get out of the slump and return to sober discussion of real problems. [Weckbach-Mara] Will there not be a discussion about personnel in the CSU even if your party gets bad results at the European elections? [Waigel] No, not even then. [Weckbach-Mara] Do you agree to Bavaria's demand to cancel 3 October as a public holiday to finance nursing care insurance? [Waigel] There are differing ideas on this matter. Everyone knows that, for instance, the chancellor and the CDU are against that. I do not see any prospects of success for this proposal. It will not be possible to push through the cancellation of the 3 October holiday.
