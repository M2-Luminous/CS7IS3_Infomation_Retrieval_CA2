Then a folding door opens somewhere in the background of the hall, and in comes a group of tall gentlemen. With wary looks and strained movements, they shield a dynamic empty space in their midst, into which a respectful crowd, now standing, tries to stare from above: therein he--Wolfgang Schaeuble, 51--rolls toward his stage. He smiles while he vigorously propels his vehicle forward. Immediately--recently in Wolfenbuettel just as everywhere else--an emotionally charged local matador of the Union will greet him as a man "who has done his duty for our German fatherland to the limits of human capacity." Now many eyes are moist. A cool Schaeuble attentively observes the reactions. Only his right middle finger twitches rhythmically on his hands folded in front on his chin. Must he not see himself as a "hero"? That is what Wolfgang Schaeuble asks Wolfgang Schaeuble in the friendly seclusion of his parliamentary group office in Bonn. Of course not; who is he after all? The "chief" has gained enough distance to laugh at himself. On the other hand, "I do not suffer from excessive modesty either." And as though he wanted to prove that, the ambitious man from Baden suddenly mentions the name of Bismarck in his subdued comtemplation of himself and his political role. Since he cannot have meant that as he only could have meant it, he tries to touch it up: "One cannot want to be Bismarck," he says hastily. Then, for an interval of silence, the gaze of the man who is so proud of the unification that he negotiated is reflected inward. "Only afterwards are you Bismarck," he nods. It was not just a painful subject that Wolfgang Schaeuble had stumbled into but an uncomfortable one as well. After all, he would first have to become chancellor if the comparison is to make any sense. But the "crown prince" of the incumbent does not want to talk about that in the 1994 election year. He certainly knows that the "rascals" in the press and opposition are just waiting to put him up against Helmut Kohl. But that attempt does not work with Schaeuble and "for heaven's sake" it must not be successful. They should all go ahead and make fun of him as the chancellor's "paladin" or "puppet." "We have no need for debate and are not interested." Party friends believe that it is quite possible that sometime in the last year Wolfgang Schaeuble, who is always aiming for success and measurable results, has toyed with the idea of an early replacement of Helmut Kohl. In the coming series of elections, however, he will give his full support to Helmut Kohl without, of course, backing away from his own ambitions. The chief of the parliamentary group has accepted the fact that he can come to the chancellorship only through Helmut Kohl and not against him. So in the past days he has been making himself scarce in Bonn--although he finds the election losses of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] bearable in the scope of the relative situation--so that he will not have to talk about the chancellor's uncertain future. This week, however, he is all the more present: in Washington. Chancellor candidate Schaeuble is presenting himself on a goodwill tour just as Rudolf Scharping, chief of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany], will do in three weeks. A Bismarck in a wheelchair? American experts on Germany such as the historian and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, remembering their lame President Franklin D. Roosevelt, will certainly be less offended by his physical handicap than by his Bismarck-attitude. Is it not true that of late Schaeuble has been awakening a lot of memories of the clanking mixture of national braggadocio and feverish promoterism with which the Germans triumphed internationally after Bismarck founded the empire? "We Germans," "our nation," "our German fatherland," the "protective community of fate Germany," their soul, their set of values, and their code of duties--who in the last decades would have dared to be as provocative in Bonn with strong words of German nationalism as the slight man from the Black Forest? Wolfgang Schaeuble finds the charge that he has changed from a pragmatic political manager into a nationalistic ideologue "very amusing." And is he not really more of a chatty speaker than an emotional declarative orator ? "There is nothing at all martial or theatrical about me." When Schaeuble wants to use such self-descriptions to deny similarities with Franz Josef Strauss, one cannot contradict him. But not just Hans-Ulrich Klose, the chief of the parliamentary group of the SPD, knows that the SPD delegates in the Bundestag react to him downright "allergically aggressively." Wolfgang Schaeuble knows that too. And that is exactly the way he wants it. At the same time, the cool negotiation talents of the jurist Schaeuble are still undisputed even today. Even in politically explosive negotiations such as on the asylum law or nursing care insurance, compromise-manager Schaeuble is impressive through his nimbleness and competence. He relaxes the atmosphere with irony and sportsmanship and one can count on his agreements, laud social democrats and liberals. Schaeuble had long since gained a solid reputation in this area in Bonn when he was abruptly and brutally pushed into the lamplight of the broad public. First the sudden unification and then the assassination attempt turned the managing helper, who was pulling the strings for Kohl behind the scenes, into a responsible leader. Unhappily since then he has been obsessed with the idea of wanting to improve the political and atmospheric state of the lurching republic. "Politics is always a matter of balance between individual freedom and a relationship with the community," he lectures from behind his desk in Bonn, a portrait of Konrad Adenauer to his side. "The trend is now tending more toward an unraveling and splitting of the community." And as he learned in his youth in the cold-war state of the "old man," he is insisting on the melding force of enemy images. "Only in conflict does it become clear what one stands for or against." That is Wolfgang Schaeuble's conviction. Thus, for example, he stands for Berlin and adds something to that: "It is a matter of Germany." And then he waits to see who howls. That will be the enemy against whom the people must unite. Is that really the "conservative revolution" that Schaeuble's leftist party friend Warnfried Dettling sees coming as Helmut Kohl's legacy? Will this "turn back the clocks of modernity in Germany," as the sociologist Ulrich Beck fears? Is Wolfgang Schaeuble thereby initiating the downfall of the Union as a people's party? Actually the chief of the parliamentary group has entered into a "very fruitful and sensible division of labor" with the chancellor, which is happening without any need to talk a lot about it. The game is called: We against them. "Freedom instead of socialism" was the classical agitation formula, which since the disintegration of Moscow's camp does not serve so well to mobilize fears, however. So "we"--that is, as Helmut Kohl likes to say, "all Germans of goodwill"--need other emotional signals of community to be forearmed against "the others." "History," "the nation," and "the fatherland" must be reflected in suitable symbols. This may not be difficult for Helmut Kohl, the emotional stager of Verdun and Bitburg. The chancellor, who knows very well how to condense politics from the fund of this own sentimentalities into kitschy highpoints, has a rather dependable feel for the radiant energy of symbols. But Schaeuable, the cold man of the intellect who sees emotions only as an exploitable weakness of his fellow man "that must not be left to the enemy," was completely unable to pull off such productions. Even his own people are disturbed by the strange mixture of national pomposity and academic lecturing with which the chief of their group in the Bonn parliament attacks the veiling action of the artist Christo in that he stylizes the unfortunate Berlin Reichstag into the "most symbolic and significant political building in Germany." It has been clear since this speech that Wolfgang Schaeuble is incapable of establishing a following. To be sure, he manages his own parliamentary group with sharp and bitter parsimony and is always well prepared but generally curt. His associates find him rude and arrogant. Words like "rubbish" and "nonsense" are quick to come across his lips. His delegates live in the fear that "as soon as someone babbles something without thinking, it will quickly become icy." When the Union leader is nevertheless able to produce a "we" feeling--as at the party congress of the CDU in 1993, for example--it is the result of a calculated confrontation with self-produced enemies. "Nothing is worse than peace with the socialists," Union parliamentarians have quoted their chairman. Polarization is the strategy that Schaeuble himself affirms with obvious pleasure. "There must be conflict for it to be interesting." But the combative Schaeuble is also becoming dreadful for many in his environs--and not just among his adversaries. Concern and even fear are slipping into many respectful statements about the lonesome politician, who is able to defend himself so vehemently against the fate that befell him. A zone of icy thin air seems to keep people at a distance as soon as the chief of the parliamentary group comes to larger gatherings. Is that just because of the wheelchair? Is it the security zone around the especially intensively protected man that frightens people away? Certainly. But above all there is around Wolfgang Schaeuble an electrically charged atmosphere of aggressiveness and controlled rage, which can be discharged at any time in a way that can cut to the bone. Wolfgang Schaeuble knows that. "Somehow I seem to be sharp," he admits not at all troubled. On the contrary, it almost seems as though the fear that he provokes when he speaks, the powerless agitation that his gibes produce in his opponents, gives him a pleasurable sensation. The only thing that makes him angry is the charge that the wheelchair has made him hard, for which he will never forgive Jochen Vogel, the former chairman of the parliamentary group of the SPD. The fact is that the physically small but competitive and athletic Wolfgang Schaeuble charged through the political world in Bonn from the first day of his career like a taut bow. "One had to expect arrows at any moment," says an opposition politician who remembers the former parliamentary business manager of the Union. What may have been a sport then is now a vital struggle. The man whose existence has been narrowed almost completely to politics literally has no more latitude. For him it is always a matter of everything or nothing. Everyone senses that and many are frightened by it--especially since the content and maxims that are behind all of Schaeuble's actions are rather arbitrary within a vague conservative framework. "Just no mental blocks," he says. Afterwards phases of insightful contemplation and frank dealing with his own vulnerability and the wounds of others have obviously appeared to Wolfgang Schaeuble to be weaknesses that he cannot afford in the tough business of politics. When he became chief of the Federal Chancellorship in 1984, minister with a "special responsibility," he was "somehow terrified" by the burden, he says. "I no longer get frightened. I am now hardened." This is supposed to sound casual and self-ironic. But the steel core of his will to power shines through such jokes. His public speeches are weapons that he uses with provocative self-righteousness. Schaeublich always makes it clear--sometimes with tremulous pathos and sometimes with quiet pungency--that he thinks he has the whole truth. He is democracy. He is wisdom. He is Germany. Thus he increasingly turned his speeches in parliament into a series of verbal duels with the opposition and then he complained sorrowfully about the many disruptions. He makes hard statements with a soft voice. He stirs up in his listeners the feelings that he does not permit himself to have. The fact that he gets people stirred up makes Wolfgang Schaeuble dangerous. The fear of his patriotic bombast seems justified precisely because he is no devout German nationalist but at most a conventional gentleman. "He is absolutely unaware of the danger from the Right," believes one of his friends and admirers. Possibly, as he asserts, the CDU-politician really thinks that in this way he can keep in check the rightist tendencies in his own camp. Possibly he actually does want to move the Union to the right to recapture the Republikaner. In any case, he has faith in the restraining force of the will over collective desires, fears, and feelings of hatred, which would be reckless in any democracy. It is perilous in Germany. But moodmaker Wolfgang Schaeuble has no antenna for this explosiveness. If necessary, he is nonchalantly able to reinterpret his popular campaign for patriotism into a purely sportive affair. In a national match against France, does he as a constitutional patriot cheer for the Germans? So it is. Whenever Wolfgang Schaeuble is tempted to consider himself rather marvelous--and that is not so infrequent--he remembers the film with the late Don Camillo, who as a zealous earthly warrior against communism had to be told by his Lord God: "Don't take yourself so seriously." Wolfgang Schaeuble knows that that is advisable not only for reasons of humility but above all for tactical reasons, for vain appearances of a chancellor rival would be the last thing that the Union could use in its fight for the vanishing power on the Rhine. This was the only reason why Schaeuble, a celebrated hero at the Berlin party congress, gave such a plain speech in Hamburg. And he cannot say often enough that Helmut Kohl is federal chancellor and will be once again. To emphasize that, he adds: "Our good God will take care of the rest." But the strange thing is that this statement of submission sounds almost like a threat in the mouth of Schaeuble, whose life has unmercifully suffered ups and downs in recent years.
