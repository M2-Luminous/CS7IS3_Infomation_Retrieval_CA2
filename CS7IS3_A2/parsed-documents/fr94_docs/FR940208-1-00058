FR940208-1-00058 FR940208-1-00011 Under the NSPS and the earlier NESHAP programs, parameter monitoring has traditionally been used as a tool in determining whether control devices are being maintained and operated properly. However, section 114(a)(3) of the Act and ยง70.6(c) of the operating permit rule (57 FR 32251, July 21, 1992) require the submission of ``compliance certifications'' from sources subject to the operating permit program. Sources must certify whether compliance was continuous or intermittent, as well as their compliance status at the end of the reporting period. In light of these requirements, the Agency has considered how sources subject to this rule would demonstrate compliance. The Agency has found that operating parameter monitoring is already being used successfully at some bulk gasoline terminals and can be applied for this purpose. The Agency considers that each exceedence or failure to maintain, as appropriate, of a operating parameter value would constitute a violation of the emission limit. Organic compounds concentration at the processor outlet is the best indication of system operation and corresponding emission reduction. A monitor to measure this parameter would be appropriate for carbon adsorption and possibly refrigeration condenser systems. To achieve representative organic concentration measurements at the processor outlet, the concentration monitoring device should be installed in the exhaust vent of the vapor processor: (1) At least two equivalent diameters downstream from the nearest control device, the point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate may occur and (2) at least a half equivalent diameter upstream from the effluent exhaust. For some vapor processing systems, monitoring of the exhaust organics concentration may be impracticable and monitoring a process parameter may be an equally accurate measure of system performance. For example, temperature monitoring of the combustion section of a thermal oxidation system or the temperature of the air-vapor mixture on the outlet side of a refrigeration condenser system establish performance of the system. If a flare is used to control loading rack emissions, a heat-sensing device such as an ultraviolet beam sensor or a thermocouple to indicate the presence of a flame during the loading operation is required. The Agency is requesting comment, including data and other supporting technical information, on whether the proposed approach on continuous monitoring and types of monitoring parameters ensure continuous compliance of vapor control systems that would be installed at affected bulk gasoline terminals to meet today's proposed emission standard. Additionally, comments and data are requested on how representative the control equipment parameters are of actual performance of the control equipment and in determining compliance. Also, comments and data are requested on alternative methods to those proposed today that can be used to ensure continuous compliance with the emission standard. The proposed regulation also allows for substituting an alternative vapor processing system for those mentioned above or the monitoring of some other parameter if it can be demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction that the processing system achieves the emission limit, and the value of the alternative monitoring parameter ensures continuous compliance with the emission standard. The operating parameter value would be established during the initial performance test. During the test, the operating parameter would be continuously recorded during all the times a gasoline tank truck or railcar was being loaded. Only monitoring data from performance tests in which the system shows compliance with the 10 mg TOC/liter emission limit are valid for the determination of the monitored operating parameter value. The operating parameter value would be the average of the values recorded during which loadings of gasoline tank trucks occur over the six-hour performance test. Today's proposal requires facilities to monitor this operating parameter value continuously, calculate and record a rolling six-hour average valve, and report exceedences or failures to maintain, as appropriate, the average value. New bulk gasoline terminals must install a vacuum assist vapor collection system to ensure that loading tank trucks and railcars do not emit fugitive HAP vapors. The vapor collection system must be continuously monitored to verify that a vacuum always exists in the system while loading is taking place. The monitoring location must be within 0.3 meter (1 foot) of the tank truck/vapor return line interface. The Agency is not proposing any specific vacuum levels that must be maintained (although the vacuum must never exceed the level at which the system's or transport tank's safety vents automatically begin to open). Therefore, the monitoring device need not be highly precise. However, a continuous record indicating that a vacuum is being maintained for the duration of all loadings must be created and maintained at the facility.
