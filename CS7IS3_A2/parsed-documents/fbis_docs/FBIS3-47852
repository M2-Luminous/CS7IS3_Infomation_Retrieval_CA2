Research organizations of the U.S. conservative camp and some major newspapers presented issues concerning the Clinton administration's attitude in negotiations with North Korea. This is indeed a noteworthy phenomenon. Expressing doubt also on North Korea's attitude, former cabinet members of the U.S. Republican administrations showed, in particular, a sensitive response to the issue of suspending the Team Spirit exercise. They stressed strong defense of the ROK from the threat of a southward invasion by North Korea and maintained that the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command exercise is an indispensable course for defense. They are worried even more about North Korea's conventional military power. This being the case, they advise that the ROK-U.S. joint military exercise should be maintained and the ROK's defense capabilities should be strengthened to defend the ROK from any attack -- nuclear or conventional. Should one assess their opinions as merely the "Hawks'" theory? The seriousness of the problem, however, is that judging from the current trend of the U.S. press, their logic is not regarded merely as the opposition harping on the Clinton administration's foreign policy. Emphatically pointing out the strengthened conventional military power in the Asian-Pacific region, Japan's suggestion to reconsider its own nonnuclear policy, and China's weapons exports, they went so far as to recommend implementation of a security-first policy in the Asian-Pacific area, instead of a foreign policy of attaching importance to economics, which may only touch off trade disputes. If we accept their allegation even in part, we would come to realize the seriousness of the security situation in the Asian-Pacific area. Thus, they pointed out that significant political and economic relations should be open to North Korea only when it takes concrete steps to reduce its threat to the Korean peninsula and the surrounding areas. They even proposed a plan to promote trade relations between the United States and China with a view to encouraging China to participate actively in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and in removing North Korea's military threat. It is indeed alarming that the U.S. conservative camp, including former cabinet members of U.S. Republican administrations, began to launch a counterattack as the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks are about to take place. This is even more true in view of the differences in views revealed among intelligence organizations within the Clinton administration, including the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the U.S. State Department. The U.S. intelligence organizations assess that North Korea has already manufactured one or two nuclear bombs, even though of crude condition, or the date of manufacture is imminent. The U.S. Department of State, however, disputes this assertion. As the situation is in disorder in the United States, which is carrying on nuclear negotiations with North Korea, it is quite natural for our government, which is maintaining a joint cooperation system with the Department of State, to be cautious. What if North Korea, while dragging out nuclear negotiations, nearly completes the manufacture of nuclear weapons and then initiates the work of hiding them in deep underground tunnels? How should we cope with a threat of attack by conventional weapons after suspending the Team Spirit exercise? The more serious problem is that even after the exchange of special envoys is realized, the envoy [from the North] may possibly propose the Koryo confederal system. In this event, is it desirable that we declare the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise to him as a partner? Indeed, this is a difficult problem. We have no other words than our hope that the North and the South make appropriate judgments regarding the situation.
