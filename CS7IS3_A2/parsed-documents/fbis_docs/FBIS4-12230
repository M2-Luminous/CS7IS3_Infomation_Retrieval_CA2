During a meeting with Dr. Humam 'Abd-al-Khaliq, Iraqi higher education and scientific research minister, here today, 'Umar added that both the aggression on Iraq and the continued blockade on its people are aimed at stopping scientific, technical, and military progress and obstructing Iraq's effective role in defending the Arab nation's interests. 'Umar reaffirmed that the Sudanese people stand alongside the Iraqi people in confronting and foiling the aggressive schemes and conspiracies concocted by the imperialist, colonialist, and Zionist circles. The Iraqi minister appreciated the positions of Sudan's leadership and people alongside Iraq in the battle it is waging against the imperialist-Zionist conspiracy. He asserted that the Iraqi people will not forget this stand despite the pressures and threats that Sudan is facing, which have not dissuaded Sudan from its genuine pan-Arab positions. The two ministers discussed issues of joint cooperation in the field of higher education and scientific research in accordance with both the cultural agreement signed in 1974 and the subsequent executive programs. Talks also dealt with the possibility of reviewing the agreements signed between the Iraqi and Sudanese universities.
