Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, was speaking at a discussion with members of the preliminary working committee for the preparatory committee of the future SAR, deputies to the Chinese National People's Congress and members of the national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from the Hong Kong region. The annex 3 to the Sino-British Joint Declaration says that from the entry into force of the joint declaration until June 30, 1997, premium income obtained by the British-Hong Kong Government from land transactions shall, after deduction of the average cost of land production, be shared equally between the British-Hong Kong Government and the future SAR government. As the future SAR government has not come into being, the share belonging to the SAR Government is temporarily kept by the Land Fund entrusted by the Chinese side of the Sino-British Land Commission, Lu said. After the transfer of power in 1997, the Sino-British Land Commission will be dismissed and the land income kept by the Land Fund for the Chinese side will all be immediately handed over and subject to the disposal to the SAR government.
