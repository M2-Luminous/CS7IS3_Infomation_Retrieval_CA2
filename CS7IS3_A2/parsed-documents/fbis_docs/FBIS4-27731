Reacting to this event of great significance in the relations of profound friendship and close cooperation between Laos and Korea, the entire Lao people and Vientiane residents are extremely pleased to have the great honor and an opportunity to welcome Comrade Kang Song-san and his entourage right on Lao soil. They will bring the goodwill, friendship, and intimate brotherly affection from the fraternal Korean people to our Lao people. The official friendship visit to our country by the premier of the DPRK Administrative Council and his delegation takes place after several delegations of Laos and Korea have exchanged visits with one another, especially the official friendship visit to the DPRK in December 1993 by our high-level party-state delegation headed by Comrade Khamtai Siphandon, which ended in glorious success. The visit by the DPRK premier clearly testifies to the development in the fine relations of friendship and close comradely solidarity between the two comrades who share common ideals and between the two parties, states, and peoples of Laos and Korea. These relations and solidarity have been nurtured by President Kim Il-song and President Kaysone Phomvihan and further strengthened to continuously bear fruit, thereby contributing to the strengthening of solidarity among the nations sharing similar ideals and to the building of peace, stability, and cooperation among the countries in the Asia-Pacific region and the world over. The LPDR and the DPRK consistently have shared common objectives and ideals. The Lao and Korean peoples have maintained fine relations for a long time. They have consistently rendered support and assistance to one another. The relations and cooperation between the parties, states, and peoples of Laos and Korea have continuously been further strengthened. The relations and cooperation between the two countries, particularly in the economic field, have advanced, especially following the visit to the DPRK by Comrade Khamtai Siphandon last December. The Lao people would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks toward the fraternal Korean party, state, and people for having rendered assistance to us in the past. We pledge to give consistent support and solidarity to the fraternal Korean people in carrying out the just cause of defending and building their socialist fatherland in the north, in trying to reunify the country through peaceful means, and in struggling to turn the Korean peninsula into a zone of peace and stability and free from nuclear weapons. We, the Lao people, wish the official friendship visit to the LPDR by Comrade Kang Song-san, premier of the DPRK Administrative Council, and his party success, thereby contributing to further strengthening the relations of friendship and cooperation between the LPDR and the DPRK.
