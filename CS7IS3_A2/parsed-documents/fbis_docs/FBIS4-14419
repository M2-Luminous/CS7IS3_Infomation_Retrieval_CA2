The meeting between the delegation of the Polish parliament and the head of the Russian government was decided at the last moment. [Correspondent Wojciech Nomejko] The expected half-hour talk was extended to over an hour. Both interlocuters considered ways to increase Polish investment in the Russian market. [Begin Oleksy recording] I am very satisfied with the expressions of readiness that Prime Minister Chernomyrdin declared regarding close contacts. We told each other: Poland can, at the last resort, manage without Russia, Russia without Poland on the whole certainly so, but why? [end recording] [Nomejko] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin declared a readiness for an economic rapprochement between Russia and Poland. Speaker Jozef Oleksy expressed the hope that after the talk today and after the visit of the Russian prime minister to Poland, which will take place in May, decisions will be made to stimulate the economy in Poland. There is a chance that the Polish food processing and construction industries will regain their former positions in the Russian market. They also discussed issues of mutual indebtedness and of the conctruction of gas pipelines. To be sure, the visit of the Polish parliamentarians was to have been solely an informational one, but the meetings with the representatives of the highest authorities of the Russian Federation, the prime minister, and probably the president, mark out the political character of the visit.
