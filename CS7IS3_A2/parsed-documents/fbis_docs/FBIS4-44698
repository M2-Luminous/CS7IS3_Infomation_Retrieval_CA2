According to the group's CEO, Edzard Reuter, the vehicle marks "a first step toward `ecological mobility,'" The vehicle's electric engine is not fueled by batteries, but by its own small electrical plant that runs on hydrogen. The hydrogen converts solely into water vapor, which is expelled into the air. Reuter considers the advance significant not only for the automobile industry, but for energy supply in general. Daimler could play an important role in the market for new energies in the future through its knowledge of the new technique. But Hartmut Weule of Daimler's research department stressed that it will take engineers and researchers years of continued testing before the revolutionary model can be mass-manufactured. Daimler group has already invested over 100 million German marks in hydrogen vehicle research.
