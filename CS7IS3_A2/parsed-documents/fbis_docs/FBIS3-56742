"I am repeating for the 37th time that I will not work in this government", Volskiy told TASS on Wednesday. He did not deny the fact that he had received the offer. Volskiy's election bloc, the "Civic Union", lost the last parliamentary election completely which proved that directors of state enterprises which it united have no social support because of the failure to ensure the minimum subsistance level to their workers and to pay wages in time. However, it is clear that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his First Deputy Oleg Soskovets want to rely on heads of state run enterprises and farms in their future work. This explains the offer to Volsky and a resolute support to Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha who protects the interests of collective and state farms. President Boris Yeltsin, who has accepted the resignation of Yegor Gaydar, the major reformer in the government, now insists on keeping another reformer, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, in the government. This caused a major disagreement with the prime minister, as Fedorov insists that Zaveryukha be dismissed. The decision on the final government composition is thus delayed. The presidential press service announced on Wednesday that consultations will continue today and in the coming days.
