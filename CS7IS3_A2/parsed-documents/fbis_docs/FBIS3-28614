The paper conveys their remarks as follows: Professor of East Asian and International History, Bruce Cummings, pointed to the different estimates of the U.S. State Department, which says, "North Korea may have nuclear weapons" and the CIA, which says the North Koreans have them. Cummings said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) relies heavily on the CIA for its "information about North Korean nuclear capability," although IAEA has conducted a series of full inspections of North Korean nuclear sites. These inspections have been allowed even though the first section of the IAEA's statutes say that any nation can refuse to allow such inspections if it feels another country threatens its security. Referring to the question of why the CIA persists in its claim that North Korea has nuclear weapons, Professor Henry Em, candidate in history, University of Chicago and instructor at Lake Forest College, charged that the CIA is fighting to maintain its 300 billion dollars annual budget and strives to maintain a "threat of dangerous enemies" as a means to gain public and congressional support. Em said: "The attitudes ascribed to North Korea can be better applied to the CIA--that it is dangerous, unstable and self-serving."
