Experts on the appraisal committee said the system marks a major breakthrough in China's neutron radiography technology, and that its critical part -- the scintillation augmentation screen -- is up to the top international standard. China's neutron radiography applications used to be restricted to nuclear reactors, as its expense and inconvenience prevented the technology being used more widely. A research group at the Northeast China Teachers' University took over the development work from the State Commission for Science and Technology six years ago. The experts said the new system can take pictures with a sealed neutron tube as the neutron source or in a weak neutron current environment. The picture can be a film or a microphoto image processed by computer technology.
