He said that he had agreed on this with his Hungarian counterpart, Peter Boross, at their meeting on Wednesday [12 January] in Prague. Slovakia and Hungary should not impair each other in the present situation, Meciar said. Slovakia is willing to conclude a "major (interstate) treaty," to negotiate the creation of a customs union and the opening of several new border crossings, Meciar stated, stressing that essential decisions could be expected only after the forthcoming Hungarian parliamentary elections. In accepting the Partnership for Peace project, the countries involved have also committed themselves to maintain democracy, observe human and minority rights, and honor current state borders, Meciar said. Under documents it has adopted, Slovakia will guarantee its Hungarian minority the international standard of human rights, but will not tolerate any more pressure, Meciar emphasized. It is necessary to stop efforts to create autonomous bodies, change the political situation in some regions' administration, push for autonomy aimed at the spheres of finances and security, and "to prevent developments from escalating further," Meciar stated.
