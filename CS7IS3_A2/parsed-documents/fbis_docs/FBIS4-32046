That is to say, surprisingly, the National Democratic Party-New Alternative [NDS-NA] stopped flirting with the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] and started to pat the shoulders of the Democratic Union [DU] in an amiable manner. Yesterday, we interviewed NDS Chairman Ludovit Cernak on the reasons for this change. [Krno] It seemed just a week ago that your electoral alliance with Jan Carnogursky was already as good as secured. What contributed to the decision to abandon your preelection wooing of the KDH? [Cernak] Politics is the art of compromise and the art of bargaining. Despite this, we have proceeded in a clear-cut and fair manner. We stated publicly again and again that we would be most happy if all five entities in the political center and right of center were to go into the elections together. Our next priority was for a centrist policy and, following up on this, we were willing to consider the KDH offer. The change in the DU's point of view was a decisive occurrence. We informed the Christian Democrats of this immediately. The point of view that strengthening the center will improve the prospects for the future broad ruling coalition's electoral success is indeed pragmatic and sensible. The DU is a priority for us; the political grouping that the Alternative for Political Realism, the Alliance of Democrats, and the NDS formed in expressing no confidence in the former government has, naturally, crystallized as a movement of the center. The public received it positively on the whole. Therefore, we are pleased that there has been a change in the DU's point of view. I have to say, however, that our approach toward the KDH in the talks was correct. [Krno] You surely asked the DU's representatives what led them to change their decision because the Union's Republican Council adopted a resolution recently that it would enter into the elections independently... [Cernak] I did not delve into the essentials of why they changed their mind. I assume that it was their realization of their responsibility for the policy of the center. After all, the existence of lots of tiny little parties is nonsense. The best thing for them would be to merge--and not only two of them--into a single entity after the elections and formulate a professional policy with strong support. [Krno] Into a single entity? As into one party? [Cernak] Yes. [Krno] In what form should you enter into the parliamentary elections with the DU? [Cernak] The DU has made us an offer that is in fact technically the same as the KDH offer--this means, opening its lists of candidates to members of other political entities. [Krno] As far as the number of elective places are concerned, will you be in a better position than you were with the KDH, which offered you the chance of five seats in the National Council? [Cernak] We will be in about the same position. [Krno] On 13 June, when we asked at a Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] Deputies' Club briefing what kind of conclusions they intended to come to with regard to their colleague Ivan Luptak for his conduct [giving the Nazi salute to Cernak] in parliament, they said that this was in reaction to your improper handling of the National Council meeting. Why did you handle it undemocratically? [Cernak] I disagree fundamentally with this claim. These are the twists and turns and excuses of a movement that is incapable of adopting a tough point of view on the statements and conduct of its own deputy. I am convinced that this was a short circuit on the part of Mr. Luptak. However, one has to pay for short circuits in life and especially in politics. The HZDS Deputies' Club should distance itself clearly from such statements made in parliament. I have read the stenographic record of the meeting carefully. I definitely proceeded in accordance with the rules of procedure.
