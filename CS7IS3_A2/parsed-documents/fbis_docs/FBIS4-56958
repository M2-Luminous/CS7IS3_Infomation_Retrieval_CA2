Even passport issuance has been suspended. In Salvador, Bahia State, the gates to the PF office were closed all day today. No one could enter the building. This ballet dancer should have left for a tour of Germany today, but she was unable to get a passport despite having insisted very much on the need to have it. In Belem, Para State, the gate opening to the patio of the PF office was also closed. The policemen cordoned off the building and did not allow anyone in, not even the PF superintendent and the PF inspectors. Nothing functioned here today. In Rio de Janeiro, the PF central office at Maua Square in the downtown area remained closed. The passport issuance department also remained closed. In Sao Paulo, some PF agents demonstrated in front of the PF headquarters. A large number of people became angry at finding the doors to the passport issuance department closed. The PF agents suspended their activities entirely when President Itamar Franco reported that he will not meet their demands. The police inspectors also decided to suspend passport issuance. At the Guarulhos International Airport in Great Sao Paulo, only two PF inspectors are controlling the passengers' luggage and passports. Some 80 landing and takeoff operations are scheduled for today. The situation has been calm all day long, but the movement will increase later on tonight, when there will be flights every 15 minutes.
