Thus, Stanislav Shushkevich made a difficult step, because he had categorically opposed joining the treaty. The official notification of the CIS Headquarters was probably prompted by statements made by CIS officials demanding that Belarus precisely determine its standpoint with regard to the collective security issue. With this step Stanislav Shushkevich removed the trump card of his opponents periodically pressing for his resignation from the post of Supreme Soviet chairman. However, the speaker believes that the Belarusian legislature has a right to introduce amendments in the process of ratification, regulating both the use of the Belarusian Armed Forces on CIS territory and the CIS Armed Forces on the territory of Belarus.
