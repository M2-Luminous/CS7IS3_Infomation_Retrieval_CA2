Speaking at a working meeting on the region's development of agriculture and animal husbandry, Vice Chairman of the Regional Government Zhang Tingwu said that his region owes the achievement to rational development policies and increasing inputs of both labor and investment. According to him, the region has in the past few years updated the household responsibility system and the contract system, improved its agriculture and animal husbandry structure, attached more importance to the role of science and technology, developed rural and township enterprises, nurtured a sound agricultural and animal husbandry market system, established a social service system, and reduced the burdens on farmers and herdsmen. The vice chairman said that in the past six years his region has invested a total of more than 2.4 billion yuan in the infrastructure of the agriculture and animal husbandry sectors. He said that Inner Mongolia now has an irrigated area of more than 1.5 million ha [hectares], about 30 percent of the total arable land. He added that more than 100 items of technology have been applied to agriculture and animal husbandry, yielding some 330 million yuan in extra value. The official said that his region has built 108 production bases of various kinds. The average grain output in the first three years of the eighth five-year plan period (1991-1995) was 10.38 billion kg, a rise of 47.2 percent over the average for the Seventh Five-Year Plan period (1986-1990), the official said. As a result, Inner Mongolia, which traditionally imported grain from other parts of the country, has become one of the areas of China that sell surplus grain. The vice chairman said the region's animal husbandry has substantially reduced its dependence on nature's whims, and the number of livestock has been maintained at around 50 million. As a result, the output value of the agriculture and animal husbandry products-based industries now accounts for 31.74 percent of the total industrial output value of the region.
