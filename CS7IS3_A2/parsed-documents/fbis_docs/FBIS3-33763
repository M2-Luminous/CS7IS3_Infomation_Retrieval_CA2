In its commentary published today, the paper refers to the current controversy over the question of the boycott, which came into the open following the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement in September. The paper notes that the basic prevailing conviction is that a settlement in the region will have to lead to normal relations over a certain period of time, something that the direct parties to the conflict acknowledged from the start when they joined the multilateral talks for economic regional cooperation. The paper emphasizes that there was a general conviction that certain criteria governed the lifting of the different types of boycotts as the settlement process progressed, but this conviction has been somewhat shaken recently.
