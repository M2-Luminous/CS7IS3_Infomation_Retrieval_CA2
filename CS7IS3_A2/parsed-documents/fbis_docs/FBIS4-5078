Stating that the DPRK's "nuclear issue" is not a matter to be discussed by the UN Security Council, a news analyst of NODONG SINMUN says: The DPRK is in a special status after temporarily suspending the effectuation of its declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Accordingly, it is not obliged to undergo routine and ad hoc inspections by the agency. If the UN Security Council is willing to resolve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula, it should take issue with the United States that is laying hurdles in the way of the solution of the nuclear issue and wrecking peace and security with a huge quantity of nuclear weapons, and its underlings, the South Korean authorities. When it caviled at the DPRK, the UN Security Council showed that it was applying a double standard and playing into the hands of the United States in its policy of stifling the DPRK. It must bear due responsibility for the consequences of its illegal dealing with the DPRK's "nuclear issue" against the aim and principle of the UN charter. A news analyst of MINJU CHOSON warns that when the United States and its followers are further expanding their anti-DPRK pressure kickup, taking the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK to the international arena, the DPRK cannot but take an appropriate measure. It is the will and invariable stand of the DPRK to maintain an independent policy and not to allow any unwarrantable demands, declares the paper.
