FR940114-0-00005 FR940114-0-00002 Commodity Credit Corporation 7 CFR Part 1468 RIN 0560&hyph;AC65 Support Prices for Shorn Wool, Wool on Unshorn Lambs, and Mohair for the 1993 Marketing Year AGENCY: Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On July 14, 1993, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued a proposed rule (58 FR 37876) with respect to the support prices for shorn wool, wool on unshorn lambs, and mohair for the 1993 marketing year. The support level for wool on unshorn lambs has been determined by taking 80 percent of the difference between the 1993 support price for shorn wool and the 1993 national average market price for shorn wool, multiplied by 5 pounds (the amount of wool on an average 100-pound unshorn lamb). The mohair support level has been determined to be $4.738, which is equal to 85 percent of the comparable percentage of parity at which shorn wool is supported for the 1993 marketing year. These actions are required by section 703 of the National Wool Act of 1954, as amended (Wool Act). EFFECTIVE DATE: January 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Janise A.
