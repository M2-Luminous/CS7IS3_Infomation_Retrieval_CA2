They cover many aspects, including running the state, party building, running the Army, the economy, culture, foreign affairs, and life in general. This article is going to deal with just a very small fraction of the theory, namely, the basic sources and characteristics of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art. The primary origin of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art is Marxist and Mao Zedong thinking on literature and art. Based on historical materials, especially through the newly published work by Mao Mao, My Father, Deng Xiaoping, we learn that initially he only had schooling up to second year in junior high; nevertheless, this gifted high school student managed to cross the ocean and arrived in the motherland of the Paris Commune at the age of 16; later he went to Marx' motherland, and accepted Marxism through a part-work, part-study program. He was a famous "Maoist" when the Red Army was first founded. Although he was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, he has always been firm in safeguarding Mao Zedong Thought in a series of speeches since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. This was an expression of his persistent loyalty as well as evidence of his profound friendship for a comrade-in-arms. In simple words and clear-cut views, the world outlook and methodology characterized by dialectical materialism and historical materialism run through many theses in Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; this also proves that he has a profound attainment and mastery of Marxism-Leninism. The second origin of Deng Xiaoping thinking on literature and art was the positive and negative experiences of party leadership in literature and art work. If we put it that the party's work in literature and art was at an infant stage during the First Revolutionary Civil War, then, when Mao Zedong published his "Talks at the Yanan Forum on Literature and Art" in 1942, the party's work in this arena had already matured. On many basic points, the "Talks" enriched the Marxist theoretical treasure house on literature and art. Deng Xiaoping's long-term revolutionary practice and his understanding of life in various directions has made the profundity of his thinking quite beyond the reach of ordinary men! The third origin of Deng Xiaoping thinking on literature and art is information on the literature and art movement during the new historical period. What accounts for the ever- running waters of the mighty Chang Jiang is that it has its fountainhead in the Tuotuo River on the southern slope of Kala Kunlun Shan; furthermore, it accepts waters from a hundred tributaries in nine provinces at any one time. Comrade Xiaoping studied the original works of Marx and Lenin in his early years, and personally participated in the collective founding of Mao Zedong Thought; all this has increased the depth and vitality of his theory. The major characteristics of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art are as follows: First, combining theory with practice. This is the general and basic characteristic of Deng Xiaoping thinking on literature and art. Just as Marx said: Any genuine philosophy is the quintessence of the spirit of one's times. The general characteristic of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art is precisely his meeting the need of the spirit of the times during the new historical period with originality, while adhering to the traditional principle of Marxist-Mao Zedong thinking on literature and art and fitting the situation of reform and opening up. We can find this by reading his programmatic document, "Speech Greeting the Fourth Congress of Chinese Writers and Artists." In addition, because Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art has its origin in reality and practicality in combining theory with practice, it was made entirely concrete in party policy on literature and art. Those people who are familiar with the PRC history of literature and art should be able to see the brilliance of this characteristic: First, literature and art should convert from a situation of taking class struggle as the key to a situation mainly characterized by economic construction, peace, and development; second, expanding the scope of to whom literature and art renders service to all people, including the intelligentsia and other people on the broadest scale; third, making important readjustments that fall in line with the characteristics of the new period concerning the contents of service, with many forbidden areas broken through, while stressing "what subjects they should choose for their creative work and how they should deal with those subjects are questions that writers and artists themselves must examine and gradually resolve through practice. There should be no arbitrary meddling in this process"; and fourth, improving and enriching forms of service, which everyone can see.... In the concluding part of the "Speech Greeting the Fourth Congress of Chinese Writers and Artists," Deng Xiaoping said with full confidence: "The conditions are ripening daily that will enable us genuinely to put into practice the Marxist policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend." In a nutshell, Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art has developed on the solid foundation of inheriting Marxist-Mao Zedong thinking on literature and art, while linking it to the new realities of literature and art in China, and calling forth ideological vitality in the combination of theory and practice. Regarding this point, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Beyond a doubt, we should never for a moment violate the fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. However, it is imperative to link, analyze, and study actual conditions as well as to resolve practical issues." "It is necessary to link Marxist universal truth to the specific realities of China, take our own road, and build socialism with Chinese characteristics; that is precisely the basic conclusion drawn from summarizing our long-term historical experiences." Second, the combination of freedom in creation and scientific value. This finds expression in the whole process of the production of literature and art, and is another characteristic of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art. Regarding literature and art undertakings, just as Lenin stressed that "it is absolutely imperative to insure a vast space for the individual's creativity and interest...," our party has all along advocated the free development of different forms and styles in artistic creation. Of course, it is unnecessary to conceal the fact that in a specific wartime environment, literary and artistic creation aimed at clearly propagating a certain policy and specific political tasks at a specific time did exist for a long time and played a certain role; however, viewed from a long-range artistic angle, its role in the development of the production of literature and art, especially quality improvement, was very limited. That being the case, Deng Xiaoping stressed: "The road before literature and art should become broader and broader" "writers and artists should deal with an ever wider range of themes, increasingly vary their means of expression, and dare to blaze new trails." "We must guard against or overcome the tendency to be formalistic and abstract, which produces monotonous, stiff, mechanical and stereotyped works." We may put it that Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art has pushed the creative freedom of writers and artists to an unprecedentedly higher plane. The scientific value of such administrative ways lies in the fact that it has macroscopic control while paying attention to microscopic readjustment, and it is capable of exercising discipline on others as well as self-discipline; furthermore, it is characterized by its practical value. Summing up, first, regarding the producers of literature and art, namely, writers and artists themselves, he set out the need to "conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought to enhance their own ability to understand and analyze life and see through appearances to the essence," and "to become real engineers of the human soul." Second, he set out the need to improve leadership in party organizations in work concerning literature and art. And third, he set out the need to augment leadership in this scene. The scientific guidance of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art makes its profundity and accuracy keenly felt on any ordinary day, especially at the critical moment of a sudden change in the situation when right and wrong are being confused. This has definitely been proven by the newly published Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping.
