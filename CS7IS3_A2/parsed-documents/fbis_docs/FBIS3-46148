Zou Jiahua began his speech by relaying the cordial regards of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to the country's coal workers who have contributed significantly to the national economic development. After hearing reports of the Datong Mining Bureau, the Jixi Mining Bureau, the Chongqing Coal Company, and the Capital Coal Construction Company, Zou Jiahua said that, after coal prices have been decontroled, the country's coal industry will confront a new situation where production decisions have to be made according to market supply and demand. In view of this the nation's coal industry must come up with new measures adaptable to the new situation. He said: After several decades, Chinese coal enterprises have become used to the planned economic management, and the traditions that the state was responsible for drawing up production plans, supplying equipment, alloting production capital, and buying up products are deep rooted. Under the market economic system, coal enterprises not only must study how much coal they should produce, but also how much they can sell; and not only must they study the domestic market, they must also study the world market. The decontroling of coal prices does not mean that coal enterprises can set prices themselves. It means market prices must be determined by buyers and sellers according to market needs. From now on the state will draw up coal production plans according to market needs. Zou Jiahua pointed out: After they enter the market, coal enterprises must lower their production cost and increase their productivity, otherwise they cannot possibly compete there. Overstaffing has been one longstanding problem plaguing China's coal industry. Coal miners from now on must foster their militancy and hardworking spirit and make great efforts to diversify operations. Zou Jiahua concluded by saying that coal mines must intensify their production safety after entering the market. He said: Leaders of coal enterprises in the country not only must pay attention to returns, but also safety, which is even more important. Efforts must be made so that, under the new situation marked by market economy, the production will be safer each year and the mortality rate of coal miners will continue to drop for the output of 1 million tonnes of coal.
