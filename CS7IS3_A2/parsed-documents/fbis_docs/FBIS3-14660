The Jamahiriya News Agency's international affairs editor commented on this saying that the decision made by the British Government exposes the true intention [word indistinct] the British Government to escalate it with the aim of carrying out an aggressive act against Libya and to inflict damage on its interests. This is [word indistinct] and parcel of previous (?attacks) carried out against Libya without regard for international law, without regard for the truth and without respect for the mediation which was undertaken by several countries. They also have no consideration for the ease with which the Great Jamahiriyah responded as well as the practical initiatives which are sufficient for reaching the truth and solving the problem from the very core. However, the three Western allies decided to ignore these and failed to reconsider their stance. The important thing to do now is to develop the Arab position with the aim of having the embargo on the Great Jamahiriyah lifted through the channels of their compatriots in the Arab League, firstly and secondly through the Islamic Conference.
