Asked by ITAR-TASS about the Russian peace-making role in former Soviet republics and a possibility of these efforts' integration with the United Nations global peace-making operations, Butrus-Ghali said this was discussed with the Russian foreign minister. In his words, the U.N. secretariat is very interested in cooperation with Russia and its participation in peace-making contingents in various areas. At the same time, a resolution of the United Nations Security Council to the effect is necessary, which will entail certain financial difficulties. The U.N. peace-making budget has increased from 500 million dollars to 3.6 billions within two years, and this is an obstacle to be overcome in order to expand cooperation with Russia in this sphere, said Butrus-Ghali.
