FBIS4-11219 "drlat079_l_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-079 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 Bolivia Military Command To Defend Sovereignty Military Command To Defend Sovereignty PY2304030994 Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 15 Apr 94 p 1 PY2304030994 Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS Spanish BFN [Text] La Paz -- Sources linked to the national Defense Ministry and the military high command on 14 April announced that "a national strategy document" for the defense of national "sovereignty and security" will be delivered next week to the president of the Republic and captain general of the Armed Forces, Gonzalez Sanchez de Lozada, for its "immediate implementation" in the attempt to safeguard the Bolivian state's physical integrity. The sources explained that for this purpose a meeting of the Defense Ministry, the National Security Supreme Council [Consejo Supreme de Seguridad Nacional, COSDENA], and the Armed Forces command was called during the past few hours. The meeting's purpose is to start drafting the document that will be submitted to the chief of state. The sources commented: We are going to adopt a definite stance -- in our capacity as the government -- regarding reports that revealed the "internal and external weakness" shown by the country in view of the "interference and imposition" of the foreign forces acting in the national territory. They also said: "Our rule will be to propose basic guidelines for its defense." This information was disclosed a few hours after former President Jaime Paz Zamora accused the United States of interfering in domestic affairs through the financial cooperation it offers for the fight against drug trafficking. To prove the pressure exerted by the United States in "many fields" of cooperation it grants Bolivia, Paz Zamora said: "I took our flag and went out to defend national dignity." The proposals the national organizations directly charged with security will make will include precise suggestions on subjects related to the presence of foreign troops in Bolivia, the existence of technical cooperation commissions for the struggle against drug trafficking, and the Armed Forces' actions to guarantee external and internal security. The sources pointed out that "the president of the Republic, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, now has to call COSDENA to assess, as a whole, the discoveries disclosed these past weeks as a result of the investigations into the government authorities' links to drug trafficking." In the meantime, National Defense Ministry sources today asserted that the drug trafficking scourge during the past 10 years has become a "destabilizing factor" for the Bolivian state's institutional system. They also pointed out that the illegal business of drug trafficking had infiltrated "the state's most sensitive security structure" and, consequently, there is a risk -- if this scourge is not eradicated -- of "irreversibly enslaving" the Bolivian state with consequences that, so far, "have not been truly determined." They also said they would make proposals designed to review agreements Bolivia has signed with the United States that "endorse a constant presence of foreign troops" in the national territory because -- they said -- it violates Bolivian sovereignty and the country's laws. They pointed out that the national government will have to do something similar about the "technical cooperation commissions" such as the DEA that act "with complete freedom and autonomy" in Bolivia. The sources added: "We must establish an explicit difference between the functions of the U.S. missions that give humanitarian aid to given regions of the country and the U.S. logistical support in the war against drug trafficking. Rules for this sort of aid must be established."
