More specifically, the YKT leadership came into being thanks to the tacit support of KTC who had just retired from first-line politics. And even today it is difficult to explain its existence minus that factor. Needless to say, KTC is a retiree from politics. He himself reaffirmed it publicly on many occasions. But the fact is that even though he retired from active politics, it does not mean that his influence has also been "retired." This fact was verified more than once. KTC remains a member of the DP and, more importantly, all his men are in good shape in the DP. [passage omitted] According to the party Constitution, the next DP national convention is to be held in May 1995; however, in the event of a national election, it can be moved up by a maximum of 6 months or delayed by up to 3 months. Therefore, the next DP convention is, basically, far more than a year away, but Chairman Yi recently referred to the possibility of moving it up within the range indicated in the party Constitution. He thus hinted at his so-called intent for en early convention, creating a subtle stir in the party; until then, he had been negative about moving up the convention date. Now, since he himself raised the issue, there must have been a reason for it. Conversely, his action proves that an anti-Yi offensive within the party is approaching to a critical level. In fact, the nonmainstreamers have been demanding, intermittently though, the holding of an extraordinary party convention sometime in the first half of 1994. Chairman Yi seems to be feeling the same pressure in the course of his management of the DP's National Assembly policy during the regular Assembly session, too. While the "nine man, nine different minds" criticism against the party leadership continues unabated, he could so far lead the party rather smoothly by effectively managing the balance of power among the members of the party Supreme Committee. However, as soon as he moved to show his own color in his National Assembly speech and in his parliamentary strategy as the opposition leader, the nonmainstreamers strongly reacted against it. Even among the Supreme Committee members, fewer came forward backing him up. No Mu-hyon and Yi Pu-yong of the Democratic faction [from the former DP before its merger with the UPP] turned their backs on him. No Mu-hyon, while holding on to his basic line since the last party convention in March, is nevertheless intensifying his criticism of Chairman continuously. What makes the chairman worry even more is that Yi Pu-yong, who had been relatively cooperative, reversed his attitude, turning critical of the chairman. Since No and Yi Pu-yong are also members of the Reform group, these things have spawned speculations that Chairman Yi has not only lost his grip of the Democratic faction but is perhaps shunned by the Reform group, too. Only two Supreme Committee members, Kwon No-kap and Han Kwang-ok, remain loyal to the chairman, while the Tonggyodong faction reportedly sees something missing in Chairman Yi, at times feeling dissatisfied. Meanwhile, the Tonggyodong faction has been constantly on the move since it unified its genealogy in the name of [KTC's] Naeoe Munje Yonguso [Institute of Internal and External Affairs]. Recently, it reorganized Yonchong, a private organization of KTC. Chairman Yi also has launched a membership drive for his private organization, T'ongil Sanha Hoe [Society for Reunited Mountains and Rivers]. But he finds himself under mounting intraparty pressure. In short, the Reform group does not approve of "dual citizenship" of members, putting pressure on the chairman and his force. Chairman Yi's camp is aware of all this subtle shifting. So much so that some insiders say that they might be oversensitive. At any rate, YKT and his force are known to be working on strategies to ensure that their leadership continues after the National Assembly regular session and further to defend its power base at the next party convention while keeping a close eye on its own faction that is turning rebellious, on the increasingly visible resistance of the progressive forces within the party, and on the growing signs of disharmony with the Tonggyodong faction, the main force in the DP. In this atmosphere, Chairman Yi is said to have tried to contact KTC recently. In fact, this does not pay for either side. For KTC, it could harm the image of his retirement from politics. Chairman Yi could also be hurt because it would further enhance his image as a weak leader unable to run the party independently. But the immediate reality is that something has to be done to change the flow of things in the combined forces of a DP apparently plagued by internal disharmony. Chairman Yi's side in particular seems to be feeling the need more keenly. Therefore, reports say, he tried to contact the Tonggyodong camp while discreetly keeping a distance. Acting as mediators between the two camps are Kwon No-kap and Han Kwang-ok, both members of the Supreme Committee, plus Rep. Mun Hui-sang, Chairman Yi's chief secretary, and Pak Chi-won, DP spokesman. Mun was the first chairman of Yonchong. He also had served as its sixth chairman until Kim Ok-tu took over recently. He is one of the key figures among KTC's direct disciples and he is always present at their gatherings. Despite his position as Yi's chief secretary, he would say unhesitatingly that "my `home base' is Tonggyodong." Pak also has his roots in Tonggyodong and was part of the KTC campaign in the last presidential election. The two are the key workers playing the role of a bridge between the YKT and KTC forces to prevent a split and ensure cooperation. They are said to be playing the part of letting Chairman Yi's side know --through a variety of routes--what KTC thinks about Yi's National Assembly strategy and political course in general, or vice versa. They contend that there is no gap between Chairman Yi and KTC. They explain that there has been no change in their basic relationship--even amid the subtle undercurrent of a power game within the party. They assert that KTC has had no objections to Chairman Yi's political line, to the substance of his National Assembly speech delivered in October as a product of that new line, and to his press conference in late September in which Yi stated that he would give the economy priority over the issue of liquidating the past--namely, to all those things that fed the feud within the party. Needless to say, it was Mun Hui-sang himself who led the writing of that speech. Moreover, Pae Ki-son, former assistant chief secretary for KTC, also took an active part. Pae has also been working as an aide for Chairman Yi for some time. Another source familiar with developments on both sides asserts that "there is nothing going on that could fundamentally reverse the internal balance of power within the mainstream." He insists that the only problem is the dissatisfaction among mainstreamers with the performance of Chairman Yi, who they think lacks in leadership for an effective struggle against the ruling camp. And it is a problem that can be resolved, he adds. The nonmainstreamers have a different view. While agreeing that the KTC-YKT alliance will not be easily shaken, they do not think that YKT will remain the alternative for the mainstreamers for too long. At the same time, the mainstreamers themselves have the realistic need to try and shake the mainstreamers from inside to make sure that he will not. Their concerns are, in fact, no longer over the KTC-YKT alliance but are focused on the moves of the Tonggyodong faction.
