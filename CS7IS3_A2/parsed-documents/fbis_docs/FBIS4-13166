Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that Shim'on Peres and Yasir 'Arafat will meet several times at a conference in Bucharest on Thursday and Friday so as to speed up the negotiations. Peres will probably also meet Jordanian Prime Minister al-Majali there, and there are currently contacts to work that out. The United States is demanding that Israel and Syria prepare a package of their demands on security, peace, and a Golan withdrawal prior to Secretary Christopher's visit. Due to that, deliberations are taking place in Rabin's and Peres' bureaus on various position papers. It is unclear whether the Syrians are working on their own proposals.
