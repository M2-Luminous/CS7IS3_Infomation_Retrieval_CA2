No one with even the slightest chance of getting into Bratislava to attend the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] rally misses an opportunity to hear Vladimir Meciar and his coworkers speak. This week, too, the banners in the "Na Pasienkoch" indoor stadium revealed that people from Prievidza, Topolcany, Nove Zamky, and Komarno, as well as Slovaks from the United States, were present. [passage omitted] As usual, HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar was the first to take the floor: [passage omitted] "Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, allow me to thank all of you who have come here this evening to meet HZDS members and leading officials and their present and future coalition partners. (applause, followed by the reminder that today is the Day of the Child) Our rallies will soon require a bigger stadium. (....) The rallies attract considerable attention; no lesser person than the president himself is their commentator. (applause) Whenever we meet, it creates ripples, and there is something to write about. (....) Over the past two weeks, I crisscrossed Slovakia from east to west, and everywhere I came across uncertainty, irritation, unrest, and a longing for action. It is becoming apparent that it was a big mistake to postpone the elections until September. They should have been over by the end of June because parliament and society (unceasing applause) are getting into a deep depression and parliament into a profound moral and political crisis. Of course, the developments of the past few weeks raise questions and call for answers. First of all, I would like to pause to consider some activities of the government that distress us. There is nothing to praise, nor will there be anything to praise. But there are plenty of things to rail against and many reasons to swear. First of all, the political background of the government had been shrouded in fog and concealed. Everyone was telling us that we were lying when we spoke about the existence of an eight-point agreement between the government and the Hungarian political parties. (noise in the hall) Although we can deduce from reports what these eight points are, we emphatically ask the government to publish the secret agreements so that we can learn whose vassal it is and whom it wants to serve. (applause) We want to know why the government accepted and pledged to implement the program of the Komarno appeal of January 1994 [containing demands of the ethnic Hungarian minority], which has been condemned by the majority of the citizens of Slovakia. Whose government is this? Who does it represent?" Balladur Plan Is Superfluous Vladimir Meciar then devoted himself to the itinerant activities of the Moravcik government and said, among other things, that he considers the Balladur plan superfluous in view of existing agreements. "We want the same rules for all minorities to be adopted in Europe and for them to have the same level of protection (applause) in our country that they have in the West. We are in favor of the codification of those rights, and then it will not be necessary to conclude agreements calling in question our position and our situation." The Socialists' victory in Hungary means no change in policy regarding the minorities, Vladimir Meciar continued, and stressed that there will not be any staking out [of Hungarian-inhabited territory] by means of signposts! "We also find distressing the questions of guarantees of democracy. We are turning to citizens before decisive moments. We did not seek parliamentary intrigues, the disintegration of other parties, and the infliction of damage on our competitors. We were looking for a way of expressing the citizens' will. A constitutional law has been passed, according to which there will be elections. As we see, however, pressure for the acquisition of 90 votes [needed to pass constitutional laws] continues in the National Council, and, as this pressure keeps growing, fears justifiedly arise about whether we will be able to defend the election date on parliamentary soil, so that the elections really take place on 30 September 1994. Therefore, as soon as the law on referendum is passed, we will initiate a new collection of signatures for a referendum. (applause)" There Should Have Been a Referendum Meciar explained how they became convinced that the referendum should have been called. The number of valid signatures that were collected was sufficient: 372,000. He said that the government's travels were very costly, adding that "they travel because they know it is the last time." And how did Vladimir Meciar assess some economic steps of the government? "We are rightly distressed by what the government has done. While they proclaimed that they would take over our policy and carry on what we had done, they are acting in the typical Moravcikite way--two steps on the spot, the suggestion of a step forward, and two steps back. Our policy was guided by a simple philosophy, which said that it is impossible to economize any more and that, to be able to spend more, it is necessary to earn more money and to raise earnings. The present government's policy says that it is still necessary to save. These savings should squeeze out of citizens about 7.5 billion korunas, which will be felt mainly by poor people who cannot afford it. But entrepreneurs should not think that this does not concern them because, when the tax on repairs and services, including public catering, goes up 20 percent, their market will be reduced in size and many small businessmen will be driven by this policy to bankruptcy. (....) Because the government neglects monetary flows, bank credits are becoming more expensive, and the interest rate on loans has reached 30 percent.... We cannot agree with that. Nor do we identify with the approach toward privatization. (....) We are against pseudoprivatization." Turning to the HZDS program, Meciar said: "We do not renounce the national program, but it is not the sole pillar; it is one of the pillars of our program. The time has not yet come for us to say that the state has become so stable that everything has been resolved. As long as the process of definite stabilization is not completed, we do not have the right to renounce this program, in contrast to those who do not want to respect either the state or the national program." [sentence as published] (applause) Sixth Government in Four Years At the close of his address, the movement's chairman said: "We consider it appropriate to adopt, shortly after the elections, measures to stabilize the political system. The Slovak Republic cannot continue like this. It will have the sixth government and the fourth parliament in four years. This brings enormous losses, which are also expressed in terms of money." And, before [moderator of HZDS rallies] Gabo Zelenay grabbed his microphone for a while, he said: "We do not have a program for ourselves, we have it for Slovakia. (applause) We are not going to fight against Weiss or Carnogursky. We want to fight for the Slovak Republic." (applause) It was time for the citizens' questions. [passage omitted] An interesting question was addressed to Meciar: What should be done with deputies so they do not betray again? "First of all, a law will have to be passed regulating the loss of mandate [of deputies who leave the party for which they ran in the elections] because moral and ethical norms have insufficient impact. A group of subversives cannot be allowed to seek the state's weakness in the weaknesses of people. [sentence as published] We assure you that instances of suspected corruption of people who have left us will all be investigated." [passage omitted] [Former Defense Minister] Imrich Andrejcak received questions bearing out that, even in the Army, not everything can be kept secret. "Why did the president appoint Docent Zak, an officer of Czech nationality, as rector of the Military Academy at Liptovsky Mikulas? Do we not have enough Slovak officers? He was appointed because he had been proposed by the minister of defense, and we do have Slovak officers. The same mistake occurred in Kosice [seat of the Air Force Academy]. The rector there is admittedly a Slovak, but a person who cannot himself fly is training pilots there. (laughter) Under Docent Zak, teaching in the Czech language was resumed in Liptovsky Mikulas (booing) and is being tolerated despite Slovak officers' protests. (....) Here is one long question, which I am not going to read. I will only say in response that I will propose to our deputies in parliament that they initiate an inquiry into whether some functionaries of the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are citizens of the Slovak Republic in the first place." (commotion in the hall) [passage omitted] At the end, it was again Meciar's turn. Asked about the case of [Deputy Prime Minister] Roman Kovac, he replied: "He has not filed any suit against me thus far nor will he file one because he is afraid of it like the devil of holy water because many of us heard this admission. It is to this government and parliament's disgrace that they keep him among themselves. And it is also his personal disgrace." Replying to a question about the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], he said: "We do not identify the entire SDL with Weiss, Ftacnik, Siroky, and Dorotin. They represent a deviation [uchylka] in the SDL. SDL members should therefore ponder what to do when their leadership deflects." Asked whether it is true that [former chairman of the Public Against Violence Movement] Fedor Gal is Weiss's extended arm in Prague, he said: "I cannot confirm that because I have no information about it. What I do know, however, is that on Easter Monday in 1992, when the balance of power in Slovakia was already clear, Messrs. Weiss and Filkus had been invited to the president [Havel] for talks, the contents of which we have never been informed. Although we were party colleagues then, we do not know what happened at the Castle that day." He explained, furthermore, how two members could nonchalantly move from one government to the next: "They claim with haughty calm that everything is okay. They say with haughty calm that one must not be confrontational. At the same time, they regard as confrontational everyone who has a different point of view from that of the present Politburo. But evil must always be countered. Evil must be resisted even if that means confrontation. (applause) We are not transcending the limits of democracy, but we are not going to pretend that everything is in order only to avoid being labeled confrontational.... According to this government's understanding, being nonconfrontational and understanding means being stupid. Don't get excited, they tell us. We are only going to suck the blood out of you (laughter). True, that is exactly what they are doing with us. They have only taken money out of our pockets. They are only threatening us with the division of the state. They only undignifiedly represent us abroad and behave there as representatives who are incapable of managing their own affairs. They only damage social relations. Otherwise, they have done nothing to harm us, so why are we not satisfied? All of this is enough for them not to be where they are now. (....) For this reason, it is necessary that this dispute be decided by the citizens as soon as possible, and we must consider which democratic means to use within the framework of the struggle against them." [passage omitted] The participants in the rally applauded. The three-hour marathon of words was coming to an end.
