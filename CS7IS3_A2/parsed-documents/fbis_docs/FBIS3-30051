It was reported that Hosokawa and former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, a Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] leader, had held a meeting on the evening of 23 February. Officials of the coalition parties as well as the LDP were sent rushing off to confirm the report. Could the prime minister have asked Watanabe to join the cabinet? Various speculations have made the rounds. Both the prime minister and Watanabe flatly denied that a meeting had been held, and refused to give any further comments. The truth about the "Hosokawa-Watanabe meeting" remains a mystery.
