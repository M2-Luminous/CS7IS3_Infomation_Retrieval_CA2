[Begin Vasquez recording] Today we have a complete laboratory study, and this is why we say that the deaths were cholera-caused. Four people have died and 700 cases have been reported.

According to the minister, 95 percent of the cases were a result of food that was handled without taking the proper hygienic measures.

[Begin Vasquez recording] The hospitals have the capacity to face the problem.
