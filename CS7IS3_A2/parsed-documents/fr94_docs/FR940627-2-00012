FR940627-2-00012 FR940627-2-00009 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Evaluation of State Coastal Management Programs and National Estuarine Research Reserves AGENCY: Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), DOC. ACTION: Notice of availability of evaluation findings. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given of the availability of the final evaluation findings for Alabama, California, Connecticut, Mississippi, Maine, and New Hampshire Coastal Management Programs, and Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island), Rookery Bay (Florida), Chesapeake Bay (Maryland), and North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERR). Section 312 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA), as amended, requires a continuing review of the performance of coastal states with respect to coastal management and the operation and management of NERRs. The states of Alabama, California, Connecticut, Maine and New Hampshire were found to be implementing and enforcing their Federally approved coastal management program, addressing the national coastal management objective identified in CZMA section 303(2)(A)&hyph;(K), and adhering to the programmatic terms of their financial assistance awards. The State of Mississippi was found not fully adhering to its approved coastal management program. Implementation of several recommendations listed in the findings will bring Mississippi's program back into satisfactory adherence. North Carolina, Narragansett Bay, Rookery Bay, and Chesapeake Bay, MD NERRs were found to be satisfactorily adhering to programmatic requirement of the NERR system. Copies of these final evaluation findings may be obtained upon request from: Vickie Allin, Chief, Policy Coordination Division, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, NOS/NOAA, 1305 East-West Highway, 11th Floor, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 (301) 713&hyph;3087.
