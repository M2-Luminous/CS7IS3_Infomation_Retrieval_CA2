Al-Bid was focusing on the Awkali tribe's 20,000 fighters to help check Salih's advance in the oil province of Shabwah, in eastern Yemen like al-Mukalla, an AFP correspondent reported Tuesday [24 May]. But the tribe was undecided, mainly because of "bad relations" with al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party which ruled the former Marxist South Yemen, southern official Muhsin Muhammad Farid acknowledged. Farid was named deputy prime minister of the Yemen Democratic Republic (YDR) which declared its independence on Saturday under the leadership of al-Bid, who moved here from his Aden stronghold a week ago. "The tribes need time to realise that the situation has changed, and to rally. They have steered clear of the war since it broke out" on May 5, Farid told a small group of reporters. "So they are not budging, and they say what's going on does not concern them." The Awkalis' reluctance to fight is obvious at the Hadhramut Hotel where 1,000 fighters, armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles and traditional carved daggers, are being housed and fed during the negotiations with al-Bid. Sitting on a rock next to his bungalow in the newly-built hotel facing the Gulf of Aden, one of the fighters bursts into laughter when asked what he will do. And then he says: "Resist, of course." The civil war and the tribal invasion have caused distress for the staff. "Last month, the occupancy rate was 82 percent. French, Italian and German tourists filled the hotel. Now we've just received a cancellation for a group of 120 French people," complained hotel manager Isma'il Zakariya, an Indian. He has not heard from his family in Bangalore for the past 20 days, as al-Mukalla is totally cut off from the rest of the world, with telephone and telex lines down. "I just want to save my skin, and get away from this place on the first evacuation," he said. Six ships were moored off al-Mukalla port, the closest loading facility to Massila oilfield. The 175,000 inhabitants of the city appeared indifferent to the battles raging hundred of kilometers away. Northern forces have made a "breakthrough" in the oil-rich Shabwah but will never reach the production fields, al-Bid said Monday. Oil production was continuing in the Massila field at more than 150,000 barrels a day. He said negotiations were underway with the Canadian oil company Canoxy on revenues, which were usually paid to the government in Sanaa, capital of the Yemen which was unified four years ago.
