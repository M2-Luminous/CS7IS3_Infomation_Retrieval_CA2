We thank you for agreeing to give this interview which, as you know, coincides with Algeria's and the Algerians' preparations for the national conference on dialogue to find a way out of Algeria's crisis. Mr. Chairman, can you talk about the hopes that the Algerian leadership is pinning on this conference? [Kafi] Thank you. First, I in my turn thank the MBC for this interest in Algeria and its problems. Thank you. Regarding your question, I and everyone who follows up on the developments in Algeria believe that a qualitative change could have happened had this crisis not taken place. Viewers and all those who watch your programs should be given the full picture of Algeria before the present stage, that is, from 1962 until 1988 when a popular uprising took place that filled the streets all over Algeria. The leadership at the time came to the conclusion that it was necessary to review the Constitution. Political pluralism was approved because it was one party rule. From that time on, Algeria began to deal with this new concept of organizing the political and social life of the country. Parties began to be established very quickly and 62 or 63 parties were set up. Between 1989 and December 1991, legislative elections were organized. I believe that this was not enough time. That's one point. Second, the parties did not organize themselves. The administration was still fragile and could not act as it should in organizing the elections and we saw what happened following the 26 December elections. When the results of the elections were announced, they were contested and were met with strong rejection. So there was a need for change. The Parliament had ended its term and the president of the Republic resigned. There was a vacuum. Naturally, we decided that the state should continue. So we formed the Higher State Council under the late brother Mohamed Boudiaf, may God have mercy on his soul. We drew up a plan to extricate the country from its crisis as quickly as possible. The task entrusted to the Higher State Council was to carry out the duties for the remaining two years of the five-year term of the president. The Higher State Council was formed under Boudiaf, who, after six months in power, was assassinated, as you know. I was chosen to replace him. I assumed power and we began our work to address the situation because we found out that the three pillars on which the state was built were in a state of collapse. We found that the state was in a shambles, the economy was collapsing, and that Algerian society was in total disarray from lack of confidence resulting from the accumulation of previous mistakes. [Zaytuni] Mr. President, regarding the idea of dialogue, certain parties, particularly the National Liberation Front [FLN] and the Socialist Forces Front, have boycotted the National Conference. Will this boycott affect the results of the conference or will it continue, even if these parties and others fail to participate? [Kafi] Before answering this question directly, I would like to say that in September 1992 we endorsed the policy of dialogue with all political parties, economic and social partners, and other confederal committees concerned with these tasks, such as the Mojahedin Organization, the Martyrs' Sons Organization, and the Farmers Union, etc. These are large, important pillars in the country. We adopted the policy of dialogue and embarked on a first round, a second, and a third round from which we emerged with the document in June 1993, a document called the basis for national dialogue. All the parties responded. We prepared a complete file on what took place at these stages of dialogue and based on these replies and this basis. Then we heard and sensed from some statements by various parties that we should negotiate or have a dialogue with the army, and so on. We decided in the end that we should give another stimulus to the dialogue. Thus, we formed a national committee to be in charge of completing the dialogue in light of what took place in the previous rounds, and of the parties' replies. This began in September 1993 and has continued to this day, until after tomorrow, that is, Tuesday 25 January and 26 January, when the conference is slated to be held. Regarding the second part of the question about the fronts, or the so-called three fronts, that is, the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], the FLN, and the Socialist Front of Ayet Ahmed. Before going into this, we have to mention that on 23 November 1993, the Higher Council decided that there must be a dialogue with Islamic figures [al-hasasiyat al-islamiyah] and the dialogue committee did in fact began contacts with the Islamic figures, both those outside and inside the detention camps. That is premature now [sentence as heard]. But with regard to the FLN and the Socialist Front, it appears that these fronts had concluded a power-sharing agreement before the December elections. Therefore, we see now that they do not want to participate in the dialogue, in the national conference, because they appear to already have an agreement and want to put the authority in a tight situation. As chairman of the Higher State Council, I personally wish and hope that they return to reason because the issue is not one of maneuvers at present. It is the issue of crisis. We did not hide this fact and said that it is a political crisis that has to be dealt with politically, that political solutions must be found for it, and that it is our hope to save the country from this crisis once and for all so that it will not recur after two, five, or 10 years. Therefore, when we opted for dialogue with all the partners, it was not a [word indistinct] but a strategic one. The objective is: first, to end the crisis in the country; second, to get the parties used to discussing with each other the country's affairs through dialogue and not through violence. Somebody might say that if these fronts do not attend the conference, then the dialogue would not have the desired importance. I reply that public opinion will be the judge. Are these fronts present in the field and do they control it or not? I say that Algerian society comprises a large number of parties and organizations and it is watching these parties' conduct and these parties' losses will be great because public opinion and history will judge them. That is why I hope that they will not place themselves before the court of history. [Zaytuni] Let us turn to the expression political families, which you mentioned in your speech yesterday. I very much liked the phrase because it reflects the nature of Algerian society, whose ethics reject violence and unethical practices, whether those carried out by some quarters in the Algerian streets such as political assassinations or by the authority's official stand vis-a-vis these quarters, such as the arrests at the detention camps in the desert. All these acts, be they torture or assassinations, do not conform to the ethics of Algerian society. The phrase political families reflects your position regarding party plurality in Algeria. You welcome pluralism, provided it serves the country. [Kafi] This is a many-sided question. I mentioned the phrase political families at a meeting with strugglers yesterday. We said let us meet with all parties that have similar views so that we can seek real solutions for getting the country out of the crisis. Thus, we extended....[sentence incomplete as heard]. I talked about this yesterday. Before we started the dialogue, the parties themselves were alienated from each other and were not in the habit of sitting down together to discuss national issues in a rational, calm, and methodical manner. So we got them used to sitting down together, and this is what I referred to yesterday as a major gain, because such alienation does not allow us to reach the desired solutions. So, when the parties got together, talked together, and exchanged opinions and counter opinions, this is the essence of democracy. We must sit down together and exchange views. Before, people used to hear about each other's views and each party refused the other's views. But when we meet, we may find something in common, particularly if your goal and mine regarding the national cause is sincere. This is what is talked about. As for the phenomenon of violence, it is true that it is alien to us. It does not belong to the Algerian society, nor does it belong to the Arab Maghreb community, as you know. This phenomenon is alien to our society, as I have previously mentioned in several speeches and even in my dialogue with the partners. This in fact is what is described as the Afghan phenomenon. In brief, in the 1948 war the Algerians went on foot to Palestine, where they saw the war there. When they heard about the Afghan people and watched the Jamal al-Din al-Afghani [19 Century political struggler in Egypt of Afghan origin] series on television -- as you know Algerians follow the news of great men in the Arab and Islamic worlds -- they went and volunteered. They [not further specified] picked them up from several areas -- some went to London and several other areas. After that, they all met in Peshawar, where they received advanced military training and joined the battle alongside the Afghan mojahedin against communism, at that time. When the communist bloc and the Soviet Union collapsed and the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan, the people who were supervising these groups let them go. Each one went his own way and started wreaking havoc in the world. Some of these groups are present here in Algeria. [Words indistinct] in Afghanistan and took part in the war in Afghanistan. Now, it is wreaking havoc here in Algeria, something which is truly alien to our society, our traditions, our upbringing, and the makeup of Algerian society. Thus, we believe that is an alien phenomenon. [Zaytuni] There is one point, Mr. Chairman. The people who have practiced and have chosen violence justify this by referring to the suspension of what is termed the election process and say that they had won the elections but the authorities prevented them from taking over. They have an argument with which to justify their actions. How do you view this argument? [Kafi] I do not talk about arguments. A person involved in politics has to behave politically. Violence must be rejected. They can attain power but not through violence. It is wrong for anyone to use violence because the election process was halted. It is wrong because, as I said before, one can contest the results. The elections were neither honest nor clean and the administration was weak and could not manage the elections and their process. But this cannot be used as an excuse to carry weapons against the society to which one belongs. Therefore, those who want to attain power -- and every party has this ambition to attain power.... [changes thought] But does one attain power with a program or with a gun? If with a program, then all the people and public opinion will be the judge. But with a gun, the people and public opinion could go along with you out of fear and not out of conviction. This argument is wrong. The dialogue within Algerian society, within the political family, must be political and calm. [Zaytuni] Mr. Chairman, let us leave the Algerian crisis after this superb analysis and touch on Algeria's foreign relations. Algeria will take over the chairmanship of the Arab Maghreb Union [AMU] at the beginning of next month. What issues or aspects will Algeria focus on achieving as chairman of this union, which appears to be suffering from some sort of stagnation? [Kafi] To say that the AMU is suffering from stagnation is correct. We wanted to deal with this situation and activate the member countries' dealings, both collectively and bilaterally, at the summit held in Nouakchott, Mauritania. But the number of those who attended it was insufficient. Morocco was represented by the prime minister and Libya by an ambassador. That was a summit. If we want to give substance to this union, then attendance must be at the required level. There are also some problems that could at present be an obstacle to progress and to what our peoples want from this union. The AMU must be moved to the position it deserves because all the other partners are waiting for this. When we draw a clearly defined strategy, then we would most certainly find a response and a desire for cooperation from others on an equal footing. But if each one continues to act unilaterally and uses the AMU just as a cover or an excuse but refrains from moving forward with it, then we would most certainly not attain the desired objective. Algeria is convinced of the collective action of the Arab Maghreb. The Algerian people, government, and establishments are convinced of this. We believe that the AMU is needed to strengthen the domestic situation in each country and to strengthen this union with these immense human, scientific, cultural, and economic strengths. There must be serious planning for this process. We cannot tolerate such a situation because of transient conditions that shake it and render it stagnant. Algeria believes in this union and we hope that when it takes over the chairmanship it will work seriously with all the comrades to ensure the success of the union. [Zaytuni] As a result of the rift in inter-Arab relations following the Gulf war, there are attempts to achieve inter-Arab reconciliation. What is Algeria's position on this issue? [Kafi] Although my meetings with Arab officials are few, because of the circumstances in Algeria and the fact that I do not leave the country much, I did meet with many Arab brothers at various levels, such as the Tunisian president and Egyptian President Brother Husni Mubarak in June and we touched on this issue. I even discussed this matter very frankly with Egyptian intellectuals during a seminar. We believe that the Gulf war happened and we should not say now who was wrong and who was right. It is something that happened in the past and caused a deep and wide rift among the Arab peoples and countries. We should go beyond this. Inter-Arab reconciliation is necessary if we are to place supreme Arab interests before other considerations. This is because the purpose of reconciliation is to close ranks, strengthen the negotiating power with the others, and bolster and deepen respect for the Arab world by others, particularly since we are going through a qualitative and unipolar world transitional period. All these factors make it incumbent upon us to get together and reconcile, because our interest lies in getting together. For us in Algeria, the Arab and Islamic world provides depth for us, and Algeria provides depth for the Arab and Islamic world. The same is true for us and Africa. All this should make us draft a well-defined strategy for reconciliation. Each of the parties concerned could make a concession so long as the ultimate objective is to serve the supreme interests of the Arab nation. [Zaytuni] Another issue in which Algeria has always played a pioneering role concerns Arab-Israeli peace as well as the Arab-Israeli conflict, which still exists. There are initiatives toward achieving some kind of peace between Israel and the Arab countries. How does Algeria view these current initiatives as well as the peace process in general? [Kafi] Algeria has a clear-cut policy regarding this issue. This issue has two dimensions. The first concerns the land occupied by Israel during the 1967 war which is claimed by its owners. Egypt regained its land. Syria is now negotiating to regain its land. Our position on this is that we always side with our brothers. We took part in the 1967 and 1973 wars alongside our brothers in Egypt. The second dimension concerns the Palestinians. Algeria has made its opinion clear to the PLO and to Palestinian President Brother Yasir 'Arafat when he talked to us before going to Washington to sign the agreement. He came here (?25) days before the agreement and told us. We do not want to be more Palestinian than the Palestinians. We support the Palestinians in whatever they chooses for themselves. However, we gave them our opinion, which is the essence of our experience from the liberation war. Thus, Algeria is involved in current Arab issues, whether through the Arab League or bilateral contacts, and is also concerned with regard to the Palestinians. However, it cannot help but back the opinion of the Palestinian officials as far as these issues are concerned. [Zaytuni] The last question, Mr. President, concerns you as president of the Republic. You assumed power under difficult security circumstances following the assassination of late President Mohamed Boudiaf, may God have mercy on his soul. Would you tell us about the most important decision you have made or position you have adopted during your term in office in the past two years? [Kafi] In fact, There are a number of actions and, occasionally, decisions that I made. I believe that settling the border issue between Algeria and Tunisia once and for all is one of the most important achievements. This is an example for any country that has border disputes. In addition, as you know, the Algerian economy was in a shambles. We made decisions to address it. We decided to adopt a market economy. We replaced a guided economy with a free economy. However, this system is being implemented step by step because we had grown accustomed to a certain course of action and now we have moved to another. We expected reactions or shakeups and were prepared to address them, particularly social upheavals that concern us very much. Dialogue was not part of our behavior and so we decided to pursue a policy of continuing dialogue in Algerian society. This is a civilized landmark which, if we continue and meet with success, God willing, it will be a pioneering experiment. [Zaytuni] Thank you very much, Mr. President. We wish you and Algeria success.
