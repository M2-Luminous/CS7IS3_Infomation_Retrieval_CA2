There must be no doubt about this. But if he overcomes this stage of foreign pressure he can be quite sure he will be successful." He explained that the lack of raw materials or qualified labor is not the investment problem in Cuba; it is the pressure that will be applied by U.S. businessmen. "For every 10 people who want to invest in Cuba, only two stay because he who believes he is the owner of the hemisphere and the world threatens the businessmen with ruining their businesses in other places," he said. Notwithstanding, he invited, as he has done in other South American countries, a group of Paraguayans to visit Cuba and learn about its reality, and where they will have the opportunity of talking with specialists in various sectors and thus observe what is occurring in Cuba. He also indicated that they will be able to speak with foreign businessmen who already have risked investing in the island so they can learn the truth. When he was asked whether trade would be difficult because Paraguay does not maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, he said no. "Diplomatic relations are not justified when the benefits do not reach the people. In that case it is much more convenient to have trade relations so we Cubans do not keep our products and so Latin America can sell us what we need," he said. As an example, he indicated that diplomatic relations with Colombia began through trade relations. Robaina concluded his unofficial visit to our country during the afternoon of 16 April. At 1530 he went to Silvio Pettirossi Airport to board a private plane, in which he arrived on 15 April, to fly to Posadas (Argentina)
