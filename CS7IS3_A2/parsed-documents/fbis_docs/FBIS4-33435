A Public Health Ministry report states that top priority is given to vaccinating children against tuberculosis, hepatitis-B, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, meningococcus groups B and C, mumps, German measles, measles, and typhus. These maladies cause a great number of deaths in underdeveloped countries, including Latin American countries, but in Cuba, with its prevention policies, a 95 percent rate of eradication among the country's children has been guaranteed. The system begins working immediately after the child is born, through tuberculosis and hepatitis B vaccinations; and when they are four weeks old children receive the polio vaccine, which is then reactivated in subsequent booster shots. Cuba produces the only effective meningococcus groups B and C vaccine in the world, as well as the tetanus toxin and vaccines intended to prevent typhoid and hepatitis B. The newspaper GRANMA reported today that a vaccine against leptospisarosis, as well as other vaccines designed to prevent various illnesses, is currently being clinically tested as part of the program that fully protects children and adults.
