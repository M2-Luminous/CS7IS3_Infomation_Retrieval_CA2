Helmueller and J. Siebenlist: "Positive Signal for Raw-Material Recycling"; Subheads: "Packaging Ordinance Amendment Should Continue To Expedite Waste Recycling"; "Planned Extension of Quota-Based Goals Allows Time for Creation of Industrial-Scale Recycling Capacity"] [Text]Duesseldorf, 18 February 1994 -- Federal environmental minister Prof. Klaus Toepfer intends to use a revised packaging ordinance to continue development of Germany's entry into recycling. In this context, at the Euroforum conference "The Dual System Facing Its Demise?!," recently in Duesseldorf, Dr. Thomas Rummler explained that the federal government wished to incorporate the experiences of the past two years into the ordinance's amendment. For, although in the view of the deputy department head in the Federal Environmental Ministry [BMU], there had been some problems in the initial phase, the present results demonstrated that something "had gotten off the ground" both in the avoidance and in the recycling of packaging. Marion Caspers-Merk, however, complains about the proposed bill for a new packaging ordinance: "What federal environmental minister Toepfer has proposed no longer has anything to do with ecological recycling." In the view of the deputy environmental-policy spokesperson for the German Socialist Party's [SPD] parliamentary group, the central thrust of the proposed changes is "to extend the deadlines, lower recycling quotas and allow access to the furnace in recycling." Therefore, it is not ecological necessity but economic wishfulness that is uppermost. The medium-sized business sector came to the conclusion from the disastrous development of Germany's Dual System [DSD] of fashioning an ecologically and economically optimized counter-bill. But instead of allowing the market even into the waste management sector and promoting the ordinance, the DSD continued to be defended. According to deputy ministerial head Thomas Rummler, the planned amendment to the new packaging ordinance will allow new chemical (raw material) recycling processes to be used for plastic packaging. The industry wants to have an annual recycling capacity of 190,000 t by 1995. Therefore the creation of investment security for raw-material recycling processes lies at the core of the respective bill. According to Rummler this should be achieved with the unambiguous conceptual definition. It was made clear that the raw-material recycling law could be realized not only using conventional recycling processes but also modern chemical recycling processes. The BMU representative opined: "This conceptual clarification will supply the indispensable investment security for firms that want to use the material properties of used plastics, for instance, in the process of hydrogenation or the production of steel." Petra Rob's judgment of Bonn's change of plans was: "We welcome the fact that the amending of the packaging ordinance redefines and unambiguously defines important concepts." Since, according to the spokesperson for the DSD GmbH, Bonn, raw-material recycling of plastic packaging, for example, through hydrogenation or pyrolysis would be explicitly recognized, industry would be given an important signal "to make the necessary billions in investments in modern recycling plants and technologies." The amendment bill also provides for packaging consisting of paper/pulp/cardboard, plastic or composite materials, a reduction of the recycling quotas as well as a deferral of the deadlines by which the quotas have to be met. As a result, the currently targeted recycling quota of 60 percent (64 percent up until now) for such retrievable packaging materials will have to be realized only by 1 January 1998 (up until now, 1 July 1995). According to Rummler this is needed to allow for the development of appropriate recycling capacities. Slight deviations in the quotas, nonetheless, have not led to any substantial changes. As Rummler states: "The pressure on the private sector to build large facilities for raw-material recycling is in no way diminished." This is highlighted not least by the fact that, in the case of plastics, half the recycling quota has to be ensured using material processes. But the amendment also makes it clear that effectively included amounts of packaging exceeding the required materials quotas could be recycled either in the form of matter or energy. However, this would require furnaces having at least a 75 percent efficiency factor.
