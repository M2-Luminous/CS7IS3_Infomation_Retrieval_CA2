Ossetia Ready for Talks LD1604212194 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 2032 GMT 16 Apr 94 LD1604212194 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] [Text] Vladikavkaz April 17 TASS -- "A way to accord between the peoples of North Ossetia and Ingushetia is hard, but we must move towards it," North Ossetia President Akhsarbek Galazov said. Addressing members of North Ossetia government and parliament leaders in Vladikavkaz on Saturday, Galazov spoke about the results of the second round of talks between the presidents and official delegations of North Ossetia and Ingushetia in Nalchik, capital of neighbouring Kabardino-Balkar Republic. Galazov said the talks were difficult and centered on the draft agreement on the principles, measures and terms of the implementation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decree establishing the procedure for returning refugees and displaced persons to North Ossetia and Ingushetia. Disagreements over who should control the disputed Prigorodny district were the "stumbling block" at the talks. North Ossetia claims the district is its integral part, while Ingushetia insists that the district belongs to it because it was inhabited by Ingushes before they were deported in 1944. Galasov stressed that "the question of border redrawing in the northern Caucasus must be removed from the agenda because territorial claims may lead to a new tragedy in Russia's south." The two republics will resume talks after April 25 when the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's new parliament, holds debates on the situation in the region and ways to stabilise it. The North Ossetian leader noted that the sides have reached "progress in normalising relations between the peoples of the two republics and dispelled pessimistic forecasts that the dialogue in Nalchik would end in a deadlock." "The leadership of North Ossetia is ready to carry out the decree of the Russian president," he said.
