Some of these countries -- Poland in particular -- have made no secret of their disappointment at the timidity of this initiative. Do you believe that this cooperation goes far enough or were you expecting more from the Atlantic alliance? [Zhelev] From the point of view of Bulgaria's national security, you cannot say that this initiative goes very far. Despite the statements by its senior officials on joint security, NATO gives no guarantees to the countries which adhere to this Partnership. It would be a different situation if we could institutionalize this process. However, this program does show NATO's desire to encourage the emergence of an open democratic system from which nobody is excluded. NATO -- and this is very positive -- has refused to divide the countries into different categories, such as the Visegrad group, the Balkan states, or the Baltic states. The Partnership gives an equal chance to all and allows each country to commit itself to the extent that its financial and moral resources will allow. It is a very realistic approach and it permits the necessary double adaptation: By the candidates prior to their final membership, and by NATO which must change from a military bloc facing an indistinct enemy into a collective security system, continental and Euro-Atlantic. [Van Velthem] How do you feel about Moscow's lack of enthusiasm for the project? [Zhelev] None of our countries need any longer fear Russian influence, the age of the Soviet empire is over. We are independent, sovereign states with an autonomous foreign policy, and nobody can determine our priorities for us. [Van Velthem] Doesn't the rise of the ultranationalist Zhirinovskiy worry you rather more? [Zhelev] Political developments in Russia itself could be cause for concern if revanchist elements were to become dominant, fuelled by reawakened imperialist ambitions which account for the rise of Zhirinovskiy. We expelled Zhirinovskiy for what he said in Sofia. This move itself demonstrates the total independence of our diplomacy, as does the recognition of Macedonia and Russia as independent states before the break-up of the USSR -- a move which in fact surprised our Western partners. [Van Velthem] What did you say to your NATO hosts concerning their recent ultimatum addressed to the Serbian forces in Bosnia? [Zhelev] I see this initiative as remaining within the framework of measures to achieve a peaceful settlement. It is the final stage in such a process and I hope the ultimatum will fully accomplish its role as a warning, without having to be implemented. The parties involved in the conflict and to whom it is addressed must clearly understand that NATO, in committing itself so categorically, cannot now turn back. It is up to them to make every effort to favor a diplomatic solution to the crisis. [Van Velthem] Bulgaria itself is suffering from the embargo on Serbia.... [Zhelev] This is true, we have suffered enormous financial losses due to the sanctions. More than the other neighboring countries -- with the exception of Macedonia -- as Bulgaria is the most isolated and all gateways to the West must pass through Serbia. This is why we have raised the matter of compensation, especially indirect compensation: The reevaluation of our foreign debt, investment aid, and funding for regional infrastructure projects in the communications and transport sectors. In particular the highway linking Istanbul and Sofia, via Skopje, to Italy. Or the highway between Salonica, Sofia, and the Bulgarian port of Vidin on the Danube. [Van Velthem] A motion of censure against the government -- which is accused of slowing down reforms -- has just been rejected in Sofia. Can Bulgaria afford a political crisis? [Zhelev] In Central Europe and the Balkans, crisis -- political and economic -- is always with us. It is the price we must pay for changing from one system to another. But there is no turning back. We should clearly distinguish between the restoration of communism, which is excluded, and the return to power of the former Communists, which is plausible. The essential thing is to continue with the reforms, the identity of those charged with the task is of secondary importance. Today, in East Europe and especially in Bulgaria, the former Communists of the nomenklatura -- who have money and key positions -- are becoming genuine capitalists. Sometimes even including certain groups which tend towards Mafia-like practices. [Van Velthem] You yourself have been accused of being a "neo-Communist" by your former friends, who are now in opposition.... [Zhelev] These are just arbitrary accusations. The only institution which guarantees stability, democratic change, and the dismantling of the communist system in Bulgaria is the presidency of the Republic. You need look no further to understand why it is criticized from all sides. But my training in philosophy allows me to remain calm in the face of such criticism.
