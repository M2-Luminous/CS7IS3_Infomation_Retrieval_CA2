Thus Finns' opinions on EU membership are taking the same direction as those of the Swedes and Norwegians. Opponents are, however, more clearly leading in those neighbor countries than in Finland. Commissioned by HELSINGIN SANOMAT, the Finnish Gallup Company polled Finns over a period of a year and a half for their views on membership. The same question we are asking was used throughout that period: Should Finland join the European Community (EC) as a full member or stay out of it? The designation EC was also still used during a poll conducted in November. In early November the Community became the EU. The most recent poll was conducted between 15 and 26 November. A total of 951 persons were interviewed. They were selected with a divided sampling to represent the voting age population outside of Aland. Scales Tipped First, preliminary guesses as to the EU Commission's position on Finland's goals for agriculture appeared in the media while the interviews were being conducted, and at the end of that period Brussels made public the Commission's views on the matter. The Commission's opinion was viewed as unfavorable for Finland in the press. We may assume that the public debate on agriculture most clearly influenced the fact that the number of opponents of membership has risen to become greater than the number of supporters, and the situation that prevailed up to now has been reversed. Absolutely final conclusions on the November poll cannot be drawn yet. The difference between the number of supporters and opponents is only 5 percentage points and the statistical margin for error for the results of both polls is about plus or minus 3 percentage points. Therefore, in reality there may also be just as many supporters as opponents. Many Still Uncertain The trend during the year and a half polling period was, nevertheless, fairly clear-cut: The number of supporters of membership was declining. The number of opponents was not increasing as clearly, but there are more opponents now than ever before. As the fall wore on, many people became uncertain of where they stood on the issue: In November, one out of every four could not say how he felt about it. Men are still a bit more eager to join the EU than women. Young people support membership more than adults do: While half of those under 25 feel Finland should join the EU, only 25 percent of those who have reached pension age do. Support for membership was strongest among Conservative voters, university educated people, and residents of the capital district. The same kind of situation existed in November, too. Enthusiasm for the EU has indeed declined in southern Finland. In November, 65 percent of all farmers opposed EU membership; 11 percent of the farmers declared themselves to be supporters. There were clearly more opponents among workers than supporters.
