It should be clearly asserted that this is not the case. The United States has placed Cuba under a trade boycott, thus severing all U.S. trade relations with this island. In the eyes of any stalwart supporter of Castro's regime, this ought to be simply a welcome gesture of consistency on the part of the United States." This remark is really surprising, particularly considering that in 1992 and again in 1993 the UN General Assembly approved important resolutions on the "need to end the economic, commercial, and financial blockade imposed by the United States against Cuba," by an overwhelming majority that included Uruguay's vote. The blockade also has been condemned by the Nonaligned Countries Movement, the Ibero-American summit meeting in Bahia, UNESCO, and many other international organizations and events. Cuba has submitted numerous proofs of the extraterritorial nature of the blockade, that is, on the obstinate manner in which the United States violates international law and the freedom of trade it pretends to impose worldwide. This evidence shows how successive U.S. administrations placed obstacles and tried to prevent other countries from trading or carrying out financial operations with the island. The United States used pressure and threats--such as the exclusion of those countries from U.S. trade and financing programs, the suspension of U.S. credits, the blockade of assistance by international financial organizations, and the prohibition to export and import products to and from the United States, etc.--to hinder trade with Cuba. Today Cuba is introducing important economic changes and is opening its doors to foreign investors, but eight of every 10 individuals interested in doing mutually profitable business with Cuban companies withdraw due to threats and pressures against them. There are many other aberrant elements in the blockade, such as the U.S. prohibition to import goods containing even the most minimal quantity of Cuban components or raw materials, or the prohibition affecting companies of any country from exporting goods to Cuba containing U.S. components or raw materials. This is a particularly sensitive point because it includes medicine and food. The United States also prevents the main international financial institutions--such as the IMF, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--from granting loans and assistance to Cuba. If this were not enough, when socialism collapsed in East Europe Cuba suddenly lost 85 percent of its economic and trade partners, but the United States strengthened its blockade and broadened the blockade's international application with the sadly known Torricelli Law forbidding U.S. subsidiaries around the world from trading with Cuba. The law also gives powers to the president to impose sanctions on any country giving assistance to Cuba and forbidding ships that trade with the island from entering U.S. ports. These extraterritorial demands are so grotesque that the EC and Canada, among other countries, rejected them vigorously. I did not want to refer to the blockade's effect on my people. It has caused us damage estimated at more than $40 billion and provoked great scarcities and suffering, thus revealing its criminal, cruel, and inhuman nature. But what offends Cubans most is that it is unfair, illegal, immoral, and unjustifiable because it pursues the objective of isolating Cuba, obtaining its surrender by hunger, and imposing on her the political, social, and economic order that U.S. authorities consider most adequate and convenient to their interests.
