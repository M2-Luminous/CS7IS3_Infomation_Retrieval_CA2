The circular urges all localities and departments, in conjunction with the current anticorruption drive, to use the case of Liu Qingfang's expulsion from the party on account of his mistakes in accepting gift money and using it for his mother's ostentatious funeral, to conduct education in party style and discipline among the large numbers of party members and cadres, and to enhance their party spirit and awareness, and their sense of organizational discipline, integrity, and self-discipline. The circular says: The expulsion of Liu Qingfang, a leading county cadre, from the party for serious violation of discipline, has once again admonished us that: 1) Communist party members, and leading cadres at all levels in particular, must constantly temper their party spirit, adhere to the proletarian outlook on life and sense of value, constantly bear in mind the party's objective of serving the people wholeheartedly, be strict with themselves, and honestly perform their duties. Only by doing so can they stand the tests of governing, reform, and opening up; and forever retain political integrity. 2) The party's leading cadres at all levels must set an example in maintaining integrity and self-discipline. The case of Liu Qingfang and other cases of violation of law and discipline show that failure in self-discipline often leads to corruption. Corruption, if unchecked, not only harms the culprits themselves but also corrupts the party and blemishes its image. It will also bring calamity to the country and the people, and sow the seeds of trouble in the future if it is allowed to spread. Therefore, leading cadres must take the lead in maintaining integrity and self-discipline and guard against becoming greedy, abusing power, trading power for money, and using their position for personal gain. This is an essential requirement and important safeguard in consolidating the party's ruling status, developing the economy, promoting reform, and building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party organizations and leading cadres at all levels must be clearly aware of this. 3) Leading cadres must earnestly practice what they advocate, and they must promote new social ethics. Our party has time and again stressed that socialism with Chinese characteristics incorporates both material and spiritual civilizations. An important responsibility of all leading cadres is to work hard to build socialist spiritual civilization; foster new social ethics; break away from corrupt customs; and firmly resist the inroads of capitalist and feudalist ideas in the course of promoting economic construction. In the new situation of reform and opening up and vigorous development of a socialist market economy, the vast numbers of party members and cadres should not only maintain integrity and self-discipline but should also take the lead in promoting healthy practices and eliminating evil practices. They should correctly guide and lead the broad masses in fostering new social ethics and improving local atmosphere to create a favorable social environment for reform, opening, and economic construction. The CPC Central Committee Discipline Inspection Commission transmitted the notice issued by the Hebei provincial party committee Discipline Inspection Commission on the mistakes made by the former Lingshou County secretary, Liu Qingfang. [passage omitted] The notice issued by the Hebei provincial party committee discipline inspection commission points out: As a leading party cadre, Liu Qingfang should have observed party discipline and maintained integrity in an exemplary way. Instead, to hold a funeral ceremony for his mother in an extravagant way, he accepted gifts of large amounts of money, used his position to take bribes, and infringed on the economic interests of the state and collective. His acts seriously violated party discipline and created a very bad influence among the masses. In light of this, the Hebei provincial party committee has decided to expel him from the party.
