Security Council resolution on sanctions against North Korea was proceeding unsatisfactorily. He also expressed surprise that the U.S. had circulated its own draft resolution which contains a list of sanctions against North Korea. He said that this resolution went against the agreement on joint work, reached during recent telephone conversations between Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin. This plan was also confirmed during a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, said Kozyrev. "We decided to work together on a resolution that would provide for sanctions on the one hand, and for an international conference on the North Korean problem on the other," he went on to say. "We also agreed not to advance unilateral initiatives," he said. The American diplomats' moves complicate the solution of the problem, said Kozyrev. "We shall not support sanctions which have not been discussed with us. This will complicate the work of the Security Council," he added. He announced that Russia had confidentially sent Americans its own ideas on the draft resolution which attached equal importance to sanctions and the international conference. Kozyrev also told Interfax that during a telephone conversation with Christopher, he named a date for a meeting in accordance with the agreement reached between the Russian and American presidents. "Christopher will respond. I'm ready to meet with him at any convenient time," said Kozyrev.
