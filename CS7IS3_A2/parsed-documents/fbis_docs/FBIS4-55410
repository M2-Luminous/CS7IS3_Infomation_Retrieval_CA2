"This, after all, has been or own proposal for a long time. But we are in favour of a permanent cessation of hostilities, not merely for four months," stressed Zametica in a statement faxed to TANJUG's Belgrade office from the cabinet of Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic. "The time limit on the cessation of hostilities envisaged in the joint declaration is harmful to the peace process," maintains Zametica. The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, Great Britain, France and the European Union's "troika" (Belgium, Greece, Germany) on Friday invited Bosnia's warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats to agree to a four-month ceasefire, "with provision for extenscon," in which to negotiate a solution to their disputes. The ministers, who coordinated a common strategy in the efforts to end the Bosnian conflict, invited the warring nations to make a serious effort, without prior conditions, for reaching a political settlement of the crisis. The ministers approved the European Union's formula which envisages for dividing war-shattered Bosnia-Herzegovina in a manner which would give the Moslems and Croats 51 percent of the original territory in which to form their federation, and the Serbs the remaining 49 percent.
