Some of our 72 recommendations must be implemented immediately." This is how Austrian physicist Wolfgang Kromp summarizes the contents of the study by Austrian, Hungarian, Italian, Croatian, and Slovene experts, presented in Ljubljana on Wednesday [5 January] together with two other studies. Krsko is only 80 km from the Austrian border. These are some of the experts' most urgent recommendations: - An immediate replacement of the brittle steam generators: Radioactive water is channeled through them to warm "clean" water for the steam turbines. Many of the pipes have cracks. If there is a leak, radioactivity will be released. At the same time, problems with draining the heat could lead to the reactor overheating. - Better protection against fires, greater powers for the security authorities. - Precise research into the danger of an earthquake in this seismically active zone as well as measures to improve the power plant's immunity from earthquakes. - Better protection of the power plant from the war in Bosnia. Kromp: "Improving Krsko will cost billions and billions. A small country like Slovenia should think about whether it is not more economical to close down the plant." However, this is not a topic for Slovene Environment Minister Miha Jazbinsek. "There will be no early closure." He can envisage an increase in the price of electricity to finance the measures. Says Styrian nuclear spokesman Candidus Cortolezis: "Austria will have to offer financial aid for closing down the plant." A similar demand is made by Greens nuclear spokesman Rudi Anschober. The Styrian research society "Joanneum Research" has already carried out studies on gradual closure and conversion. Cortolezis: "However, this alone is not sufficient." If nothing is done, the accidents will continue. The latest one, a defect in the electronic equipment, occurred on 26 November 1993. At the moment the fuel elements are being replaced, which will take until 12 January.
