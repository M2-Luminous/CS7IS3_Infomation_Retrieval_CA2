But through patience and determination, they mobilized themselves for the pursuit of the democratic process that saw the adoption of a new constitution and the holding of presidential and legislative elections. According to the official results of the legislative elections proclaimed on 14 March, two political parties, namely the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD], won parliamentary majority at the National Assembly. In conformity with the provisions of Article 66 of the Constitution, the head of state should have named a prime minister from within this majority in line with the Constitution. But the head of state, out of his concern to demonstrate his clearly expressed desire on the eve of the elections to set up a broad-based national government whatever the elections results may be, decided to hold prior consultations with political party leaders. He, therefore, received the CAR and UTD leaders on two occasions. Unfortunately, after meeting on two occasions with the two leaders accompanied by officials of their parties and after two other private meetings with these leaders, no consensus was reached because the two party leaders have not been able to reach an agreement. However, out of his regard for the deep aspirations of the people and, in particular, out of his concern to avoid the baneful consequences of a policy of exclusion, the head of state is relentlessly continuing his consultations with the CAR and UTD chairmen. He has already accepted the resignation of the transitional government, which he has asked to expedite pending matters. Meanwhile, the people, who are deeply affected, are waiting for the setting up of the new government team so that they can resume their political, economic, and social activities as soon as possible with more confidence and in full force. For this reason and in the supreme interest of the nation, the head of state is making an urgent appeal to the leaders of the two political parties to meet the people's expectations.
