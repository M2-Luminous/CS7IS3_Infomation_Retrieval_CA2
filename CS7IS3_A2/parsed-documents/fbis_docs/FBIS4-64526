This was announced in Bonn today by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Kinkel pointed out that the Federal Defense Ministry has evaluated the photographs given to the Foreign Ministry "as proof of Turkey's use of weapons and equipment from military aid programs contrary to the terms of the agreement." The result is that "use contrary to the terms of the agreement cannot be proved on the basis of the photographs." The German Government has therefore decided to resume the deliveries to Turkey as stipulated in the agreements on NATO defense aid, material aid, and special arms aid.
