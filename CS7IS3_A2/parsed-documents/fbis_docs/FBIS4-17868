Informing journalists on the meeting, head of the council's press centre Yuriy Algunov said that in Guliyev's opinion "nobody needed the continuation of the Karabakh conflict". He said that the war was lately receding, but it was a very slow process. Informing the guest on the work of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, Shumeyko noted that there were several views on the status of the Council of the Federation. Some people believe the council should be a buffer between the president and the State Duma. Shumeyko stressed in this connection that the "legislative power has never been nor will be a buffer". Shumeyko, who is also chairman of the Council of the CIS Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, dwelt on the role of parliaments in the effort to integrate the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). He noted that the former Soviet republics had many common interests. The problem is to "find optimal ways for their rapprochement without harming their sovereignty".
