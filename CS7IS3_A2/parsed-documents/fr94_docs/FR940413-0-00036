FR940413-0-00036 FR940413-0-00007 Example 10. Beauty Limited of Montreal, Quebec, sells a shipment of cosmetics to Total Woman, Inc. (a U.S. company) in care of (c/o) Unique Image of Albany, New York. There is no address listed on the invoice for the buyer, Total Woman, Inc. The ultimate consignee in this case is Total Woman, Inc., which is the buyer in this transaction. Its name and address must therefore be included on the Customs entry or release documents. Example 11. Spring Water Company of Los Angeles purchases a load of bottled water from Healthy Water Limited of Calgary, Alberta. The address of Spring Water Company is listed as a post office box in Los Angeles. The water is shipped to Ralph's Grocery Store on Sepulveda Boulevard in Los Angeles. The ultimate consignee is Spring Water Company of Los Angeles as the U.S. buyer of the water, regardless of the fact that its address shows a post office box. Example 12. FTX Company in Mexico City ships a load of door knobs to the Rio Company in El Paso, Texas. There are no other parties located in the U.S. shown on the invoice. The Rio Company should be shown on the entry or release documents in accordance with §142.3(a)(6) since there is no known buyer of the merchandise at the time of its importation and those are the premises in the U.S. to which the imported goods are being delivered. However, if there is a known buyer that name must be used. Example 13. ABC Garments of Edmonton, Alberta, manufactures children's clothing and sells to small boutiques in the U.S. These boutiques place orders (usually small) with ABC Garments which will accumulate a number of orders before sending them as a consolidated shipment with their customhouse broker listed as consignee. Although §141.51, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.51), allows all merchandise arriving on one vessel and consigned to one consignee (in this case, the broker) to be included in one entry, the ultimate consignee ( i.e. , the person to whom the merchandise is sold) for each shipment in the consolidated entry must be provided to Customs in accordance with §§141.86(a)(2) and 142.3(a)(6), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.86(a)(2) and 142.3(a)(6)). Furthermore, pursuant to §§24.5(a) and 142.3(a)(6), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 24.5(a) and 142.3(a)(6)), a Customs Form 5106 would also have to be filed for each ultimate consignee for which entry is made. Example 14. Through Quicksilver Delivery, an international courier company, Just Fabrics, Limited, of Montreal, ships a parcel of fabric cuttings to Dresses-Are-Us in London, England. Dresses-Are-Us is listed as the destination party on the invoice. After Customs clearance, the parcel is forwarded to England by A&hyph;1 Freight Forwarders of Buffalo, New York. Because there is no known buyer in the U.S., A&hyph;1 Freight Forwarders in Buffalo, New York, should be shown on the entry or release documents in accordance with §142.3(a)(6), since theirs are the premises in the U.S. to which the merchandise is to be delivered before being forwarded to England. Example 15. Top Hat, Ltd., ships twenty orders of clothing accessories on individual bills of lading to various consignees. The entire shipment is included on a master bill of lading designating a customs broker as consignee. One entry would be filed in this situation in accordance with §141.51, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.51). Although the broker listed as consignee on the master bill of lading may be the importer of record, tariff-line items would designate the individual ultimate consignees. Ultimately, all twenty ultimate consignees would be listed on the entry. Some line items may be repeated for more than one ultimate consignee.
