FR940926-0-00027 FR940926-0-00009 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 73 [MM Docket No. 91&hyph;140; DA 94&hyph;1013] Revision of Radio Rules and Policies agency: Federal Communications Commission. action: Final rule; correction of rule and confirmation of effective date. summary: This Order confirms that the stay of certain changes to the FCC's multiple ownership rule was lifted on September 16, 1992, and reprints the corrected rule in its entirety. The Mass Media Bureau takes this action to ensure that the correct version of the rule is printed in the Code of Federal Regulations. Because the stay was lifted in an ordering clause to a Commission document but not in the Federal Register summary associated with that document, the lifting of the stay was not recognized by the Federal Register. As a result, the rule is currently printed in the Code of Federal Regulations as if the stay was still in effect. This Order is intended solely to correct the outdated version of the multiple ownership rule; no substantive rule changes have been made. effective date: September 26, 1994. for further information contact: Jane Hinckley Halprin, Mass Media Bureau, Policy and Rules Division, (202) 632&hyph;7792. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Order Adopted: September 15, 1994 Released: September 19, 1994 In the Matter of: Revision of Radio Rules and Policies. By the Acting Chief, Mass Media Bureau: 1. In its Report and Order in MM Docket No. 91&hyph;140, 7 FCC Rcd 2755 (1992), 57 FR 18089 (April 29, 1992), the Commission amended 47 CFR 73.3555. The effective date of the changes adopted in the Report and Order was subsequently deferred pending resolution of petitions for reconsideration. Order Deferring Effective Date in MM Docket No. 91&hyph;140, FCC 92&hyph;351 (released July 30, 1992), 57 FR 35763 (Aug. 11, 1992). The stay of the effective date was lifted by Memorandum Opinion and Order in MM Docket No. 91&hyph;140, 7 FCC Rcd 6387 (1992), 57 FR 42701 (September 16, 1992). Because the stay was lifted in an ordering clause to the document rather than in the Appendix that contained the modified rules, the lifting of the stay was not picked up by the Federal Register. As a result, the rule is currently printed in the Code of Federal Regulations as if the stay was still in effect. 2. This Order is intended solely to correct the outdated version of Section 73.3555 currently printed in the Code of Federal Regulations. No substantive changes have been made to the rules; notice and comment are therefore unnecessary. See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3). The correct version of ยง73.3555 is printed in its entirety below. 3. Accordingly, it is ordered that 47 CFR ยง73.3555 is amended as set forth below. List of Subjects in 47 CFR Part 73 Radio broadcasting. Federal Communications Commission.
