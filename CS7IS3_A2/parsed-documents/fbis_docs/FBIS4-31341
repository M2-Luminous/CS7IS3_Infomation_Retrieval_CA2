FBIS4-31341 "dreeu110__a94022" FBIS-EEU-94-110-A Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Council Approves Amendment to Election Law Council Approves Amendment to Election Law AU0706213594 Prague CTK in English 1921 GMT 7 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0706213594 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava June 7 (CTK) -- The Slovak parliament today passed an amendment to the Election Law with 69 deputies of those present voting for the law, 51 deputies against it and 2 deputies abstaining from the vote. The amendment does not change the basic provisions of the federal Election Law which has thus far been valid in Slovakia. For example, it preserves the requirement of 5 percent public support for a party and 7 percent for a coalition to enter parliament. The government coalition prevented the inclusion of a provision into the amendment according to which parties' lists of candidates should be sent to voters three days before elections as this would create the danger of manipulation. Parties' slates will be available at election rooms and only information about candidates will be sent to voters. The amended Election Law was passed in something of a hurry as can be seen from the fact that an hour's break was taken before the final vote during which the parliament leadership looked for ways to replace "Czechoslovak Republic" into "Slovak Republic" in the law. The amendment does not allow election campaigning on commercial radio stations. Deputy Pavel Hrusovsky from the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) said that the amended law did not give an unambiguous answer to whether a Slovak citizen living abroad can vote in Slovakia. The contradiction between the provision which allows voting only by citizens with permanent residence in the Slovak Republic and that which allows voting by citizens without permanent residence in Slovakia will apparently be solved only by the Interior Ministry or an election commission. "Slovak citizens with permanent residence in the Czech Republic could be stripped of their active voting rights," Hrusovsky told CTK. However, other deputies believe that it will be enough for a Slovak citizen living in the Czech Republic just to come to Slovakia during the election to be able to vote. The amendment sets down that parties that receive at least 3 percent of voters support will get from the state 60 crowns for each voter instead of the initial 15 crowns.
