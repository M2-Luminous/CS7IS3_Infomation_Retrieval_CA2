Estonia, he said, does not implement its statement made at the 14th round of the Russo-Estonian talks as regards the draft agreement on social protection of military pensioners and members of their families. Russia wants all retired ex-Soviet servicemen to be granted permanent resident status which is rejected by Estonia. Besides, the Russian side has not yet received the confirmation that Estonia will allocate financial means for building housing in Russia for servicemen of the Russian troops to be withdrawn. "Taking into consideration an Estonian side's actual refusal to fulfill the promises earlier given by it, which served the basis for Russia's proposal about August 31, 1994 as a final date of the withdrawal, the Russian side states that its troops pullout will be implemented according to the timetable worked out by Russia," Vasiliy Svirin stressed. The problem of territorial claims, he noted, is raised practically at each round of the Russo-Estonian talks and causes certain tension. However, this problem has no direct influence on the talks on the troops withdrawal and the condition of military pensioners. "We have never linked a troops pullout to any other problems, but at the 17th round of the talks the Estonian side suddenly stated that it invited Russia to The Hague International Court to determine the legality of the established borders. Moscow is guided in this issue, the Russian side replied, by the United Nations Charter which legalized the inviolability of frontiers in Europe, as well as by other international and legal documents to which Estonia also became a party", the representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry emphasized.
