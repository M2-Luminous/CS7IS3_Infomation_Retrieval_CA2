Sources close to the army said, however, because the value of the targeted imports was no more than U.S.$200 million (HK$1.5-billion [Hong Kong dollars] ) the PLA would be relatively restrained in making public protests. Moreover, the PLA is still hopeful of the resumption of full ties between the Chinese and the American armies, which would enable China to import technology with military applications. Diplomatic sources said the ban should not jeopardise the first steps that had been taken earlier this year towards the partial resumption of military links. Chinese Vice-Chief of Staff General Xu Huizi is still expected to visit the U.S. in the summer, when he will probably look at military-related technology. The sources said that if the American army proved amenable to upgrading military relations, Beijing would not play up the just-announced ban. [passage omitted]
