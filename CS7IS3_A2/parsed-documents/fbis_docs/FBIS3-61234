Representatives of collectives of enterprises, directors (managers), and owners assembled--all those who are engaged in the sphere of goods production, regardless of form of ownership and type of economic activity. Established in 1992 by the Association of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Russia, the Agrarian Union of the country, the League of Assistance to Defense Enterprises, the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and the Russian Union of Workers Collectives, the FTR today, undoubtedly, not without the energetic efforts of Yuriy Skokov, its leader, represents the interests of the federal, republic, regional, kray, and oblast branches of unions of goods producers, which united, as the congress showed, by no means for the sake of selfish opposition as such. Their unification was prompted by the policy of the present government, expressed in a reprisal against national industry, which, in the opinion of congress participants and the leadership, does not at all appear to be a mandatory and necessary victim for a country that has taken the path of political and economic reformation. Not denying the need for economic transformations, the congress of goods producers evaluated the path of economic reforms in Russia in its own way. As was obvious from the report of FTR Chairman Yu. Skokov, there were in fact none. The political reforms absorbed everything, for which there was a consistent need for the president, people's deputies, and parliament... Meanwhile, an analysis of the state of the economy of Russia based on the results of the year presented to the congress by FTR experts shows that the drop in domestic production, without which the preservation and strengthening of Russian statehood is inconceivable, exceeded the planned level by more than a factor of two. The FTR chairman cited figures: the national food basket, consisting of 19 (!) descriptions of goods (for comparison, it is made up of 300 paragraphs in the United States), is applicable to only 30 percent of the population of Russia. The growth in unemployment is indicated by the 2,400 plants in this country that died out this year. Against the background of general instability of economic life and administration, there is a continuing flow of a significant part of our national wealth abroad, and the export of capital from the country in legal and illegal form amounted to $12-15 billion this year. An economic and legal environment that is hostile to native goods production, whose direct result was the disruption of economic relations and a reduction in the volume of products, created such conditions that it simply became unprofitable to work. Thus, in branches that determine the competitiveness of the Russian economy (electronics, electronic equipment, and instrumentation) in the last three years the output of products has dropped by more than 40 percent, which indicates that a process of the deindustrialization of the country is beginning. In the meantime, the congress of goods producers of Russia (not anticipating tangible progress for the better, not only in the first quarter but also in the first half of 1994, when, in the opinion of FTR experts, there will continue to be a further listless decline in production, inflation in costs in connection with continuous price increases for energy sources and agricultural raw materials, an increase in transport rates and wages, mutual indebtedness of enterprises, and the depreciation of money), is coming out in support of signing agreements with the government of the Russian Federation and organs of authority of the components of the Federation concerning a qualitatively new system of mutual relations that regulates the procedure of implementing the stages for conducting economic transformations. In the FTR's opinion, the state should guarantee the native goods producer the unconditional right to direct participation in determining the strategy of development of the national economy and in legislative initiatives on questions of goods production and expert analysis of all normative acts at the federal and regional level in this sphere. Arkadiy Volskiy, chairman of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Russia and leader of the Civic Union, remarked in his speech to the congress that goods producers can credit themselves with the fact that the government, which until recently demonstratively had withdrawn from tasks of support of domestic production, today agrees with the need to regulate the economy of the country. However, the present state of Russian industry, the FTR leadership thinks, will not permit restriction to "consultations" with the government. Correctly relying on the intellectual and production potential of the regions, and also emphasizing the cementing role of the "class" of goods producers in the regional policy of the state, the FTR chairman sees the Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES), the Agrarian Party, and the Women of Russia Movement as possible and real allies in the federal organs of power who could be interested in supporting domestic goods producers. It is obvious that the representation of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Russia in federal organs of authority by one plant director can hardly be adequate for an expression of the interests of a multimillion-strong social group. But the question of the political formation of a movement of goods producers, as the FTR leader let it be known, is not yet urgent. Today, Yuriy Skokov believes, it is far more important to conduct a staged restructuring of the economy of Russia that is as painless as possible for the population, and which, in spite of everything, the FTR leader sees in the future as being among the first in the world.
