This is because LDP President Yohei Kono has declared his candidacy for the premiership while some LDP members are prepared to leave the party. Junior LDP members who advocate reform of the electoral system are "expected to leave the LDP." According to a senior official of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], they are divided into two groups--"one backing Shinseito and the other supporting Sakigake [Harbinger]." Shinseito feels that if it can lure them into the ruling coalition, this will serve as a restraining influence against Sakigake, which has hinted leaving the cabinet. Shinseito is also gradually leaning to the idea that it is necessary for the ruling parties to select the new prime minister while keeping the current ruling coalition framework in tact. However, because it is thought the LDP may split into three groups--one supporting Kono, one backing former LDP Vice President and Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, and the other advocating reform of the electoral system--Shinseito is carefully watching moves within the LDP. Appearing on a Fuji TV program on 12 April, Shinseito Acting Chief Secretary Kozo Watanabe said: "The ruling parties worked together to compile the budget. While maintaining a cooperative framework, we should choose an appropriate person." He added: "We will not refuse to accept those who wish to join us." Thus, Watanabe expressed the hope that the ruling coalition would maintain the current framework and invite LDP members to join the coalition. As its basic strategy, Shinseito aims for the splintering of the LDP. Thus, it will be desirable for the party if the LDP is thrown into confusion as a result of strife between Kono and Watanabe over the candidacy for the premiership, as well as the breakaway of a pro-electoral reform group. Senior Shinseito officials have continuously hinted the party may form an alliance with the LDP's Watanabe. Behind this move lies Shinseito's expectation that the alliance will work as an effective "trump card" to oust leftwing members of the SDPJ from the ruling coalition. SDPJ left-wingers are feared as a stumbling block to future political operations. According to a senior Shinseito official, many Shinseito members still believe that even if Watanabe leaves the LDP, "only 30 or so LDP members will follow him, and this is not enough." A Shinseito Diet member who works as liaison between Watanabe and Shinseito Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa said on 12 April that it was unlikely Watanabe would leave the LDP to form a large political party which can replace the SDPJ in the ruling coalition. Nevertheless, if conditions are created under which it is possible to change the framework of the ruling coalition, this will make it easier for SDPJ members to agree to maintain the current framework. If the ruling coalition decides to choose the new prime minister under the current framework, Shinseito co-leader Tsutomu Hata (deputy prime minister and foreign minister) will be the most likely candidate because of his career. It seems Shinseito has intentionally hinted at forming an alliance with Watanabe to prepare for full-scale negotiations within the ruling coalition over the selection of a candidate.
