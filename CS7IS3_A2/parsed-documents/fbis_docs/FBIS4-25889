At a recent seminar organized by China Financial Times on the issue, government officials, financial experts and businessmen concluded that the solution depends on changing the way State enterprises operate. Bank loans have been the main support behind enterprises' operations ever since the government stopped earmarking working capital, according to China Financial Times. Most enterprises accumulate little for working capital. Nationwide, the average percentage of enterprises with self-supplied funds for working capital fell from 25 percent in 1984 to only 7 percent last year. For normal operations, an enterprise should generate at least 30 percent of its working capital, according to Liu Zigang, an official with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). When bank loans are in short supply, such enterprises experience hard times. It is a heavy burden for the banks to provide large amounts of working capital for enterprises. According to Liu, ICBC provides 80 percent of the working capital extended by financial organization. In 1992, the bank's loans for working capital rose by 67.2 billion yuan ($7.7 billion) compared with the previous year. Last year, it rose by 1O2.4 billion yuan ($11.8 billion). By the end of this April, the increase totalled 20.3 billion yuan ($2.3 billion), 10.3 billion ($1.2 billion) more than in the same period last year. But the demand for working capital rises even more rapidly. Inflation has caused increases in the enterprises' production costs, so demand increased for working capital. Chain debts also take a large part of the enterprises' working capital. Large uncollected accounts at many firms force them to delay payments to their own creditors. During the first quarter of this year, the total owed by the 40,000 enterprises which have accounts at the Industrial and Commercial Bank increased by more than 40 billion yuan ($4.6 billion), compared with the same period last year, according to Liu. Many enterprises have not invested enough for their construction projects, so funds earmarked for working capital usually are diverted to fixed assets to pay for the con struction. For construction completed between 1992 and 1993, diverted funds totalled at least 67 billion yuan ($7.7 billion ). According to Su Zongguo, an official with the State Economy and Trade Commission (SETC), there will be a gap of at least 50 billion yuan ($5.75 billion) between demand and supply for working capital required by industrial enteprises this year. Because of this shortage, many enterprises may have strong sales, but lack funds to purchase raw materials to produce more goods. The government has decided to adopt different measures to solve the problem. Major enterprises with bright prospects that have used their capital properly will be assured of government support. Enterprises in poor financial shape but striving to improve their operations will receive loans. Enterprises considered hopeless will be allowed to go bankrupt. To do this, it is essential to categorize enterprises with great care, says Hu Huanxin from the Agricultural Bank of China. The total investment in fixed assets should be firmly controlled, said Su. New projects should only be approved after they have raised enough funds so that no working capital will be diverted. Chain debts will be monitored by the SETC to free working capital. Analysis has already begun with major industrial enterprises that work with raw materials, power, and machinery. The enterprises' reliance on bank loans should be reduced through an increase in self-supplied working capital, said Liu Zigang. And the State should increase investments in major industrial enterprises through lower tax rates, and tax rebates. Banks should set aside loans to be used exclusively as working capital. Sales income from enterprises should be placed in banks' special accounts and earmarked for use as working capital. Supervision of bank loans to be used for working capital should be strengthened through a regulatory system, so that these funds could be used more efficiently. This can be one way to ease the shortage of working capital, suggests Yao Jiqi from the Bank of China. Within the corporate system, government enterprises now can raise money by issuing stocks and bonds. To help transform their operations, the SETC has started to experiment with more than 10,000 enterprises in 10 cities. The results will be reviewed at the end of the Eighth Five-Year period (1991-95).
