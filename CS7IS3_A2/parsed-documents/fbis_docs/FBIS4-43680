One cannot isolate Franz Schoenhuber as chairman of the Republikaner if other standards are applied to the PDS, Waigel said at the beginning of the annual conference of the chairmen of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/CSU Bundestag Group in Weimar on Monday [20 June]. On 12 June, the successor party of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany established itself as the third political power in the new laender and gained between 15 and above 20 percent of the votes. Waigel now calls for an increased confrontation with the parties on the left and the right fringe. The FRG finance minister assessed as a good sign the fact that, for the first time, the new laender's need for transfer payments will not further increase next year. In the first quarter of this year, a growth rate of 10 percent was achieved in eastern Germany. It still cannot be said how long the recovery process will take. However, the upswing has obviously begun, he said.
