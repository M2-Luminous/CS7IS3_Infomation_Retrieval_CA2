In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Mikhail Umanets, chairman of the Ukrainian State Committee for Nuclear Power Engineering, said that Ukraine is ready to shut down the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in return for financial assistance. A Ukrainian governmental delegation met with a group of G-7 officials in Kiev today to discuss the issue. The Ukrainian side said it needs over 3 billion U.S. dollars to go ahead with the plan of closure. However, there has been no response from G-7 officials yet, Umanets said. He said that the matter has been handed over to a special working group set up today. Detailed reports on the problem will be submitted to the upcoming G-7 summit meeting in Naples. Umanets did not rule out the possibility that "the sides will reach a consensus" in Naples.
