Accordingly, the Republic Party urges the influx of foreign capital, instead of a redistribution of stocks. The Republic Party recently described its monetary and fiscal policy and its effect on inflation. According to Republic Party Deputy Chairman Laszlo Fodor, it is still possible to cope with a budget deficit of 5 percent of the GDP. It is essential that Hungary fulfills its debt-repayment obligations. If a new government takes power after the elections, the Republic Party will play a role in this government and will assert its view that Hungary still needs a basically strict monetary and fiscal policy for quite a while. The Republic Party urges the development of a banking environment more interested in financing the economic players than in investing in state bonds. The program of the Republic Party includes an interest policy and system that lead to interest rates encouraging savings. Laszlo Fodor mentioned the fact that the party thinks that the program of the current government in financing the exports and imports is worth continuing, and it is necessary to set up a relevant bank for this, as well as a stock company to provide export guarantees. It is already certain that, if they get into the government, the Republic Party will submit a supplementary budget by the second half of this year. They will immediately eliminate the system of separated state funds; instead, they will set up a single such institution. This social-economic fund would replace the current 100 or more funds and it would finance projects on the basis of a uniform, strict and throughly controlled system of criteria. According to Laszlo Fodor, everything that is happening with these funds in Parliament today is only helping a wasteful economy, because the current law allows these funds to give loans to each other in exchange for interest. The Republic Party thinks that income from privatization can be the source of reducing the state debts and, therefore, the party wants to allocate more funds for this, and would recirculate the remaining funds into the economy. The economic program of the Republic Party finds its unrealistic to achieve a one-digit inflation in a short time, but it is certain that inflation can be maintained much below 20 percent. The party does not intend to bring elements that increase the inflationary pressure in the economy. In case it gets into power, the Republic Party will guarantee the indexation of pensions, minimum wages, and public employees' salaries every three months, in order to adjust them to the rate of inflation. Thus, the party could achieve an increase in purchasing power. The party wants to achieve a similar agreement between the employees and the employers.
