(6)"] [Excerpts] Former National Defense Ministry [KAM] leaders set up a commission to determine prices, headed by Deputy Minister S. Vasiliauskas. [passage omitted] I had a chance to speak with the latter the day before yesterday. He said that seven firms had offered helicopters for sale. Four of them were professional commercial companies directly associated with aircraft making plants with a strong record of providing repairs, spare parts, and specialists. As the commission chairman noted, the prices proposed by all of these companies had matched their helicopters. According to S. Vasiliauskas, the choice of the firms "Akvel" and "Mingrin" was not accidental, because the latter proposed the latest technologies. In addition, these firms guaranteed one year of free maintenance, and the commodity offered by the firm "Akvel" was in Lithuania. These facts decided their choice as the partners. The experts' commission assessed the "Akvel" helicopter at $900,000, while the price set by the firm was $1.2 million. The KAM commission announced that the terms proposed by the partners were acceptable. Thus, it suggested that agreements with the companies "Akvel" and "Mingrin" be concluded. In reply to the question of whether there had been any public bid, Mr. S. Vasiliauskas said that there had not been any public announcement. The ministry was preparing to buy helicopters from a foreign country, and Lithuanian law does not require any publicity in such cases. The commission received proposals from Air Force Commander Z. Vegelevicius. It had only to vote on whether one or another proposal was good or bad. "The role of our commission was silly," acknowledged the deputy defense minister. "I think that prices should be set differently." S. Vasiliauskas claimed that the helicopter deal with the companies "Akvel" and "Mingrin" had been very successful. However, when I asked him why the ministry paid $3.5 million for three helicopters, when it was possible to buy similar aircraft much cheaper from Russia last year, the deputy minister replied that he had commanded his subordinates to "knock down" the prices as much as possible. The deputy minister could not explain why the helicopters had arrived without certain parts, why they had not been removed from Russia's air register, and why they had differed from the type indicated in the agreement. Under the agreement, Lithuania had to receive transport helicopters, while the National Defense Ministry got helicopters for tourists. [passage omitted] Who will answer for all of this? As far back as 21 July 1993, Minister A. Butkevicius issued an order approving the conclusions submitted by the KAM price commission and authorizing Air Force Commander Z. Vegelevicius to sign contracts with the stock companies "Akvel" and "Mingrin." The agreements on the purchase of three helicopters were signed on time, and even more quickly than usual. However, as we have already reported, in the early summer of 1993, the KGB unit in Smolensk prevented an operation whereby 10 military MI-8MTV helicopters had to be transferred to Lithuania through the Russian air transport company "Vitiaz" and the Kaunas association "Selma." [passage omitted] Ex-Minister A. Butkevicius claimed to RESPUBLIKA that the firm "Selma," headed by a three-time convicted president, had been proposed as a partner is supplying arms and ships by the Russian Baltic Fleet leadership itself. "Selma" had been entrusted with the construction of military housing in Kaliningrad Oblast. Knowing that the firms "Selma" and "Vitiaz" were authorized to conduct the helicopter operation, one could assume that the companies "Vitiaz" and "Mingrin" were also imposed on Lithuania's national defense leaders by the Russian Baltic Fleet command. A. Butkevicius is trying to construe the opinion that the refusal of the Russians' proposal would have meant the burying of hopes for the Russian Army's timely withdrawal. The KAM and its leaders were allegedly pursuing noble goals. However, the deplorable and unsuited explanations of the former KAM leaders can hardly justify their inability to work honestly and properly, or the abuse of their responsibilities. Last spring, Chief State Inspector V. Kundrotas documented dozens of financial violations at the Defense Ministry. Under the 23 December 1991 instruction, 57.86 million rubles [R] were transferred to one of the ministry's structural subunits -- the Information Service -- for the alleged acquisition of facilities. S. Vasiliauskas, its former manager who later became deputy minister, concluded three delivery agreements: With the joint Lithuanian-U.S. venture "Litvit" -- on the acquisition of a military outfit for R38.5 million; with the same stock company "Akvel," which had supplied the ministry with helicopters -- on the purchase of special facilities for R16 million; and with a commercial enterprise of technical supplies -- on the acquisition of material assets for R2,226,000. Unfortunately, the millions were transferred the very next day to private companies which did not fulfill their commitments. [passage omitted]
