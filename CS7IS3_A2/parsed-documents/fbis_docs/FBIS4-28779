Burma will attend the ASEAN ministerial meeting in Bangkok in July for the first time as the guest of the host country, Thailand. Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong said dissident Burmese students should refrain from conducting political activities affecting Thailand's relations with Burma. "The Burmese students who live at the (Burmese Students) centre should know how to behave. "It is not appropriate for them to conduct any activities jeopardising relations between Thailand and neighbouring countries while living here," the minister said, apparently referring to Burma. The Interior Ministry is attempting to block protests which might take place during the meeting. Interior officials are keeping a watch on Burmese dissidents and ethnic minority groups including students at the centre at Ban Maniloi in Rat Buri Province as the ministry has been told about a plan to prevent Rangoon officials from attending the meeting.
