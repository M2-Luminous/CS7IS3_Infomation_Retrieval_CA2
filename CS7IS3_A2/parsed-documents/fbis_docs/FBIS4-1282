FBIS4-1282 "drafr080_a_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Foreign Minister: RPF Cease-fire `Not Sincere' Foreign Minister: RPF Cease-fire `Not Sincere' LD2504205994 Paris Radio France International in French 1830 GMT 25 Apr 94 LD2504205994 Paris Radio France International French BFN [Text] In Rwanda the unilateral cease-fire declared by the Patriotic Front [RPF] is due to come into force at 2200 GMT. However, this end to the fighting is conditional on an end to the massacres. Meanwhile, massacres and fighting are continuing in the capital, Kigali. On the diplomatic and military fronts the situation is deadlocked between the two warring factions. The interim government has announced its own cease-fire from Zaire. Any dialogue seems more and more unlikely. Here is the foreign minister of the transitional government, Jerome Bicamumpaka: [Begin recording] [Bicamumpaka] If the RPF wants to talk with the Rwandan army over the heads of the government, this is not possible. On the other hand, if the RPF wants to negotiate with soldiers under the authority of the Rwandan government, I believe that we can take the necessary steps to enable such a dialogue. The RPF cannot hope to dictate anything by refusing to recognize our government. I believe that the RPF is not sincere when it speaks of a cease-fire; had it been sincere it would not have started the hostilities on 6 and 7 April. This time, however, if the RPF, taking note of developments in the military sphere, in the political sphere, is changing its mind, if it wants a genuine cease-fire with proper guarantees, then we are ready to negotiate with the RPF, but we do not trust its statements. [Correspondent Dominique de Courcelles] You, the government, have for your part declared a unilateral cease-fire, too. What is the situation regarding this cease-fire? [Bicamumpaka] [Words indistinct] of the Zairean president, we proposed a cease-fire. We hope that the Zairean president will forward this proposal to the RPF and that the latter will accept it. Either we negotiate and we have peace, or, if we do not want peace, if the RPF wants war, we hope to defeat it militarily. [end recording]
