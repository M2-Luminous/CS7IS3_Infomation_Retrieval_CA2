This is easily understood because Sandinism is the most important political movement and it has the greatest responsibilities in terms of the country's future. What the FSLN discusses today regarding its political platform, the national crisis, its concept of a party, its statutes, and its leadership will have momentous consequences for Sandinism. Moreover, it also will have an impact on society as a whole because there is a direct relationship between the process to strengthen democracy within Sandinism and progress achieved in the national democratization process. Therefore, we believe all Sandinists are dutybound to realize the importance of participating in the debate. We have a double responsibility -- to support the reorganization of Sandinism, the main goal of the First Congress, and to simultaneously help outline the perspectives of a solution to the national crisis. No one can fail to endorse those efforts. Today BARRICADA wants to ratify its pledge to work and help bring Sandinists together again. Because of professional ethics, we reject sectarian journalism that is only appropriate for zealots, like the one endorsed by the right wing which does not allow other opinions or a diversity of sources on current events. Three years after BARRICADA was relaunched, when it stopped being the official newspaper, the influence and credibility earned by this newspaper have proved, as an expression of political efficiency, that we adopted the right decision. Just as we have proclaimed on previous occasions, BARRICADA has always been and always wants to be a free forum for discussion and national debates. We are not a cathedral where dogmas are preached; instead, we are a medium open to doubts, intellectual honesty, constructive polemics, and exchanges of practical experience to seek solutions and guidance for the citizens. We support a debate among Sandinists where ethics prevail. In other words, we sponsor a discussion of ideas -- political and ideological positions -- where sincerity and a spirit of unity prevail above all. We oppose the methodology of using exclusion and epithets, and we only endorse strong arguments and reason when refuting opposing opinions. We understand that all debates imply a reasonable quota of zeal, but this does not mean the discussion should degenerate into personal attacks. These are the basic norms we ask you to share with all those who have an opinion and who wish to state it through BARRICADA. Aside from the observance of ethics, the rules for the debate demand a political willingness to continue advocating a greater flow of information and greater editorial opportunities that allow the greatest diversity of opinions, whether on an individual basis or as a group, in the Sandinist debate. The existence of different currents of opinion has resulted from the vitality of Sandinist democratization. BARRICADA, being a member of the news media, has a responsibility -- to offer the reader in-depth research into the exchange of organized opinions. Therefore, we have begun publishing a new section in this edition -- the "FSLN Congress" section -- which shall be published whenever necessary to divulge the different positions and documents, as well as rank-and-file activities, polls, and personal interviews, and it will complement the "Opinions" and "Readers' Forum" sections. We pledge to follow the policy of allowing all kinds of opinions to be heard, and we urge all the Sandinist media to open their pages and radio and television programs and to sponsor an ample debate without sectarianism. At BARRICADA, we view the media as autonomous areas of power that are linked to the broad spectrum of our society, and we are sure the debate also will strengthen the media's autonomy. Moreover, we want to remind readers that BARRICADA's journalists and workers, and the members of its editorial staff, have different personal opinions about the topics for the Sandinist debate, and they state their opinions in the newspaper's pages under their respective signatures. Only the editorial represents the official position of the newspaper.
