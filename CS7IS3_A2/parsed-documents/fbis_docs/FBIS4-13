FBIS TRENDS-06Apr94-Ukraine Communists Win Election in East, Democrats Win in West Communists Win Election in East, Democrats Win in West SUMMARY Voters in the 27 March Ukrainian Supreme Soviet election voted heavily for the recently reconstituted Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU), especially in the east and south, preferring it to other leftist parties--the Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU) and Labor Party--which were almost shut out. Rukh ran very well in Kiev city, and democrats dominated in the west, accentuating the regional divergences in the country. Despite the apparent lack of enthusiasm for parties and the huge number of nonparty candidates running, candidates with party affiliation did very well in the first round and also got about half the places in the runoffs, suggesting that parties may play a bigger role in the new parliament than had been expected. END SUMMARY Very few seats were settled on this first round of the election The Central Election Commission announced on 29 March that 49 of the 450 seats had been decided in the 27 March first round and that the victors included 12 from the CPU; 4 from Rukh; 2 each from the URP (Ukrainian Republican Party), SelPU (Peasant Party of Ukraine), KUN (Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists), and SPU; and 1 from the UKRP (Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party- -Stepan Khmara's party), while 24 have no party affiliations (UNIAN, 29 March). UNIAR, however, on 30 March said 48 seats had been decided and presented a different list of victors, including 11 independents, 10 CPU, 6 Rukh, 3 "Ukraine Democratic Association," 3 KUN, 3 New Wave, 2 DemPU (Democratic Party of Ukraine), 2 SPU, 2 SOU (Union of Officers of Ukraine), 2 URP, and 1 each for SelPU, UKRP, UNA (Ukrainian National Assembly), and MBR (InterregionaL Bloc of Reforms--the bloc of former Premier Leonid Kuchma and former Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Volodymyr Hrynyov). Leftists Run Well In addition to its Lead in the small number of settled contests, the CPU and other leftist parties are poised for significant gains in the runoffs, having placed far more candidates in the runoff contests than the democratic parties. Interfax reported on 30 March that 159 CPU members and 29 SPU would be in the runoffs--25 percent of the total number of second-round candidates--while 70 Rukh, 24 URP, and 6 KUN candidates would compete and that combined democratic candidates would total about 125 (a figure including 6 from the ultranationalist UNA), versus about 400 independent candidates. Demokratychna Ukraina reported on 31 March that 185 CPU members would go into the runoffs along with 26 SPU and 83 for the communist-inclined SelPU, versus only 55 Rukh (71, if one counts candidates backed by Rukh) and 27 URP. Other Leftist parties, such as the SPU and Labor, were almost shut out by the CPU--even though the CPU was banned until recently and presumably was not as well organized as the SPU or other Longer-established parties. Leftist voters apparently were attracted by the communist Label, not by a more moderate form of socialism, or wished to register protest by voting communist. The CPU even beat out non-nationalist democrats based in the east: The Kuchma-Hrynyov MBR only won 40 places in the runoffs, according to the 1 April Nezavisimaya Gazeta. The efforts by democratic parties to avoid destructive competition and present a united front against leftists and rightists achieved some success, although probably not as much as some democrats are claiming. The democratic bloc--now titled "Ukraine Democratic Association"--set up by Rukh, URP, DemPU, and other democratic parties, did well in Lviv and appears to have helped the democrats at Least get into the runoffs in some eastern and southern districts. Democratic bloc leader Levko Lukyanenko optimistically claimed after the election that 182 democratic candidates had gotten into the runoffs versus 170 CPU and Less than 30 SPU (Kiev radio, 30 March). He broke these down as 88 from the democratic bloc plus 94 independents he considered "of democratic orientation." He also claimed 24 of the first round victors as representatives of his bloc (Kyivska Pravda, 1 April), apparently adding together all democratically-inclined victors. Voters Support Parties In another notable trend, voters gave more support than expected to party-affiliated candidates, leading them to dominate the first-round winners and claim a Large share of places in the runoffs. UNIAR's List of the 48 first-round winners included 37 with party affiliation and only 11 without, suggesting that ties to a party gave a real advantage. This idea is reinforced by the large number of party candidates who made it into the runoffs- -402 party candidates versus 400 independents, according to the 30 March Interfax. In contrast, only 11 percent of first-round candidates had been nominated by parties, according to the 2 March Holos Ukrainy, although many others had party affiliations. The apparent discouraging of parties in the election law, the many nonparty candidates, the often-voiced anti-party sentiment, and the preference of many prominent, establishment candidates for running as independents had encouraged expectation that the overwhelming majority of those elected would be people without party ties, leaving only tiny party factions in the new parliament. The first round suggests that parties may play a bigger role than expected and that, with voters concentrating their votes on the CPU and Rukh, there will be fewer parties and bigger party factions in the new parliament--although the majority may still be independents. Regional Variations The election appeared to not only reflect polarization between the CPU and Rukh but also to accentuate regional divergences in Ukraine, with the CPU far ahead in the east and south and Rukh candidates and other democrats sweeping Kiev city and the west. South The CPU was clearly dominant in the southern oblasts of Odesa, Mykolaiv, and Kherson, which altogether contain 45 districts. (No substantial results from Krym, where many potential voters refused to participate, have been reported yet.) With all but one district reported in these three oblasts, the CPU won the only seat settled and won places in 16 runoffs, while fellow leftists in the SPU and SeLPU won only 2 runoff places apiece. The Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc MBR won 3 runoff places and the Liberal Party 1. Democratic nationalists won hardly any places in the runoffs: Rukh 4, URP 1, Union of Officers of Ukraine (SOU) 1, and Greens 1 (SEE BOX ONE). -- In Odesa Oblast's 23 districts, CPU First Secretary Mykhaylo Myaskovskyy won the only seat settled (Post-Postup News Agency, 29 March), while the CPU placed candidates in 5 runoffs, and other runoffs will include a "Union of Communists of Odesa" candidate, a pro-communist candidate, and a SeLPU candidate (Post-Postup, 29 March). Rukh ran only 12 candidates (its list of candidates was printed in the 17 March Rada) and got none into the runoffs, while the democratic bloc put up 19 candidates (its list of candidates appeared in Narodna Hazeta, No. 11-12) and got one (a DemPU) candidate in the runoffs. -- In Kherson, no seats were filled on the first round. The CPU placed candidates in runoffs in 8 of the 11 districts, while the SPU placed 2 candidates and the SeLPU 1. Non-nationalist democrats--reformers got 1 Liberal candidate and 1 MBR candidate in runoffs (Post-Postup, 30 March). Rukh and the democratic bloc had run 10 candidates (Rada, 17 March; Narodna Hazeta, No. 11-12) and placed 2 candidates in the runoffs, both running under the label "Ukraine Democratic Association" (Post-Postup, 30 March). -- In Mykolaiv, no seats were filled, but democrats did somewhat better than in Odesa and Kherson. The CPU placed candidates in runoffs in 4 of the 11 districts, the MBR in 2, Rukh in 2, URP in 1, SOU in 1, and Greens in 1 (Post-Postup, 29 March). The democratic bloc as a whole outscored the CPU, getting 5 in the runoffs (the Rukh, URP, SOU, and Greens candidates) out of the 11 it nominated (Narodna Hazeta, No. 11-12). Rukh had nominated candidates in all districts (Rada, 17 March) and 3 candidates it endorsed (including 1 SOU candidate) got into the runoffs. East Democrats expected an uphill struggle in the east and so had largely united their efforts, with the democratic bloc usually able to field far more candidates than Rukh alone (see the Rukh list in the 17 March Rada and the democratic bloc list in Narodna Hazeta, No. 11-12). Rukh appeared especially weak in Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk, where the democratic bloc endorsed more URP or DemPU candidates than Rukh candidates (SEE BOX TWO). Election returns from the east are still incomplete but show a big CPU lead, with 11 CPU members already elected and at least 55 in runoffs, plus 9 SPU and 4 SeLPU candidates. Meanwhile, the democratic parties so far appear to have only about 20 in runoffs. Even the eastern-oriented Hrynyov-Kuchma MBR and the Liberal Party appear to be getting only a handful of candidates into the runoffs. ---- In Zaporizhzhya, with all 18 districts reporting, the CPU won the only seat settled and got candidates into 8 runoffs, SeLPU got 3 into the runoffs, but SPU got none. Independents got 18 in the runoffs, while democrats got some into runoffs running as the "Ukraine" bloc (2) or the "We" bloc (4). The Liberals and MBR got none. Rukh put up candidates in 13 districts (Rada, 17 March) and got 3 into runoffs, but as "Ukraine" bloc or non-party candidates (Post-Postup, 30 March), while the democratic bloc put up 15 candidates (Narodna Hazeta, No. 11-12) and got 4 into runoffs, as "Ukraine" bloc, "We" bloc, or nonparty. Three of these were also Rukh candidates, and the fourth was from the PDVU (the centrist Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine). -- In Luhansk, the CPU's strength was demonstrated dramatically when CPU candidates won 6 of the 25 districts in the first round. One independent also won (UNIAR, 28 March). Almost all districts have only communists in the runoffs, according to local democrats (Post-Postup, 1 April). -- In Dnipropetrovsk, the one seat settled in the first round went to a SeLPU member, while democrats have a slight lead in runoff spots for the other 33 seats, with 11 for the "Ukraine" democratic bloc (including 3 backed by Rukh). Eight CPU, 3 MBR, 2 Labor Party, 2 Rukh (plus 2 in the Ukraine bloc), and 1 SelPU candidates also placed in the runoffs (Post-Postup, 30, 31 March). -- In Kharkiv, returns from 14 of the 28 districts filled no seats but put 8 CPU candidates into runoffs, as against 3 SPU, 2 Rukh, 1 MBR, and 1 DemPU (Post-Postup, 30 March). -- In Donetsk, the Donetsk paper Aktsent on 1 April characterized the election as a "colossal success" for leftists and a "full defeat" for nationalists, citing several districts where democrats got only a tiny percentage of votes. The paper reported that 4 of the 7 seats filled went to the CPU, while 32 of the 81 runoff candidates are CPU, 6 SPU, 4 Labor Party, 2 Civil Congress of Ukraine, and 1 each for SeLPU and the Liberal Party. There is no evidence so far that Rukh, the democratic bloc, or even the Hrynyov-Kuchma MBR got into the runoffs. Although Aktsent reported that only one Liberal Party candidate got into the runoffs, the party itself claimed 4 of its candidates would be in the runoffs (Rada, 31 March). Rukh Territory In sharp contrast to the east and south, Kiev city and the west seem likely to be swept by the democratic bloc and Rukh, with the CPU making little showing. Kiev city. Rukh did very well in the capitol, winning two seats outright and getting into the runoffs in almost all of the 21 remaining districts, giving it a good chance of winning the overwhelming majority of Kiev seats. The two seats won by Rukh- backed candidates--Rukh leader Serhiy Holovatyy and independent radical economist Volodymyr Lanovyy--were the only Kiev city seats won on the first round. Judging by the list published by the Post-Postup News Agency on 30 March and in the 29 March Vecherniy Kiev, Rukh candidates or candidates affiliated with Rukh got into runoffs in 20 of the other 21 districts, while Rukh lost out in only one district. Rukh's success is all the more surprising because some of its prominent figures, such as Les Tanyuk, chose to run outside Kiev city, leaving Rukh leaders Holovatyy, Ivan Zayets, and Yuriy Kostenko, and independents Vecherniy Kiev editor Vitaliy Karpenko, former Defense Minister Kostyantyn Morozov, and economist Lanovyy the only big names on Rukh's endorsed list (published in the 17 March Rada). Several of the successful candidates on Rukh's endorsed list were independents (Morozov, Karpenko, Lanovyy) or URP or KUN candidates, rather than actual Rukh members. No other party came anywhere near Rukh's success in Kiev city. The UNA got 4 candidates into runoffs, the URP 3, CPU 3, SPU 1, KUN 1, and the KNDS (Congress of National Democratic Forces) 1. Ten independents got into runoffs. Leftists were splintered, as the CPU and SPU competed against each other in almost every district (Post-Postup newspaper, 17-24 March). Rukh even outstripped the democratic bloc of which it is a member. The democratic bloc endorsed candidates in only 14 of the 23 districts, including 7 Rukh candidates, 4 URP, 1 KUN, and 2 independents (Narodna Hazeta, No. 11-12), and 13 of the 14 were the same candidates as Rukh endorsed. But the democratic bloc did not endorse Lanovyy or Holovatyy and so backed neither of the two elected in the first round, leaving it with no winners even though Rukh won two. Bloc-endorsed candidates placed in 12 district runoffs. Lviv. As expected, national democrats did very well in Lviv. Rukh candidates won 3 of the nine seats settled on the first round (out of 23 districts), the moderate national democratic New Wave bloc also won 3, while the ultranationalist parties UKRP and KUN each won 1, and an independent probably close to Rukh (Yevhen Zherebetskyy, who actually had helped found the local Rukh in 1989, according to the 29 March Post-Postup) won the remaining seat. The democratic bloc, locally called the Political Consultative Council of Lviv, did better than Rukh and may wind up with the overwhelming majority of Lviv's seats. It endorsed candidates for all 23 districts, but since its member---parties often could not agree on one single candidate, it usually endorsed two or three candidates per district. Its list of endorsees was published in the 5 March Vysokyy Zamok. Six of the endorsees won on the first round (3 Rukh, 3 New Wave), and in one district both runoff candidates are endorsees, guaranteeing a seventh seat for the bloc. In 10 other districts the bloc got at least one candidate in the runoff, while its candidates lost in 6 districts. Thus, the bloc has a chance of getting as many as 17 of the 23 seats. Its loss in at least one district--number 268- -appeared to be caused by the bloc backing two or three candidates who probably split the democratic vote, allowing candidates from the right extreme (KUN) and left extreme (CPU- SPU) to win the two runoff positions. Rukh did not do as well in Lviv as it did in the last election, when, as the main democratic umbrella organization, it won most seats, and it will have fewer members on Lviv's delegation to the Supreme Soviet than the present 10 or so who still identify themselves with Rukh, rather than with some other party. This year it ran candidates in 15 districts (Rada, 17 March) and saw 3 win, another 6 get into runoffs, and 6, including Lviv Rukh Chairman Yuriy Klyuchkovskyy (who lost to a KUN candidate), lose. In addition, Rukh backed 3 candidates from New Wave who were elected. In total, Rukh might get as much as 9 seats. Among the other main parties in the democratic bloc, New Wave, a coalition of democrats, did well, probably because it had prominent candidates such as Ihor Yukhnovskyy and Viktor Pynzenyk. It fielded only nine candidates (listed in the 12 January Za Vilnu Ukrainu), three got elected (Yukhnovskyy, Pynzenyk, Ihor Koliushko), two got into runoffs (Taras Stetskiv and Zoreslava Romovska), and four lost. The URP, although based in Lviv and one of the oldest democratic parties, did very poorly. It ran candidates in 17 districts (listed in the 24 March Za Vilnu Ukrainu), but none were elected on the first ballot and only 4 got into runoffs, while 13 were defeated. Especially humiliating, its national chairman Mykhaylo Horyn was defeated by ultranationalist Stepan Khmara in district 261. Ultranationalist parties--KUN, UNA, UKRP, OUN (Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists), and SNPU (Social---National Party of Ukraine)--did poorly, probably because they ran so many candidates against each other. Ultranationalist candidates won 2 of the 9 seats settled and got candidates in the runoffs in 8 districts, but lost in 12 districts. Their biggest success was Khmara's defeat of Horyn, a sweet revenge for Khmara, since he had been ousted as deputy leader of the URP in mid-1992 by incoming Chairman Horyn as part of a move to shift the URP toward a more centrist stance. The other success was KUN nominee Ivan Bilas's defeat of Lviv Rukh Chairman Klyuchkovskyy in district 278. Most of the far right's successes, however, were by the relatively moderate KUN, which won one seat and got candidates into 6 runoffs. The more radical UNA got candidates into 2 runoffs, including commander of its paramilitary arm (UNSO) Oleh Vitovych in district 275 and UNA-UNSO chief of staff Yaroslav Ilyasevich in district 282. The semi-fascist SNPU, which had put up candidates in 21 districts (Post-Postup newspaper, 17-24 March), got no one into runoffs (Post-Postup News Agency, 29 March). Among leftists, few SPU and even fewer CPU candidates even registered in Lviv, and it is not clear if the few that did had any serious organizational support. The lef t's only successes were getting one SPU-CPU candidate (Ivan Kelman) into the runoff in district 268 and one CPU candidate (Oleksandr Holub) into the runoff in district 266. In the latter case, the victory was a fluke, since URP candidate Oleksandr Shandryuk won just under 50 percent, and in a badly splintered field Holub came in second with only 7.7 percent (Post-Postup, 29 March). Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil Few results from the other two Galician oblasts are in yet, but they, like Lviv, settled a high proportion of seats in the first round and appeared to vote for national democrats or ultranationalists. Ivano-Frankivsk filled 6 of its 12 seats, with 2 democratic bloc candidates, 2 DemPU, 1 URP, and 1 KUN candidate winning, while Ternopil filled 4 of its 10 seats, electing 1 each from Rukh, URP, UNA, and KUN (Post-Postup, 29 March). Implications Concentration of votes for the CPU and Rukh and the democratic bloc may help reduce the large number of parties and create larger factions in the new parliament, bringing improvement over the present confused situation where few deputies adhere to any faction and a majority is hard to rally. The difficulties Rukh and the democratic bloc have suffered in trying to agree on common candidates suggests that they probably will not succeed in creating a well-unified bloc in parliament. The pre-election expectation of a majority of unaffiliated deputies appeared to favor President Leonid Kravchuk, Supreme Soviet Chairman Ivan Plyushch, and the present establishment--all of whom appeared to want to keep parties weak. A large CPU faction may pose a threat to Kravchuk and to any future president, such as Kuchma, as well as to reformers, since they will not be as subject to manipulation as non-party deputies often dependent on the establishment. The apparent weakness of other leftist parties and of the Liberal Party and MBR appears to throw the heavily populated and politically dominant east and south into the hands of the CPU. Such a strong regional base for the CPU may accentuate the tension with west Ukraine and more reformist areas. Thus, the election already may be signaling a significant political realignment of political parties and regional forces.
