The government invited the U.N. Security Council to take urgent measures to avert consequences which the continued negative development might have for the peace process. Quoting instances of ceasefire violation, the Government of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) said in an annexe to its statement that Moslem forces were constantly provoking incidents by opening artillery fire on positions of the Bosnian Serb Army and civilian targets. A number of civilian facilities have been destroyed and there have been casualties among the civilians, which have been particularly heavy in the area in Brcko, East and West of Vozuca, the suburbs of Teslic and in Doboj (all in the north) and in Srbobran and the adjacent territories (in central Bosnia). Moslem forces have occupied a number of Serb villages, the government said in the annexe. Bosnian Croat and Moslem forces are relocating substantial formations north and south of the Posavina corridor in the Sava River valley in the north, which links the east and west of the Bosnian Serb republic. Neighbouring Croatia is concentrating troops in the area of Zupanja and Slavonski Brod on the border with Bosnia, the annexe said. South of the corridor, in the direction of Brcko, the Moslems have concentrated five brigades and six battalions brought in from the U.N.-designated 'save haven' of Tuzla in the northeast, totalling 18,000 troops, 25 tanks and between 50 and 60 artillery weapons of calibres larger than 100 mm, the annexe said. Against Doboj and Modrica, the Moslems have lined up five brigades and two battalions, totalling 11,000 troops, 20 tanks and between 30 and 40 big-bore artillery weapons, while strong Moslem forces are concentrated against Teslic in the north. Furthermore, the Moslems are unlawfully using markings of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the Yugoslav Government said, specifying that the Moslems have painted white two helicopters in Sarajevo and three in Zenica in central Bosnia, and have used them to ferry arms and military equipment as well as troops to their forces confronting Bosnian Serb positions. Bosnian Croats, too, have relocated troops from the south to Kupres and Zepce in central Bosnia, and have concentrated 10,000 troops, reinforced with several battalions of new recruits from neighbouring Croatia, on the bridgehead at Orasje, north of the Posavina corridor, the statement said. UNPROFOR has been officially informed about the incidents, and could witness on the ground the unjustifiable behaviour of the Moslem forces, which runs contrary to the ceasefire agreement. UNPROFOR officials have assured Bosnian Serb Army representatives that they would inform their commands about the matter, the Yugoslav Government said in the annexe to its statement.
