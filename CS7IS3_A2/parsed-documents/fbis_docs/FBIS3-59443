In a statement made at the beginning of the meeting, Mr. Paul Filipi, the president of the forum, said that the goal of the meeting was to mark the date of 8 January 1919, when the Transylvanian Saxons, on the basis of people's right to self-determination, through their National Council, assembled in Medias, proclaimed unity with the Kingdom of Romania. Describing the historical importance of this act, Mr. Filipi stressed the role of a connecting bridge between Romania and Germany played by the German minority, a role also acknowledged in the treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries, concluded in 21 April 1992. The meeting was attended by representatives of the German minority from various regions of the country, who presented to the Romanian president the problems that they are currently facing in the areas of education and religion, as well as the state of mind of citizens of German nationality. They requested that a law on minorities be drafted and asked President Ion Iliescu to issue a declaration in which it is recognized that the German minority in Romania suffered discrimination after World War II and that the compensatory measures that they are demanding are justified. In a statement made to the press at the end of the meeting, President Iliescu said that, in our country, there is a constitutional framework for the development of a common life between the majority population and ethnic minorities, noting that, within this context, the claims expressed by the participants are resolvable and there is a chance for the citizens of German nationality who left Romania to return to the homeland.
