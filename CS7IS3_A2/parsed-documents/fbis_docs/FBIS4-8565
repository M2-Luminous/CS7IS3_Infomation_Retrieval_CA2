This time, the story was received with more than a little malicious joy. The big pain in the neck is gone at last. Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar has been deposed, losing in almost the same way that he kept winning. Although the Czech public is almost unified in its rejection of Meciar, Czech politicians aren't so sure. At least that's what an observer might assume from their cautious treatment of this change in leadership. They seemed more careful than diplomacy alone would oblige them to be. Another curious sign is the degree to which politicians' reactions varied, even within a single party. Despite all his faults, Vladimir Meciar was a rather predictable politician. In any political situation one had only to imagine all the potential options and choose the most preposterous, and that would almost invariably be the course he took. Meciar did not just offend everyone's common values and good sense. He seemed to reach deeper, confounding the very fabric of regular life. The only unsolved mystery is whether he did all these things according to some ingenious plan or whether his method of leading by the force of sheer personality--untainted by reason--happened to be just what Slovakia wanted at the time. Whatever his intention, Meciar's troubling ways have been a rather useful tool for Czech policy-makers. Enough has been said about our leaders' open dislike of Central European integration, specifically among the Visegrad nations of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Slovakia itself always helped to fuel the argument against cooperation: "Do you really want to be in an association with a so-and-so like Meciar? Can a country with the least bit of self-esteem team up with him?" From this point of view, the upcoming coalition government in Slovakia--and especially its prime minister--may eventually prove to be more problematic. First of all, the new leadership will be hard to pin down because it seems to comprise so many differing views. And secondly, Meciar's removal has thrown the whole political process off kilter. If the new Slovak government does manage to hang on, however, the Czech Republic might have to learn to live side by side with Slovak leaders who are partners on an equal footing and who cannot be as easily dismissed in the public eye for their dubious pasts. Worse yet, one part of the new coalition is the Democratic Left Party (SDL), the direct descendant of the former Communist Party. That may be particularly painful for our side to deal with. Just try to imagine the scene when our minister of defense, a true, dedicated Christian, meets a Slovak counterpart with a godless red past. How can they possibly be seen agreeing on something such as peace in Bosnia? The fact is that the Slovak ex-communists have managed to cut themselves off from their past much more effectively than their Czech brethren have. They are rather closer to what is understood to be the modern European left. For Czech leaders, however, this is where the danger lies. If the Slovak coalition survives and its SDL ministers eventually prove themselves, they might be politically much more difficult to deal with than Meciar. Remember our officials' shocked reaction to the current Polish center-left government. Their approach has developed into a very cautious "friendliness" mixed with distrust. Now we may be forced to go through the same process east of our border. On top of that, there are signs that next month's general elections in Hungary may produce a government that includes part of the ex-communist Socialist Party. Any compromises would be hard to swallow after so many of our political leaders made presentations to the West, explaining that the only possible way out of the post-communist marsh is the firm road of a liberal market economy and libertarian society. There cannot be any sidetracking, they said--no "third way" for us. We can hardly back up now. There are center-left governments within the European Union too, and we know they are watching us closely. If we cannot make it work with Visegrad, it will be harder to become buddy-buddy with the Westside gang. The members of this club seem unwilling to appreciate our quiet sacrifice in tolerating such neo-socialism. They keep telling us that we cannot play in the big leagues unless we make it in our local one first. If Slovakia, be it left or right, is functioning well, it will be even harder for them to understand why we can't be better team players.
