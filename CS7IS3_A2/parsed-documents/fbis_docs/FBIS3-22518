They stated that at least 18 cases have been confirmed in Barranca and that there are another 500 cases where dengue fever is suspected (400 in Puntarenas and 100 in Liberia, Province of Guanacaste). This announcement by the Costa Rican Institute for Research and Education in Nutrition and Health (INCIENSA) led authorities in the Ministry of Health to reconfirm the emergency which was declared on 27 September, when it was reported for the first time that there was a possibility that the disease -- which was supposedly eradicated 50 years ago -- was reappearing. Although the first samples [of suspected material] have been sent to the Reference Center of Honduras, a diagnosis has not been made, because of the medical strike called in that country at least two weeks ago. Due to the epidemic, the first action taken was to establish health quarantines in Puntarenas, Liberia, and Valle Central, according to Emilia Leon, acting minister of health. In the port of Pacifico the disease spread rapidly. The first case was identified on 14 October in Barranca. From there it spread to Esparza -- where there are at least two persons ill with the disease -- and to other places in the province. Ana Gabriela Ross, director of the South Central Region of the Ministry of Health, stated that mosquitoes have been detected in the Cantons of Desamparados, Goicoechea, Alajuelita, Coronado, Tibas, Moravia, and Montes de Oca, as well as in the Districts of Hatillo and San Sebastian. She added: "In June several suspected cases were reported in Barrio Mexico, Ciudad Colon, and Tibas." Ross did not specify the number of persons affected, but she said that they showed symptoms of dengue fever: headaches and pains in the joints of the body, skin rashes, general discomfort, and feelings of tiredness around the eyes. Health authorities stated: "Mosquitoes transmitting dengue and yellow fever are found throughout the country." They confirmed that they are taking emergency action to prevent the outbreak from spreading to a larger number of people. Unofficial calculations indicate that if the pace at which the disease has spread continues as it has up to the present, it could affect between 250,000 and 500,000 people. The government has allocated 30 million Costa Rican colones for the purchase of insecticides to fumigate the areas of greatest danger and especially those homes where symptoms of the disease have been detected. Panama will loan to Costa Rica two machines equipped to fumigate the streets with "Malathion," a powerful agrochemical which is soluble in water and which is lethal for the "Aedes Aegyptis" mosquito [which transmits the disease]. According to Acting Minister of Health Leon, the 200 containers of "Malathion" in storage in the warehouses and the eight fumigators on hand (including the two machines which Panama is providing) are enough for a considerable period of time. Five of the fumigators will be sent to Puntarenas, and the remaining three, to Guanacaste. For his part Jose Luis Garces, director of the Malaria Department of the Ministry of Health, said that 14 technicians experienced in primary care have been sent from Limon to Puntarenas.
