It is necessary to exert equal pressure on all sides in order to have affect on the negotiations, Yarokostopoulos said in an interview to the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS. He pointed out that the United Nations wished to exert political pressure on Serbia with the sanctions and that their effect on the overall economy in this Yugoslav republic was obvious. However, the question is whether the political goal because of which the sanctions were introduced has been achieved or have the sanctions proved to be useless in this respect, he added. The U.N. Security Council introduced comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) at the end of May 1992 accusing Yugoslavia of aggression against the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The U.N. Security Council did this ignoring the fact that a civil war among local Moslems, Serbs and Croats has been underway since April 1992 and that there are no Yugoslav Army troops there. The head of the EU monitoring mission for the former Yugoslavia said it was wrong to think that the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should remain in force until the problems in areas under U.N. Protection (UNPA) in the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia are solved. The republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) is a UNPA. The RSK was proclaimed on predominantly Serb populated areas in former Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslavia and its attempt to limit civil and national rights of the Serbian people. Although the RSK has been under U.N. protection since spring 1992, the Croatian Army launched three aggressions on it since then in an attempt to forcibly establish its authority there. The sanctions are linked to a concrete political problem and that is Bosnia-Herzegovina, Yarokostopoulos said and assessed the sanctions would be lifted once the war there was stopped.
