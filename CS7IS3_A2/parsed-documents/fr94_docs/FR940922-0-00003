FR940922-0-00003 FR940922-0-00001 The revision was requested originally for the period July 1993 through August 1994 by Milk Marketing, Inc. (MMI), a cooperative association that represents many of the market's producers. As printed in the Federal Register , the revision became effective July 1, 1993, with no termination date. The 1994 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) reflects the revised shipping standards, and without further amendatory action, the 1995 CFR will also reflect the reduced 25-percent shipping standard. MMI requested continued revision of the cooperative association shipping requirements for the period September 1, 1994, through December 31, 1995, and a proposed revision was issued. Comments supporting the revision were received from MMI and two other cooperative associations with members whose milk is pooled under Order 36. MMI, Eastern Milk Producers Cooperative Association, Inc. (Eastern), and Dairylea Cooperative, Inc. (Dairylea), stated that the revision is needed to prevent unnecessary and uneconomic movements of milk because of the current severe milk supply-demand imbalance in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania marketing area. MMI's comments included a description of milk marketing conditions for June 1994 that show milk production for the market increased over 4 percent from the same month of the previous year, representing 12 million additional pounds of milk in the Order 36 pool. For the same month, Class I sales decreased by nearly 2.5 percent from June 1993, representing a reduction of approximately 3.4 million pounds of Class I sales. As a result of the market's increasing production and declining Class I use, nearly 15.5 million pounds of milk had to be used in manufactured products than in the same month the previous year. The comments filed by Eastern stated that the trends observable for June are expected to continue for the foreseeable future, creating additional pooling difficulties for cooperative handlers pooling milk under Order 36. Dairylea stated that continuation of the revision would prevent unnecessary, uneconomic movements of milk. According to comments filed, milk supplies historically pooled under the order currently are continuing to lose their markets and having to find new outlets for their production. Apparently, Order 36 and nearby pool distributing and pool supply plants are releasing some of their milk suppliers to find their own markets for milk. Such institutional changes in the sources of supply for various plants may result in market instability and disorder. Milk production in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania marketing area appears to be increasing while Class I use is declining. As a result, greater volumes of milk must be diverted to manufacturing uses than in prior years. The last full year before the 1990 proceeding that resulted in the amendments that took effect October 1, 1993, was 1989. During the short production months (September through November) of 1989, the percentage of Order 36 producer milk needed for Class I use was over 60 percent, with less than 30 percent of the market's milk used in Class III. For the same period of 1992, the percentage of producer milk used in Class I was just 55 percent, with the Class III percentage increasing to nearly 36 percent. The trend continued during the same months of 1993, with less than 55 percent of the producer milk pooled during September, October and November used in Class I. The increased production and decline in Class I sales, coupled with the market's changing handler-producer relationships, necessitates a continuation in the reduction of the percentage of milk that must be delivered by a cooperative association to pool distributing plants in order to assure the pool status of the cooperative's member milk. The revision effective July 1, 1993, should continue in effect for a period long enough to allow the institutional shifts currently in process to work themselves out, and for the cooperative associations to assure themselves of an adequate fluid market for their producer milk. Therefore, the revision should remain in place through December 1995. After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal set forth, and other available information, it is hereby found and determined that the diversion limitation percentage set forth in ยง1036.7(d) should be maintained at the present 25-percent level through December 31, 1995.
