The British commander of a UN forward base in Zepce said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) convoy was blocked in Teslic, only a few kilometres west of the Maglaj pocket where some 16,000 Moslems in Maglaj itself and over 100,000 people in the region are under a fierce Serb attack. Maglaj, where UNHCR officials have described the situation as desperate, has received no humanitarian aid by road since last October, and is entirely dependent on NATO food airdrops. The commander of a 150-strong Light Dragoons reconnaissance unit said Serb forces had Wednesday asked convoy leaders to sign "a disclaimer saying they would take responsibility" for the aid trucks and personnel if they entered the Maglaj area. He said the UNHCR officials had refused to do this. The convoy left Banja Luka in northwest Bosnia last week and has been blocked at Teslic for several days. Several UNHCR convoys have been kept from reaching Maglaj, in northern Bosnia, aid officials said. The commander spoke to AFP on condition that he not be named. The Dragoons, who arrived 10 days ago, were still filling in sandbags and working on positions at the abandoned factory where they are installed. The commander said the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) of which the British soldiers are a part had several options available to ensure that the convoy enters Maglaj "in a very, very short period of time." He said these included the Serbs agreeing to let it pass, Croat militia in the area helping it pass or for UNPROFOR to act on its own.
