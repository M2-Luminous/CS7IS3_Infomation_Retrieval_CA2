The congress re-elected Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic as president of the party. Closing the two-day gathering of 218 delegates, Bulatovic emphasised the importance of cherishing and promoting the state of Montenegro which, together with Serbia, forms Yugoslavia, and said that nobody had the right to break these states. It is not in Montenegro's interest to form a state only with Serbia, "our vital interests lie also in the direction of Herzegovina, and we have close historical and economic ties also with the Bosnian Serb republic and the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.)" said Bulatovic. The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 by the local Serbs in those parts within the arbitrary communist-era borders of Croatia where they are the majority population, in response to Croatia's violent secession from former Yugoslavia and trampling on their rights. In 1992, local Serbs in the breakaway Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, too, formed their Bosnian Serb republic in their ancestral ethnic lands. Bulatovic said that Montenegro was supporting and would continue to do so the struggle of the Serb people outside Yugoslavia for freedom, dignity and equality, but added that it would continue to oppose "the extreme nationalism which has grown root under the influence of civil war, radically confronted ideologies and narrow national interests." He stressed that Moslems in Montenegro must by no means be equated with the militant fundamentalists in the Bosnian Moslem leadership, and that the Albanians who advocate secessionism and violent methods of its achievement were few in the republic. Bulatovic said that there must be no animosity towards Croats in Montenegro, because "we have never waged war on the Croatian people, but on the proponents of the extremist greater-national ideology" in Croatia. He said that Montenegro had been the first to "suggest to a wondering Europe the idea of a normalisation of relations among the former Yugoslav republics," and that Montenegro "has no reason for a confrontation with, for instance, Macedonia or Slovenia."
