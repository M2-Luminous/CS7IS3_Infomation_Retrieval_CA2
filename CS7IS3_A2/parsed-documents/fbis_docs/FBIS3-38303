[Scharping] I have hardly any leisure time any more. But I like the new challenge. I think that people notice that. [BILD] Many people would like you to shave off your beard.... [Scharping] I know as many who want me to keep it. When I was in my last year of high school, I once shaved it off, but I did not like it. [BILD] Seriously, what would Chancellor Scharping change immediately? [Scharping] Germany must concentrate all its efforts on employment, the fight against joblessness, the future, and a decent life for everybody -- which requires the creation of new jobs. We need a national employment pact. The enterprises must increase their investments, and the SPD will promote that. Work must be organized in a more intelligent way. Corresponding collective agreements have been concluded. I hope that this will also be possible in the metal working industry. We do not want strikes. The employers should offer the employees a settlement. One thing should not be forgotten: Paying for work is more useful than financing unemployment. [BILD] What else? [Scharping] First, families with children should receive 250 German marks [DM] for every child, and the high allowances for high-income earners should be abolished. Second, the reconstruction of eastern Germany should be financed in a balanced way. The employees are now carrying the major burden. This must be organized in a different and fairer way. In fact, many officials in Bonn no longer know what it means for an employee to make ends meet at DM2,000 net per month. However, if somebody can pay DM2,000 in taxes, he can also pay DM2,200 without a reduction of his living standard. Third, bureaucracy must be reduced. Thus, building permits should no longer be required for houses containing up to six apartments. Compulsory notification should be sufficient. Fourth, environmental protection offers enormous opportunities -- for exports as well as new jobs. [BILD] Would you increase the price of gasoline? [Scharping] No, I do not see any possibility of further increasing the gasoline tax. The burden of taxes and fees is already too high for the broader population. We will relieve earned incomes. Something is wrong when gross incomes of DM3,000 are reduced to DM2,000 net or less. Messrs. Kohl and Waigel have increased the gasoline tax by over 40 pfennig per liter since 1990. Those who take such measures must help the commuters. The gentlemen in Bonn have forgotten that. [BILD] How will you finance the reforms? [Scharping] We need a fairer equalization of burdens. Thus, taxes on income that is not earned through employment should be clearly higher than on earned income. In Germany the population possesses financial assets worth DM3,500 billion. There are people who receive several thousand DM in interest every month. I strongly advocate the principle of achievement. Yet depositing one's money in Luxembourg is no great achievement. Thus, income that is not earned through employment should be burdened to a greater extent in the future. In fact, we will not increase taxes but reorganize them. Work should be relieved, and the burden on consumption of raw materials, the environment, and energy should be increased. [BILD] How do you want to reduce the high state debt? [Scharping] We have a debt of DM1.9 trillion. In his term of office, Theo Waigel has incurred higher debts than all the finance ministers before him put together. The main task of an SPD-led government in the first year would be: To Reduce state expenditure to the absolute minimum and use it in a more purposeful way. I will reject all demands for additional expenditures or tax increases. I am as hard as a rock in this respect. Moreover, the state must prove that it is able to save before it can ask the citizens for higher contributions.
