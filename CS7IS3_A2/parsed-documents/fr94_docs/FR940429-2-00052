ACTION: Notice of realty action. SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 206 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, the BLM proposes to exchange public land, on an equal value for equal value basis, for private lands. The proposed exchange would be a positive step towards meeting the goal of placing all land ownership within the Sears Point Archaeological District under Federal ownership and Bureau of Land Management administration. DATES: The segregation effect of the notice of realty action on the public lands shall terminate upon issuance of patent or other document of conveyance to such lands, upon publication in the Federal Register of a termination of the segregation, or 2 years from the date of its publication, whichever occurs first. ADDRESSES: Protests should be addressed to the Director, Bureau of Land Management (760), MS 406 LS, 849 C Street NW., Washington, DC 20240. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The private lands are located within and adjacent to the Sears Point Archaeological District in Yuma County, which is also known as the Gila River Cultural Area, an area of critical environmental concern. The public lands proposed for exchange are described as follows: Gila and Salt River Meridian, Arizona T. 9 S., R. 23 W., Sec. 29, Lot 2, SE1/4SW1/4. Containing 51.66 acres, more or less. Final determination for exchange will await completion of an environmental assessment. In accordance with the regulations of 43 CFR 2201.1(b), publication of this notice will segregate the affected public lands from appropriation under the mining laws, but not from the mineral leasing laws. The public lands would be conveyed out of Federal ownership subject to the following four rights-of-ways: 1.
