These vice ministerial talks will be the first official meeting between Russian and Japanese representatives to be held since President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October. As a result, significant attention from many nations, including third party nations, has been focused on the talks. Although there are still over three weeks before the talks begin in Moscow, at this time we can probably go ahead and make the following assumption; that is, the talks will be held in a less friendly atmosphere than there existed at the time of Yeltsin's visit to Japan. Several recent incidents have clearly accounted for the cooling down of bilateral relations. Above all, the major factor is the dumping of radioactive wastes in the Sea of Japan by the Russian Navy and apprehensions that it may be repeated. Of course, efforts have been made by both nations toward seeking a solution to the problem, but so far not everything has been settled. Meanwhile, Japanese fishing boats have violated Russian territorial waters, and it has been reported that the Japanese Government plans to review its credit extension program to Russia, particularly on temporarily suspending humanitarian aid. More important, however, is that political developments in both nations are raising great concerns over future bilateral relations; that is, there has been cabinet reshuffling in the Russian Government, and the political reform bills have not been passed in the upper house of the Japanese Diet so far. There are concerns in Japan that revisions in Russia's reform policy due to the reshuffling of the cabinet of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin may adversely affect its foreign policy, including its relations with Japan, and result in Russia taking a more hard-line attitude. On the other hand, there have emerged views in Russia that even if the main core of the current administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa were to remain in power, the administration could get stronger, resulting in its taking tougher stance regarding relations with Russia. In this backdrop, it can readily be imagined that the most important task for the two nations in the bilateral talks is to assure each other that there will be no changes in policy regarding political matters. For that matter, steps have already been taken by the two nations toward this end. For example, it can be recalled that on the opening day of the Russian Federal Assembly, the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, President Yeltsin made remarks stressing that he still has final say over Russian foreign policy as before and that there will likely be no changes to it. The president's remarks were directed at Japan. As for Japan, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is also deputy prime minister, has stated in a news conference that on Russian aid, there will be no changes in the Japanese Government policy. It is expected that at a meeting of influential people of Russia and Japan scheduled to be held in Tokyo in early February, steps will be taken to deepen mutual understanding and strengthen mutual confidence that has recently been complicated by problems. In the last several years, an important step regarding bilateral relations was taken whereby the two nations have been able to change their past relation of conflict into one of mutual understanding and cooperation. What is important now is to maintain what has been achieved, prevent reversal, and continue on the path toward establishing a true partnership between the two nations. It is hoped that political dialogue between Russia and Japan, including the upcoming bilateral talks, will contribute toward this goal.
