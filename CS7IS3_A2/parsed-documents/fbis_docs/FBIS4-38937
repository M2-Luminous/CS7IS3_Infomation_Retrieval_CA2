This was announced at a news conference today by Bagaciunas, head of a branch at the Ministry of Finance's budget department. The news conference was also attended by Feliksas Kolosauskas, chairman of the Seimas budget and finance committee, . It is known that the approved national budget for this year totals 4.3 billion litas. Attempts are being made to compensate the deficit by borrowing from other funds and structures. Among others, the head of the budget branch mentioned the state privatization fund. The government is borrowing from the commercial banks in Lithuania, too. The Ministry of Finance has taken a short term loan of 15 million litas at a 60 percent annual interest. According to Bagaciunas, an agreement was signed recently on a short-term loan of 20 million litas. Because of this deficit, planned expenditure must be limited in the budget, too: wages, pensions, and grants. According to Bagaciunas, there will be spheres of priority to which the budget funds will be directed first of all. The branch chief at the ministry's budget department is pinning hopes on Value Added Tax [VAT]. With the help of this tax, the Ministry of Finance expects to obtain about 150 million litas this year.
