The Israeli ambassador in Cairo, accompanied by a small delegation, visited Shell-Egypt with the objective of starting practical steps in an Israeli project to export Egyptian gas through a pipeline to Israel. Shell announced that it had discovered the largest gas reserves in the western desert, in the region of al-Abyad. The reserves are estimated at 14 billion cubic feet. Despite the fact that Oil Minister Hamdi al-Banbi announced that Egypt's position on exporting gas is still under consideration, public oil companies in Egypt do not generally adhere to the official position and own shares in gas companies, in accordance with the oil agreements, in exchange for investments in prospecting and digging. It is likely that practical steps will be agreed upon between Shell-Egypt and Israel, particularly because Shell is decreasing its prospecting activities to save funds for the investments that will be required to develop gas discoveries. On the other hand, practical steps have already been taken to set up a refinery with the Israeli company Paz Adil, which is a subsidiary of the Merhav investment group. This is being done using two Egyptian businessmen as a cover. One of these men is a prominent member of the National Democratic Party in Alexandria. The other is reported to be an arms dealer. An Israeli technical delegation will be arriving in Cairo tomorrow to meet with a number of officials from Egyptian companies after 1 January 1994. It is worth noting that the head of the investment authority earlier denied that Israelis were participating in a refinery and that the responsible company is registered abroad to dodge the Arab boycott officially enforced against Israel.
