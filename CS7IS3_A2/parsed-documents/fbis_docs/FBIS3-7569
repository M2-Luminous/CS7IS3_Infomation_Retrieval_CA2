Regarding deregulation plans, which are to be the centerpiece of a new market-opening package that the government plans to issue on 29 March, Takemura said, "Our country has created itself a handicap in that when it tries to import goods such as automobiles, rice, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products, it requires much time and cost for various inspection procedures and paperwork." He stressed, "We must at least bring it (deregulation) down to the level found in other major industrialized nations." As an example, Takemura cited inspection procedures for automobiles. Noting that there are many people whose jobs are linked to this system, while there are also people who seek its abolishment, the chief cabinet secretary said, "Deregulation is not a simple matter, but if we fail to carry it out, we cannot revitalize our economy, nor can our country be able to associate with the rest of the world on an equal partnership basis." There are three candidates running in the ongoing Yokohama city mayoral election. One is the incumbent mayor, who is backed by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], Komeito, Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which have all jumped onto the same bandwagon. The second candidate is a political newcomer who is being backed by Sakigake and the United Social Democratic Party [USDP]. The third is a newcomer backed by the Japan Communist Party [JCP]. Regarding this election, Takemura said: "Currently, the general direction toward which Japanese politics is flowing is determined by a handful of politicians engaged in back-room collusive dealings. This election is an opportunity for the people to decide whether they approve of such practices." "Matters are often decided somehow through collusion, and this is still the situation with central government politics," he added. Apparently, Takemura's remarks are directed at Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, and others, in criticizing them about how they have been proceeding with their plans to form a new political party, as well as a large parliamentary group.
