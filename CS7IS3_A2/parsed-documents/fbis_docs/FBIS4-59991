In an exclusive telephone interview with MBC's Tawfiq Jazulit, al-Bid did not rule out the possibility of secession from the north, but he left the final decision up to the competent bodies in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and the national forces. Jazulit's asked him: [Begin recording] [Jazulit] Mr. Vice President, the YSP and the Yemeni oppositionists have set up a National Salvation Council instead of a national salvation government, as was previously suggested. What is the significance of setting up this council? [Al-Bid] I believe that this is not the issue at the moment. The issue we are dealing with now is how to ensure that there is increasing steadfastness. We hope that by the time 'Id al-Adha comes, the ferocity of the battles will have abated. If there is talk about salvation, it is an issue that concerns the other parties and political forces joining with us. We have reached an agreement with them on the principles for national salvation. [Jazulit] What is the truth about al-'Anad? Sanaa insists it is in their hands, and proof of this is that it has sent some correspondents to the region; but you deny it. What is the real military situation in al-'Anad? [Al-Bid] As I have repeated to you, al-'Anad is unyielding. Al-'Anad will not fall, nor will our values, courage, and ability to confront the aggressors. I assure you they will be forced to retreat. [Jazulit] The fighting continues in the absence of Arab mediation, although there are extremely important political developments in Aden. Does this mean that events are heading toward secession? [Al-Bid] I do not know what the final solution will be, because I cannot determine this alone. But I can tell you that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih declared his secession on 27 April by declaring war. Now, after these massacres and sacrifices, I do not know how we could patch things up or what stand we will take. However, we will see what is best for Yemen. [Jazulit] Will secession be one of the major alternatives of the YSP and the opposition in light of the intensity of the fighting? [Al-Bid] We will do what the majority of the political forces and parties with whom we have reached agreements decide. We will follow the final formula we believe will be most suitable for running the affairs of our citizens. I tell those who are literally pushed to the battle front--they have now moved all the battles to the southern and eastern governorates--that the acts that some innocent people are being forced to do against their will is criminal, and it must stop. We call on all Yemenis, nationalists, and honest people in Yemen and abroad to put an end to this massacre that is taking place in the country. [end recording]
