Deployment strategies have already been planned by the Natal Command headquarters. [Begin recording] [Franz Verfuss of the Natal Command] It will be three companies, a company being approximately 100 to 150 men strong. A company will be deployed in each of the group areas: one going to the Group-9 area -- Pietermaritzburg, one going to the Group-10 area near Durban, and one going to the Group-27 area round about Eshowe. [Van der Westhuizen] Colonel Verfuss said because kwaZulu/Natal is such a vast area, the troops would be mobile and would assist the police and the other troops already in the area to stabilize the most volatile areas starting off with kwaMashu and Bhambayi near Durban. He said they would not work directly with the kwaZulu Police. [Verfuss] If the kwaZulu Police cannot handle a situation, they approach the police, the South African Police. If the South African Police feel that they need extra forces, they approach the South African Defense Force. Our support is to the South African Police and not directly to the kwaZulu Police. [Van der Westhuizen] Despite Bhambayi and kwaMashu being very quiet during the daytime, it's at night that violence usually erupts, and it's then that the security forces will be most needed.
