Mr. Pridiyathon Thewakun, President of the Exim [Export-Import] Bank, said that he was assigned by the Commerce Ministry to consider the business risks from selling Thai rice to Iraq. One of the factors subject to consideration is the amount of the Iraqi assets being frozen by the international organization so far, and how many lending countries are planning to snatch the money after the assets are released. A source from the Commerce Ministry said that if the deal is approved, Thailand might be able to sell as much as 1.5 million tonnes of Thai rice during the period, considering that, Iraq aside, Thailand has received the offers from Iran to exchange 500,000 tonnes of 100 percent white rice for crude oil. Indonesia and the Philippines also proposed to buy an equal volume of 300,000 tonnes of rice, while Japan has delivered the latest rice order covering 200,000 tonnes.
