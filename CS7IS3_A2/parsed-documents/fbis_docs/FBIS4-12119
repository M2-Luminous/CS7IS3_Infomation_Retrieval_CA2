More than 50 people were wounded in the explosion. Five people who were gravely wounded were transferred to the Rambam Hospital in Haifa, where one of them died of her wounds. Another four wounded are currently being transferred to the Tel Hashomer Hospital. Eight of the wounded were released; 33 people were hospitalized in the 'Afula Hospital with light to moderate injuries. Police Minister Shahal and Police Commissioner Peled arrived at the scene. Minister Shahal said that since the Hebron massacre the Police feared Arab terrorist attacks, and several attacks were indeed foiled. Commissioner Peled said that it is possible that as of tomorrow no vehicles from the territories will be allowed entrance into the Green Line, because it is inconceivable that Israel would allow inhabitants of the territories to enter the Green Line to carry out attacks. The issue of the closure will also be reassessed. The commissioner added that the timing of the attack -- 40 days after the Hebron massacre -- did not surprise the police, which were recently reinforced along the Green Line and in Jerusalem. Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that the car used for the explosion was stolen from the Tel Aviv area. Migdal Ha'emeq [a town near 'Afula] residents have started to congregate en masse, and the police are acting to prevent acts of revenge.
