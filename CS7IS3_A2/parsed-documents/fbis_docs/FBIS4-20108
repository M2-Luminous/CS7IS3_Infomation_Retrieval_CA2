The Committee also adopted resolutions covering Norway, Finland, and Austria. But the debate which preceded the decision was irritated and confused and hardly provided any guarantees about how things will go in the decisive parliamentary vote next week. The Committee adopted its resolution on Sweden's membership application with a vote of 15. Seven members voted against the resolution and two members abstained. A passage to the effect that the Foreign Affairs Committee is only voting for Sweden to be admitted to the EU at New Year 1995 "out of a general sense of political responsibility" was thrown in at the last moment. Sweden receives a yes from the Committee "despite the much discussed shortcomings in the EU's institutional development and the procedural shortcomings relating to informing the European Parliament about the membership agreements," the resolution states. And in the debate several members expressed their bitterness that the Parliament has not been given any binding promises about reform of EU bodies. Many EU members of Parliament have demanded a stronger position for the Parliament and/or a strengthening of the EU's supranational role as a condition for voting yes to the enlargement of the EU -- an issue on which the Parliament now has a right of veto -- but have had little response to their demand. "People have completely ignored the conditions the Parliament laid down," former French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson complained. Many members were also dissatisfied with the procedure for the important vote, which will be held on 4 May, according to a preliminary agenda. The European Parliament will only be able to vote yes or no to approving the agreements with Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria. Only the following day will there be a debate and votes on Parliament's own resolutions which in principle will then be meaningless. The notion that the resolutions, which are adopted the day after the main vote, can be seen as "explanations of voting behavior" from the Parliament was an idea that received an unfavorable reception from many Committee members. And the uncertainty about what will happen in the Parliament remains to the very end. Despite the fact that the vote on the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries' membership agreements is now on the agenda there remain three opportunities to remove it during next week's parliamentary session.
