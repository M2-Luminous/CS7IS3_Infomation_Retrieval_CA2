Their accessories including the traction motors, elastic wheels, electric control devices were domestically eeveloped. The operation of the streetcar is automated and the shock from the rails is minimized with the car body supported by many elastic devices. Its operation is very safe with three brake systems available at high and low speed and in emergency. The traction motor being large in capacity, it can draw a trailing car. The metro car is automatically operated and its body is supported by pneumatic springs to reduce the shock from the rails. And the newly developed compressor leaves nothing to be desired in the brake system.
