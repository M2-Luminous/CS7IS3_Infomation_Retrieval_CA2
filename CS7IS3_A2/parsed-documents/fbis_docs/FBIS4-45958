The circumstances of the USSR's collapse and the rapid degradation of society call into question the correctness of this complimentary comparison -- at any rate as regards the skills of many of the "chess players" of the perestroyka period. The historians of the future, however, will as usual voice varying opinions about 20th century Russian history and about whether the last Soviet leadership had an inferiority complex or whether they were pioneering a new era, and so forth. What will be seen as history by the researchers of the future, for us increasingly boils down to the problem of survival. Consequently, as we encounter very urgent matters every day it does not seem out of place to attempt to sort out at least certain rules and the sense of the game in which Russia is a player in the nuclear arms sphere. The current era of total change is, apart from anything else, also a time of radical change in geostrategic realities and ways of thinking. The speed and spontaneity of these changes are probably the reason why our so-called post-Soviet society is parting willingly (and even with unmitigated enthusiasm) from the state appurtenances that largely determined the USSR's status as a military "superpower." There is something irrational -- though easily explained in terms of the systemic crisis in society and its revolutionary nihilism -- in the fact that we are putting paid with equal measures of indifference ("we don't need that any more!") to the, in many respects controversial but nonetheless technically sophisticated, "Buran" (and thus, in practice, to our entire "state-funded space effort"); to aircraft-carrying cruisers -- and next it will be the turn of the entire oceangoing fleet; and to ABM defense and air-defense installations and strategic ground force groupings west of Smolensk and south of Sochi. There is, however, a sphere of social and professional interests where the consequences of the possible changes should be analyzed with particular care and where discussions should be conducted by specialists in a constructive spirit without any interference from emotions and not necessarily in conjunction with other information such as, say, the examination of the START II Treaty by the new parliament or the adoption of a long-term program for military organizational development. It will be a question of the prospects for developing our strategic nuclear forces, which can quite justifiably be called the scepter in the double-headed eagle's claw. It is time to recognize that behind the numerous discussions about the expediency of retaining, removing, or adopting certain weapons systems and their quantitative and qualitative parameters lies a principled and so fundamental question that people prefer not to consider it -- will Russia be able under these conditions that are new to it to preserve its nuclear potential and in what form? It is no secret that a number of important components in the nuclear system that used to exist have been lost, and traditional problems such as, for instance, the no-first-use of nuclear weapons and the relationship between a retaliatory strike and a counterstrike are being reconsidered and reinterpreted. Thus, the question of the future of Russia's nuclear potential is becoming not so much theoretical as practical -- particularly now that the lack of funds and the absence of constant and focused attention from top organs of power to the problems of the strategic nuclear forces could lead to their irreversible degradation. In tandem with this, the protracted uncertainty about ratification of the Strategic Offensive Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) threatens to seriously delay the entire future disarmament process and introduces additional problems to the choice of the ideal solutions for modernizing the Russian Armed Forces' strategic nuclear component. Statesmen who should already be taking responsible steps to choose long-term avenues for the organizational development of nuclear strategic forces are feeling an urgent need for a more accurate system of references in the emerging geopolitical situation, a need to understand what global military-political situation they will have to face in the future. And it is very important for them that some fragments of the picture of the future -- despite the turbulent processes of change in the world order -- are in a number of aspects acquiring new outlines. A typical feature of the emergent era will be a change in the overall structure of influence in the world. Many specialists are noting that the bipolar structure with two opposed superpowers -- the United States and the USSR -- is being replaced by a more traditional multipolar structure which, by reducing the opportunities for the superpowers to determine the course of world development, will enhance the role of other countries (such as the countries of Europe and the Pacific region), diversifying the arsenal of their ways and means of influencing world politics. According to a number of forecasts, the weakening of U.S. economic positions in favor of West Europe and Japan will make the United States' bonds of alliance with its partners in Europe and Asia more short-term and unstable, and international relations more complex, unstable, and less predictable as a result. Hence, the overall political situation in the world may be less predictable, hard to control even at regional, not to mention global, level, and likely to result in the emergence of acute crises and the appearance of additional spurs to confrontation. The distant rumbles of thunder can already be heard. In the context of a multipolar world with criteria of influence and stability that are somewhat different and by no means always advantageous for Russia, when additional room is created for multilateral political maneuver, allies can very quickly become enemies, and the principle of "every man for himself" (remembering G. Washington's behest) prevails increasingly clearly in politics -- under these circumstances it is hardly sensible to rush into all-out disarmament, giving up our national nuclear forces or even discussing handing them over to some kind of collective control. It would be an unforgivable mistake, giving in to complacent ideas about the end of the era of confrontation, to "tear the tails off" all Russia's strategic missiles, although this does not at all mean that we should not use the entire panoply of peaceful means of safeguarding Russia's national security or that we should end the disarmament negotiations. The range of opinions on this issue, particularly now that politics has become part and parcel of our public awareness, is quite broad. Thus, there is a view (voiced in particular by ISKRAN [expansion unknown] staffers S.K. Oznobishchev and A.V. Surikov) that at a time of the transition to the building of strategic partnership relations between Russia and the United States, the use of the strategic stability criteria which were successfully used in the postwar decades is becoming senseless. Since this is the case, despite all the reservations befitting the current situation, nuclear weapons are allegedly becoming a kind of burden for Russia and should be gradually turned into the "last guarantee" of the security system "not only for Russia and the United States in isolation, but perhaps for a whole group of states united behind the principles of a collective security system within the UN framework." Admittedly, it seems as though the United States is not yet ready to share with Russia its experience of these innovations, even though their general human and humanitarian thrust is evident. The nuclear powers' lack of enthusiasm on this subject is possibly explained by the fact that achieving an ideal combination of individual and collective means of defense is a complicated task with no single solution. But that is a separate discussion. The actual agenda is different, and one specific problem is that Russia should maintain effective national strategic nuclear forces. At the same time, it somehow seems as though our enemy now is not any specific country or group of countries, but uncertainty (incidentally, the transition to planning for uncertainty has already been reflected in some official U.S. documents on military-strategic issues). If we set out the development of military thinking in the nuclear planning sphere extremely simply and without any serious distortions, it can be said that the development of nuclear weapons arsenals has made certain changes to the targeted role of military strategy, which has become more broadly interpreted and is seen as a military-political strategy. In reality this has meant a change of emphasis in nuclear planning from the possibility of directly winning a nuclear war to the sphere of implementing political goals by means of the threat of war. The concept of political deterrence has supplemented the concept of nuclear deterrence -- literally "containment by means of nuclear deterrence" [sderzhivaniye posredstvom yadernogo ustrasheniya]. It was based on the principle of the "balance of terror" -- the certainty that each party to a potential nuclear conflict would inevitably suffer unacceptable damage in any nuclear war scenario. The logic of deterrence presupposed the permanent building up of the two superpowers' nuclear potentials and an increase in the number of nuclear munitions and delivery systems to an irrational level (a kind of "foolish multitude") that guaranteed the impossibility of one side winning in any meaningful way. Implementation of this concept turned into an outright arms race. At the end of the sixties the stupidity of this approach to the organizational development of strategic nuclear forces was so obvious that the parties to the confrontation came to the conclusion that it was expedient to seek (very cautiously and gradually) new approaches to maintaining strategic stability and to implementing the concept of combining nuclear deterrence with arms control (so far only control). If the strategic nuclear forces of the two states (or coalitions of states) are capable of inflicting unacceptable damage on each other in retaliation (retaliatory strikes and counterstrikes), then both sides restrain each other from aggression, military equilibrium exists between the states, and, consequently, military-strategic stability in their relations is maintained. Thus, deterrence is achieved by the possibility that strategic nuclear forces will deliver a retaliatory strike of such force in response to an enemy first strike that the idea of carrying out a first strike ceases to be attractive. The method of maintaining strategic balance on the basis of the use of nuclear deterrence proved its effectiveness from many standpoints over the decades. But, like any "precision" instrument, it is very fragile and subject to many factors in real life. Thus, of itself the conclusion that stability exists at any specific moment of time requires a very complex analysis of the military-political and military-technical reality, and consideration of a huge number of varied and, moreover, variable quantities in the most unexpected areas. We can also cite the sensitivity of this kind of stability to different symmetries and asymmetries in arms systems, and imbalances between rivals even within the framework of the "simple bipolar world." Any changes in military potentials, on the one hand, promote the emergence of excessive suspicion in interstate relations, while, paradoxically, on the other hand objectively requiring the maintenance of a certain level of mutual confidence. In this context many necessary but unilateral steps to sensibly improve national armed forces could upset the strategic equilibrium and should therefore be most carefully weighed up from the standpoint of whether or not they will be seen by the opposite side as an attempt to change the balance in its favor. Caution or active enmity can be caused by the improvement of the technical potential of conventional (nonnuclear) weapons, particularly in terms of warhead accuracy and yield, the development [sozdaniye] of any ABM systems with ambiguous roles, and so forth. The problem of somebody acquiring a decisive military advantage through a technological breakthrough also remains very topical. This likelihood does exist, which could tempt people to play their "untrumpable" card for the purposes of strong-arm blackmail. That is why Russia and the United States, like other states, need to improve their strategic nuclear forces in areas that strengthen strategic equilibrium. And corresponding joint information about weapons systems in service should be envisaged. In order to define the main avenues for the organizational development of national nuclear deterrence forces it is very useful to comprehensively analyze and take account of new concepts which have recently been actively developed and actually implemented by Western specialists in the sphere of strategic planning. These concepts are based on the initial premise that the most realistic threat to the security of the United States and its NATO allies now comes not from Russia and the other CIS countries but from "authoritarian" regimes (read "unfriendly," as distinct, for instance, from "friendly dictators"), or regional interstate and interethnic conflicts using conventional weapons. It is within the framework of this doctrine that Western specialists have embarked on the elaboration of new approaches which will define the principles governing the use of nuclear arsenals for the next 10-20 years. In the United States in particular, in early 1993 L. Aspin, the then U.S. defense secretary, had already ordered an urgent review of the concept of the use of U.S. strategic nuclear forces. Although officially the adoption of the new concept is planned only for this year, the main problems that have arisen in the course of its elaboration have been covered in sufficient detail. In particular, the U.S. strategists will not only have to revise the list of targets, but also review once again whether the United States needs such a big nuclear potential, since maintaining it at its current level costs the United States $10 billion a year at a time when the threat of an all-out nuclear war has significantly diminished. The military are also having to "rethink the methods for deterring new and old enemies." It is worth noting that, in L. Aspin's opinion (and there is hardly any doubt about his competence on geostrategic matters), the main threat to U.S. security is now posed not by an increasingly predictable ("transparent") global strategic foe -- as was the Soviet Union -- but by a whole team of "political monsters" in the shape of "nuclear smugglers and double-dealing governments that reject international norms." For all the lack of ambiguity in the interpretations of the role played by nuclear weapons in the present-day world, the renewed U.S. concept of "containment by means of nuclear deterrence" nonetheless remains the most important nuclear planning idea for the United States, and the novel aspect of the utilization of strategic nuclear forces will most probably lie in the search for "some kind of devilishly inventive new principles." Nothing is as yet known about these, incidentally -- although L. Aspin admitted, discovering compelling reasons for it, that the approach of "monitoring the nuclear arsenal together with a threat of retribution" which had effectively influenced the Soviet Union, "may not frighten the new owners of nuclear weapons at all." In this event it cannot be ruled out, at least theoretically, that there will be an expanded range of missions for strategic nuclear weapons to carry out -- from peaceful containment through deterrence on the basis of the inflicting of unacceptable damage, to the limited combat use of nuclear weapons alongside conventional (nonnuclear) systems. The main aim of the limited combat use of nuclear weapons would be to prevent a military conflict from developing into all-out hostilities -- that is, in an unfavorable direction for the state under attack -- and to defuse the conflict. We cannot rule out new and original ways of parrying the threat from "nuclear smugglers and double-dealing governments." For instance, the potential threat of nuclear terrorism could be eliminated by implementing the idea of global information transparency in the nuclear sphere, whereby secret activity in manufacturing and moving not only nuclear devices, but in accumulating a "critical mass" of fissile materials would become impossible. Governments that prove intractable in this area could be (as has already happened) removed from the political scene for the required period of time by establishing control over the ruling elites in these countries or with the help (and there are plenty of examples of this too) of limited military and other sanctions -- which would easily be feasible within the framework of a policy of regionalism or simply under UN mandate. But the latter measures might not always be successful -- therefore the reality of using strong-arm methods, regrettable though it may be, should be retained. We should be more interested in the question of whether Russia is ready to propose its own vision of the use of strategic nuclear forces. The undoubtedly honest position of the new Russian military doctrine -- now being extensively commented upon -- on the possible use of a nuclear first strike can be seen mainly as a reaction to traditional strategic challenges and as being largely brought about by the country's situation and, accordingly, by the state of its Armed Forces. To all appearances, even the modernization of Russia's strategic nuclear forces, which is suggested under the framework of the treaties on offensive arms reduction, does not make it possible to do anything but implement deterrence within the framework also of the "traditional" military-strategic situation with the criterion of inflicting unacceptable damage on any aggressor in retaliatory action. When talking of the category of "unacceptable damage," we should take account of present-day views of this problem. We realize now that this category has, as it were, two dimensions, and can be framed within two systems of coordinates. It is usual to consider (and, incidentally, this understanding emerged relatively recently), that the criterion of unacceptable damage exists simultaneously as a certain quantitative level of losses and as a kind of psychological barrier. The question of the norm of unacceptable damage is incredibly complex. Military specialists honestly admit the failure of the numerous attempts to define a more or less objective level for it. Staffs in both Russia and the United States are now using in their practical activity the mathematical value of a set amount of damage (required for deterrence) which nonetheless plays an important role in assessing the strategic balance when defining the limits of restrictions in the course of drawing up disarmament treaties and, most important of all, serves as a kind of guideline in shaping major state programs for the quantitative and qualitative development of strategic offensive arms. We should not downplay the positive significance that the idea of a quantitative assessment of the force required to inflict "unacceptable damage" on an enemy has possessed for the development of the strategic situation, looked at retrospectively. It was this idea that made it possible to conclude more or less objectively that there was nuclear parity between the USSR and the United States -- which made it possible for one of the parties to dump its psychological baggage and provided an incentive for a disarmament process based on mutual recognition of the impossibility of either side's winning any substantial advantage in the context of balanced cuts in strategic offensive arms. At the same time, let us emphasize yet again that the criterion of "unacceptable damage" was to all intents and purposes never used as the basis for the adoption of the "final" decision to launch a nuclear strike within the context of the nuclear deterrence doctrine. Its mechanistic meaning (incidentally, if it could have been used as a guideline, then the choice of the time to launch a first strike could easily have been delegated to computers) cannot be related to the huge moral responsibility which a political leader would have to assume when deciding to start a nuclear war. We need only recall the Caribbean crisis, when the correlation of nuclear munitions was 17-1 in favor of the United States. (The Soviet Union had around 290 nuclear munitions, while the Americans had something in the order of 5,000). You can also imagine under what scenario the war in the Persian Gulf would have been played out if Iraq had had a few primitive nuclear munitions at the time. Most probably there would have been no war, and the task of liberating Kuwait would have been resolved by different means. Few people give much thought to the fact that the category of terror and the category of "unacceptable damage" in its psychological dimension are historical categories -- times change, old moral principles and stereotypes are being tightened up and new ones are taking shape; attitudes toward the permissibility and probability of nuclear war are also being reconsidered by the political leaders of the major nuclear powers. Throughout postwar history common sense has never yet deseted them, which has made it possible at least to avert several global nuclear conflicts. There are no grounds for supposing that the current U.S. leaders have "frozen" their idea of what constitutes acceptable damage for their country as a result of an exchange of nuclear strikes with Russia at the level imagined by President Eisenhower. When in 1989 the U.S. plan for a nuclear attack on the USSR, drawn up in 1957, was declassified, environmental specialists were quick to produce a model of the consequences for the United States of launching such a nuclear strike against the USSR. It turned out that if all the planned 180 high-yield atomic and hydrogen bombs were exploded on Soviet territory, the USSR would be guaranteed to cease to exist as a state, but in two or three weeks the level of radioactive fallout on U.S. territory as a result of the natural spread of radioactive dust through atmospheric air currents would be comparable to 60 Chernobyls. Of course, the accuracy of these assessments (from the "greenhouse effect" to "nuclear winter") can be disputed, but one would like to hope that nobody would try to do a real experiment to check them out. More and more experts today are inclined to think that nuclear weapons cannot be used in principle. It is, nevertheless, not possible to wholly agree with this, since the unambiguous exclusion of the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons removes their deterrent effect. You could even use sophistry to prove the opposite. But in practice the basis of deterrence is the probability of the use of nuclear weapons. References to the irrationality of their use and their terrible consequences, which make it impossible to achieve the political aims of a war, are convincing but leave room for doubt. For instance, in August 1914, when World War I was already building up a head of steam in Europe, certain U.S. newspapers thought it appropriate to state something to the effect that the systems (primarily artillery systems) in the sides' arsenals were so destructive that it was difficult even to imagine the consequences of a war -- and therefore there could simply not be a war. Another example is that Indian tradition has it that the events described in the heroic epic "The Mahabharata" (compiled in its present form around the middle of the first millennium) relate to some wars and great social upheavals of the fourth millennium BC. The epic describes various types of what we would now call mass destruction weapons, whose use required a difficult psychological barrier to be overcome. R. Oppenheimer, one of the developers of the atomic bomb, directly associated the Mahabharata's "light brighter than a thousand suns" with a nuclear explosion. For us it is not so important which modern arms systems might correlate to the types of weapons described there. What is important was something else -- there was an entire science behind their use (star-gazing and their own system of combat using "divine weapons"). "No man should ever think of warring with them. Should they fall into the hands of the weak, they could consume this entire transient world. They should always be used as a defense against other weapons. They are wonderful, they cannot be parried, but they can repulse an attack in which any other weapon is used [divnoye, ono neotvratimo, no udar vsyakim drugim oruzhiyem ono otbivayet]." The psychological barrier was nonetheless overcome, and the weapons were used, despite the warning that some types of them would lead to an effect, seen in a modern reading, on the human genetic code. We can only hope that the current system of deterrence will prove more effective. It should not, however, be thought that the existence of nuclear forces under present-day conditions is able to prevent the unleashing of any conventional wars and armed conflicts -- particularly on the periphery of the superpowers' spheres of influence. Since there are a now a multitude of precisely such conflicts, nuclear weapons are not omnipotent. Hence the need to develop conventional systems -- precision weapons. The development of precision weapons is also expedient for another reason -- states (albeit in the very distant future, or at least not in the foreseeable future) may give up nuclear weapons, and the full burden of the task of ensuring deterrence will be borne by conventional weapons systems. This will not happen in one sudden surge, there should be a long period when the task of deterrence is resolved through the combined use of nuclear and conventional systems. But the task of developing precision weapons is very complex, requires the diversion of considerable material and financial expenditure, and will last just as long -- since it depends on the development [razrabotka] not just of precision systems but on computerized reconnaissance, targeting, and guidance networks. Consequently, the basis for its elaboration should be developed right now. But, at the same time, it is necessary to recall that if a state does not have the requisite conventional weapons for deterrence, then it should not destroy its nuclear weapons even if all other states scrapped their nuclear weapons. Otherwise this would lead to a destabilization of the situation and to the possible unleashing of a war or military conflict. Thus, we can conclude that the main role of the Russian strategic nuclear forces should be to continue to safeguard Russia's national security. And the makeup of these forces, the technical features of their systems, the organization of their combat and auxiliary subunits, and so forth should meet two criteria -- first, the ability to effectively deter any aggressor against launching a war; and, second, the ability to put a stop to aggression by ruling out the possibility of a military conflict escalating into large-scale hostilities, to suppress military conflict, and to ensure a quest for compromise in the course of peace talks. From the preceding reflections it becomes clear that we currently have a fundamental opportunity for a fairly broad choice of ways to develop the Russian strategic nuclear forces. It is even permissible to speak of their possible radical restructuring with the complete renouncement of the use of old stereotypes and strategic concepts, as if going back to the very beginning, and, incidentally, the situation reagrding the reappraisal of values in the country as a whole accords with this. However, in the face of the systemic crisis which Russia and other CIS states have found themselves in, tough restrictions, mainly financial ones, have been imposed on the choice of real ways of developing strategic offensive arms. The majority of Russian military specialists agree that only two of them are realistically practicable: Either to "go it alone" and take unilateral steps to reduce the numerical strength of the strategic nuclear forces and change their structure, or else to conduct the modernization of the strategic nuclear forces within the framework of the process of the mutual reduction of strategic nuclear arms with our former main opponent, and then in coordination with other member states of the nuclear club. Circumstances have taken shape in such a way that Russia has taken the second path, which is justified in the present conditions. Although well-founded misgivings exist concerning the possibility of the American side, even within the framework of the restrictions of the START I and START II Treaties, to quickly increase its nuclear potential if the United States were to withdraw from these treaties, the rules of the game which have been adopted are nevertheless better than a situation whereby the Americans could do this without any of the current restrictions. START II, as an important international document, has been the subject of a most careful study by a wide circle of Russian experts. A multitude of articles exists on practically every aspect of the problems of strategic stability, which this treaty raises and broaches. The fact that good work has been done on this question from the viewpoint of information and analysis obviates the need for us to further examine the quantitative and qualitative restrictions which the treaty places on the strategic nuclear potentials of Russia and the United States. It is appropriate to ask oneself just the main question here: Will the treaty preserve strategic stability and will the new level of the nuclear potential estyablished for Russia be sufficient as a deterrent? When analyzing these problems, two focal points in the discussions of various aspects of this treaty must be singled out. This concerns first of all a triadic (Strategic Missile Forces plus Navy and Air Force strategic nuclear forces) or a dyadic (Strategic Missile Forces plus either Navy or Air Force strategic nuclear forces, and so on) structure of the strategic nuclear forces, and the number of nuclear munitions which Russia is authorized to have. Second, the quantitative distribution of the number of munitions among the various components (naval, air, and land-based) of strategic offensive arms. The expediency of a triadic or dyadic structure of strategic nuclear forces for a particular state is determined by its geostrategic position, the capacity of its technical personnel and resources for servicing strategic nuclear weapons, the tactical-technical characteristics of the strategic nuclear forces it has, and the parameters of its means of active counteraction against a potential adversary. Thus, by assessing the aforesaid parameters of the United States' systems, we will obtain practically equal combat capabilities for the land-based and naval components of the U.S. strategic nuclear forces in terms of hitting targets. This testifies to the possibility of the United States transferring to a dyadic (naval and air components) structure of strategic nuclear forces and the elimination of land-based ICBM's. Unlike the United States, an effective strategic nuclear forces structure for Russia which would guarantee the nuclear deterrence of any aggressor in any strategic situations, is a triad: Strategic Missile Forces plus Naval strategic nuclear forces plus Air Force strategic nuclear forces. Excluding the Strategic Missile Forces, the Naval strategic nuclear forces or the Air Force strategic nuclear forces from the triadic structure of Russia's strategic nuclear forces would lead, according to certain calculations, to an increase in the number of nuclear munitions required for deterrence within the strategic nuclear forces by a factor of 1.2-1.6, and in individual strategic situations, to the nonfulfill of the combat mission. This discrepancy in the rational structures whereby the Russian and the U.S. strategic nuclear forces are composed is attributable to the inferior survivability of the naval component of Russia's strategic nuclear forces (see V. Belousov's article) as compared with the analogous parameters of the U.S. strategic nuclear forces. This deficiency in the Russian naval strategic nuclear forces may be compensated for and is compensated for by a Strategic Missile Forces land-based stationary and also road-mobile force. The triadic structure of the Russian strategic nuclear forces provides a guaranteed counter to technological breakthroughs in the military sphere, for example in air defense, ABM defense, or antisubmarine defense. Such a strategic nuclear force structure creates a great deal of uncertainty for a possible aggressor as to the effectiveness of his preemptive strike, and is a factor which stabilizes the strategic equilibrium. Therefore it is impermissible to remove one of the components from the Russian strategic nuclear forces.
