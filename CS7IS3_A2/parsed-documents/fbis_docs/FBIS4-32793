This is being done in accordance with the recently implemented decree-law 149. PRENSA LATINA learned from sources at the Office of the Prosecutor General that these proceedings were initiated after more than 60 homes and 200 vehicles, including cars, trucks, and motorcycles, as well as vehicle spare parts and accessories, were seized. Similar action was taken with many motors, household appliances, clothing, machinery, accessories, raw materials, plastic products, tanks containing fuel, tanks filled with oxygen and acetylene, and exorbitant amounts of grain and animal feed. Meanwhile, GRANMA reported that factory, store, small business, and restaurant administrators, as well as farmers, mechanics, and electricians are among those who have acquired wealth illegally. The article adds that large sums of money, in cash and in bank accounts, were also seized from these people. One of the biggest files belongs to a resident of the western Pinar del Rio Province, who will have to prove legal ownership of two cars, two motorcycles, two rice mills, one corn mill, and a large number of spare parts and accessories, as well as a large amount of oxygen and acetylene. This individual was hoarding many pieces of fake jewelry, more than 250,000 pesos (the same as $250,000 at the official exchange rate) in bank accounts and cash, motors, and food. In all these cases, including those in which it is obvious that illegal activities were committed, those involved will be given time to prove that the goods were acquired legally. If the accused cannot prove this, the file will be sent to the State Committee for Finance and the State Committee for Prices to decide whether or not the goods will be seized. This operation against the so-called hoarders is being conducted in response to requests made by the people during the more than 80,000 meetings at places of work, in accordance with an agreement approved by the parliament and with the decree-law passed by the government.
