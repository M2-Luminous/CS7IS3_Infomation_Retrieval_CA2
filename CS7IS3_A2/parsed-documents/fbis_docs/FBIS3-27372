Liu Jing was sacked from his post as deputy director of Hunan Province's Economic Research and Information Centre and thrown off the centre's Party committee. Lan Jun, former manager of the Hunan Southern Commodity Company, was expelled from the Party. A third official, Zhao Xinsheng, a deputy manager with the commodity company, got a severe warning from the Party. However, an official with the provincial discipline inspection committee said yesterday they were unlikely to face criminal charges. Liu was secretary general of the committee organizing the `93 Flood and Disaster Relief Concerts held in Changsha, on last July 13 and 14 which were sponsored by Liu's centre, the commodity company and Hunan Economic News. They were set up after horrific floods took a terrible toll of lives and property throughout the province last summer. The concerts starred Hong Kong pop singers Sally Yeh and George Lam Chi-cheong. However, newspaper reports said Liu and Lan, together with several of their employees, violated culture management rules by setting up what were actually commercial concerts and selling them as charity events. They drove the price of a pair of tickets as high as 880 yuan ($101) then persuaded various units to buy them. The concerts made 1,384,000 yuan ($159,080). However, Liu and Lan failed to hand 1.150,000 yuan ($132,000) over to the provincial Civil Affairs Bureau as they had promised in contracts. For the commodity company had previously paid 2,290,000 yuan ($263,218), 68 percent of which came from bank loans, to a Hong Kong company to organize the pop stars performances. The sum was well above the concerts' profits and the local government was left to make up the difference. The provincial Auditing Bureau has extracted 810,000 yuan ($93,103) from the Economic Research Centre's account to pay the provincial Civil Affairs Bureau. But another 340,000 yuan ($39,080) has still to be recovered. Since the events, the central government has decided to tighten regulations governing charity performances.
