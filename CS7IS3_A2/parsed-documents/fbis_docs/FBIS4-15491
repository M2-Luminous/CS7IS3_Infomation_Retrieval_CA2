According to Kazimirov the peacemaking mission will attempt to clarify positions regarding the Russian peace plan. Kazimirov noted that because of poor weather he could not arrive in Khankendi [Stepanakert] during his past visit. "The short meeting with several leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh was held half way between Yerevan and Stepanakert, somewhere on the border of Azerbaijan", said Kazimirov. "The peacemaking and mediation missions must be conducted stage by stage, neither side wants its concessions to be announced publicly prematurely, and there has been no concession from the opposite side. That is why we should not hurry," said Kazimirov. As has been earlier announced, Kazimirov arrived in Baku a week ago accompanied by members of the CIS Interparliamentary delegation in order to introduce the peace plan prepared by Russia and presented to the Azeri and Armenian sides. The major points of the plan provide for a cease-fire, the withdrawal from all occupied territories and a revision of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh.
