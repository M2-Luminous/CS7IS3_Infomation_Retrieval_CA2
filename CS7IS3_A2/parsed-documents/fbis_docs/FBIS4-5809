Addressing an annual convention of trust bankers, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said a recovery is in sight on the heels of the latest stimulus measures. "The economy is showing signs of hitting bottom," Mieno said, indicating a firmer view than his latest press comments by dropping off the phrase "on the whole." In a press conference last week, the central bank chief described the economy as "showing signs of hitting bottom on the whole" and said his assessment is "changing delicately." Fujii said, "the time is steadily ripening for the economy to recover...although tough conditions are still continuing." The finance minister earlier said the economy is in "a delicate stage" and statistics to date "have not yet proved the economy has hit bottom." Both Fujii and Mieno cited improvements, led by personal consumption, since early this year. Mieno, stressing that conditions had improved since last year, also said, "various positive factors for an economic recovery have increased over the past year." Japan's economy last year suffered unexpected downward drags such as the yen's sharp appreciation and unusually cool and wet summer, causing it to fall off after showing signs of recovery. Mieno particularly cited progressing inventory adjustments and corporate restructuring, support from fiscal and monetary measures, and recent recovery in economies abroad. Fujii said he is confident that the economy-oriented budget for fiscal 1994 and the record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package launched in February will "greatly contribute" to putting the economy on a full recovery track soon in the current fiscal year. Meanwhile, Mieno noted some prevailing concerns, such as spreading labor cutbacks, a possible further rise of the yen, and ongoing write-offs of losses incurred by financial institutions and companies after the collapse of the economic bubble of the late 1980s. Keeping in mind these possible downward pressures, Mieno said, "a further cautious watch is necessary" to see if the improvement in some areas is sustainable and can spread to overall business activities. He said he will carefully monitor monetary and economic developments. Considering liquidation of bad loans, both Fujii and Mieno gave high marks to voluntary efforts by financial institutions, and called for further moves in line with market and other deregulatory steps taken recently by the financial authorities.
