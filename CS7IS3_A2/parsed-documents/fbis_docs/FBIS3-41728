Last week 147 persons infected by this disease were brought to the hospital. The diphtheria situation is no less complex in the Moscow suburbs. According to specialists the growth of the incidence of diphtheria is explained on one hand by the fact that ``a total victory over diphtheria by medical personnel in the USSR'' was officially announced in the mid-1970s, which led to an unexcusable decrease in attention toward this disease. On the other hand the debate that arose several years ago in the press on vaccinations forced many to avoid precautionary measures which they felt to be unsafe. As a result a rise began in the disease in countries of the former USSR in the mid-1980s. Moscow is one of the most dangerous regions from the standpoint of development of a diphtheria epidemic. Since the beginning of this year 1,140 cases of illness were recorded, including 234 among children. (For comparison: In all of last year 774 diphtheria patients, including 123 children, were registered by institutions of the city's Main Medical Administration.) At first glance the situation in the Moscow suburbs does not seem so frightening--316 patients in 8 months; however, even this figure is double that for all of 1992. According to specialists of the city's Main Medical Administration a certain decline in the epidemic was noted in July-August, associated primarily with the vacation season; however, growth of the number of patients was registered in late August. A total of 56 persons succumbed to this infectious disease in Moscow; four of them were children. According to unofficial data each week an average of two or three persons die from diphtheria in Moscow. In the opinion of medical personnel death is guaranteed almost 100 percent for anyone who falls ill and is not immunized against diphtheria. The social status of diphtheria patients has changed considerably: While last year 100 percent of persons dying from diphtheria were chronic alcoholic patients, now this disaster has fallen upon new social groups. The risk carried by those whose professional responsibilities include communicating with broad strata of people is greater than that of others. Specialists agree unanimously that the sole solution to the situation is diphtheria immunization, which may be obtained in both a rayon polyclinic and in hard-currency clinics and medical centers.
