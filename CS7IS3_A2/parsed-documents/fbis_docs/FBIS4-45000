The Nobel peace prize winner, the Dalai Lama, has decided to shift his headquarters from the hill town of Dharamsala. In all probability, the spiritual and temporal head of the Tibetans will move his base to the outskirts of Bangalore. This decision follows a spate of violence, arson and looting which the Tibetan community in Dharamsala has been subjected to in the last fortnight. The Dalai Lama made his decision known when the former BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] chief minister, Mr. Shanta Kumar, visited him at his residence in the presence of this correspondent. Mr. Shanta Kumar apologised for the violence which followed the death of a Gaddi youth at the hands of a Tibetan. The movement against the Tibetans has, much to the embarrassment of the BJP, been spear-headed by the party's local MLA [member of Legislative Assembly], Mr. Krishen Kapoor. Later, in an exclusive interview, the Dalai Lama expressed his deep hurt at the manner in which the Tibetans had been stone-walled by sections of the local community. "I am very, very sad that an individual incident has, unfortunately, been allowed to be manipulated by local politicians and this makes it very serious," he said. "Perhaps in a small town, the presence of a few thousand Tibetans is conspicuous. My presence here and that of the central administration, too, makes the Tibetans here stand out. To avoid a conflict becoming a major problem in the future, it is best that I move out of Dharamsala," he said. Expressing his deep gratitude to the Indian government for providing refuge to almost 100,000 Tibetans (of which 6,000 live in Dharamsala), the Dalai Lama, however, clarified that the choice of Dharamsala as his base was not one taken by him out of choice. "It was at the insistence of the Government of India in 1960, when I was informed that Mussourie was only a temporary arrangement, that I shifted to Dharamsala with reluctance. I have always been in favour of being closer to Delhi," he said. He added that on every subsequent occasion when he had attempted to move out of Dharamsala -- to Simla in the '60s and later in 1988 when his community felt that earthquake-prone Dharamsala was unsafe for him -- the local community had appealed to him not to shift his residence. "But this time I have been faced with a human earth-quake -- I think the time has come for me to move and, if possible, I will move to Bangalore," he informed. The decision of the Dalai Lama has taken the local Tibetan community, and his government-in-exile, by shock. For many, this has been their only home since their flight from Tibet almost 35 years ago. But, as the elderly Ms. Kunga whose shop was looted and attacked by an unruly mob, points out, "I have never felt more intimidated -- not even by the Chinese." The situation in the hill-resort has remained tense despite section 144 being revoked on April 27. While there has been no fresh spate of violence against the Tibetans, every new day witnesses a fresh turn to the current impasse. Just yesterday, Dharamsala awoke to pamphlets strewn all over the Tibetan-dominated McLeod Gunj area which screamed in Hindi, "This is a special warning to all Tibetans. If you people do not leave Dharamsala by July 25, we will bomb you out..." This is in addition to a series of memorandums and resolutions which the local politicians have been regularly signing asking for the immediate expulsion of Tibetans from Dharamsala. Despite this, the local administration refuses to accept that there is any cause for concern. The deputy commissioner, Ms. Manisha Sridhar, when contacted, said, "I do not think that this is a big issue -- it can easily be sorted out. I think that the press has unnecessarily blown it up." While admitting the incidents of arson, violence and looting, Ms. Sridhar, however, felt that it would be unwise for her to make any immediate arrests against those who led the mobs as it might aggravate the tension. She informed that 14 reserves of police force had been placed on duty as a precautionary measure. The local politicians -- both Mr. Kapoor of the BJP and Ms. Chandresh Kumari of the Congress -- remain vituperative in their attack against the Tibetans, accusing them of everything from drug and arms smuggling to being condescending and insensitive to the local population.
