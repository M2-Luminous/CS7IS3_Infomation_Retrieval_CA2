Two groups of legislators from the DPP, Taiwan's major opposition party, on May 25 and May 31 separately showed local reporters the document they claimed Lien issued as a Kuomintang member. The DPP claimed the document is clear evidence that the KMT-controlled administrative branch is trying to convey benefits to KMT members, and asked Premier Lien to step down. The Executive Yuan issued a stern warning to the DPP on Tuesday and emphasized that the document is fabricated and intends to mislead the public. It also vowed to track down those involved in circulating the document. Meanwhile, President Li Teng-hui, speaking in his capacity as KMT chairman before the decision-making Central Standing Committee, demanded that an investigation be made into the incident to clear Lien's name. Vice Premier Hsu Li-teh told the committee that the document displayed by the DPP does not conform to the original written by Lien, either by content or by the date it was circulated. Wu Chung-li, the deputy director-general of the Government Information Office, announced later in the day that the original Lien document will be publicized on Thursday.
