The bidding, organized by the Ministry for Environmental Protection, Natural Resources, and Forestry, is restricted to foreign bidders. Consider that the first round of the bidding resulted in granting licenses for oil and gas prospecting in Poland to the following companies: Amoco, to prospect for and explore oil and gas deposits in central and southeastern Poland and methane in black-coal seams in Upper Silesia; and British Gas, to prospect for and explore oil and gas deposits in central Poland. A similar license for another segment of central Poland was granted to the Exxon-Shell Consortium. The above-named companies also intend to participate in the second round of bidding, and such renowned companies as Mobil, Texaco, and Pan Canadian are also expected to participate. Prospecting in the zones allocated as a result of the first bidding could commence as early as this spring, except that the absence of suitable agreements with the Polish Ministry of Finance is an impediment. That is because the prospecting companies try, as is the custom worldwide in such situations, to debit investment start-up expenditures to operating expenses. Under the regulations in force, they are tax-exempt during the first three years of their operation, but the start-up period (which may involve expenditures roughly totaling $150 million) may last as long as six years. Accordingly, the prospecting companies desire tax deferment for seven to 10 years in a row, and the capitalization of their expenditures after the start-up period. In addition, they desire exemption from the VAT [value-added tax]. Such terms appear to be highly preferential, slanted in favor of oil and gas prospectors (or rather prospectors for gas and eventually oil), especially considering how well-heeled they are. But several other factors have to be considered here. First, it is not that Exxon-Shell, Amoco, or Texaco needs Poland. On the contrary, by letting these companies in, we could save $150 million that would otherwise have to be paid from our budget. Second, these companies are too mighty to place them in the role of a petitioner for something that is normally granted worldwide to oil and gas prospectors. For them to include Poland is no big deal, whereas to us this is highly important. There still remains the sensitive issue of the role and place of a domestic prospector--namely, Polish Oil and Gas Extraction Corporation (PGNiG). "Our agreement with the PGNiG divides Poland into two zones," explained Director Marek Hofman at the Department of Natural Resources, in the Ministry for Environmental Protection, Natural Resources, and Forestry." The first zone encompasses areas in which development is already under way and deposits have been explored and are generally easier to develop. Segments of the second zone are successively opened to bidding by oil and gas prospectors. These segments exist in exceptionally difficult geological conditions and are highly risky." Because we are on the subject, we will conclude with some good news. Petrobaltic, by now in its capacity as a purely Polish company, intends any day now to initiate the development of Section B-3 in the Baltic, which is considered highly promising. Prospecting in the Polish shelf [of the Baltic Sea] is to be continued.
