It has never been a question of a sale, but only a lease contract between the Haitian state and officials of Port Tortuga S.A., said Minister Dejoie. I have never granted a portion of the national territory to any foreign company, Dejoie said at the conclusion of his conversation with the Commerce and Industry Commission of the lower chamber. The commerce [and industry] minister was responding to the convening of the commission about the Port Tortuga matter on 23 March. The PAIN [National Agricultural and Industrial Party] leader demanded a meeting in camera as he refused to provide explanations to the deputies in the presence of journalists. The Port Tortuga matter is nothing but a lease contract binding the Haitian State and the officials of that company for the exploitation of a portion of Mole Saint-Nicolas, according to Louis Dejoie: [Begin recording] [Dejoie] There has never been a sale of land, either by Minister Dejoie nor the preceding [commerce] ministers, to a foreign company at any time. [passage omitted] No contract has actually been signed between the Haitian state and Port Tortuga S.A. A draft contract was sent to [Minister of Finances and Economy] Rey -- who is also a party to this project -- for her signature. She has not signed. She did not want to sign -- (?according to) a letter I received from her -- [prior to] certain formalities. [passage omitted] "I have signed no contract." [passage omitted] This is a draft contract between the Haitian state and a company called Port Tortuga for the exploitation of something touristic. [Unidentified reporter] Louis Dejoie II says he is waiting for apologies from the head of state if [Aristide] really asked him to put an end to illegal activities. The PAIN leader pointed out that he has never received any request from President Aristide about Port Tortuga S.A. [Dejoie] [Passage omitted] "I do not really know whether President Aristide made such a statement. But if he did," which counters even all that I have said here -- and everybody has evidence that Dejoie (?could) never sell or alienate a tiny plot of land -- I am waiting for retractions from the president of the Republic. [Unidentified journalist] "So, he has not asked you (?to do) anything?" [Dejoie] "He has not asked me (?to do) anything. I have received nothing from the president. Neither would he dare ask me for something like that when I have done nothing contrary to the law." What I can tell you is that I believe in the honesty of the president of the Republic, who would not say such things if he did not have information. "In my opinion, leaflets saying that Dejoie has done this and that have been sent out." [Journalist] "Will you give up the project?" [Dejoie] No, the project cannot be given up. "The government has resigned. A new government has to be established and take care of it." [end recording]
