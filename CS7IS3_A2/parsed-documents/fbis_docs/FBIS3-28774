U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor earlier in the day announced the suspension of working-level negotiations until Hata's arrival in the hope that a Japanese political decision could lead to a breakthrough. The talks, which had resumed in Washington early this week, stalled due to a squabble over how to measure Japan's efforts to open its auto and other markets. Hata is to join Friday's summit meeting between Prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton.
