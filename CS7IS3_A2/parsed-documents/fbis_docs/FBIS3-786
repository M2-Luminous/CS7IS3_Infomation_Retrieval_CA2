The chief minister, who is also the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, on Sunday said: "What they did to Bophuthatsawna they want to do to kwaZulu." His warning followed the uprising in the Bophuthatsawna homeland which subsequently led to the overthrow of its leader Lucas Mangope. Addressing academics on a one-day election tour of Pretoria and th East Rand, both as statesman and National Party leader Mr de Klerk said: "There is no basis whatsoever for such an accusation." "In terms of the interim constitution and the Electoral Act, the kwaZulu government can govern until the election comes." He warned, however, that the IFP decision not to participate in the election "creates a dangerous situation". He appealed to both Mr Buthelezi and the African National Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela to control their followers in the run-up to the election. Regarding the handling of the Bophuthatswana crisis, Mr de Klerk said the ANC had created the impression "via the TEC [Transitional Executive Council]" that the ANC was in control of the situation. Mr de Klerk said the South African Government was in control of the crisis from the first signs of possible trouble in the homeland. He slammed the propagandistic inferences that the government "was sitting on its hands" throughout the crisis. The next destination on the De Klerk roadshow included a short stopover in the predominantly Indian area of Laudium, west of Pretortia. About 1,200 NP [National Party] supporters welcomed Mr de Klerk in a parking lot behind the Laudium shopping centre. Mr de Klerk again highlighted the NP's economic policy which he said was in line with policies which had created wealth in countries like America, France, Germany and Japan. Mr de Klerk criticised the ANC's economic policy which he said was based on policies which had led to poverty in countries like Mozambique, Poland and Russia. A small group of ANC supporters waving ANC banners and posters also turned up to hear Mr de Klerk speak amidst some heckling and toyi-toying. Mr de Klerk thanked the ANC supporters for allowing him to speak to his supporters. Mr de Klerk's next stop will be Sandton, north of Johannesburg, where he will address members of the business sector.
