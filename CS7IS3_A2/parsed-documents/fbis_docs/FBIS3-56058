I give the floor--an opportunity to ask a question--to our guests, to journalists from the United States of America. [Correspondent, in English] (?Walt Lister) of CNN. What exactly must your parliament now do to ratify this agreement, and exactly how long will it take for Ukraine to become a non-nuclear nation? [Kravchuk] Philosophers say everything is changing in this world. Life is changing. One cannot even step twice in the same place in a river. This is why our parliament, as life goes on, is becoming wiser. Our parliament, as life goes on, sees the realities. I am convinced that it will understand the essence of the great problem that is facing the world today, the essence of our relations. With the mutual desire of the three states--the United States of America, Ukraine, and Russia--we will fulfill our obligations, and the parliament will support us. Now, a question from the Ukrainian side, please. [passage omitted] [Kravchuk] On the American side, please. A lady there. [Correspondent, in English] Thank you, and happy birthday, President Kravchuk! [passage omitted] [Kravchuk] Thank you for your congratulations, and I would like to express my satisfaction with the gentlemanliness of our correspondent here, who mentioned Mrs. Clinton. Of course, I would be glad if she were here, and we all could see her. Now, again I give an opportunity to a lady. Maybe I will receive yet another greeting from her. [Correspondent] I echo the previous greeting, and I would like to ask this question: There is a shortage at times of those who are supposed to fulfill programs. In other words, they are unwilling to go to Ukraine because of the uncertain situation there. Where are the guarantees that the agreements that were achieved today will be implemented? [Kravchuk] If I were to answer this question, I would say that the guarantees are here in Ukraine. We will receive the attitude that we deserve according to the results of our work. Abstract guarantees do not exist. [Clinton] If I might add just one point: Sometimes in discussions with nations, some actual guarantees do not materialize because they are dependent on decisions made by other parties--usually the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. In this case, every part of our agreement depends only upon the three presidents and their governments to keep their word. And I told-- the first thing I said to--President Kravchuk tonight is that I would do everything I could to make sure that all three of us did exactly what was in the agreement, and I am confident that we will. [Kravchuk] I have the greatest responsibility. I feel it as a press secretary--that there is a protocol. However, this is the last question, and I must allow you to ask it. [Correspondent, in English] Mr. President. Mr. President Clinton. You mentioned the PFP--the Partnership for Peace--and there are some people who say that Russia has been using a type of passive imperialism in order to keep countries of Eastern Europe and Central Europe out of NATO for the time being by threatening destabilization. Do you agree with that? And I would be very interested in what President Kravchuk has to say. [Clinton] No, I don't. I think.... [interrupted by interpreter who translates question into Ukrainian] The short answer to the question is that I do not agree with that, although President Yeltsin himself has expressed reservations about NATO membership for other countries if Russia is excluded. He, you know, he has expressed an interest in being a member himself. The leaders of NATO concluded that they should not offer membership at this time to any country because they weren't sure any country was ready to assume the responsibilities of membership and because they did not want to exclude anyone else. [passage omitted] [Kravchuk] Mr. Clinton came to my help, and I give the right to the Ukrainian side to ask one more question. [Correspondent] Which security guarantees will be provided by the United States and Russia to Ukraine after it acquires a non-nuclear status? [passage omitted] [Kravchuk] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen. I would like to use yet another opportunity to say that we will compensate for our brief meeting with additional meetings, where we will begin to fulfill our obligations. You will contribute to this with unbiased coverage of the events in Ukraine and Ukraine's role in Europe and in the world. It would be best now to wish President Clinton a good journey. Good-bye.
