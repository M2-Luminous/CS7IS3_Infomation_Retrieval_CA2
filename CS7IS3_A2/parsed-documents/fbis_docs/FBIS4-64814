FBIS4-64814 "drweu089_q_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-089 Daily Report 4 May 1994 TURKEY Iraqi Ambassador Calls For Cooperation on Kurds Iraqi Ambassador Calls For Cooperation on Kurds NC0605183594 Istanbul TERCUMAN in Turkish 4 May 94 p 7 NC0605183594 Istanbul TERCUMAN Turkish BFN [Text] Al-Tikriti, Iraq's ambassador to Turkey and a relative of Saddam Husayn, said that Turkey should cooperate with Iraq to establish [kurulmasi--no negative as published] a Kurdish state in the region. Ambassador al-Tikriti said: "The project of creating a Kurdish state incorporating Iraq and Turkey is Britain's. The United States supports this project." He gave assurances to Turkey, saying: "If the Hammer Force leaves, we will not allow even a single PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] militant to take shelter in northern Iraq." Iraqi Ambassador to Ankara al-Tikriti assessed the latest developments in the region during his visit to our paper's Ankara bureau. Indicating that the Turkey-Iraqi oil pipeline will rust unless the oil is flushed out, al-Tikriti said: "Iraq owes some $1 billion to Turkey. We told Turkey: Take the oil in the pipeline to enable us to pay our debt; and moreover, do not give the remaining money to us in the form of foreign currency, we want foodstuffs. But, the United Nations will not give permission to Turkey. Turkey is hurt from the embargo the most. At present, BOTAS [Turkish Pipeline and Oil Transportation Company] buys oil from other countries at $19 per barrel. It also pays $1.50 for the transportation of each barrel. Were the oil pipeline open, this transportation price would not be paid. That is why BOTAS is losing $1 billion every year. We want to act within the framework of UN resolutions, but we are being obstructed. Because of the embargo, 4,500 children in Iraq die every week." "Cooperation Is a Must" Indicating that the establishment of a Kurdish state in northern Iraq will considerably undermine the regional stability and that the real damage will be done to Turkey, al-Tikriti said: "This is because there are more Kurds in Turkey than in Iraq. The Kurds' goal is obvious. They want to set up a large Kurdish state in the region. They have even published maps. These maps were shown on one of your television programs. The West does not want stability in our region. Turkey and Iraq are face to face with a plot. The project of creating a Kurdish state in the region belongs to the British. The United States is supporting this project." Indicating that Turkey and Iraq should cooperate to prevent the implementation of this project, al-Tikriti said: "Otherwise, a Kurdish state will be established." Guarantee Given to Turkey Noting that prior to the Gulf crisis no such tension and disorder existed in the region, al-Tikriti said that at the time Iraq gave importance to Turkey's security. Asking "where was the PKK before the Gulf crisis?" al-Tikriti said: "The PKK will vanish if the Hammer Force leaves and the oil pipeline is opened. At present, the PKK is being protected and sheltered by the Kurds in northern Iraq. Ask the Hammer Force to leave. Once the Hammer Force leaves, our government will restore authority in the region. Not even one single PKK militant will remain in northern Iraq. PKK is a terror organization. Besides, Turkey's security is important to us." Asked what Iraq's position towards the Kurds will be once the Hammer Force leaves, al-Tikriti replied: "We gave official guarantees to Ozal in the past, and later to Demirel. We told them that we would not oppress the Kurds."
