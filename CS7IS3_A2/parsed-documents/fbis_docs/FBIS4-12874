The misunderstanding could be attributed to lopsided perception of India's policies in Washington. President Bill Clinton had deputed Mr. Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state in the U.S. Administration, to visit New Delhi and remove the misunderstanding. Mr. Talbott stated in New Delhi: My government attaches considerable significance to my visit. President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher had asked me to come to India in order to consult Prime Minister Rao and other officials of the Indian Government on confidence [words indistinct] in which we can put together new impetus and new scope to U.S.-India relations. It became clear at the end of Mr. Talbott's two-day visit that there was no American tilt toward any country and India and the United States was poised to turn a new leaf in bilateral relations. The sharp reaction evoked in India on Assistant Secretary of State Ms. Robin Raphel's controversial statement on Kashmir was more than clarified when Mr. Talbott categorically stated that it was for India and Pakistan to resolve the problem themselves in accordance with the Simla Agreement. India's concern on delivery of more F-16 aircraft was conveyed to Mr. Talbott in clear terms. The supply will be also against the goal of U.S. Government's declared policy to help in reducing tension in South Asia and discourage arms races between India and Pakistan. Mr. Talbott acknowledged at the conclusion of his visit that the greatest threat to India's security was from Pakistan's nuclear program. Then, when the United States is trying to make one-time exception to the Pressler Amendment on the ground that is further U.S. nonproliferation goals in South Asia. [sentence as heard] Pakistan has developed nuclear weapon capability clandestinely. This is in clear violation of bilateral understanding with Washington. Earlier, the U.S. had given 40 F-16 aircraft to Pakistan as a reward for their assurance that they would not go nuclear. Now, it seems the U.S. would like to reward Islamabad with another 38 planes for having gone nuclear. Until recently, the U.S. was stating categorically that even if the Pressler Amendment was deleted, Pressler standards will continue to apply. This position was rather given up suddenly and now one-time lifting of the Pressler Amendment is being advocated. This will leave Pakistan's nuclear arsenal developed secretly intact. No longer can a case be made that these aircraft are required by Pakistan to combat communism, or the Soviet Union, or the threat to Pakistan's security from Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The sole target of U.S. supplied F-16's today can be in India. Mr. Talbott, said to be close to President Clinton, was also told that as part of the dialogue opened at India's initiative, Pakistan was urged to undertake various confidence-building measures both in conventional and nuclear fields. Both the countries have an agreement not to attack each other's nuclear installations. India has now offered Pakistan an agreement not to bomb each other's population centers and economic targets as well as an agreement not to use nuclear capabilities against each other. Pakistan is still reluctant to pursue seriously this dialogue. This attitude will undoubtedly get a boost by any U.S. decision to strengthen Pakistan's military capability against India. Mr. Talbott appreciated India's economic reforms. The U.S. has now become the largest single investor in India. President Bill Clinton is also under pressure from powerful business lobby to ensure that the big Indian market is not jeopardized because of the political considerations. This is one reason for U.S. keenness to improve relations with India. The main irritant in Indo-U.S. relations is the issue of supply of additional F-16 planes to Pakistan. The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has said that acquisition of F-16 fighter aircraft by Pakistan would disturb the security environment and escalate tension which would lead to an arms race in the region. It appears almost certain that the prime minister will visit U.S. some time next month in response to Bill Clinton's personal invitation to him. The only hitch could be supply of F-16 planes to Pakistan.
