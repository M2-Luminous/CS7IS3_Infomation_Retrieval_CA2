He said that the programme of the meeting of Hungarian representatives, to be held in Komarno tomorrow, had originally included the establishment of a civic association of elected representatives of the Hungarian minority, but the Slovak Interior Ministry had said it would not register such a body. There was no sense in establishing an body with no legal competence, Pasztor said. The meeting was expected to pass a resolution which will serve as a basis for the programmes of political parties and for further debate in parliament, he said. Tomorrow's meeting is open only to elected representatives of towns and villages, parliamentary deputies, journalists and invited guests, Pasztor said. Representatives from all the foreign embassies in Bratislava and from the Council of Europe had been invited to the meeting, which would be conducted in Hungarian, with translation provided into Slovak and English.
