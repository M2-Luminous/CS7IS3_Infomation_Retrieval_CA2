Hosokawa made the remarks during a session of the House of Councillors Budget Committee before it passed the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993. The extra budget was finally approved as it was passed at the plenary session of the upper house. The premier said the U.S. has been "irritated" by its trade deficits with Japan of more than 50 billion dollars annually. "I am afraid similar problems may repeatedly occur one after another unless signs of improvement come out visibly," said Hosokawa, referring to a U.S. announcement last week which unveiled steps to impose sanctions against Japan in a dispute over access to the Japanese cellular phone market. The announcement was made a few days after Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to strike a deal on a new framework to slash Japan's trade surplus. Hosokawa said he wants to find a way to solve the trade imbalance, stressing the importance of relations between Japan and the U.S. "We should make every effort to stabilize Japan-U.S. relations. It is not only a bilateral relationship but has impacts on Asia and Pacific regions," Hosokawa said, adding the U.S. presence in the region gives a sense of security to other countries in the region. The prime minister also said he is aiming for an alliance of ruling parties to compete with the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the next general election of the House of Representatives. He said the seven ruling parties cannot win the election if they field separate candidates. Hosokawa, however, denied he is after a two-party system. "I have said Japanese politics will become a moderate multiparty system, not a two-party system. I still think so," he said. The prime minister reportedly wants to remove Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who is opposed to the two-party system. Takemura and former SDP [Social Democratic Party] Chairman Sadao Yamahana, also state minister in charge of political reform, voiced their support during the session for a multiparty system. Hosokawa said he will decide whether to reshuffle the cabinet after hearing the opinion of governmental and ruling parties' officials.
