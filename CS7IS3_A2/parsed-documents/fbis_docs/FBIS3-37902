"The president will react calmly, without emotions. He will give a moral assessment of the event", Vyacheslav Kostikov told reporters on Thursday. However, the spokesman himself believes the implementation of the Duma decision would result in "a serious destabilisation", will be detrimental to Russian national interests and will affect the foreign policy. Kostikov hinted that the amnesty to rebels may not be implemented because of a "possible war of juridical interpretations". "If the Constitution says that the State Duma declares amnesty it does not mean that it adopts a decision on it", Kostikov said adding that "the amnesty in its political part is immoral" because it frees those who are responsible for the death of people.
