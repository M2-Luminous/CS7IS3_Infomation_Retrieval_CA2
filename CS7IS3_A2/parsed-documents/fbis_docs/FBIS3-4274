During the function, attendees extensively exchanged views, and conscientiously discussed transformation of enterprise operational mechanisms, establishment of a modern enterprise system, and formation of an entrepreneurs' contingent. They stated: It is necessary to continue to carry forward the spirit of daring to be the first in the world advocated by 55 factory directors and managers 10 years ago to explore the way forward, deepen enterprise reform, and speed up the pace of establishing a modern enterprise system. Jia Qinglin, provincial CPC committee secretary and governor, attended and addressed the function. He said: March 24 is a day which deserves commemoration by entrepreneurs. Ten years ago today, 55 factory directors and managers jointly urged the higher authorities to delegate power. They played a promoting role in enterprise reform and evoked greater repercussions in the society. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, as in various other parts of the country, a number of enterprises with good management, high efficiency, and vigorous mechanisms have also appeared in Fujian. In particular, these enterprises have integrated themselves into the market economy in accordance with international practice and accumulated experiences for establishing a modern enterprise system. This has forcefully promoted sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. Jia Qinglin pointed out: To invigorate state-owned enterprises, medium and large enterprises in particular, the fundamental solution lies in deepening reform, transforming operational mechanisms, and establishing a modern enterprise system. At present, on the one hand, we must grasp well the implementation of existing measures. On the other hand, we must continue to explore new ways to further enforce enterprise laws and regulations, so that enterprises can truly become corporate bodies which cater to the needs of the market and main market competitors as well. In conclusion, Jia Qinglin hoped that the majority of entrepreneurs will continue to carry forward the spirit of daring to be the first in the world, and the spirit of initiative, self- reliance, self-support, and self-renewal, and rely on and unite with the broad masses of workers and staff members to explore how to run modern enterprises. CPC committees and governments at all levels, relevant departments, and various quarters in the society must show concern for, support, and cherish entrepreneurs, and create a fine environment and conditions for carrying out enterprise reform well.
