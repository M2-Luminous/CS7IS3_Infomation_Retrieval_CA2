FR941206-2-00033 FR941206-2-00025 [Project No. 10625&hyph;001] Kittitas Reclamation District; Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment November 30, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 F.R. 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a license for the Taneum Chute Hydroelectric Project, located on the Kittitas Reclamation Districts', Taneum Chute irrigation canal near the city of Ellensburg, Washington, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment. Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Any comments should be filed within 30 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC., 20426. Please affix ``Taneum Chute Hydroelectric Project, FERC No. 10625&hyph;001'' to all comments. For further information, contact Gaylord W. Hoisington at (202) 219&hyph;2756. Lois D.
