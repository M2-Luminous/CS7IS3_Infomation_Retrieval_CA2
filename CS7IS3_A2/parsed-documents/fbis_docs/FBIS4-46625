It must now be realized that the Black Sea zone is a zone of specific interests, both for Ukraine and for Russia. The question of the Black Sea Fleet must be resolved proceeding from that as well. It seems to me, indicated Oleksandr Moroz, that we should provide guarantees to the officers and warrant officers of the Black Sea Fleet with regard to their treatment, and to all Ukrainians with regard to their rights, while working concurrently on the creation of our own fleet.
