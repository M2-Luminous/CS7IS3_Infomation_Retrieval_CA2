According to the television station, which allegedly has a copy of the letter, Bergman demanded Grachev's consent in `deposing the Dniester Republic's leadership.' The 14th Army command calls the `intentional misinformation' broadcast by the television station as an attempt to involve the Russian top leadership in the current dirty political intrigues. The press center notes that they contacted the Russian defense ministry and that no letter has been received from Colonel Bergman. The defense ministry also said that if such a letter had been received, it would have been sent to General Lebed to take 'proper measures against instigators.' The 14th Army commander was compelled to send the Russian defense ministry the entire text of the letter allegedly written by Bergman." "The analysis of the letter shows the complicity of certain structures of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic in destabilizing the social-political situation and the justification of the extension of the state of emergency," states the 14th Army press center.
