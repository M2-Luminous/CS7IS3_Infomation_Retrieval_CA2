Let us listen to the Guatemalan president: [Begin recording] [De Leon] [Words indistinct] in the same building, he was my teacher, and was specially recognized as a jurist. The Guatemalan people appreciated him greatly as a lawyer. Finally, he was president of the Constitutional Court, a mandate that was about to end. He did an outstanding job there, not only during the 25 May incidents, in which we returned to the institutional and constitutional order that had been broken by former President Jorge Serrano Elias, but during recent actions carried out by the court. He recently ruled that the electoral and political party law was unconstitutional. [Words indistinct] his actions as head of this court, the highest in the country in charge of constitutional matters. It has been a hard blow for me personally. I appreciated him greatly; we were friends. And from the institutional point of view, as president I regretted his death from the moment I learned of it. I was not in the capital but I ordered the necessary investigations and we hope there is sufficient evidence to locate the criminals. We do not have the words to express our sorrow. We cannot understand how it could have happened to a person who loved peace and freedom for which he fought. Once again the Guatemalan family has to deal with an act of violence. Guatemala is going through difficult moments from the point of view of citizen's security and the government is willing to take all the necessary measures to restrain this wave of violence, which is adversely affecting all social classes. As we said in the beginning, this is something for which we cannot find the necessary words to explain [words indistinct] no matter from where it comes. [Unidentified reporter] [Question indistinct] [De Leon] We do not know yet. The truth is that [words indistinct] enough evidence. Today the Government Ministry, through its experts, will reveal details of the unfortunate incident. We cannot confirm or rule out anything [words indistinct]. [Reporter] [Question indistinct] [De Leon] We do not really know what the reason was [words indistinct]. [end recording] The president said that up until now, this incident could not be described as a political crime, but that at 1600 [2200 GMT] the Government Ministry will reveal the results of the preliminary investigation.
