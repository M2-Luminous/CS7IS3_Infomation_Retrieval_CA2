Spokesman for the Ukrainian Navy Oleg Chubuk told TASS on Tuesday that the radar stops functioning because "the Black Sea Fleet has not expressed readiness to cooperate with the Ukrainian Navy in running the facility and exchanging data monitored in the north-western part of the Black Sea". According to the source, the fleet command has twice ignored Ukrainian messages requesting such cooperation. The Black Sea Fleet operates a network of radars called "Mars", one of which is located near Odessa. Tensions between the Ukrainian and Black Sea Navies flared up last month when radar equipment was transferred from Odessa to the fleet's main base in Sevastopol without Ukrainian consent.
