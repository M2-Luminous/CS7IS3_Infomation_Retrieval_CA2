Well, very positive signs are now emerging from the talks that have been going on in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, since November. It seems, the representatives of the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] government and the rebel movement, UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola], have reached agreement on many of the crucial points. The first sign of this emerged on Monday when it was announced that they had agreed on the future composition of the police force. Well, mediating at those talks has been the UN's envoy to Angola, Alioune Blondin Beye. Up to now, he has been reluctant to discuss the progress of the talks with the media, but last night he was only too happy to tell us what has been happening. Ndai Auhami has called him up in Lusaka and asked him first if the progress was so substantial that the war in Angola was now over. [Begin recording] [Beye, in French fading into English translation] No, one cannot say that because, although we have, well, sorted out the reinstatement of the cease-fire, we have not yet proclaimed it. It will not come into place yet because we have chosen a global accord, and it is only when the global accord is finished that we will be able to say that the war in Angola is finished. [Auhami] Mr. Blondin Beye, what about the withdrawal from areas occupied since the elections, and the acceptance of the election results? [Beye] This question has been definitely solved. A letter signed by UNITA addressed to the UN secretary general formally accepts to withdraw from occupied zones after the elections, and this withdrawal has been programmed, and is already solved militarily, and will be under UN supervision when the time comes. Its principles and modalities have already been negotiated. [Auhami] Does UNITA accept the results of the election? [Beye] UNITA has formally declared at the beginning of the Lusaka talks, and already during the exploratory talks of Lusaka-I that it formally accepted the September's 92 election results and their consequences. [Auhami] It is a very big breakthrough in Lusaka, so what is going to happen now? [Beye] Yes, since Monday [31 January] when the police question was resolved, we can say that we are at a turning point, as a sportsman climbing a mountain, who has made a great effort to reach the top. With the police question we have reached the top of the mountain, and we are now starting the downward slope. Indeed, very substantial and significant progress has been made, and with the solution to the police question, it is a significant move forward. What is left now is to be patient still to negotiate in the same conditions, and to count on the same political will of the government and UNITA, and count on the press' understanding that they should let us work in private which has worked so well for us. [Auhami] So, in your mind, is the killing in Angola over, the bloodshed over? [Beye] Yes, I am one of those who sincerely regrets that UNITA and the government are still having fatal combats. It is high time now that the political will is paramount, and now that the choice has been made to solve the Angola crisis not by military means, but by negotiations, the time has come to put an end to the Angola tragedy, that Angolans stop killing each other unnecessarily as peace is near at hand. So, if the negotiations are solved, as I hope they will be, I hope the Angola tragedy will end. We took time, but we didn't waste our time. We preferred to negotiate seriously and in depth to leave nothing out, to leave no problem aside, and attack each question resolutely and in detail in order that this time the peace be a durable and real one, and that Angola finally know peace. [Auhami] How long do you think you are going to stay in Lusaka? Are you going to stay for more than two weeks, three weeks, a month? [Beye] I must be very modest. It would be very pretentious of me to be able to predict on such a difficult question as Angola. Five centuries of colonization, 15 years of freedom fighting, 17 years of fratricide fighting do not get resolved in a few months or weeks. We must have time to solve this question. What the international community does not accept is the [words indistinct] to stay put. Other than that we are ready to invest the time necessary as long as each day marks progress, that each day means a step toward peace. We will not accept staying put, but if everyday we can make progress, we are ready to go slowly. [end recording]
