Trapped in the web of the Cuban-U.S. dispute, used by several U.S. Administrations in their campaigns against the island, the emigrants witnessed in the past decades how their relations with their country of origin have became tangled and have felt an isolation that goes beyond the family circle. The conference, convoked by the Cuban Foreign Ministry, also had the virtue of revealing the existence of groups of nationals who are located in dozens of countries on several continents, even though, due to its geographic proximity and that it is a historic path, emigrants have always headed for the United States as their first choice. The people present at the conference held a wide range of political and ideological positions. They, however, concurred in rejecting Washington's economic and commercial blockade of Cuba. The main topic of the previously agreed agenda was emigration regulations. The level of information, however, offered to the participants with regard to the country's economic, institutional, and cultural situation amply exceeded rigid models or undesired exclusions. Four special interventions introduced very important explanations of further bilateral relations and also served to specify the level of participation the emigrants can have in the life and daily business of their own country. Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government (parliament,) exhaustively explained, not only the operation of that government body, but also the truly participative nature of Cuba's current democratic system. As an example, Alarcon described the people's recent debates on measures to reorganize the country's finances. He rejected the adoption of multiparty politics due to its divisive nature and the damage it could cause to the unity of the population in such difficult times. Of great interest to all, according to what was said by several of the guests, was the panorama of Cuban cultural life portrayed by Abel Prieto, president of the Union of Writers and Artists (UNEAC). Prieto called for maintaining Cuban culture as the central theme in every work, whether it belongs to an emigrant or not. Vice President Carlos Lage examined the situation of the Cuban economy and said the efforts being made by the entire population, which can also include those who live abroad, will give Cuba the possibility of surmounting the crisis triggered by the U.S. blockade and the disappearance of the eastern European socialist bloc. It fell on Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to announce the package of measures dictated by the government in its wish to contribute decisively to the normalization of ties with the emigrants, which is desired by all. Truthfully, the measures corresponded, in some cases, to requests that had already been made by the guests. Robaina's announcement was received enthusiastically by the plenary. The creation of a special department in the Foreign Ministry to handle emigration affairs, the authorization to allow emigrants' children to enroll in Cuban universities, and the elimination of the clause that sets five years as the minimum period between visits to Cuba by those who reside abroad were some of the measures. Also, the revocation of the requirement that those who come to visit relatives pay for a hotel room, the possibility of investing in sectors that have been earmarked as a priority by the Cuban Government, and the printing of a publication addressed to the emigrants abroad, completed the announcement. The main breakthrough, however, came just a few hours after President Fidel Castro received the conference participants at the Palace of the Revolution. The participants met directly with parliamentarians to study the draft citizenship bill, with youth and women leaders, and later with the UNEAC board to study other levels of future participation. Those were the first steps in consolidating the endeavor that started with the conference. The positive climate, which was witnessed by more than 150 domestic and foreign journalists, was present in the opinions expressed by many of the participants in the conference, including those who, possessing a political position different to that of the Cuban Government, sought to contribute to the common effort. Several analysts and media representatives have pointed out that confronted with such a reality, the attacks of the ultra conservative groups living in the United States turned out to be totally futile.
