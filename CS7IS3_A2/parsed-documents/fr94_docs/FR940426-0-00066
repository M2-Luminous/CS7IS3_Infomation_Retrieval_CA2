FR940426-0-00066 FR940426-0-00013 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [FL&hyph;53&hyph;6409; FRL&hyph;4877&hyph;3] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans Florida; Title V, Section 507, Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Withdrawal of final rule. SUMMARY: On February 23, 1994 (59 FR 8542), EPA published a document to approve without prior proposal the February 24, 1993, version of the revisions made by Florida to the Florida State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions established a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), to be fully implemented by November 15, 1994. This implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA). EPA subsequently received adverse comments on the action. Accordingly, EPA is withdrawing its direct-final approval. Elsewhere in today's Federal Register , EPA is proposing to approve the February 23, 1993, version of revisions made by Florida and providing an opportunity to comment on the proposal. EFFECTIVE DATE: This withdrawal will be effective April 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the material submitted by the State of Florida may be examined during normal business hours at the following locations: Environmental Protection Agency, Region IV Air Programs Branch, 345 Courtland Street, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365. Air Resources Management Division, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Twin Towers Office Building, 2600 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida 32399&hyph;2400. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Carlton R. Layne, Regulatory Planning and Development Section, Air Programs Branch, Air, Pesticides & Toxics Management Division, Region IV Environmental Protection Agency, 345 Courtland Street NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365. The telephone number is 404/347&hyph;2864. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Implementation of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires small businesses to comply with specific regulations in order for areas to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a PROGRAM, and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. On February 24, 1993, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection submitted to EPA for approval the requisite revisions to the SIP establishing the PROGRAM. These revisions were adopted by the Florida Legislature by amending chapter 403 of the Florida Statute, approved on April 8, 1992. The EPA reviewed this request for revision of the federally approved SIP and found it to be in conformance with the requirements of the 1990 CAA. EPA therefore published a notice to approve the revisions without prior proposal (59 FR 8542, February 23, 1994). In the final rulemaking, EPA advised the public the effective date of the action was deferred for 60 days (until April 25, 1994) to provide an opportunity to submit comments. EPA announced if notice was received within 30 days of the publication of the final rule that someone wanted to submit adverse or critical comments, the final action would be withdrawn and a new rulemaking would begin by proposing a 30 day comment period. EPA had earlier published a general notice explaining this special procedure (56 FR 44477, September 4, 1991). EPA has received comments on this action that address the structure of the Florida PROGRAM. Accordingly, the Agency is today withdrawing its approval. EPA is withdrawing this action without providing prior notice and opportunity for comment. The Agency finds it has good cause within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) to proceed without notice and comment. Notice and comment would be impracticable in this case because EPA needs to withdraw its approval as quickly as possible in order to consider the comments which the public has submitted or may wish to submit. Moreover, further notice is not necessary because EPA has already informed the public it would follow this procedure if it received a request for the opportunity to comment. For the same reasons, EPA finds it has good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) to make this withdrawal immediately effective. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.
