That question is: Will implementation of the CBM's mean the possibility of recognition, direct or indirect, of the Turkish Cypriot pseudostate? Kasoulidhis said that it appears, at last, that the CBM's can be implemented without the danger of recognition of the pseudostate. [Begin Kasoulidhis recording] It appears that there are ways that can be agreed upon to implement the CBM's without the direct or indirect recognition of the pseudostate. The foreign minister is expected to carry the final draft of the report with him when he returns from London tonight. The constitutional and legal processing of the report took place in London. [end recording] The experts' report is currently in the hands of Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis. [passage omitted]
