According to the rumors, the headquarters was moved hastily to that building on the outskirts of Cluj because of the danger of a conflict with ethnic Gypsies who have invested money in the scheme but have not been paid their dues on time. A few days ago a group of Gypsies, who had driven all the way from Suceava, caused a disturbance in the center of Cluj, where the Caritas headquarters had temporarily moved to, namely in the building of the daily MESAGERUL TRANSILVAN, a paper that advertises Caritas and publishes its notices and lists of winners. Furthermore, the same sources within Caritas have disclosed that last week the leader of the ethnic Gypsies, Emperor Iulian of Sibiu, had personally come to Cluj to talk to Gheorghe Stoica [founder and owner of Caritas]. Unable to meet Stoica, Iulian became infuriated and threatened to return later to Caritas at the head of an army of 30,000 Gypsies if Stoica does not make the payments that he has pledged. Meanwhile in Cluj, certain supporters of Caritas have been circulating all kinds of rumors, even by means of the local newspapers, claiming that all the participants in the scheme will experience a miracle. That lie was so exaggerated that Mr. Stoica himself felt compelled to issue a communique in MESAGERUL TRANSILVAN, saying that solely the news published by that paper may be considered accurate. That is, he indirectly rejected the rumors that had been circulated by the Pro Caritas Foundation with the purpose of tempering the anger of the deceived participants in the scheme. Apart from this, the lists of the winners have become rather short. Currently they are paying out the winnings of investors whose names begin with the letters P and R, and who paid in their money on 5 July. Meanwhile the selling of Caritas slips continues in Cluj, as many investors believe that there are a sufficient number of people naive enough to pay cash for winnings that are uncertain. Here are some examples selected from the MESAGERUL TRANSILVAN: "Offer: 50 Cluj Caritas receipts dated 11 and 19 July in exchange for a bachelor flat." Or: "Will exchange 500 Caritas receipts dated September for a one- to three-bedroom apartment or individual house," and so on. And finally, here is a question that is typical of how Caritas makes its payments: "We ask the leadership of Caritas to clear up how they intend to pay the winnings of the investors who paid in their money on 3 July and who have been skipped over during recent payments." That is a good question: What happens to all those who have been skipped over, even though their payments are long overdue?!
