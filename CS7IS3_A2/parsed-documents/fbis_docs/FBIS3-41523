In his speech at the meeting, Chinese delegate expressed China's resolute opposition to the union council's decision to admit the so-called ``International Tibet Lawyers Committee'' as a member of the union. In his speech, Shen Maocheng, Chinese vice minister of forestry and vice president of the China Wildlife Protection Association, pointed out: The ``International Tibet Lawyers Committee'' is not a nature conservation organization. The committee's activities are stirring up Tibet independence and splitting China; these activities have nothing to do with Tibet's nature conservation and the protection of Tibet's natural resources. Since the organization was formed in 1989, it has never provided practical aid and support in any form to Tibet's nature conservation. Shen Maocheng stressed: Tibet has always been an inalienable part of China's sacred territory. China resolutely opposes any foreign forces' activities designed to split China. The Chinese delegate's speech won support of the delegates of Pakistan and other countries. The meeting's chairman (Lanfar) decided to set up a special committee to investigate the matter and to make a decision on whether or not to admit the ``International Tibet Lawyers Committee.'' The current international environmental protection meeting, whose theme is to ``show concern for the earth and its dwellers,'' opened in Buenos Aires on 17 January. More than 1,300 delegates from 118 countries are attending the 10-day meeting.
