[Bocharov] You are the first president of the Komi Republic.... [Spiridonov] Head of the republic. I believe that there must be one president in Russia. There is. [Bocharov] Good. Today is the first day after your official inauguration. Which concern of this day -- as of the 100th day, which is traditional for summing up the first results -- will be the chief and most important concern for you? [Spiridonov] Both today and on the 100th day, and maybe also on the 200th, the budget will constitute this concern. Although, in connection with the Russian president's recent edicts, maybe the situation will yet improve. I very much hope so. [Bocharov] How many days out of the first 100 will you spend in this office, and how many traveling around the republic? [Spiridonov] The first three days. The rest traveling around the republic. In parallel I will be forming the government. I do not intend to make a revolution, but serious changes are needed. [Bocharov] Personal or structural? [Spiridonov] Mostly structural. The aim is to combat the omnipotence of officials. Our chief enemy, as well as the enemy of all Russia, is the petty official and the big official. The most brilliant projects and undertakings are ruined precisely at the level of the official. A Mariya Ivanovna or a Vasiliy Petrovich, unknown to anyone, possess a power which is frequently out of all relation to that of a minister or even the president. [Bocharov] Komi is known to be a veritable storehouse of natural riches. In this connection Syktyvkar is constantly being visited by representatives of very serious and world-renowned firms and corporations. By which criteria do you intend to be guided in your approach to cooperation with the West in this sense? [Spiridonov] There is one criterion: the good of the cause. For the republic and its people. We will rely on the great experience of the federal structures. We will also support our own structures in every way. The republic's foreign economic activity is growing daily. A lot of mistakes are being made and criminal actions being committed. But a positive process is already evident. The task is clear in this sense too. The republic's enterprises must work. Production must grow, not fall. People must earn well. We have no reason to fear joint projects or, to put it more simply, access for businessmen to our expanses and our riches. Here is an interesting thing. Back in 1928, in one of the rayons of Komi, the raykom [rayon party committee] bureau examined the question of allowing the raykom secretary's son to head a British concession. At that time people were not afraid of these words, but today we continue to fear these words, such as the word "concession." I wish to say that we are ready to deal not only with recognized authorities in the West but also with our own businessmen with capital. There is no need to blush and hide our eyes. Money must work. This is a principled approach. It is irrational to waste efforts on a debate over the nature of the accumulation of primary capital, unless, of course, it is a question of obvious piracy. I repeat once more: Money must work, enterprises must build up capacity, and people must earn well. Today we cannot allow a negligent or frequently simply even a foolish leader of one enterprise or another to go on taking a freeloading approach to the budget and to state funds and to demand that they be taken from invalids, children, and pensioners instead of introducing these funds into the state's budget. [Bocharov] The election showed perfectly clearly the level of your authority in the republic. In what way do you intend to maintain it? [Long silence] [Spiridonov] If it has to be done artifically, then in no way....
