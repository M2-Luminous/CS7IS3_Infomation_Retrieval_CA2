Brown described as not very encouraging the dynamics of the development of the Russian market economy. Nevertheless, he believes there are prerequisites for stepping up bilateral cooperation in many areas, primarily in space exploration, extraction and processing of oil and gas, production of medicines, and development of communication facilities. Brown said that real chances to "advance to the Urals" had appeared after his trip to Yekaterinburg. Offices of American companies could be opened there. The agenda of the stay in St. Petersburg of the American delegation, which includes the heads of 28 key U.S. corporations, is of an obviously business character. Brown had a private meeting with St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak today morning.
