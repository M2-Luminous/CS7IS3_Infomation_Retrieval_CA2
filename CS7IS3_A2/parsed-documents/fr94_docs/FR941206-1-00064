FR941206-1-00064 FR941206-1-00007 In order to determine the MACT floor for the wood furniture industry, the EPA surveyed more than 850 wood furniture manufacturing operations. Facilities of all sizes operating under each of the SIC codes of interest were surveyed in order to get a representative sampling of the industry. Responses were received from more than 300 sources, 91 of which were determined to be major sources. Information provided by plants included the material safety data sheet (MSDS) for each finishing material, cleaning material, and adhesive containing HAP that was used at the plant, as well as information on HAP usage, HAP emissions, finishing material usage, cleaning solvent usage, adhesive usage, and control techniques used (if any). a. MACT Floor for Finishing Operations. i. Existing sources. As discussed in section VI.D., in evaluating the data collected from industry on finishing operations, the format that seemed technically feasible and most flexible for the entire source category was an emission limit expressed in terms of pounds of volatile HAP (VHAP) emitted per pound of solids used (lb VHAP/lb solids [kg VHAP/kg solids]). Thus, the MACT floor for finishing operations at existing sources was calculated as the average HAP emission level (lb HAP/lb solids) achieved by the best performing 12 percent of sources, that is, those sources with the lowest HAP emission level. The HAP emission level for each facility was calculated by dividing the facility's total HAP usage by the total quantity of solids in the finishing materials. The Agency had collected sufficient data on the HAP usage at major sources from the survey of the industry, but did not have data on the solids content of each finishing material used by a facility. Therefore, the coating supplier for each major source calculated the emission level for that source. The Committee agreed that data provided by coating suppliers were more accurate than an emission level calculated using only the EPA's data base; because of the lack of data on the solids content, the Agency would have needed to make assumptions to calculate the emission level for each major source. Because information was available on 91 major sources, the MACT floor was calculated as the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 11 existing sources (i.e., the best performing 12 percent). The Committee agreed that the 11 sources should comprise every type of wood furniture operation covered by the proposed rule. If the MACT floor was calculated by looking only at the emission limit of the top 11 sources, without regard to industry segment, one industry segment could be ``over-represented.'' The Committee was especially concerned that one of the smaller industry segments could comprise the majority of sources in the MACT floor. Therefore, each industry segment was represented in the MACT floor proportional to its representation in the industry. The Committee agreed that the quantity of finishing material used was a reasonable method for assessing the percentage of the entire industry represented by each industry segment. Based on the finishing material usage data collected by the EPA through its survey of the industry, it was determined that the total finishing material usage by the source category was approximately distributed as follows: _kitchen cabinets (SIC 2434): 34 percent _residential furniture (2511): 44 percent _office furniture (2521): 7 percent _radio/TV cabinets (2517): 6 percent _upholstered furniture (2512): 3.5 percent _public building furniture (2531): 3 percent _store fixtures (2541): 2 percent _other (2519): 0.5 percent Based on the above distribution, the Committee agreed that the 11 plants comprising the MACT floor should include the best performing 4 kitchen cabinet plants (34 percent of 11), 5 residential furniture plants (44 percent), 1 office furniture plant (7 percent), and 1 plant manufacturing radio/TV cabinets (6 percent). The other industry segments comprised such a small percentage of the source category, the Committee believed that it was not necessary to represent them in the MACT floor analysis. The Committee also believed that the industry segments not included in the MACT floor were similar in many respects to those that were included and would therefore be able to achieve the same MACT floor emission limit.
