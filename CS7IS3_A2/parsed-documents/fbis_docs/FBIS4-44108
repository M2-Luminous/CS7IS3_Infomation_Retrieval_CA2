Is the EU torn by strife? [Kinkel] The summit was no battle. There were different opinions on the next president of the EU Commission. Eleven states backed Belgian Prime Minister Dehaene, while Britain was against him. Now we have to settle this conflict. There is a bit of troubled water. This must be calmed. [Hoeren] The British complain that the atmosphere has been poisoned, and the Dutch accuse Chancellor Kohl of having fought for Dehaene like a bulldozer. [Kinkel] These accusations are completely unjustified. I categorically reject them. Some of the tones that were heard there are inappropriate and do not serve the cause. Some people forget that the issue was not a decision for or against a particular person but the best solution for the most important European office. I hope very much that the noise on the fringes will soon abate. [Hoeren] The British have announced that they will never vote for Dehaene.... [Kinkel] It is true that the decision on Jacques Delors' successor must be made unanimously. This makes it difficult if one country refuses. It will be the first task of the German Government in its presidency of the EU council as of 1 July to bring the cow off the ice. Chancellor Kohl and I will talk to all countries so as to find a solution by the special summit on 15 July. [Hoeren] What do you think of the compromise suggestion to extend Delors' term of office? [Kinkel] Given a ratio of 11:1, it must be possible to find a successor. There is no reason to put up a compromise candidate. We cannot afford an undignified struggle about filling the most important office in Europe. [Hoeren] What are the things that speak for Belgium's Dehaene? [Kinkel] He has shown that he is a dedicated European and a doer. At this difficult time, the EU needs a doer.
