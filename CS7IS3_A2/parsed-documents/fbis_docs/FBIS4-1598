In Mostar, south-western Bosnia, lawmakers of the self-declared (Croatian) republic of Herzeg-Bosnia voted almost unanimously for the new federation plan signed in Washington last week. The Muslim-dominated Bosnian parliament is also due to meet on Monday in Sarajevo to debate the plan, crafted by U.S. and Russian mediators and signed by Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak, and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. Earlier today, the commander of the Muslim-led government army, General Rasim Delic, and the chief of Bosnian Croat forces, General Ante Roso, signed an accord in Sarajevo on a joint army command, the first practical step toward forming the new federation. The military leaders agreed that the joint army command should operate until the formation of a new federal army, after a new federal constitution has been passed. The agreement on the new federation would mean the end of Herzeg-Bosnia as an independent entity. The Serbs, however, who control nearly 70 percent of Bosnia, have rejected any participation in the new union, ignoring appeals from Washington and Moscow. Delic told reporters after signing the military accord that he had held "cordial and constructive" talks with his Croatian counterpart. But he failed to give more details. Roso also spoke highly of the accord, saying that it has created the necessary conditions for Croats and Muslims to live together in peace.
