Minister of National Defense Mehmet Golhan has said the Council of Ministers will approve the new measure in the next few days. The villages on the two mountains will be moved, and anyone who enters the two areas will be fired on. The measure will provide for the establishment of a kind of buffer zone against the PKK militants who may try to infiltrate into Turkey from Iran, Armenia, and the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. The National Security Council [NSC] met a few days ago to assess the intensified PKK activities on Agri and Tendurek Mountains and the opportunities the PKK militants have to infiltrate into Turkey from the neighboring countries and take up positions on the heights in these two regions. Considering the requests of the security forces, the NSC agreed that the Agri and Tendurek Mountains will be declared "restricted military areas." The NSC has conveyed its decision to the Government. Mehmet Golhan said the Council of Ministers will decide on the matter in the next few days. He also said the decision to declare the two mountains restricted areas will be put into effect this fall. Stressing that it will be aimed at obstructing PKK activities among the citizens and the nomadic tribes in the two areas, Golhan asserted: "The declaration of restricted areas will apply only to Agri and Tendurek Mountains. Several villages will be moved in accordance with the new measure. No one will be allowed to enter the two areas. We shall than be able to control the PKK's activities with no difficulty." Some 50 villages will be moved when Agri and Tendurek Mountains are declared restricted areas. Some 10,000 people who live in villages such as Binkaya, Yukarisek, Tepeli, Uzunyol, Tuzla, Ortulu, and Sankaya will be transferred to areas close to larger towns. Work is underway to establish the location of the new settlements. Appropriate areas are being selected from among the public-owned lands. Private property may also be nationalized for that purpose if necessary. Meanwhile, nomadic tribes will not be allowed to enter the two restricted areas during summer. Although the Council of Ministers has not yet adopted a decision on the matter, it has been reported that measures have already been taken to prevent the nomadic tribes from moving into the two areas. The measures have been put into effect by the governors in the region in accordance with a circular they received from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. A buffer zone will be established on Turkey's border with Iran, Armenia, and Nakhichevan to prevent the PKK militants from infiltrating into our country. The security forces will be instructed to fire on any unauthorized person who enters the restricted areas. Thus, one of the important routes the PKK militants use to infiltrate into Turkey will be sealed off.
