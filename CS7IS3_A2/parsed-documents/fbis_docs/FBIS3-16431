Their essence may be boiled down to the following sentence: Russia is losing its role as first violin in the peacemaking in the former Yugoslavia. This is linked to the success of the Washington talks on forming a Muslim-Croat federation, as well as to the fact that Bosnia's Serbs will not join this federation. It was these "surprise discoveries" that made some journalists and even politicians say that "the peacemakers' laurels are passing from Moscow to Washington." Such statements could even have been ignored owing to their scant seriousness in the matter of big-time politics. But they are being made at a time of a certain general cooling in Russian-U.S. relations and could exacerbate the situation still further. Therefore, I believe, it should be clearly decided that Russia and Washington cannot compete to see who will earn more points out of the tragedy of the Yugoslav peoples. Both great powers are doing what they can and what is in their power to end the fratricidal war and to restore a just peace in Bosnia as quickly as possible. What is more, our countries are agreeing and coordinating their efforts between themselves. The Bosnian problem, by the way, is one of the most important on the agenda of the Vladivostok talks between Andrey Kozyrev and Warren Christopher. They really do have something to discuss. Unilateral initiatives far from always spell success. For example, that federation in Bosnia and the prospects for forming its confederation with Croatia. Work on preparing the draft constitution of the Bosnian federation was completed Sunday under the Americans' patronage in their embassy building in Vienna. Its official signing is scheduled for Friday. But it is not enough to sign a document, it is necessary to make it work. Without Serbian participation (and this will hardly be achieved without Russia) in the "divorce process" the vitality of the new federation will be in question if only because its formation provides for the transfer of 60 percent of Bosnia's territory to Muslim and Croat control. Today approximately 70 percent of the country's territory is in Serb hands. Will they agree to voluntary concessions? If so, on what terms? The fact that the federation's creators have left the doors to it open for the Bosnian Serbs as well is, most likely, simply a political goodwill gesture. It is obvious that the Serbs, if the question of their joining anyone at all arises, will choose, rather, federal Yugoslavia, the present union of Serbia and Montenegro. This decision will have its pluses and its minuses. The positive aspects are clearer. The negative aspects are less obvious but have more complex consequences: The likelihood of forming a new "Greater Serbia" and "Greater Croatia" is fraught with a deeper split and growing tension. The resolution of both the present and the long-term problems, precisely because of their complexity, requires concerted joint actions by all the interested sides, not a race to pick up political points and to maintain the image of peacemakers.
