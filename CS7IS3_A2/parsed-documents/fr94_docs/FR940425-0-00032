FR940425-0-00032 FR940425-0-00018 In response to Blue Bird's recommendation that the regulation allow a five percent drop after the barrier crash test, NHTSA is concerned that this approach would allow varying amounts of fuel leakage from different vehicles depending on the fuel system's size. Therefore, the agency has decided to reject Blue Bird's recommendation. c. Test time. NHTSA received nine comments addressing the appropriate test time for the pressure drop requirement. Of the nine commenters, Washington, NGV Systems, Navistar, and NGVC stated that a cumulative measurement should be taken after 15 minutes because the amount of gas leaking each minute would be too small to measure accurately. They believed that taking incremental measurements within the 15 minute period would not be acceptable. Other commenters, including AAMA, Thomas, TMC, and Blue Bird stated that even the cumulative leakage over 15 minutes would be too small to measure in some cases. Blue Bird stated that the proposed leakage limit was ``totally unacceptable'' because it would be necessary to detect a pressure drop of 0.6 psi in a 3000 psi fuel system. AAMA stated that measurement of the pressure drop 60 minutes after impact would be reasonable and should be adopted by the agency based on the limitations of available measurement equipment, since the proposed leakage rate would result in a total pressure drop of 211 psi for a 3000 psi, 170 liter (45 gallon) fuel system. Given the problems with measuring the proposed levels of allowable pressure drop, NHTSA has decided to change the pressure drop requirement to make it more measurable while keeping it as close to a no-leakage requirement as practicable. The agency considered two alternative changes to the proposal to ensure that the level of pressure drop was practicable to measure: (1) Increase the amount of CNG leakage allowed during the proposed 15 minute test period or (2) increase the test time period. The agency has decided to reject the option of increasing the level of allowable leakage to the point that even marginal violations of the leakage limit could be reliably measured at the end of a 15 minute period. Such an increase might be unsafe and would be inconsistent with the agency's goal of establishing a minimum leakage requirement that is as close to a no-leakage requirement as possible while still being readily measurable. Instead, to accomplish its goal of establishing a safe and practicable requirement, NHTSA has decided to increase the test time from 15 minutes to 60 minutes. The agency has determined that it is necessary to lengthen the test period to permit measurement of safe levels of leakage. To illustrate, a container with a service pressure of 3000 psi and an allowable pressure drop of approximately 50 psi after 15 minutes, would have an allowable pressure drop of 200 psi after 60 minutes. Since the agency has determined that it is not possible to reliably measure a pressure drop of less than 154 psi within a 10 ○F temperature variation, then the agency's original goal of prohibiting a pressure drop of more than 50 psi in 15 minutes would not be practicable. Accordingly, the agency determined that it is necessary to lengthen the test period or else the only detectable violations would be gross violations of the pressure drop limit. Small violations of the limit would not be detectable. Moreover, while a pressure drop of 50 psi in 15 minutes could not be reliably measured, a pressure drop of 200 psi (4×50 psi=200 psi in 60 minutes (4×15 minutes=60 minutes) is readily measurable. While those two pressure drops are equally stringent since the leakage rate is essentially constant for a marginal violation, only the 60 minute period would permit measurable results. By increasing the test time to 60 minutes, the agency believes that the requirement will allow only readily measurable and safe amounts of leakage. The agency believes that increasing the test time from 15 minutes to 60 minutes will not result in an increase in leakage rate. As explained above, if the limit and the time are proportionately increased the same extent, the stringency is maintained. Increasing the test time will not increase the safety risk since the rate of CNG leakage is still equivalent, in terms of energy content, to that allowed of liquid fuels in Standard No. 301. In addition, the leakage rate is more critical than the total level of leakage over an extended period of time, since CNG dissipates rapidly because it is lighter than air.
