Shokin, Submikron Scientific Research Institute; UDC 621.382] [Abstract] Recovery of the amorphized silicon crystal lattice at an annealing temperature below the melting point by the solid phase epitaxial recrystallization mechanism (TFER) and the attendant complex processes of impurity atom redistribution and embedding, point defect and capture center generation, etc., are discussed, and an attempt is made to examine solid phase epitaxial recrystallization in amorphized silicon layers with ion-implanted Sm and Yb. These rare earth metal (RZE) impurities were selected due to their low solubility in silicon and, consequently, the low concentration of active atoms. KDB-12 <100> Si slices were used as the source material, and [.sup]152[/] Sm[.sup]+[/] and [.sup]174[/] Yb[.sup]+[/] ions were implanted in a Vezuviy-5 unit. The samples were annealed in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The solid phase epitaxial recrystallization processes were studied by the methods of Rutherford's backscattering (ROR) using primary [.sup]4[/]He[.sup]+[/] ions with a 1,500 keV energy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (VIMS) in an IMS-3F unit; the backscattered ions were recorded by a solid state semiconductor detector with a 17 keV energy resolution, and the primary O[.sup]2[/][.sup]+[/] ion beam with an 8 keV energy and 1-2 �A current was scanned into a 0.5x0.5 mm pattern. Rutherford backscattering spectra and Sm and Yb concentration profiles in ion-implanted Si samples are plotted, and the ion implantation and heat treatment conditions are summarized. The study shows that after the heat treatment, the impurity distribution is characterized by three types of peaks; on the surface, slightly off-surface in the case of incomplete recrystallization, and on the boundary between the amorphized layer and crystal substrate. The effect of impurities on the recrystallization rate, i.e., the solid phase epitaxial recrystallization front velocity, is examined: given a 470�C annealing temperature, it is equal to 0.9+/-0.1 nm/min for Sm and 1.7+/-0.1 nm/mm for Yb, which is grater than that of Si[.sup]+[/]-implantation by three- and sixfold, respectively. The characteristics of ion-implanted rare earth elements in Si during heat treatment may be used in semiconductor technology for producing heat- and radiation-resistant semiconductors, getter areas, small p-n-junctions, and other applications.
