At a time when national reconciliation is being discussed, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] is linking the resumption of the peace talks to an inquiry team being sent to Cuito and Huambo to establish who was responsible for the resumption of hostilities. At least, that was what UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Valentim, spokesman for the UNITA team to Lusaka, told the BBC yesterday. [Begin Valentim recording] Our stance is quite clear: We are prepared to continue the talks. The UNITA team will stay on in Luanda, and it will continue to negotiate with the observers, the mediators, and the government's delegation. However, to save peace in Angola, we have asked that an inquiry team be set up and sent to Bie and Huambo to establish the identity of and condemn the aggressor so that peace can be saved in Angola. [end recording] Meanwhile, reports reaching us from Luanda are less than encouraging. It appears that the government is also hardening its stance. In fact, yesterday the Angolan authorities said they will not give in to what they described as absurd proposals by UNITA. Analysts see this as an indication that the government wishes to make no national reconciliation package concessions. [passage omitted]
