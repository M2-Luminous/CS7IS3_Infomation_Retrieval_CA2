It visited the Vostok and Zvezda plants, where nuclear submarines are dismantled and radioactive waste stored. As a result of eight hours of work at the city and plant administration offices and an examination of the facilities where liquid radioactive waste is kept, the commission prepared a protocol which states unequivocally that the situation in Bolshoy Kamen is fast approaching critical. The main conclusion: "We should expect an emergency situation involving TNT-5 to develop in April-May." The liquid radioactive waste problem is increasingly often associated with the Far Eastern plant Zvezda. According to the commission's estimate, about 2,253 cubic meters of it is kept here, with total radioactivity exceeding 30 curies. It is all kept in seven tankers, which are moored at the plant's piers. Two tankers -- TNT-5 and TNT-27 -- acquired notoriety around the world after the liquid radioactive waste dumping in October of last year, and the third--TNT Pinega -- is just beginning service in this capacity. TNT-5 is currently in the most critical situation. The vessel, built at the beginning of the 1960's and decommissioned two years ago, now represents the main danger. Its tanks hold 794 cubic meters of liquid radioactive waste with a total radioactivity of 0.776 curies. Over the past three months the radiation level in the stern and engine compartments increased threefold and now measures 1,400 microroentgen an hour. Because of malfunctioning systems and equipment, up to 10 cubic meters spilled from the tanks into the vessel's body over this time. Analysis of radionuclides in the tankers and samples of soil at the pier under the mooring area show that radioactive waste may leak not only into the tanker's body but also into the bay's aquatic area. The opinion of the commission, which consisted of representatives of various agencies, as well as those of Bolshoy Kamen, the plant, and the Pacific Fleet administrations, is unanimous: Tanker TNT-5 has to be urgently hauled outside Bolshoy Kamen bay and the content of its tanks dumped. These and many other conclusions may remain on paper, however. "The problem is that radioactive waste is stored on the territory of the Zvezda plant, but does not belong to it," the enterprise's chief engineer Yuriy Shulgan said at the meeting with the commission. "The owner is the Pacific Fleet." "After the Government of Russia banned liquid radioactive waste dumping, the fleet also has been unable to resolve this problem," emphasized the Pacific Fleet deputy commander, Rear Admiral Nikolay Lysenko. The facility for storage and processing of radioactive waste, including liquid, which existed in the 1960's at the Sysoyev Cape was closed down temporarily by the Pacific Fleet more than 20 years ago; in the opinion of specialists, it is unlikely that this facility could be restored. Construction of a new facility, regardless of which design and whose money was used, cannot be accomplished in less than six to nine months. Meanwhile, the tanker, despite the fleet's energetic efforts to keep it afloat, may, if not sink, at least begin seriously leaking radioactive waste. "Right now we are only talking about the waste stored in the tanker, but this is only part of the problem," emphasized Dmitriy Gichev, deputy chief of the Vladivostok consolidated inspectorate for nuclear and radioactive safety. "Over 30 years of active exploitation, the TNT itself has become a source of radioactive contamination. Even if we pump the contents out of it, there remains the equally serious problem of dismantling the tanker itself." The commission's protocol is as alarming as it is hopeless. Maritime Kray is unable to solve a problem whose roots are in Moscow. Neither the plants, nor the fleet, nor the administration received any reply to their numerous appeals to Moscow. Just as there is no federal financing for the program of improving radiation safety drafted by the Government of Russia in August last year. The issue of building a radioactive waste processing facility in Maritime Kray was to be resolved under the provisions of this program. Moreover, from the faraway offices of the Moscow military brass an order arrived at the fleet to prohibit access to military facilities to anyone whatsoever. Therefore, the kray commission had to go to Moscow to obtain permission to examine the decommissioned TNT-5. Journalists were not permitted on board this "classified military facility" (which, I repeat, was decommissioned from the Pacific Fleet two years ago). Compared to other enterprises (the Urals Mayak plant, for instance, is in need of reprocessing liquid radioactive waste with a radioactivity level of 500 million curies), Bolshoy Kamen's 30 curies may look like a drop in the bucket, but it is our ocean, as it is our land on which we live and the products of which we consume. Why should we all remain hostages to a government that is trying to maintain a good image in the eyes of the world at the expense of our health and safety? By the way, in the opinion of specialists, if a catastrophe with TNT-5 does occur in Bolshoy Kamen, because of the specificity of underwater currents the main victim will be Vladvostok. Specialists already note a higher radioactivity of bottom-layer sediment in Shamora and Tavaiza bays as a result of work with nuclear submarines at the Zvezda plant. So far the situation in Bolshoy Kamen is relatively calm. The plants were promised a 200,000 ruble advance for February, provided there is enough cash. Another nuclear submarine has arrived for repairs. On the one hand, it is work for thousands of people; on the other, new cubic meters of radioactive water, which may become the last drop that will cause the cup of radioactive equilibrium to overflow -- and then we will have an ecological catastrophe. The bureaucrats in Moscow refuse to see this, however.
