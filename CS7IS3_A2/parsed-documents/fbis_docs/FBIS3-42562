This is Georgiy Lukava, a candidate of the Liberal Democratic Party. BIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCE. Georgiy Grigoryevich Lukava was born in 1925 in Tbilisi, in an office worker's family. As he himself says, "My name is Georgian, my upbringing, Russian." He graduated from the Lenin Military-Political Academy and also completed graduate work at the academy in philosophy. He is a professor and doctor of philosophical sciences. The subject of his thesis was "The Nature of the Contradictions in Armed Struggle Involving the Use of Nuclear Weapons." The subject of his doctorate was "Dialectics of the Theory and Practice of the Art of War." He worked in the Philosophy Department of the Lenin Military-Political Academy and was for 16 years deputy head of the Frunze Military Academy Social Sciences Department. He is currently head of the Department of Liberal Arts and Sociopolitical Sciences of the Moscow University of Civil Aviation Engineers. He is married with two children. My first question concerned the professor's party affiliation. He is a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, apparently, not a "Zhirinovskiy hawk." His Majesty Chance brought Lukava and the Liberal Democratic Party together. Several months ago the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] held the conference "Russia's Economic, Political, and Spiritual Crisis, and Solutions to It." Lukava was invited to speak also (it should be mentioned that he is a person well known around political teach-in's and does not, as he himself acknowledges, pass up a single roundtable or activity of various parties and movements "in order to be au courant with the debate and with what is said on this issue or the other by Baburin, Isakov, Umalatova, and Shakhray"). Georgiy Grigoryevich delivered a report on the subject "Spiritual Readiness and Its Role in Surmounting the Crisis." His speech went down well, by all accounts. "Leader Zhirinovskiy himself shook my hand and thanked me," Lukava warmly recalls. "True, he had nothing else to say, nor did I ask any questions. I am a tactful sort." Meanwhile, the LDP's ideas struck home with Lukava, so to speak, and he set about studying its rules and program documents. "I, like many communists, had a superficial idea of this party, mainly from newspaper articles and television programs, but I learned here that the LDP's program coincides 70 percent with the programs of the Communist Party, the Russian National Union, and other patriotic organizations." Nor, for their part, did the Zhirinovskiyites forget Lukava. When the campaign began, Georgiy Grigoryevich received a call from LPD headquarters: "We have been conferring here and have decided to ask you to be a candidate for deputy from our party." Lukava thought about it for two days, after which he agreed. The professor shares far from all of Zhirinovskiy's views. He believes, for example, that "there is an element of insufficient balance" in certain pronouncements of the LDP leader on foreign policy matters, Finland's annexation to Russia, say. But Georgiy Grigoryevich categorically disagrees that Zhirinovskiy is preaching fascist ideas. In his view, some people want simply from a feeling of envy to discredit Vladimir Volfovich's good name. Lukava sees as one of his tasks the building of a bridge of friendship between the Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov camps. "I would like all that is strong in the Liberal Democratic Party to be linked with the same strong aspects and representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation." That Communist Party leader Zyuganov recently declared for all to hear the readiness of the communists to interact with the healthy forces of the LDP he considers his contribution, to some extent. Today all Lukava's thoughts are taken up with what he will say to his deputy colleagues on the opening day of the Duma. Georgiy Grigoryevich has not yet set about writing his speech, but he has some advance ideas in mind. "I will, of course, confer with those who nominated me for parliament, with Vladimir Volfovich included. Elementary decency on my part implies this." No recommendations from Zhirinovskiy have been received as yet. The professor intends in his speech to appeal simultaneously to both the intellect and the feelings of the deputies. "I want by the method of emotional impact to create a certain intensity in the hall." Lukava is thinking of employing as a means of emotional impact "elements of spiritual culture," including musical works. "It pleased me greatly that at the Soviet Embassy reception at the time of the Genoa Conference, Chicherin, people's commissar for foreign affairs, played Beethoven's [begins italics]Apassionata and Chaykovskiy's 1812 Overture." Georgiy Grigoryevich feels little awkwardness at the sorry fate that befell the previous parliament. To the question as to whether he expected a similar end for the present Duma, he replied in purely philosophical terms: "From the standpoint of the great Leibniz, historical analogies do not recur within the framework of the absolute." It is pleasant talking with a man of depth....
