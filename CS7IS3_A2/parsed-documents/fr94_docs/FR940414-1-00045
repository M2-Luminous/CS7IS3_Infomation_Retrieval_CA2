FR940414-1-00045 FR940414-1-00010 • Agriculture _All pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities with at least 90 percent of 1988 pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging revenues from the agriculture market that did not fall into any other subgroup (this does not include refilling establishments). This subgroup also includes facilities identified as ``agriculture'' through a review of their products handled in 1988 and their revenue markets. • Consumer Home Products _All pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities with 1988 pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging revenues from the consumer home, lawn and garden market that handled products specifically aimed at the home portion of the market (including household cleaners). • Consumer Lawn and Garden _All pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities with 1988 pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging revenues from the consumer home, lawn and garden market that handled products specifically aimed at the lawn and garden portion of the market. • Industrial _All pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities with at least 90 percent of 1988 pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging revenues from the industrial market that did not fall into any other subgroup. • Institutional _All pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities reporting at least 90 percent of 1988 pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging revenues from the disinfectant or institutional market or facilities reporting at least 50 percent of the facility's pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging production from products with a product type of ``disinfectant,'' ``sanitizer'' or ``sterilizer'' that did not fall into any other subgroup. This subgroup also includes facilities identified as ``institutional'' through a review of their products handled and their revenue markets; however, it does not include those facilities placed in the consumer home products subgroup. • Manufacturers _All pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities that also manufactured one or more active ingredient in 1986. These facilities are not included in any other group, regardless of other activities at the facility. • Organo-Metallic _All pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities reporting at least 90 percent of 1988 pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging revenues from wood preservatives market or facilities reporting at least 50 percent of the facility's pesticide formulating, packaging, or repackaging production from handling products containing organo-metallic active ingredients, including organo-copper, organo-mercury, or organo-tin active ingredients that did not fall into any other subgroup. • Organo-Metallic/Industrial _Pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities that fall into both the organo-metallic and the industrial subgroups. • Other _All pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities that do not fall into any of the above categories. This subgroup does not include those facilities that were placed in a subgroup based on the products and markets that appeared to represent the majority of operations at the facility, even if the facility did not meet all the criteria for the subgroup. Each facility was put into only one subgroup. If a facility's products or markets were not predominantly in one subgroup the facility was placed in the ``other'' subgroup. EPA chose this approach to evaluate the factors of market type, physical properties of an active ingredient or active ingredient group, or formulation type which, aside from the treatment requirements for a given active ingredient, were believed to have the greatest effect on the generation of wastewater and therefore treatment needs. The Agency split one market type: ``home, lawn and garden'' into two subgroups because facilities producing products to be used inside the home such as insecticides controlling roaches would likely be formulating, packaging or repackaging their products throughout the year, whereas the facilities that formulate, package or repackage pesticides for the lawn or garden would likely have a seasonal production schedule. These different production schedules can affect wastewater treatment requirements and the ability to recycle or reuse wastewater. Similarly, all facilities that reported having a DOT test bath were grouped together because this source of significant volumes of wastewater affects wastewater treatment requirements and the ability to recycle and reuse wastewater. Manufacturers were separated from other pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities because they are chemical manufacturers and tend to be large facilities with existing wastewater treatment systems. Although their formulating, packaging or repackaging operations are not different from other facilities, the scale at which they produce pesticide products and the volumes of wastewater generated and current wastewater disposal practices are different. The subgroup analysis did not reveal substantive differences in the water usage or production processes within any subgroup, thus EPA does not believe there is any need for further subcategorization of this subcategory. However, the economic impact analysis indicates that facilities which formulate, package or repackage sanitizer chemicals would be impacted by the costs of the various technology options. Sanitizers chemicals are proposed to be defined as products containing one or more of the active ingredients listed on Table 8 of the regulation. EPA has segmented the sanitizer facilities for the purposes of establishing PSES. Facilities in the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging industry typically conduct more than one type of operation to produce pesticide products. The industry generally comprises facilities that either formulate and package pesticide products (68 percent), or facilities that formulate, package and repackage pesticide products (22 percent). A small group of facilities perform other combinations of these operations (e.g., package and repackage only). The largest concentration of PFPR facilities, 45 percent of the facilities are located in EPA Regions IV and V, the southeast and midwest portions of the country. However, PFPR facilities can be found in every geographic region of the United States. Facilities were requested to report the percentage breakdown of their 1988 pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging revenues by market type. Revenues coming from the agricultural market constituted the largest percentage, approximately 65 percent of the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging revenues.
