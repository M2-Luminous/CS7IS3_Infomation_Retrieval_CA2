The Palestinian leadership believes that the decisions made by the Israeli Government do not meet the minimum requirements under these circumstances for the resumption of the talks. These decisions are an insult to the blood of the Palestinian martyrs and encourage the settlers and their gangs to continue their hostile acts against the Palestinian people, as well as their daily violations and crimes. This stand has been communicated to all concerned parties. We do not believe that the talks can be held while this serious and explosive situation is being ignored. This situation is caused by the settlers' acts and crimes in the Palestinian territory. The Israeli Government should put an end to the role of the settlers' and their activities. They also should put an end to the presence of a number of settlements in Gaza and the West Bank, particularly in Hebron -- where Qiryat Arba' represents a hotbed of terrorist and criminal activities against the Palestinian masses. [Al-Shubashi] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said today that the Palestinians do not have any option other than that of returning to the negotiations with Israel. He added that the Israeli Government has taken firm measures to avert violence, assassinations, and attempts to wreck the peace process, although the entire world has seen footage of the settlers attending Goldstein's funeral ceremony, in which he was deemed a hero and a martyr. ['Abd-Rabbuh] The real option before us and before all those who want to achieve peace is to end the role of settlers in the Palestinian territories. We cannot conceive of a peace agreement at a time when there is an additional army of terrorists and killers engaged in the perpetration of the most heinous crimes on the Palestinian territories, and enjoying the official support and protection of the Israeli Government. The Palestinian leadership is continuing its contacts and work in this regard. At present, we are working to ensure the passage of a UN Security Council resolution providing for international protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. Such a resolution must also condemn the settlers' activities, and deem their presence illegal as established by previous resolutions issued by the UN Security Council. These demands currently constitute the required guarantee for reaching a peace agreement, and indeed, for implementing the peace agreement on the ground. Consequently, the option raised at present is that of providing the requirements of true peace, the requirements that would help achieve such peace. Broad sectors of the world community are aware that it is impossible to achieve coexistence, and to create circumstances conducive to peace as long as settlements exist and as long as the time bomb called settlers and their armed groups remain. [Al-Shubashi] Does this mean that the choice will also be a diplomatic one? Peres said your only option is to resume the negotiations, and you are saying that the other option is to mobilize world public opinion or to contact the world following this massacre to support the Palestinians. What about the U.S. stand? ['Abd-Rabbuh] In the next two days, we will dispatch an envoy to Washington to discuss all these matters with the U.S. Administration. The issue is not about resuming talks just to show that the peace process is continuing. What is required is to link the resumption of talks with effective measures to stop this cancer, because the presence of settlers undermines peace opportunities. Both issues -- the settlements and the resumption and success of the talks -- have become intertwined. The option is not only a diplomatic one. In order to protect themselves -- and given the protection provided by the Israeli occupation forces to the settlements' activities and role -- the Palestinians now have the right to carry weapons to defend themselves. Within this context, we call for a large-scale Arab and friendly campaign to support the Palestinian people in the occupied territory, particularly since the Israeli Government's decisions, which include some individual and limited measures against a few number of the settlers just to throw dust in the eyes, also include measures to maintain the siege and collective punishment against all the Palestinian people in the Palestinian territory. This means the continuation of the starvation war and comprehensive terrorism. The victims are punished collectively, individual or light measures are being taken against some criminals only to avoid crisis and strong reactions by world public opinion. [Al-Shubashi] Has the Palestinian leadership accepted President Clinton's invitation to resume the talks with Israel next week, as has been reported? ['Abd-Rabbuh] I have said that we will send an envoy to Washington to explain our stand, a second envoy to Moscow, and a third to some European countries to explain that there is more to the issue than resuming the talks. The important issue is that it is impossible to ensure the success of the talks when there is a time bomb jeopardizing them -- the presence of settlers, their daily acts of sabotage, and the threat they pose to the lives of Palestinians. [Al-Shubashi] Thank you, Mr. Yasir. ['Abd-Rabbuh] Thank you.
