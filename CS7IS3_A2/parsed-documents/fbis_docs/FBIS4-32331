Does this represent any change in Polish- Romanian relations? [Melescanu] I would not say that it is a change; it is rather the continuation of the traditional links of friendship and solidarity which have existed between our countries for centuries. We share the same fate in the center of Europe; we have faced similar problems; we have fought -- often together -- for survival, to maintain our national identities, and we have ensured peace and security in Europe. Our solidarity remained -- even during the fight against the invader; let me, for example, recall commendable measures taken by Romania at the beginning of World War II, after Poland was invaded. The need for cooperation between our two countries today is more than obvious. We have the same goals: reform, democracy, integration with European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Our cooperation, even coordination of efforts, can only be beneficial to us and it can only bring us success. At the same time, we can be significant forces of stabilization in the center of the continent. [Malik] Romania -- this is at least the impression that we (here in Poland) received -- lagged a little behind on the road of transformations and reforms which were taking place in the postcommunist countries. The same can be said about international relations. What is the situation now? [Melescanu] First of all I would like to briefly explain the reasons why I believe that the delay that you have mentioned has an objective aspect; however, it is also a matter of perception. As is known, Romania was governed in the 1980's by one of the strictest totalitarian regimes. The deeply repressive character of the communist regime did not allow progressive movements, similar to the Polish "Solidarity," to develop. Therefore, it was only possible to overthrow the dictatorship in a mass outbreak of social unrest, not through a gradual linear transformation. The transformations, which in Romania were taking place at an accelerated pace, without any division into stages through which other post-communist countries had gone, were radical. Their incredibly broad range inevitably resulted in social dissatisfaction, which was very visible in the first phase of the transition period. These social movements were received abroad as an expression of social opposition to the ongoing transformation process, whereas in reality, they were the result of reform -- reform that was bold and indeed difficult. I would also like to add that as a result of the complexity of the problems caused directly by our great involvement in the reforms, in 1990 and 1991 we forgot that our situation must and should be explained so that people abroad would know about our achievements and the steps that we were making toward democracy and the market economy; I even mean those steps of which the effects are only now beginning to be felt. As opposed to many other areas, industrial production for instance, in politics facts do not speak for themselves. In other words, the image of Romania abroad was incomplete and therefore distorted. I will not condemn all those people who have contributed to the creation of this not-very-praiseworthy picture of Romania in that period, because we ourselves relegated the policy of reporting about the purposes of our efforts as well as about the positive results achieved on the road of transformations. Your question also implies in a subtle way that there has been a change in perception. There existed a need to define the true picture of Romania, to correct subjective interpretations, and this is exactly what is happening. It is apparent not only to the Romanian minister of foreign affairs, but also -- I am convinced -- to the public at large. The evaluations of certain international establishments today, such as that of the World Bank for instance, confirm the considerable progress that has been achieved in Romania on the road toward reform. I do not want to quote any statistical data. It is undeniable, however, that in 1994, considered to be the year of mass privatization, Romania already registered a drop in inflation along with perceptible trends in stimulating the national economy. It is important to stress that the geostrategic position of Romania, its prospects, natural resources, and potential have all given it an important and responsible place in the world's political life. I am thinking, of course, about our striving toward Europe, which we are sharing with Poland and which has been confirmed by many documents of the European Union [EU]; however, I am also thinking about the vicinity of the conflict-stricken territory of former Yugoslavia. The priorities of foreign policy place Romania in the European zone, but they certainly do not in any way confine its activities to only this. [Malik] The Romanians boast of their heritage, which can be traced back to Latin civilization. Some Poles associate Romania with the sight of Romanian Gypsies begging on the streets of Polish towns and cities. How do you, as head of the diplomatic service, see the place of your country in Europe and the world? [Melescanu] Yes, that is true, the entire nation is proud of its origin and of its history. Let me repeat well-known facts: the Romanians are proud to stress their Latin origin, the fact that, despite various developments, they have retained their identity on the land of their fathers. Our nation has survived as a real island of Latin culture right in the middle of a Slavic sea. You have mentioned Poles, who associate the image of Romania with Romanian Gypsies. I am certain, however, that even more Poles know our country better -- I am now thinking about those of them who have had some contacts with our culture, about hundreds of thousands of your countrymen who have visited our country. Their picture of Romania should not be that much deformed. Current economic difficulties are bound to be overcome and Romania will be able to quickly regain the prestige and the place that it deserves, thanks to its European vocation. [Malik] Bucharest has been very active on the political scene lately. Can you specify when Romania will become an equal member of the EU or West European Union [WEU]? [Melescanu] I am convinced that my words will be interpreted correctly if I say that the Romanian diplomatic service is evaluated as active, constructive, and realistic. Bucharest is increasingly mentioned as a center that organizes international meetings; increasingly more is also being said about the presence of the Romanian diplomatic service in the regional arena -- both in Europe and around the world. These aspects are not at all new; they have simply become more visible recently because they have ceased to be obscured by prejudices and by the not-really-true picture of Romania. Again, what should be done is to recognize the existing state of affairs rather than organizing a diplomatic offensive. Aside from that, as you know, integration with the European and Euro-Atlantic structures is one of the priorities of Romania's foreign and security policy. The recently observed development of the situation in this area has confirmed that this integration is not merely a theoretical striving or a remote goal. If, on the one hand, one takes into account recent initiatives aimed at preparing our states to become an inalienable, stronger, and more stable part of the extended Europe -- the "Partnership for Peace," association with WEU, the Hurd-Andreatta initiative, the Pact on Stability, and on the other hand, the progress that Romania has made on the road of reforms, then I believe that this provides foundations to give an optimistic answer. We can believe, therefore, that integration with the EU might be put into effect toward the end of this century and that this will be accompanied -- quite logically -- by simultaneous integration with the WEU. These predictions, justified by our research, should not be interpreted as an attempt to underestimate the various problems that still exist. I am convinced that the title of full EU member will be the confirmation of the state of affairs. This statement is entirely justified by the fact that the EU is going through a process of creating, along with us -- the associate-member states -- their foreign policy and a policy of joint security, which will go considerably beyond the borders of the EU, before our de facto integration takes place. In my opinion, this is what is going to determine the continuation of European integration. This will also make it easier for our countries to come closer together. This is one more argument that supports my evaluation. [Malik] Not far from Romania, the tragedy of the former Yugoslavia is going on. What is the position of Bucharest on the conflict between Serbia and Croatia, not to mention Bosnia? [Melescanu] First of all, I do not think that this is a conflict between Serbia and Croatia or Bosnia. Of course, the problem of Kraiina remains unresolved; however, the present situation does not pose the risk of direct armed conflict. As far as Bosnia is concerned, ethnic communities are fighting there in direct confrontation of civil war. Romania has all along been in favor of resolving this conflict by political means, of providing a resolution that would be acceptable to all parties; the first step should be to stop the bloodshed. This is the only way to ensure lasting peace in the region. For this very reason we are happy about the recent, albeit temporary cease-fire. It is very important for the United Nations, EU, United States, and Russia to arrive at a joint position on the Bosnian issue. Thus, I am an optimist and I believe that thanks to joint efforts by international communities, we will soon be able restore peace there.
