Filatov disapproved of the setting up of a house investigatory commission because the Russian Federal Prosecutor's Office is already conducting an investigation into the matter on its own. He blamed the president's envoy to the parliament Aleksandr Yakovlev for the shortfall: He should have proposed that the law-makers hear the federal prosecutor first or wait until an official statement was made by the investigators. Any duplication of investigative efforts generates mistrust and confrontation, Filatov suggested. As concerns a new residence for the State Duma, Filatov said Moscow simply did not have a building to suit the tastes of the lower house. Commenting on (former Soviet parliament speaker) Anatoliy Lukyanov's proposal that the Russian legislature be given the building of the former Soviet parliament in the Kremlin, Filatov said the building was now occupied by the president and his staff while the neighboring residence of the head of state was under repair, which is due to last for three years. As for the former Communist Party Central Committee buildings in Staraya Square, for which the Duma asked as an alternative, it housed the federal government and some other departments, the Moscow regional duma and administration, and the presidential staff. Filatov said. The number of rooms in the "White House" which was earlier occupied by the Russian parliament dissolved last September, is insufficient to provide offices for all the 450 deputies of the present legislature, each of whom wants to employ several assistants for the 80 minimal wages [as received] granted them. The house committees and commissions, factions and technical services as well as the Secretariat are also building up their staffs, who will need at least 1000 offices. Filatov said a combined version will probably be offered to the Duma, including the building of the former State Planning Committee in Okhotny Ryad. It is more important to avoid squabbling but arrange constructive interaction between the chambers of the Federal Assembly, the president and the government. Towards this are now working the president's representative in the parliament Aleksandr Yakovlev, Yeltsin's aide Georgiy Satarov and a department of the president's staff. "This is a daily uphill job, but I know that President Bill Clinton's staff thinks nothing is more important than interaction with the Congress", Filatov stressed. He added that the presidential message to the parliament on the state of the federation will urge all three branches of power to interact constructively in making effective in practice the constitutional provisions which protect human rights, ensure reforms and combat crime. The president has prepared a package of 60 bills on economic and court reforms, and on the state system, as well as draft civil, land and environmental codes, Filatov added.
