FR941219-0-00060 FR941219-0-00016 (3) One comment suggested that requiring prepaid, first-class postage for a Servicing Disclosure Statement that is mailed is unnecessary, costly, and inconsistent with the disclosure mailed in compliance with the Truth in Lending and Equal Credit Opportunity Acts. If the transaction is handled by mail, one commenter suggested, the period of three business days should begin only after the lender receives a written application from the borrower. HUD response. The use of prepaid, first-class mail is common business practice. The practice reasonably assures that the borrower will receive the Servicing Disclosure Statement and, thus, affords protection to those responsible for delivering the statement. The 3-business day period begins only when the application is received. (4) Four commenters suggested that lenders be permitted to include in the Servicing Disclosure Statement a statement that ``the loan cannot be funded unless the acknowledgements are signed and returned.'' One commenter asked that no follow-up correspondence be required if the lender has provided the Servicing Disclosure Statement to the borrower and the borrower has not returned a signed Acknowledgement. HUD response. The Department has deleted in this final rule the provision that no loan should be funded unless the signed Acknowledgement was contained in the loan package. HUD has determined that there is sufficient oversight by regulators and secondary market purchasers, and no overriding reason to highlight the Servicing Disclosure Statement over any other required statement. However, the Acknowledgement is still required to be a part of the loan package. The Department has also eliminated the mandatory follow-up requirement that was included in the interim rule. (5) One commenter stated that if the servicing is always sold, transferred, or assigned, there is not a ``present servicer'' or a ``new servicer'' at the time of application for the loan. The model language of the Notice of Transfer indicates that the borrower will be informed about the servicer, but the language fails to state when and in what format the borrower will receive this information. HUD response. The Department disagrees with the content of this comment. Whoever sells, transfers, or assigns a federally related mortgage loan is considered the present servicer and is called the ``transferor servicer'' in this rule. The servicer that buys, is transferred, or is assigned the mortgage servicing function is the new servicer and is called the ``transferee servicer.'' A mortgage broker that closes a table-funded transaction in its own name is in the position of a transferor servicer. A dealer in a first lien dealer loan situation is also a transferor servicer. Appendix B of the interim rule presented sample language for the Notice of Transfer; the language is retained in substantial degree in this final rule. As with the Servicing Disclosure Statement, discretion is allowed concerning the exact wording of the Notice of Transfer, but the various elements that the notice must contain are detailed in ยง3500.21(e). (6) Two commenters requested clarification about who bears the primary responsibility for notifying the borrower of a transfer of servicing when the transferor and transferee choose to notify the borrower in a single, joint Notice of Transfer. HUD response. HUD believes that in normal business transactions, the timing and issuance of Notices of Transfer would be resolved as part of the purchase and sale agreement. If a joint notice is not feasible, both notices will be required. (7) Several commenters were concerned about the impact of the requirements on the servicer's ability to administer collection practices consistent with investor requirements. A commenter questioned whether a late payment could be assessed prior to the 60-day period if the payment had not been made to the transferee. Also, two commenters asked whether late fees due prior to the transfer could be assessed.
