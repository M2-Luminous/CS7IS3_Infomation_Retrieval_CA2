This is because he once served as a Chongnyon [General Association of Korean Residents in Japan] cadre. His parents and siblings have embarked on the repatriation ship, and he himself has also visited North Korea. Mr. Chang had been vice chairman of the Chongnyon headquarters in the Niigata region, famous for the base of repatriation ships. He left Chongnyon in 1989, and is now in the forefront of the anti-Chongnyon movement. This is because he is conscience-stricken for having sent innocent compatriots to North Korea, a land of hell. His father and eldest brother died there after going through hardships. His second eldest brother has been missing since Mr. Chang began the anti-Chongnyon movement. I met with Mr. Chang at his apartment. He is waging an unaided struggle in Niigata. [U Chong-chang] I hear that Chongnyon members are wavering. [Chang Myong-su] In 1991, an event happened in Niigata. Cadres from North Korea called in the families of repatriates to the ship Mangyongbong-ho, threateningly, telling them to shell out donations. Then, giving 20 million yen, a businessman whose elder brother is in North Korea shouted "this money is not yours, but our family's." It had been unimaginable in the past for people of Chongnyon to stand against cadres from North Korea. This is a sign of wavering. [U] Has your safety not been in danger while you have been engaged in the anti-Chongnyon movement? [Chang] In October 1989, when I was about to contribute an article on the human rights abuse of repatriates to a Japanese monthly magazine for the first time, a Chongnyon cadre was dissuading me from writing such an article, saying that he would make arrangements for me to meet with Chairman Han Tok-su. I said that I would be willing to meet him if Chongnyon admitted that sending compatriots to North Korea is a national crime. After that, I had never heard from them. Since I founded the council in April 1990, I have been threatened and shadowed. They have even been spreading a rumor that I am a cat's paw of the ROK Government. [U] In what direction have you decided to move your activities? [Chang] A considerable number of the repatriates are missing. I understand that the Chongnyon Central Committee is in agony over this issue. Because Chongnyon has played a leading role in sending compatriots to North Korea, that organization should also resolve the issue of the return of the repatriates. I am determined to endlessly urge that Chongnyon resolve this issue. [U] What is the response in Japan? [Chang] Japanese broadcasting stations, which had been silent over Chongnyon's sending Korean residents to North Korea, dealt with the issue of repatriates in a series of three installments two years ago. I understand that Chongnyon's influence over Japanese journalism is enormous. But, the Japanese journalists are now paying attention to this issue.
