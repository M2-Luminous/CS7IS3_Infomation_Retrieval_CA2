Marcinkus and A. Arlauskas, commanders of Lithuania's only two air bases situated in Meskuiciai, Siauliai region, and Pajuoste, Panevezys region, voiced their distrust in the Seimas [parliament] National Security Committee [NSK] and its chairman, V. Petkevicius. A statement sent to the president, the Seimas, and the government reads: "The NSK has changed from a controlling body into a dictatorial one. It is obvious that Chairman V. Petkevicius and the group which leads the committee have thus far failed to realize the functions that the NSK must perform." The commanders claim that "the NSK leadership is exerting particularly powerful pressure on the Air Force. (...) The statement that the few current training fighters are sufficient to meet the needs of military aviation can be seen as inflicting damage to the prestige of the Air Force. The need to control our airspace and state borders is fully ignored. Regardless of state security interests, the Zokniai (Siauliai) airport, which lies in a perfect strategic location suitable for military aviation, was transferred to commercial interests. Its reinforced concrete hangars are used to store groceries, while military aircraft are standing under the open sky." Asked to comment on this statement, A. Arlauskas, commander of the second air base, said that the NSK seems to be deliberately destroying the national defense system. However, everything is done to remove the guilt. According to A. Arlauskas, V. Petkevicius, who recently visited the airports in Panevezys and Siauliai along with the president and the national defense minister, demonstrated his complete ignorance when he asked in everyone's presence: "From whom must we defend our airspace?" Pilots were indignant over the behavior of the NSK chairman during his visit to Siauliai -- the latter allowed himself to degrade the commander of the first air base and the pilots by calling them "blue suckers." Captain J. Marcinkus sent a report to the president in connection with this. Captain A. Arlauskas said that the majority of servicemen at the second air base are skilled aeronautical engineers. However, the latter are employed as guards, because the staff has not yet been confirmed. He claimed that there will soon come a time when there will be no one to manage the airport.
