Party leader James Molyneaux is heading a delegation which will visit New York and Washington. The party said there was a particular need to counter attempts by the republican support group Noraid and other elements to undermine business and industrial interest in Northern Ireland. A statement from the party said a series of routine visits by senior party members had helped to "offset the problems being caused by a small but vociferous minority within the Irish-American community." Fermanagh-South Tyrone MP Mr Ken Maginnis, Euro MP Mr Jim Nicholson and party secretary Jeffrey Donaldson leave with Mr Molyneaux on April 16. Last month Mr Molyneaux refused to accept an invitation to address a New York conference attended by the Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams. The party statement added: "Mr Molyneaux believes this is an appropriate time to reinforce relationships on a broader front and has been encouraged by the number of invitations to undertake a more formal visit at this time."
