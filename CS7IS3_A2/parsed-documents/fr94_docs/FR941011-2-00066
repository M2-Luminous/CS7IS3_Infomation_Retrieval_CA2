FR941011-2-00066 FR941011-2-00036 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;411&hyph;000] Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company; Notice of Revised Tariff Filing October 4, 1994. Take notice that on September 29, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) filed as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1, the following revised tariff sheets to reflect the cancellation of Rate Schedule ISST&hyph;NE (effective September 1, 1993) and the installation of a replacement service under Part 284 of the Commission's regulations: To be Effective September 1, 1993 1st Revised Sheet No. 1 1st Revised Sheet No. 21 1st Revised Original Sheet No. 21 1st Revised Sheet No. 125 To be Effective November 1, 1994 2nd Revised Sheet No. 1 Original Sheet No. 21A 2nd Revised Sheet Nos. 125&hyph;129 Original Sheet No. 129A First Revised Sheet No. 317 First Revised Sheet No. 318 Original Sheet No. 659A&hyph;659G Tennessee states that the Preferred Access Transportation rate schedule is an interruptible service that has higher priority than other interruptible services. The service will be generally available to all shippers, but is restricted to transportation of gas withdrawn from storage (Tennessee's or third parties') during the winter season from November through March. These availability restrictions reflect the specialized nature of the ISST service that the Preferred Access Transportation Rate Schedule replaces. The terms and conditions are similar to those in the Texas Eastern Rate Schedule PTI, which has been approved by the Commission. See Texas Eastern, 62 FERC Â¶61,015 (1993). Tennessee states that it is proposing a higher rate than under Rate Schedule IT (100% load factor rather than 125% load factor), and is requiring monthly prepayment for monthly quantities derived from seasonal elections. Tennessee states that the Commission has recognized that higher rates are justified for special higher priority service. Tennessee states that because the service is interruptible, the revenues will be subject to the crediting mechanism in the same manner as those collected under Rate Schedules IT and IT&hyph;X. This service does not represent new throughput on the system, but merely the repriortization of existing interruptible volumes. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest such filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before October 12, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
