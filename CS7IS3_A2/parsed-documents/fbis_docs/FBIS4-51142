The bank reported record rural deposits of more than 700 billion yuan ($80.4 billion) at the end of last week. Bank president Ma Yongwei said the bank had taken 90 billion yuan ($10.3 billion) of personal savings since last December. Farmers have become richer since the government started paying them cash instead of IOUs, for their grain and vegetables, Ma said. So, rural savings have soared. "At present, the bank's individual savings are experiencing a unprecedented upsurge." Ma said, adding that over the past six months, the bank had taken 100 billion yuan $11.5 billion) from individual depositors in the countryside. The surge in individual savings is good news for the bank, which, as a leading creditor in rural China, needs the money to back up government buyers of farm produce during the summer harvest, Ma said. "We have pledged that there will be no more IOUs issued to farmers this summer," he said. At least 80 per cent of the Agricultural Bank's individual savings are fixed deposits, which will be mainly used to fund farm production and grain purchase credits. And arbitrary levies on farmers are also being brought under control by the government, further raising farmers' living standards, he said. Most farmers now believe that bank savings are the best way of protecting their assets, the bank said. The State Information Centre predicts that during the first half of this year, rural per capita income will grow 9 per cent. Last year the country's farmers only earned 3.2 per cent more than in 1992, while urban residents saw their income rise by 10.2 per cent during the same period. The gap between rural and urban living standards appears to be narrowing this year.
