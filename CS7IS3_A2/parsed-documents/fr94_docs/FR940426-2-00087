FR940426-2-00087 FR940426-2-00057 As identified in NEDC&hyph;30851P, Supplement 1, these proposed changes increase the average Control Rod Block failure frequency less than 0.06%. As provided in the NRC Staff's Safety Evaluation Report of NEDC&hyph;30851P, Supplement 1, this increase is very slight and is offset by the safety benefits associated with the proposed changes to the RPS and Control Rod Block Instrumentation. As a result, the combined effect of the changes proposed for the RPS and Control Rod Block Instrumentation requirements should result in an overall improvement in plant safety. Therefore, these proposed changes do not result in a significant increase in either the probability or the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not result in any change to the plant design or operation, only to the AOT and frequency at which testing of the Control Rod Block instrumentation is performed. Since failure of the Control Rod Block instrumentation itself cannot create an accident, these proposed changes can at most affect only accidents which have been previously evaluated. Therefore, these proposed changes cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. As identified above, these proposed changes increase the average Control Rod Block failure frequency less than 0.06%. This increase is very slight and is offset by the safety benefits associated with the proposed changes to the RPS and Control Rod Block Instrumentation. As a result, the combined effect of the changes proposed for the RPS and Control Rod Block Instrumentation requirements should result in an overall improvement in plant safety. In addition, RBS has confirmed that the proposed changes to the functional test intervals will not result in excessive instrument drift relative to the current, established setpoints. Therefore, the proposed changes do not result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Isolation Actuation Instrumentation 1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. These proposed changes do not involve a change to the plant design or operation, only the Allowable Outage Time (AOT) and frequency at which testing of the Isolation Actuation instrumentation is performed. Failure of the Isolation Actuation instrumentation itself cannot create an accident. As a result, these proposed changes cannot increase the probability of occurrence of any design basis accident previously evaluated. As identified in NEDC&hyph;30851P, Supplement 2, these proposed changes to the surveillance test interval requirements for the Isolation Actuation instruments which are common to RPS or ECCS have a negligible (less than 1%) impact on the average isolation unavailability when combined with the individual valve failure probability, and that the changes to the AOTs has [have] less than a 2% impact. The analyses demonstrate that the individual valve failure probabilities dominate the overall isolation failure probability. As provided in the NRC Staff's Safety Evaluation Report of NEDC&hyph;30851P, Supplement 2, these proposed changes would have a very small impact on plant risk. As a result, overall plant safety is not reduced by these proposed changes. As identified in NEDC&hyph;31677P, the proposed changes to the requirements for Isolation Actuation instrumentation not common to RPS or ECCS result in a small decrease of 1.97x10 -8 /year in the average isolation failure frequency. As identified in the NRC Staff's Safety Evaluation Report of NEDC&hyph;31677P, the NRC agreed that these proposed changes are acceptable because the failure frequency impact is minimal. As a result, overall plant safety is not reduced by these proposed changes. The small increase in the average failure frequency of the instruments common to RPS or ECCS due to the proposed changes to the Isolation Actuation instrumentation requirements is offset by safety benefits such as a reduction on the number of inadvertent test-induced scrams and engineered safety feature actuations, a reduction in wear due to excessive test cycling, and better optimization of plant personnel resources. Hence, the net change in risk resulting from these proposed changes would be insignificant. Therefore, these proposed changes do not result in a significant increase in either the probability or the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not result in any change to the plant design or operation, only to the AOT and frequency at which testing of the Isolation Actuation instrumentation is performed. Since failure of the Isolation Actuation instrumentation itself cannot create an accident, these proposed changes can at most affect only accidents which have been previously evaluated.
