Taxpayers may still have to pay up to 2.9 billion pounds to enable Britain's ageing Magnox reactors to be taken out of service, the 100-page report, by the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University, says. The study was commissioned by the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee, which advises it on the methods and costs of dealing with civil nuclear waste. The high and unpredictable costs of decommissioning nuclear sites have been one of the nuclear industry's greatest headaches. The uncertainty was the main reason for the withdrawal of the nuclear industry from the 1989 electricity privatisation. The National Audit Office has estimated that future decommissioning could eventually cost 18bn pounds and that the taxpayer might have to foot the bill as well as the nuclear industry. The research unit report says that annual provisions of between 1m pounds and 5m pounds for new plants could be sufficient to pay for their eventual decommissioning. It points out that this is a small proportion of the income of 200m pounds a year which a typical plant generating 1100MW might earn. Accurate estimates, however, are hard to make until "real progress is made" towards the construction of a store for nuclear waste. Plans to develop a store in the rocks underneath Sellafield in Cumbria have been delayed several times. The fund would not solve the problem of decommissioning the Magnox reactors, the report says. "Over a decade's worth of provisions were effectively `lost' at privatisation of the electricity industry and expected decommissioning costs have risen rapidly in real terms over the last decade." In a separate report the advisory committee says: "Government could be the guardian of the fund but public confidence might be enhanced if the fund was truly independent and retained for the sole purpose of decommissioning plant."
