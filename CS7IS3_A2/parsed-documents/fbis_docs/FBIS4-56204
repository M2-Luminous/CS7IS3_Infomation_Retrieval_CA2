Deputy Lazaro Barrero stressed to the plenum the need for a monetary reform that should include the confiscation of illegally obtained money, a change in currency, and the freezing of excessively large bank accounts. Otto Rivero Torres, president of the Federation of University Students, stressed to the ANPP plenum the importance of increasing control and standards in universities. Other deputies emphasized greater state control over enterprises providing essential services to the people, to prevent the deviation of essential resources required by the people. Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation, saluted Cuban workers in his address to the ANPP special session that began this morning at the Convention Palace. Ross stressed that we are observing 1 May by working and seeking appropriate solutions to the current crisis. Ross went on to say that in the last two months Cuba has lived a great event in the realm of labor, the Parliaments in the Workplace. Ross explained that the matter of correcting the economic situation was very much present in the debates that took place in these meetings of workers, which once more demonstrated the workers' unconquerable faith in the Revolution. Cuba's economic imbalance, manifested by the 11.636 billion pesos in excess currency, is the reason that proposals for correcting the economy are being evaluated. Finance and Prices Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez gave an address detailing some of the proposals and measures under study, among them an increase in the prices of certain nonessential products such as cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. In the case of cigarettes, the changes will not affect the present categories of distribution. The new prices will be two pesos for a regulated pack, six pesos for extra packs, and 10 pesos for unregulated packs. This will require an adjustment in production. With reference to alcoholic beverages, the proposal is to establish differentiated prices according to their type and category. The proposals of the minister of finance and prices to the ANPP special session included a selective increase in prices and rates for public services. In that sector, to raise the price of electricity could be an effective method of increasing the revenues to the government's budget. The study conducted and presented to the ANPP by Jose Luis Rodriguez proposes charging nine cents per kilowatt to consumers who do not exceed 100 kw monthly. The consumers who use between 100 and 300 kw monthly will pay 20 cents per kilowatt. Consumers who use more than this amount will be charged 20 cents extra. Finance and Prices Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez explained that the measures under study to correct the economic crisis will constantly make allowances for the lower income sector of the population. The elimination of subsidies to various products and the allocation of these subsidies to the people in the lowest income brackets is also under consideration, in order to enable them to cope with the selective increase of prices in various sectors. The proposals under study in the ANPP special session include increasing the current rates for telephones, postal services, and automotive fuel; the latter could mean doubling or tripling the present cost per liter. Under consideration is the possibility of charging entry fees to specified cultural and sports events, which could convey over 8 million pesos to the national budget. Finance and Prices Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez explained that, with the objective of covering the costs of workers' dining halls, one proposal includes a decentralized setting of prices that would be easily adjusted to the conditions and quality being offered. Rodriguez added that one proposal is to charge boarding school students for lunches; a minimum fee of 35 cents could produce an annual revenue of 29 million pesos. Rodriguez pointed out that the proposals, including lowering subsidies to students, exclude the low income sector of the population. The ANPP special session is also discussing measures such as taxes on personal income, documents, properties, and water service. The proposed cost for water service is one peso a month per person. The address by the finance and prices minister mentions the possible change of the currency for a convertible peso. Changing the Cuban peso was described as feasible and it was announced that several alternatives have been studied toward this end. Likewise, the possibility of strengthening the value of the peso by gradually increasing the quality of goods and services was described. Regarding the state, the Finance and Prices Ministry proposal includes the reduction of subsidies that resulted in losses of 1.3 billion pesos this year; this will make it possible to reduce the fiscal budget by 24 percent. The possibility of selling personal insurance is also under consideration, as are diverse means to stimulate bank savings accounts in order to remove from circulation the largest possible amount of currency.
