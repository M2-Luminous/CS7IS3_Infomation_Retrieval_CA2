Sources in his close entourage said he is staying in his countryside residence in order "to quietly, without emotions consider what has happened and how to act". Spokesman of the Belarusian parliament Vasiliy Vorobev hinted that Shushkevich would hardly agree to become the chairman of the CIS Parliamentary Assembly, the post proposed to him by Vladimir Shumeyko, the speaker of the Federation Council, the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament. The post was earlier occupied by former Russian speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov who was arrested after the October opposition rebellion in Moscow. Vorobev said that the statement of Shushkevich's adviser who said that the former leader might accept the post "reflects mostly the personal opinion of the adviser, rather than of Stanislav Shushkevich". However, Vorobev said that he had not spoken with Shushkevich on the subject and added that it is too early to make any predictions.
