FR941122-1-00064 FR941122-1-00015 An SMR licensee initially authorized on any of the channels listed in Table 4A of Section 90.617 on or before August 9, 1994 may transfer or assign its channel(s) to another entity subject to the provisions of Sections 90.153 and 90.609(b). If the proposed transferee or assignee is the MTA licensee for the spectrum block to which the channel is allocated, such transfer or assignment presumptively will be deemed to be in the public interest. 13. A new Section 90.771 is added to Subpart S to read as follows: ยง90.771 Field strength limits. The predicted or measured field strength at any location on the border of the MTA service area for MTA licensees shall not exceed 22 dBuV/m unless all bordering MTA licensees agree to a higher field strength. In the event that this standard conflicts with the MTA licensee's obligation to provide co-channel protection to incumbent licensees under Section 90.621(b), the requirements of Section 90.621(b) shall prevail. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28760 Filed 11&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M
