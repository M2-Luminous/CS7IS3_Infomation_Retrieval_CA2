The Hong Kong economy is so intimately linked to its Chinese counterpart that they sink or swim together. Moreover, the meeting took place as the fast-growing Chinese economy successfully pulled off a "soft-landing," meaning that it has been able to grow rapidly yet steadily. Economic reform in China too has been enormously successful and is about to enter the most critical phase, which will be a shot in the arm for the Hong Kong economy. For all these reasons, the meeting naturally attracted the utmost interest in Hong Kong. During the past month, the Hong Kong media printed article after article on the convening of the 3d Plenary Session, analyzing, discussing, and speculating on what new measures the Chinese would take to develop the market economy and deepen reform. An Immensely Significant Document It is widely agreed in Hong Kong's economic and theoretical circles and among people in the media that the plenary session was being held at an opportune time. The "Decision on Certain Issues Relating to the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy," which was discussed at the meeting, is an enormously significant programmatic document. It offers a penetrating analysis and clear exposition of a string of important ideological and theoretical issues relating to the development of the Chinese economy and the deepening of reform in the next stage. It achieves a consensus and lays down important decisions on how to create a basic framework for a socialist market economy by zeroing in on the essential areas. It will certainly push economic development to a new high, the most basic guarantee of the long-term and steady development of the Hong Kong economy and its prosperity. To establish a socialist market economy, the 3d Plenary Session called for the deepening of reform in a wide range of areas, including banking, financial administration and taxation, investment, foreign trade, state enterprises, social security, agriculture, and scientific and technical education. Essentially it will include, first of all, the reform of the microeconomy, specifically changing the operating mechanism of state enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise system. Second, it involves reforming, nurturing, and developing the market system, particularly the acceleration of the maturation and perfection of the capital goods market. Third, it involves reform at the level of macroeconomic regulation and control, specifically changing government functions and establishing a macroeconomic regulatory and control system for these sectors: banking, finance, prices, investment, foreign exchange, and social security. For the moment the most important and urgent thing is to achieve a breakthrough in banking and financial and tax administration by creating a new banking and tax system and operating mechanism. The reason is that "banking is the lifeblood of the market economy" while financial administration and taxation directly determine the ability of the central government to regulate and control the macroeconomy. The local media are fully aware of the enormous effort that has gone into the deliberations over and drafting of this document. We can be quite sure it is the distillation of the experiences of 15 years of reform and the wisdom of people of all quarters, starting with Deng Xiaoping's reform philosophy. CPC leaders personally conducted numerous studies and surveys in various locations, carried out ideological work at the local level, and repeatedly spoke publicly about his thought and his ideas on deepening reform. The 3d Plenary Session was preceded by the publication of the Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, which provided full ideological preparation for the drafting of the programmatic document. Public opinion too was fully prepared for what the document would include. During the drafting process, the opinions of high-ranking figures both inside and outside the party were solicited again and again in hopes of reaching a consensus. It went through 10 drafts in all. For these reasons, the document is highly practicable and theoretical. It is a programmatic document on modern Chinese construction, its place in history comparable to that of the "Decision on Economic Reform" adopted by the 3d Plenary Session of the 12th CPC Central Committee in 1984. Economic Development Both Rapid and Stable On the eve of the 3d Plenary Session, numerous newspapers in Hong Kong printed "Highlights of Deng Xiaoping's Speeches Delivered in Wuchang, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shanghai" in early 1992. Deng Xiaoping emphasized in his speeches that "development is the only way to go." "Grasp the opportunity; develop ourselves." "The key is economic development." "Don't stand in the way of places which are capable of development." "Places where conditions are ripe should try to develop a little faster." The media consider all this of profound importance as it further unifies public understanding of the issue of growth rate and determines the direction in which China should move forward. Besides, it has been a big morale booster to the people of Hong Kong. At a time when Sino-British political talks have yet to produce an agreement and China is tightening macroeconomic regulation and control in an effort to cool the economy, Hong Kong investments in the mainland continue to rise and U.S. and Japanese capital keeps flowing into Hong Kong in large quantities in preparation for the big push into China, in the process driving up share prices sharply on the Hong Kong stock market. The media take this as a vote of confidence in the Chinese economy, a sign that the Chinese economy will continue its fast growth after the 3d Plenary Session, its prospects getting more and more attractive. Even as they are convinced of fast economic growth ahead for China, some local scholars note that the number one issue facing China today is stability. Economic growth must be stable as well as fast; only stable growth can be true, fast growth. Will the Chinese economy become overheated again in the future? Will the scale of investment expand mindlessly again? Will there be an upsurge in inflation? These problems concern them. They believe that as long as China does not have an effective restraining mechanism and risk mechanism, their recurrence is inevitable. Hence the overriding importance of maintaining economic stability. Some scholars even argue that an annual growth rate of 7 or 8 percent is good enough and that China should not pursue double-digit growth in order to steer clear of the boom-and-bust cycle and the resultant heavy losses. Earlier some people portrayed macroeconomic regulation and control and accelerated development, even accelerated reform, as mutually exclusive. They would have you believe that it was a mistake to tighten macroeconomic regulation and control. Many local experts do not share this point of view because, first of all, macroeconomic regulation and control can be found in all countries that have a market economy. Since China is in the midst of a transition from the old economic system to the new, the need for macroeconomic regulation and control is even greater. Second, macroeconomic regulation and control has indeed been highly effective. Had the government not imposed the earlier round of controls, instead allowing the financial sector to drift into chaos, inflation to worsen, and the exchange rate to plunge, both economic development and the effort to deepen reform would have been badly hindered. Thirdly, China's top priority now is to carry through with macroeconomic regulation and control to hold down inflation, trim the trade deficit, improve the economic structure, and boost government revenue, thus setting the stage for the continuous development of the economy and the deepening of reform. It Takes Time To Establish Market Economy The local economic and theoretical circles are highly hopeful that the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee would bring about a breakthrough in economic reform. Economic structural reform in the last 15 years has been a huge success and laid a solid foundation, thanks to incremental reform of the past. The practice of advancing gradually and steadily is consistent with China's national conditions. In rural reform, in particular, spectacular breakthroughs have been made in price reform and opening to the outside world. Some scholars describe past reform as following a "roundabout strategy" and argue that it has been limited to matters of "secondary" importance. Not true in fact. Take price reform, for instance. You cannot say it is "secondary." Price reform, a big success story of the past few years, has always been billed as the "key" to successful reform. Today, we may say, the "fortress" of price reform has been captured. In the next stage of reform, we must launch an offensive against the other "fortresses" of the planned economy in an effort to create a full-fledged market economy. Be that as it may, some Hong Kong scholars have some misgivings about "accelerated reform." Would "targeted breakthrough" become "shock therapy?" While acceleration is necessary, they believe, we must not go after instant success. The reason is that China will find the pain of radical change unbearable. Once things get out of hand, the consequences will be catastrophic. A market economy cannot materialize overnight; it takes a lengthy process of maturation, growth, and improvement. Other scholars argue that 15 years of reform have given us a wealth of experience and the national economy has developed to a point where it can withstand a good deal of stress. In the future, when it comes to reform we should move quickly whenever possible. The idea is to bring about a change with one move in order to reduce the conflicts that occur as the old order gives way to the new and the resultant losses. Needless to say, wherever quick action is impossible, we must stick to the incremental approach and carry out reform step by step. Work Hard To Develop Primary Industries The People's Bank of China announced recently that because macroeconomic regulation and control has gone well, the state of banking in China has improved and is gradually returning to normal. This is good news to the people of Hong Kong because it suggests a Chinese economy that is growing rapidly, steadily, and healthily, creating a favorable climate for Hong Kong to invest in the mainland and bolster its imports and exports. Structural imbalances, Jiang Zemin [3068 3419 3046] pointed out recently, are one of the major barriers to accelerating the Chinese economy. It is the hope of the Hong Kong economic community that in the days ahead China will make the correction of structural imbalances its top economic priority by concentrating its energies on the development of primary industries and the infrastructure, expediting the development of the transportation, communications, telecommunications, and energy industries and other important raw material industries, and easing the "bottlenecks" in economic development in order to better the foreign investment climate. The Chinese Government has decided to abolish over 2,700 development zones, which means that we will still have about 500 national- and provincial-level development zones, still too many. The number should be further scaled back so that whatever funds available can be concentrated on and put to better use in developing a number of key development zones, thus making the investment pay off sooner. A few days ago the Chinese Government approved 54 new major large-scale projects in the "bottleneck" industries. They will be a big boost to the economy. Speed Up Lawmaking for Market Economy As local experts see it, the market economy is an economy of laws based on highly competitive commodity production and commodity exchange. Inevitably it is accompanied by haphazardness, social injustice, and other maladies. Even more so than the planned economy, therefore, the market economy needs to be guided, regularized, safeguarded, and disciplined by a sound legal system. The Hong Kong economy is a well-developed market economy as well as an economy solidly based on laws, the product of a lengthy and gradual development process. In this sense Hong Kong offers a model that China can emulate as it develops a market economy. Some Hong Kong scholars take pains to point out that a market economy is no panacea. It is wrong to make a fetish of the planned economy, of course, but it is just as wrong to have blind faith in the market economy. The emphasis by the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on the accelerated development of a legal system is both necessary and timely from the perspective of building a socialist market economy vigorously but cautiously.
