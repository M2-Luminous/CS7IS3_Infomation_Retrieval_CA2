They live and carry on activities together with more than 80 percent of the country's population in more than 8,800 villages composed of more than 50,000 hamlets. These party members play a very important role in the movement to develop rural life and our country's agriculture in all respects. Reality shows that the strength of the party members and of the movements in the rural areas depends mainly on the quality of the core cadres at the primary level. There is no doubt about this. 1. Looking at the past 8 years of carrying on renovation, in difficult conditions, most of the primary-level cadres in the rural areas have remained zealous and dedicated to the work, and they have overcome the difficulties, maintained their quality, and striven to complete the tasks assigned them. Some of the primary-level cadres have matured, actively overcome the difficulties, expanded agriculture with a commodity production orientation, begun to tie production to markets, and contributed to changing the socioeconomic situation in the rural areas in basic and important ways. Result will vary depending on the region and base, but clearly, if most of the cadres fail to maintain their quality and prestige and cadres lack the ability to carry out the tasks, it will not be possible to make good changes in the various spheres in the rural areas. Surveys in a number of localities show that 77 percent of the cadres in general, 69.7 percent of the cadres in the 10 primary positions, and almost 75 percent of the cadres in the 3 key positions have made a great effort to carry out the tasks. Some people say that the great leap forward made by our country's rural areas and agriculture is due to the fact that the mechanism has been renovated and not to the ranks of primary-level cadres. But that is not true. It's true that this is due in large part to the mechanism. But without people, how could the mechanism "enter" life? Furthermore, the mechanism is set up by people. Without people, how could there be a mechanism? The reason why the mechanism to renovate agricultural management has been able to manifest strength is that it has been developed, tested, and reviewed at the primary level. The great achievements scored by the primary-level cadres are very clear and cannot be denied. The rural area cadres have matured through production and work realities, and they are tied to production and the lives of the people in the locality. Because of this, they have the capabilities to find real solutions to the conflicts and problems that arise in the rural areas. This is a great and very basic advantage. At the same time, among these cadres, a rather large percentage have undergone training and matured in the military and in organizations, enterprises, and schools. Statistics from a number of localities show that in the 10 primary positions, 58 percent are demobilized soldiers and 3 percent are retired cadres. As for the three key positions, the percentages are 64 percent and 6 percent respectively. This is a special characteristic of the ranks, because their structure has undergone clear changes during the past 15 years. The average age of the rural area cadres has gradually declined, forming clear age-group categories. In 1992, surveys conducted at 100 villages in five rural areas representative of the entire country showed that 40 percent of the cadres were age 35 or below (an increase of 2.3 percent as compared with 1989), 34 percent were between the ages of 36 and 45 (an increase of 1.8 percent as compared with 1989), and 26 percent were 46 or older (a decline of 0.8 percent as compared with 1989). In particular, in the three key positions, 47 percent of the cadres were 40 years old or younger (a decline of 3 percent); 42.5 percent were 41-45 (a decline of 2.8 percent); and 10.5 percent were 51 or older (a decline of 1.1 percent). Another point that must be affirmed is that the primary-level cadres, particularly those in the key positions, have made important advances with respect to cultural, theoretical, and managerial standards. As for cultural standards, 50 percent of the cadres have level-II standards, and 26.3 percent have level-III standards. In the 10 primary positions, 54.5 percent have level-II standards, and 38.4 percent have level-III standards. As for political theory standards, in the 10 primary positions, 52 percent have elementary standards, and 18 percent have middle- and high-level standards, and in the 3 key positions 35.1 percent have elementary standards and 38 percent have middle- and high-level standards. As for managerial standards, in the key positions, 24 percent have studied economic management, and 18 percent have studied state management. In each of these spheres, the percentage has increased an average of 1.8-2.5 percent as compared with 1989. What should be pointed out is that at many bases, this factor has played a decisive role with respect to development in the locality. 2. However, it must be admitted that among the ranks of rural area cadres, there are many problems that need to be solved. Surveys conducted at many village bases show that 14 percent of the cadres in general, 17-21 percent of the cadres in the 10 primary positions, and more than 16 percent of the key cadres need to be replaced. The limitations of the primary-level cadres in the rural areas today are evident in the following main aspects: First, the standards of a large percentage of the cadres are low (also, there are rather wide variations between regions). In the 10 primary positions, more than 11 percent of the people have level-I cultural standards (in the Central Highlands the percentage is 17 percent). In the three key positions, more than 8 percent have only a level-I education (more than 14 percent in the Central Highlands). As for economic management standards, in the 10 primary and 3 key positions, the percentages of people who have received training are 11 percent and 24 percent respectively. The percentages for state management standards are 8.2 and 18 percent respectively. For the entire rank of cadres, with respect to cultural standards, 19 percent have only a level-I education (more than 58 percent in the Central Highlands), and almost 2 percent are illiterate (17.2 percent in Gia Lai and Kontum Provinces). Only 3 percent have received training in economic management, and only 2 percent have received training in state management. In general, cadres in the rural areas have not been trained in all respects, and they cannot carry out the tasks assigned them. Because of this, in carrying out the tasks, they rely mainly on their experience and do things in an arbitrary manner. They do not do things democratically, and they act in an irresponsible manner. This is the case in many places to varying degrees. Second, the forces of young cadres are still sparse, and the number of female cadres, of whom there are already very few, is clearly declining. Surveys conducted in 19 villages in Thai Binh, Quang Nam-Danang, and Minh Hai Provinces during 1991 and 1992 show that in the 10 primary positions, only 15 percent of the cadres are below the age of 30, and only 10 percent are women (both categories have declined an average of 0.6 percent as compared with 1989). In the three key positions, only 5 percent of the cadres are below age 30, and only about 1 percent are women (a drop of 0.2 percent). In particular, surveys conducted in 11 villages in Hai Hung, Thua Thien-Hue, and Ha Tay Provinces show that 10 of the villages do not have any female cadres in the three key positions. The same is true nationwide. Of those participating at the village party committee echelon during the period 1991-1993, only 17 percent of the cadres were below the age of 30, and only 11 percent of the cadres were women. Those are alarming figures that need to be given attention. Third, the work style of cadres in general is administrative and bureaucratic in nature. Above all, the key village cadres meet too often. We noted that in seven villages in two provinces, during the first 3 months of 1992, there was an average of seven meetings a month. The activities of many primary-level cadres, particularly those in the 10 primary positions, consist mainly of going from their homes to their offices. Because of this, they are unaware of what is happening in the hamlets and villages or learn about what has happened only much later. 3. The material and spiritual lives of the primary-level cadres are very difficult, and many of these cadres have many desires and concerns. Surveys conducted in six villages in Hai Hung and Minh Hai provinces show that up to 9 percent of the families are poor. As for those cadres who were "pillars" in previous years and who have remained loyal, upright, and incorruptible, they and their families are still living in poverty. Most of the recent arrivals are former soldiers who have just matured. Because of this, they are in dire economic straits. The "hunger" for information among primary-level cadres is a widespread phenomenon. Normally, each village receives only a few newspapers, and these are reserved for the key cadres. Their information is mainly in the form of official letters and directives from higher echelons. The rest comes from listening to the radio, but fewer than half of the cadres have a radio. In the past, a number of villages had a system of public loudspeakers, but because of poor management and the elimination of state subsidies, almost all of these are broken. Because economic life is still difficult, few primary-level cadres are able to obtain information and study on their own in order to raise their standards. For several years now, many places have had a policy of not promoting primary-level cadres to the district level. Because of this, the young cadres at the primary level have not seen any way to advance. At the same time, because the procedures and policies regarding primary-level cadres are inappropriate, the common tendency of cadres today is to "concentrate on engaging in economic activities for their families." If they participate in activities, they want to participate only in cooperatives and administrative organizations. They are very afraid of engaging in party and mass organization activities. Besides this, at times the echo of a "new authoritarian" class in the rural areas has generated many concerns among the primary-level cadres, particularly the young cadres. Also, the ideological differences among the various strata of cadres are becoming clearer and clearer, and these have led to unfortunate conflicts. Some older comrades think that younger cadres are impolite, rude to superiors, and unwilling to listen. Conversely, younger comrades think that older cadres are conservative, paternalistic, and empirical. 4. From various studies, we can see a number of factors that exert a powerful effect on the ranks of rural area cadres: a. Prior to the Fifth Plenum of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee, we had not conducted in-depth studies or formulated a basic and synchronized economic and social development strategy or strategy for building the new rural area. Many of the economic and social policies on rural areas were inappropriate and slow to be changed. We were slow to clarify the functions and tasks of the organizations in the political system at the primary level, and we were slow to formulate unified work regulations based on cadre positions. b. There are still a number of shortcomings concerning the leadership and management responsibilities of the echelons directly superior to the primary level. They have not adhered closely to the ranks of primary-level cadres (monitoring things mainly through records and reports), and appropriate and effective policies and solutions have not been implemented. Staff and support elements have not done a good job of guiding and controlling the bases. c. Primary-level cadre planning and training has not been carried on well in accord with the the positions of the cadres. The selection and assignment of cadres is still characterized by either a lack of democracy, localism, and rightist tendencies or an attitude of "wait and see" and "lethargy." d. Many of the policies on primary-level cadres are sketchy and even "uneven" and irrational, but little has been done to overcome this situation. There are no effective regulations or solutions to prevent and put a stop to corruption, undemocratic actions, local thinking, and factionalism, which are things that have led to disputes and disorder in the rural areas. 5. Based on the present situation, in order to solve the above problems, in my view, efforts should be concentrated on clarifying and resolving the following: As for organizational activities, solidifying and improving the party and administrative organizations, cooperatives, and mass organizations should be closely tied to implementing the programs and hitting the targets related to developing the economy and society and building the new rural area in accord with the special characteristics of each region. Based on regulating the assignment of the managerial and leadership positions of the administrative and party organizations at the primary level, studies should be done in order to "frame the responsibilities" of a number of key and primary cadre positions at the primary level in places where this is possible in order to improve the effectiveness of the apparatus. The experiences of Hai Hung, Thai Binh, and Ha Tay Provinces show that the village party committee secretary can serve concurrently as the chairman of the village people's council or village people's committee and that the party chapter secretary can serve concurrently as hamlet chief. In my view, the lessons in establishing "hamlet administrative committees" in Dai Loc in Quang Nam-Danang Province and the "hamlet administration" form--a partial echelon in Thai Binh--are good lessons. The task of these units is to help the village people's committees manage all aspects in the hamlets over which the village people's committees have jurisdiction. They can even regulate production (the function of the production units). As for cadre work, the echelons directly superior to the bases must regularly make inspections and categorize the ranks of key cadres by position in order to organize and arrange things in an appropriate manner. At the same time, cadre standards must gradually be formulated by position. For example, cadres in the delta areas must be at least level-II graduates. Depending on the conditions, those in the mountainous areas and Central Highlands can have lower standards, but cadres engaged in some task must definitely receive training concerning the responsibilities, tasks, and technical aspects of that job. At the same time, the cultural standards of the cadres must gradually be raised. The system of classes and cadre training programs must be renovated in accord with the special characteristics of the rural area. These should be short-term classes that are tied to the positions of the cadres. Attention should be given to the forms used to introduce and study the good experiences at rural bases. Cadre work, from observing and evaluating to training, assigning, rewarding, and disciplining cadres, must be democratized. Biased, narrow, and local thinking must be avoided. Along with perfecting the the work regulations of the organizations, we must continue to formulate and perfect the stipulations on the rights and responsibilities of all types of cadres based on their position. These regulations and stipulations must be made public in order to facilitate controlling and monitoring the activities of the organizations and cadres. As for policies, village cadres are part of the ranks of party and state cadres in the present four-echelon party and administrative system. Because of this, studies should be done so that, if possible, the wage system can be applied in a suitable manner. The first thing is to unify the system of allowances based on position for the cadres at the primary level. At the same time, we must continue to examine, supplement, and perfect the procedures and policies regarding state cadres who work in rural areas for long periods, particularly technical cadres. In summary, in expanding agriculture and developing the rural areas in our country, the primary-level cadres in the rural areas play a very important role. Whether our country's agriculture and rural areas make rapid and good progress depends to a great extent on the standards and strength of these cadres. Building and strengthening the ranks of primary-level cadres in the rural areas is a basis for strengthening the role and increasing the strength of the party.
