It was, after all, the Army that played the decisive role in the drama. [Grachev] We have not forgotten those terrible events, although six months have passed since then. I want to say that the Army at the time was simply obliged to act decisively and show unity and understanding. To this day the military feel and sense what happened, possibly more so than anyone else. The sad thing is that the Army had to clean up the mess, figuratively speaking, created by political confrontation. Once again, I want to repeat that the Armed Forces at that time prevented a civil war. I want to make it clear that the Army want to see the maximum amount of accord in society. At the moment, accord is simply essential. Without accord there cannot be any reform, not political, economic, or cultural.
