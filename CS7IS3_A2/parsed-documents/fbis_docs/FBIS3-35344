We are meeting today to commemorate the annual anniversary of the General Union of Algerian Workers and the anniversary of the recovery of the national wealth. On this occasion I congratulate all male and female workers. [passage omitted] We are celebrating this anniversary while Algeria is tackling its many-faceted crisis, including the economic crisis. We are aware that the first ones affected by this crisis are the workers, the people on low income, and the most deprived social groups. The economic stagnation has led for years to an increase of unemployment and shortage of investments. This has added to the difficulty of living conditions. I take this opportunity to salute our workers who face the difficulty of this situation with patience and wisdom deserving all appreciation and without abandoning their duty of safeguarding the national economy and without surrendering to the provocations or the political one-upmanships coming from several quarters. [passage omitted] We are following with interest the situation of other countries that went through this experiment; we are aware of the economic and social pitfalls that went hand in hand with these experiments; and this prompts us neither to worship nor imitate any experiment; we do not give any preference to one over another. We are aware that no matter how strong the capabilities of liberalism may be, they remain limited like any other economic choices. If easing the negative sides of the market economy does happen only through a genuine mobilization of the nation's cadres, and the establishment of a real program for national solidarity; this factor also takes places via the support of the state, the bolstering of its capabilities to defend the most needy classes, the presence of a scientific management of resources, and an increase of national production. In this field, we aim to strengthen the state; and at the same time support dialogue and social consultation, because the Algerian state belongs to all Algerians; it is the state of law; it is there to serve the people in its entirely. However, we should reiterate that the state is not and will not be lenient with those who work for the destruction of the country and the sabotage of its economic capabilities. In these circumstances, the workers are called upon to mobilize themselves and show vigilance to defend their institutions against acts of sabotage. Brothers and sisters, if we want to meet the challenge, first of all we should rediscover the value of work and the value of efforts and efficiency; rewards should be based on this criterion alone. Here, we should be frank, we have squandered a great deal of precious time because of absenteeism and because of management negligence; because of wastage and mismanagement in production; and an exaggerated usage of the right to strike. Reviving the national economy, upon which depends the stability and equilibrium of society, falls within the tasks that await us all: namely, the restoration of security, the eradication of violence, the underpinning of the state's structure, the imposition of the rule of law by the competent authorities, the introduction of profound reforms to the state administration, and opening the door of opportunity for youth and capable cadres. All of these actions are seeking to renew the system of the country in a comprehensive way. In the next few weeks the economic and social council will be installed where members of various walks of life in the society will meet to discuss the issues and submit proposals in their respect to the executive authorities. We are convinced that the trade union organization represented by the general union of Algerian workers will play a significant role in these consultations. In the political field we stand by the consultation and the wide participation and by the serious dialogue with all national political forces which abide by the constitution and reject the use of violence. [passage omitted] Brothers and sisters, in conclusion I reiterate congratulations to the Algerian workers, and I call on them once again to be mobilized and vigilant and to work more and be more united and defend the future and the destiny of the country. May God make us all successful, and may God's peace and blessings be upon you.
