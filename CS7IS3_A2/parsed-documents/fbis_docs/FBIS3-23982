Oddly enough, both sides used the same argument: both insisted that their only aim was the protection of the interests of the laboring public, but for some reason they could not reach an agreement. Something else was also odd: the laboring public itself probably does not even know that such heated battles are being fought on its behalf and in its defense. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA decided to rectify this incongruity. The editors are not only informing their readers of the plans for the Social Insurance Fund, but also wish to hear their thoughts on the matter. Let us discuss this vitally important topic ourselves. One Person Will Hold the Reins--What Could Be Wrong with That?... (Opinion of Yuriy Shatyrenko, chairman of Social Insurance Fund) It is a fait accompli: the management of social insurance has been taken out of the hands of the trade unions and turned over to the government by presidential edict. Some people feel that this was done in retaliation for the position the FITUR took during the October events. I think it is only a coincidence, although it is possible to see a natural sequence here. All of this, however, is already history. Now we have to decide what state management will entail. Above all, it will entail some kind of hierarchical structure with a clearly defined, vertical chain of command. The edict said that the government would manage social insurance in conjunction with the all-Russian associations of trade unions. This means that they will be represented in the collegial bodies included in this precise state structure. Therefore, the fund is now managed by a single individual--the chairman, who will have jurisdiction over all other administrators: the chairmen or managers of regional, sectorial, and other divisions and branches. The chairmen and managers on each level will have boards or coordinating councils, made up of representatives of various requisite state institutions (such as, for example, the tax service, labor agencies, financial institutions, and employers) and also, of course, the trade unions. Now we have to decide the degree of trade-union participation. There are now 90 of them in Russia, and all of them want to have a say in the management of social insurance. As the saying goes, the number of opinions is equal to the number of individuals. Just try to coordinate all of these views! The board will have fairly broad powers. It will discuss the draft budget, hear reports on the budget execution and, in general, discuss all of the most important aspects of the work of the Social Insurance Fund on the appropriate levels. The board will not be able, however, to make any decisions independently, because all directives will be based on the orders and instructions of the chairman. If the board and the chairman should disagree, the administrator will have the usual five days to report the disagreement to a superior organization, and this organization's decision will then be final. At the highest level, the federal one, if I, as the present chairman of the fund, disagree with its board, I will have five days to report this to the government, and then it will have the final say. There is no question that these incidents will be rare, because common sense will prevail in most cases. Unfortunately, it was impossible to reach an agreement on this point with the trade unions. They are insisting that the fund should be under group management and that all decisions should be made by the board. This is the most fundamental difference of opinion. The government was the "arbiter" in this case. Members of the government reviewed the matter and decided that a single manager would be preferable. After all, just think what would happen if the heads of the coal workers' and petroleum workers' unions--V. Budko and A. Sergeyev--were both on the board. They never agree on anything, and simply because they do not like each other. They do not even place much importance on the public interest. Therefore, we should agree that today, because there is no unity in the labor movement, we need what might be described as the commanding-officer method of decisionmaking. It is possible that a move to more democratic principles of management might be considered in the future, when things are calmer and when large associations of trade unions have been established. As far as the numerical representation of the trade unions on the board is concerned, it is possible that it should be increased, but exactly what good would this do? The whole purpose is to let all of the unions participate in the management of the fund, so that they can see where the money is being spent and how the interests of the laboring public or a particular branch or occupation are being protected. For this reason, let the trade unions take turns on the board. This would work on the federal level. On the sectorial level, however, things can be much simpler: if there is a sectorial division of, for instance, railroad workers, a representative of the railroad workers will always serve on the board, without any kind of rotation. On the regional level, proportional representation will depend on the leading branches in the region. We have agreed not to get rid of anything that exists and works today. All of it will remain in place until a law on social insurance has been passed. The other possibilities of social insurance will be used in the sphere of public health. We are not excluding the possibility of supplemental systems and are prepared to promote this with the offer of procedural assistance, money, buildings, etc. The present system of social insurance, based on the deduction of 5.4 percent of total wages, provides all employed individuals with only minimum guarantees: for the person who loses his salary because of disability, for the woman who loses her salary because of pregnancy or maternity.... If trade unions wish to become more active and offer some kind of additional support, we will help them do this and we certainly will not interfere in their affairs. There was another point on which we disagreed with the trade unions. They insist on written confirmation that the money in the Social Insurance Fund is their property. I do not agree: this is state money. This is an ordinary tax, just like the income tax or value-added tax. If the state wished, it could liquidate our fund and combine it with, for instance, the pension fund. If it wished, it could raise or lower the rate of deduction. The fund is a purely financial organization which collected money according to a specific rate of deduction and is distributing the money for specific purposes. It should not do anything else with the money. But What About the Trade Unions--Will They Only Get a Seat at the Corner of the Table? (Opinion of Vyacheslav Goncharov, deputy chairman of FITUR) The future of the Social Insurance Fund is still arousing great anxiety in our trade-union organizations and labor collectives, and not because something is being taken away from us, as people in the government have implied. We are aware of all of the responsibility required for the performance of the only services that could have kept the system working flawlessly for many years. The trade unions will continue to be responsible for them by presidential edict. I want to say right away that we are willing to work with state agencies and share the responsibility with them in matters pertaining to the improvement of social insurance. Questions and objections arise, in my opinion, because the trade unions were not consulted before the management of the fund was turned over to the state. I want to stress that the FITUR is ready and willing for dialogue and for the planning and execution of joint actions with the government and employers on the basis of a social partnership. I do not want to overdramatize the situation, but reciprocity is clearly lacking in this process. We do have certain proposals which the new management of the fund did not accept, and we intend to take them straight to the government and defend their validity. I will discuss them in greater detail. First of all, there is the whole structure of fund management. Regrettably, there is no group management in this structure. The new board will play a strictly advisory role, and the representation of trade unions on the board will be confined to the bare minimum. What is the point of discussing the presence or absence of agreement among trade unions now that the FITUR unites almost 92 percent of all workers? Obviously, the representation of the FNPR should be commensurate with this, and the present number of seats for trade unions (7 of the 25) is clearly inadequate. We cannot arrive at a common denominator with the "statesmen" in the argument over the ownership of the money controlled by the fund. They tell us that it is theirs--the state's, but we feel that this is the people's money and that it should belong to the Social Insurance Fund. After all, we know that the budget on the federal level, and especially on the regional level, is bursting at the seams. If we do not defend our position, there could be all kinds of fights over these resources--representing 5.4 percent of total wages. How can the money be used prudently? In addition to the funds used for the designated purpose, a small portion should be allocated for the maintenance of athletic training schools for children and young adults. Otherwise, we might forfeit the money, along with the healthy childhood of the little Russians for whose sake our people are willing to endure all of their difficulties. Medical services also require financial support--perhaps not all services, but prosthetics, post-traumatic care, and rare and complex treatments and operations certainly require some money from the Social Insurance Fund. Besides this, we are naturally concerned about the financing of technical and legal inspections instituted by trade unions and the salaries of our physicians: not so much because they are working under the union banner, but because we have a system--a system that works!--and it would be wrong to demolish it. After all, demolition is not a necessary stage of the construction process. At this time of transition, the trade unions suggest a constructive compromise: the fund budget could be divided into two parts. The first could be used for payments for social guarantees, and it could be managed by directly related agencies of the executive branch of government and by economic structures. The influence of trade unions could be confined to a minimum in this sphere. The other part of the budget, however, could be used for public health (the 19.4 percent allocated for the network of health resorts and 1 percent for the athletic schools for children and young adults), and this portion should be managed by trade unions on all levels and various Russian associations because we own the material base of this health network. We can guarantee that the new board of the Social Insurance Fund can expect nothing but the gratitude of the public if it agrees to this compromise. After the Presses Started Rolling A few days ago the leaders of trade-union associations belonging to the FITUR and the so-called "parallel" associations gathered in the Palace of Labor in Moscow, as if in response to an alarm. There was good reason to sound the alarm: the new board of the Social Insurance Fund (now a state fund) forgot about President B.N. Yeltsin's instructions to work with the trade unions, ordered the liquidation of some central sectorial divisions, tried to seize their assets, and is even taking aim at the trade-union health and vacation resorts. These steps aroused understandable indignation, but will it produce any tangible results? In this context, we are reminded of the old Russian saying about the masters of insincere rhetoric: "Their tongues are coated with honey...."
