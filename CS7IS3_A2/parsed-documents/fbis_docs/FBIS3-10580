The president-in-exile considers this plan not in compliance with the Governors' Island accord signed in New York last July and even counterproductive to implementation of this accord for the reestablishment of democracy in Haiti. President Aristide made these statements on 5 March during a meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Jean-Bertrand Aristide talked for more than an hour with Mr. Butrus-Ghali while several thousand Haitians demonstrated near UN headquarters in support of the president-in-exile. In a news conference following talks with the UN secretary general, the president-in-exile accused the United States of playing a double game. According to Father Aristide, while Washington publicly reasserts its willingness to support the return of democracy to Haiti, it has simultaneously submitted a draft resolution to the UN Security Council which, he says, is the other side of the coin. For the president-in-exile, there is no possible solution outside the framework of the Governors Island accord. We refuse to participate in the delay tactics and political cynicism of the international community, which is ambiguous and weak, says the president-in-exile, and which lacks the willingness to implement the process decided on Governors Island. He acknowledges, however, a firmer commitment from France and Canada. In an effort to afford a quick, direct solution to the crisis, President Aristide again asked for the application of a strict and total embargo. He said that international military intervention is unnecessary. He demanded above all the departure of the authors of the coup d'etat before considering the nomination of a new prime minister and the installation of a concord government. According to a high-ranking UN employee who attended the talks between President Aristide and UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, the president-in-exile appeared at the same time intransigent and disappointed. This high-ranking employee indicated that Jean-Bertrand Aristide feels betrayed by the international community on Governors Island. In a press release issued after the meeting, the UN secretary general stated that the crisis settlement plan voted by the Haitian legislators constitutes a means of overcoming the deadlock and achieving implementation of the Governors Island accord, not the substitution of this accord. Butrus-Ghali and Jean-Bertrand Aristide promised to continue to explore the means of solving the crisis. It should be recalled that on the eve of this meeting between the UN secretary general and the president-in-exile, the group of the Four Friends of Haiti submitted to the UN Security Council a new draft resolution for reinforcing the international sanctions against Haiti. The draft resolution provides for a total trade embargo except for food and drugs, the cancellation of noncommercial flights to and from Haiti, as well as travel restrictions on the coupists and their relatives abroad. The Security Council is due to make a decision within 15 days of this resolution.
