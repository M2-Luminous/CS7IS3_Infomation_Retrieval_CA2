Any sore point in our society or negative phenomenon there immediately appears in the military, and with double or even triple the intensity. The economic crisis is hard for everyone, but for military personnel, who are maintained exclusively at government expense, its consequences are especially grave. Discipline has slackened in the country, crime has become rampant, and these things cannot help but affect the strength of our military ranks. But perhaps the most important issue today is what is happening in the spiritual or psychological area--the crisis of the state and national ideal, the loss of moral reference points in life, and much, much more. While for some people these things are no tragedy, if they can find refuge in the world of individualistic, consumer values, for military people, whose very vocation is founded on the idea of serving the Fatherland and on the idea of patriotism, to lose one's spiritual grounding is like having no weapons or ammunition in battle. In this connection it is hardly surprising that military personnel are among the first who are sounding the alarm about an aggression being waged by the lack of spirituality, amorality, and all-permissiveness that we encounter left and right. It is not surprising that the Armed Forces and Ministry of Defense are increasingly often a source of impulses encouraging a rebirth, on a new basis, of the patriotic and unifying ideal and of effective and productive efforts to rear true civilians and defenders of the Motherland. This theme was the focus of a session of the Russian Ministry of Defense Collegium held several days ago, as KRASNAYA ZVEZDA already reported. The agenda item was worded as follows: "On measures to strengthen military-patriotic education for servicemen and young people in support of the Russian Federation Armed Forces." But in the hall, besides military officials and chiefs of Main and Central Defense Ministry Directorates, one could also see Russian Minister of Culture Ye. Sidorov; Colonel-General G. Yashkin, retired, chairman of the Russian veterans organization; Metropolitan Kirill of Smolensk and Kaliningrad; R. Bykov, the noted film-maker, and many other state and public figures and representatives of concerned organizations. This made it clear that the discussion would inevitably transcend purely departmental bounds and by no means touch on the "interests of the Armed Forces" alone. And that is what happened. The introductory remarks by Russian Defense Minister General of the Army P. Grachev, followed by the report by Deputy Defense Minister Colonel-General V. Mironov, bluntly declared: "This situation cannot continue. Nihilism, lack of spirituality, and morale degeneration have reached an extreme point that poses a danger to both army and navy combat readiness and the security of society and the state. The following facts disclosed at the session caused a bitter sensation: In sociological surveys conducted among conscripts in a number of oblasts on whose territories the units of the Volga, Urals, and North Caucasus Military Districts are stationed, as well as in Moscow and Moscow Oblast, nearly 70 percent said military service was unnecessary, and more than 35 percent spoke of a readiness to emigrate from the Motherland. Every second conscript thinks that such concepts as military duty, honor, and patriotism are things of the past and no longer have any meaning. The character of conscripts is extremely alarming. Drunkenness, drug abuse, and crime are on the rise. Almost every fifth young recruit has committed a legal offense or been taken to the police station, and nearly 10 percent have been convicted of crimes. In view of all these things, the Army and Navy are definitely taking necessary measures. Everything possible is being done. Col-Gen Mironov cited a number of facts relating to every service arm and branch and showing how commanders and Army and Navy educators aren't giving up but are instead trying to work with the contingent now arriving in units and on ships and to get positive results nonetheless. But the main attention of both the keynote speaker and other colleagues who spoke was focused, not surprisingly, on shortcomings and untapped potential. The need to improve cooperation with state and public organizations, patriotic associations, and the mass media was posed with particular urgency. It was pointed out that much in this regard has been lost, unfortunately. Ties with unit veterans, associations of Afghan war veterans, and other patriotic organizations are unraveling. The educational role of the Russian Sports and Technical Defense Association has declined markedly. Many of its primary organizations are more involved in commerce than in the education of future soldiers. The Russian Armed Forces have at their disposal a rather impressive array of assets for military-patriotic education. They include more than 500 officer houses and clubs, 400 military museums, 35 singing and dancing ensembles, six drama theaters, 800 orchestras, and library holdings of several million volumes. But this things need serious support. Every third officers house is in need of renovation. There is a shortage of funds to make video films and movies about the history of service branches and units. Book holdings must be updated. There is almost no literature on the history of Russia and the Russian Army. A study of the state of affairs in military commissariats in Moscow, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara, Tataria, Bashkiria, and a number of other parts of the country show that existing educational potential is being used poorly and that cooperation with government bodies and public organizations is weak. For example, of 246 military-patriotic clubs in Moscow only 14 remain, and of 1,400 museums and military valor rooms in secondary general-education schools only 514 are left. The situation is no better in other republics and oblasts. Honor guards at memorable sites linked with the heroic history of the Fatherland have been eliminated almost everywhere. The Orlenok [Eaglet] and Zarnitsa [Summer Lightning] Games have become a thing of the past. Military sports camps have almost disappeared. Fitness programs for young people, like the Ready for Labor and Defense program, many of whose methods were adopted in other countries, including the United States, France, and Germany, have ceased to function. The report and a number of speeches suggested that it is a serious mistake to abolish the system of elementary military training, which was hardly intended to militarize pupils' way of thinking and has greatly helped youths adjust to army life and master basic army skills. And it is inappropriate that military-patriotic themes have largely disappeared from school textbooks, literature, movies, theater, and art. Unfortunately, the vacuum is being filled by a low-grade promotion of sex and violence. Age-old Russian values are being destroyed. Yes, there are many, many problems, and they are extremely acute. But what can be done? How can the syndrome of destruction be overcome? How can the situation be rectified? "We can talk a lot about forms and methods of patriotic education," said Colonel-General M. Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff, in his speech. "But nothing is going to change unless we start with ourselves, with the patriotic education of officials." He was seconded by R. Bykov. Today our government itself, the national leadership itself is in need of patriotic education, if you will. To be more precise, in need of a change of attitude toward this matter." The film director cited an incident that evoked a stir in the hall. He recounted how a request that an appropriate government agency help finance a movie about the 50th anniversary of the Great Victory brought the following answer: We can't help because "the military budget cannot be increased." This is the level of understanding of the problem, the level of thinking that, unfortunately, is very widespread even among senior officials. "We have reached a point where people have even begun to be embarrassed by the term `military-patriotic' education," said Deputy Defense Minister Colonel-General B. Gromov bitterly in his remarks. He called the attention of those present to the need to seriously improve efforts to instill in young people respect for national history and the achievements of Russian culture. "We must pool our efforts!" was the main point of the speech by Russian Minister of Culture Ye. Sidorov. He said that the Ministry of Culture was prepared to cooperate closely with the Ministry of Defense in all initiatives aimed at the spiritual rebirth of society. In the minister's opinion, a good start would be worthy preparations for the 50th anniversary of the Great Victory and a fitting observance of that event. Metropolitan Kirill also spoke about pooling efforts. In this connection, he characterized the cooperation agreement signed recently by Defense Minister General of the Army P. Grachev and Patriarch Aleksii II of Moscow and All Rus as extremely promising. This "agreement of intentions" of sorts is already operating and making headway in promoting the revival of Russian military traditions. But it is important, the clergyman stressed, to prevent the effort from becoming a short-lived campaign and to avoid excesses, as in a reported incident in one unit in which the following order was issued: "In honor of the observance of the Annunciation, I hereby order..." Real deeds, not fanfare and declarations, are what is needed today. This was emphasized by many colleagues at the session. Any real efforts, no matter how small, to promote the revival of patriotic education must be supported. In particular, attention was called to steps taken by the commanders of the North Caucasus and Transbaykal Military Districts to support effective cooperation with the Cossack movement. In this region, almost 80 Cossack organizations are serving as sponsors for various units and taking part in educational work and efforts to solve social and consumer-service problems. Or consider this example: Despite all difficulties, young sailors clubs in the Northern Fleet, young paratrooper clubs in the Moscow Military District, and young artillery crewmen clubs in St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg have survived and are popular among young people. The same is true of patriotic and military-history associations attached to various units and higher educational institutions. This form of work encompasses more than 50,000 youths, and more than 3,000 servicemen have been enlisted in it. Every effort must be made to publicize such examples and multiply them. Patriotic education enthusiasts must receive comprehensive assistance and support. At the same time, it is clearly impossible to rely solely on someone's enthusiasm. The session leitmotif was the need for a carefully formulated and substantiated state policy on patriotic and military-patriotic education and on the development of appropriate federal programs involving all branches of government, as well as representatives of science, culture, and public organizations. This was also stressed by General of the Army P. Grachev in his closing remarks. He announced that the Ministry of Defense will propose an initiative to the government on launching a federal program to enhance the prestige of military service and to strengthen not only the prestige of the Armed Forces, but also the Russian state and the country's security. As was pointed out, the collegium discussion is only a start, a kind of prologue to a tremendous amount of painstaking work to create in the new conditions a reliable and effective system to rear citizens, patriots, and defenders of the Motherland--a system that both society and the Armed Forces need very much.
