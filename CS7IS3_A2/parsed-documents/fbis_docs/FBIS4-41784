It made public its attitude toward the socio-economic situation in Moldova in the 100 days since the 27 February elections. "The collapse of the standard of living is taking place along with a more insolent theft of state property. The blockage of mass privatization leads to decreasing prices for patrimonial vouchers: this removes the last chance open to the Moldovan citizens to escape hunger and poverty," states the PSDM declaration made public during the press conference. Oazu Nantoi, PSDM chairman, stated that due to the election results a single party is at power this party is responsible for the worsening socio-political situation in Moldova. In his opinion, the stability of the national currency "is due not only to the international credits or policy pursued by the National Bank, but to the Moldovan population's limitless patience." "The governing party is hurrying to ensure a political comfort similar to that of the communist party during the stagnation period. We are witnesses of a cleansing of those who have not hastened to show their loyalty to the governing party," said Nantoi. He also pointed out that freedom of expression is smothered in Moldova and censorship is used in state media. He alleged that the Government "has no clear strategy on how to settle the problems of Eastern and Southern Moldova or consolidating Moldova's statehood." Nantoi stated that another step toward Moldova's disintegration has been enacted by creating a symbolic federation within which the central administration cannot establish sovereignty on its territory. He said that the officials' exaggerated dependence on the relations between Moldova and Russia and "Chisinau's political inefficiency" stimulate Russia's demands for concessions. Nantoi pointed out that in the recent Tiraspol-Chisinau negotiations, the opinions of the Moldovan citizens living in Dniester were not heard. Commenting on the president's joining of the PDAM [Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova], Nantoi said Snegur thus "assumes responsibility for the policy of the governing party."
