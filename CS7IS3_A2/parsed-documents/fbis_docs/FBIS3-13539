[passage omitted] The prison's administration has emphasized to AL-HAYAH that the number of "freed" prisoners totals 901, in addition to eight guards, and that 1,400 prisoners are still in the prison. The cell doors were opened for them, but they refused to leave. [passage omitted] Those observing the escape operation level the accusation of "involvement" at high quarters in power, on the basis of the following: 1. Mohamed Karash, director of Tazoult prison had over the previous eight months sent eight reports to the justice minister, informing him of the intention to attack, the plan, and the timing. He says he "had not received any response until the day of the attack." 2. In an official meeting grouping Interior Minister Selim Saadi; General Abdelhamid Jawadi, commander of the 5th military zone and who is leading the combing operations in the area, in addition to other figures, Abdelsaghir Hamrouche, wali of Batna, raised the issue before participants, so Gen. Jawadi said: "Let them escape," meaning the Tazoult prisoners. 3. Intervention forces near the area arrived in Tazoult eight hours after informing them of the incident. 4. The reports sent to the presidency contain indications that security authorities in neighboring wilayas had knowledge of the attack. Well-informed sources say that "in view of this accurate and reliable information, decisionmakers are astonished at the negative attitude of those concerned, who failed to take suitable measures to foil the attack plan." Some circles in Tazoult attribute the question of "avoiding" foiling the operation to the following: 1. The site of the operation is President Liamine Zeroual's city, whose residents are currently subjected to storming and combing operations by Gen. Jawadi's forces. It is a "clear" message. Some people say that what had happened is a "coup attempt," and this rumor has been circulated throughout the country. 2. The attack was carried out while lists of prisoners to be released were being prepared, the lifting of the curfew considered, stages of the dialogue with the Islamic Salavtion Front planned, and the pensioning of 25 high-ranking officers talked about. Those opposed to the dialogue with the Islamists believe that this operation aborts the dialogue and national reconciliation idea, which President Zeroual and most Algerians hope would produce a comprehensive change. The major attack on Tazoult prison coincided with another attack which is not less important than the first, namely on the ammunition factory situated some 40 km west of Tazoult (birthplace of Gen. Khaled Nezzar). The attack continued for five hours until the intervention of the Air Force, which settled in the clashes in favor of the factory's guards. Political sources believe that the escalation between the two sides is aimed at thwarting Liamine Zeroual's plan, which -- as far as he is concerned -- is a question of life or death. The sources did not rule out that the next days may bring other surprises and important changes at the top of the military establishment and the government.
