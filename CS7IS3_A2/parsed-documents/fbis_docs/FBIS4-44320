Ten years ago, Margaret Thatcher would not hear of appointing France's Claude Cheysson. Today, John Major vetoes the appointment of Belgian Jean-Luc Dehaene. It is no fluke that the Brussels machine should once again be paralyzed by a loose British cog. While beleaguered Tory governments have indeed been in the habit of resorting to anti-European posturing to improve their standing at home, such an explanation tends to fall somewhat short of the mark and in any case clouds the real issue: Twenty-one years after joining the Common Market, the British have in no way given up their notion of a liberal Europe wide open to the rest of the world, and they do not want to miss the opportunity, so thoughtfully offered to them by the Franco-German tandem, to remind the rest of Europe that the UK is no more "interventionist" or "federalist" than it ever was. To be sure, one can argue that Europe has known other crises and that it will weather this one as it has previous ones. Undoubtedly, but in what shape will it come out of it? Because, unlike what used to happen when Europe bounced back unscathed from one deadlock to the next, today each new difficulty damages it further. Europe is not in too good a shape, and it has only itself to blame: While it was politically viable with six members, this became a lot less true with nine, and then with 12 members. No one knows how it can govern itself with 16 members, and a Europe from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains, as asked for by Boris Yeltsin in Corfu, would -- at best -- never be more than a broad free-trade zone. The founding fathers' spiritual heirs may be saddened by this while Euroskeptics may rejoice, but the fact remains that such an evolution is only natural. In the political realm, the word for gluttony is voluntarism, but the results are always the same: indigestion, followed by a forced diet of lighter food. Because they wanted to go too far, too fast, Jacques Delors and Francois Mitterrand may go down in history not as self-styled initiators of the great European breakthrough, but as sorcerer's apprentices who only presided over a return to reality. Like the human body, history has its own rhythms which seldom fit such a short period of time as one or even two seven-year presidential terms.
