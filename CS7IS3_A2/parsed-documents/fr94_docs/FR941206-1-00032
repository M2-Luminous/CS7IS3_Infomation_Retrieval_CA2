FR941206-1-00032 FR941206-1-00005 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [Region II Docket No.137; NJ 18&hyph;1&hyph;6474, FRL&hyph;5116&hyph;9] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; New Jersey Employee Commute Options Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The EPA proposes to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of New Jersey for the purpose of establishing an Employee Commute Options Program. This SIP revision was submitted by the State of New Jersey to satisfy the statutory mandate that an Employee Commute Options Program be established for employers with 100 or more employees. Under the New Jersey program, compliance plans must be developed by these employers. These plans are to be designed to convincingly demonstrate an increase in the average passenger occupancy (APO) of their employees who commute to work during the peak period of no less than 25 percent above the average vehicle occupancy (AVO) of the nonattainment area. AVO is defined as the number of employees reporting to all worksites in the program area from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., divided by the number of vehicles driven by these employees during a typical work week. APO is defined as the number of employees reporting to a specific site from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., divided by the number of vehicles driven by these employees. DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 5, 1995. ADDRESSES: All comments should be addressed to: William S. Baker, Chief, Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, Region II Office, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York 10278. Copies of the state submittal are available at the following addresses for inspection during normal business hours: Environmental Protection Agency, Region II Office, Air Programs Branch, 26 Federal Plaza, room 1034A, New York, New York 10278. New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Office of Air Quality Management, Bureau of Air Quality Planning, 401 East State Street, CN418, Trenton, New Jersey 08625. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeffrey S. Butensky, Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, 26 Federal Plaza, room 1034A, New York, New York 10278, (212) 264&hyph;2517. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 requires employers with 100 or more employees in severe and extreme ozone nonattainment areas to participate in a trip reduction program. This includes 18 of the 21 counties in New Jersey, excluding the counties of Warren, Atlantic, and Cape May. EPA issued guidance on December 17, 1992 interpreting various aspects of the statutory requirements (Employee Commute Options Guidance, December 1992). Although the federal program has been named ``Employee Commute Options,'' or ``ECO'', the State of New Jersey has opted for the name ``Employer Trip Reduction,'' or ``ETR''. The program shall be referred to as ``ETR'' for the remainder of this document. The concern that led to the inclusion of the ETR provision in the amended Clean Air Act is that people are driving more than ever before. In addition, the distances driven per trip have increased considerably. This has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and has offset a large part of the emissions reductions achieved through the production and sale of vehicles that operate more cleanly. It is widely accepted that within a decade, the increased emissions caused by increased VMT and congestion will outweigh the benefits derived from new less polluting vehicles. Unless this increase in VMT is mitigated, there will be an overall increase in emissions from motor vehicles. The ETR provision is designed to decrease the use of single occupancy vehicles and to reduce emissions_beyond what can be and will be obtained via stricter tailpipe and fuel standards. Section 182(d)(1)(B) of the amended Clean Air Act requires that employers submit their compliance plans to a state within two years of the date the State submits its trip reduction plan to EPA. The compliance plans should be designed to ``convincingly demonstrate'' an increase in the APO for their employees who commute to work during the peak period by no less than 25 percent above the AVO of the area. New Jersey has established different zones within its nonattainment areas for the purpose of calculating the AVO. The compliance plans must ``convincingly demonstrate'' that the employers will meet the target within two years of submitting a compliance plan, or by November 15, 1996 for New Jersey. In order to gain approval, a state's submittal must contain each of the following program elements: (1) The AVO for each zone if the area is divided into zones; (2) the target APO(s) which is(are) no less than 25 percent above the AVO(s); (3) an ETR program that includes a process for compliance demonstration; and (4) enforcement procedures to ensure submission and implementation of compliance plans by employers. The acceptability of these elements as submitted by New Jersey is discussed below.
