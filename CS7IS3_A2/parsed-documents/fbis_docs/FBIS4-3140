During an interview with this reporter, Fu Xishou, deputy to the Eighth National People's Congress and governor of Anhui, frankly said that Anhui is determined to realize this goal in the near future. Fu Xishou said: "In the past, we Anhui people were unwilling to shake off the label of being poor. The reason behind this is that if they remain poor they would get help. In fact, nothing was gained by assuming this posture. Moreover, it caused the cadres in some areas to fail to concentrate on economic development. This posture not only showed that Anhui people lacked fighting will but also adversely affected their image. To change this image and Anhui's appearance, we must depend on ourselves, seize opportunities, and work hard in a down-to-earth way." Fu Xishou told the reporter: In the past two years, the people of the province have emancipated their minds, changed their old concepts, and strove to catch up with other areas. The provincial party committee and the provincial government promptly put forward the "one line, two points" strategy aimed at developing the Wanjiang basin, responding to the call for developing Pudong, concentrating on developing the economic belt along the Chang Jiang, and accelerating the development of Hefei and Huangshan Cities. The implementation of this strategy has stimulated economic development throughout the province. Last year, Anhui's economic growth rate broke all previous records. Its gross domestic product totaled 94 billion yuan, up 22 percent over 1992; its total industrial output value amounted to 140 billion yuan, including 10 billion yuan from the output value of town and village enterprises. All sectors of the rural economy developed, with total agricultural output value amounting to 41.7 billion yuan, an increase of 8.5 percent, ranking fifth in the country in terms of growth. Exports in 1993 totaled $960 million yuan, up 16 percent. Last year Anhui approved 1,040 foreign-funded enterprises, with a contract volume exceeding $700 million, which is the sum total of foreign investment in the past nine years. Household appliances and other processing industries, which used to be Anhui's weak points, have gradually become its strong points. The governor, who graduated from Qinghua University in the 1950's, understood very well how these achievements were made in 1993: "We cannot say that our current economic strength is very great. There is a wide gap if we compare our economy with that of other developed provinces. We must not lower our vigilance. We must continue to work hard." Fu Xishou said: To enable Anhui's economy to develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy way, it is necessary to carry out the following two tasks. First, it is necessary to accelerate the construction of basic industries and infrastructural facilities, both of which will become Anhui's advantages. Second, town and village enterprises and state-owned enterprises should do a good job in importing technologies and carrying out technical transformation. Infrastructural facilities and basic industries are the mainstays supporting Anhui's economic development, and importation of technologies and technical transformation are like "wings" that can stimulate Anhui's economic development. Fu Xishou said: This year is a crucial year in building a socialist market economic structure. Anhui must accomplish the following tasks: First, accelerating the development of a market economy in rural areas and striving to increase farmers' income; second, maintaining healthy and rapid industrial growth, while focusing on structural readjustment and efficiency; third, accelerating changing the operating mechanisms of state-owned enterprises and finding an effective way of establishing modern enterprises; and fourth, opening up to the outside world in all directions and domains and developing an open economy.
