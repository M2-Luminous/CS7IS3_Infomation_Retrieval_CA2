II. Description of Proposals The Exchanges have submitted substantively identical proposals to the Commission to amend their respective rules 13 to establish generic listing standards for options on narrow-based indexes (also known as sector or industry indexes) and procedures designed to expedite the approval of trading of such products. Currently, an Exchange must submit a proposed rule change to the Commission for review in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Act (``section 19(b)(2)''), and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, in order to list for trading options on a particular index. The Exchanges' proposed rule changes would permit an Exchange to list classes of options on a particular narrow-based index 14 that satisfy specified generic listing standards, pursuant to a filing submitted to the Commission for effectiveness immediately upon filing under section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act (``section 19(b)(3)(A)''). 15 Under the streamlined procedures, trading in options on the narrow-based index could commence 30 days from the date of filing of the proposal to list such options. 13 Amex Rule 901C; CBOE Rule 24.2; NYSE Rule 715; PSE Rule 7.3; and Phlx Rule 1009A. 14 This order approves generic listing standards and streamlined procedures for approval with respect to options on narrow-based indexes only. The proposed rule changes approved herein do not pertain to the listing of options on broad-based indexes. 15 In the event that proposed narrow-based index options do not qualify for expedited approval under these new standards, the Exchanges will not be foreclosed from filing a proposed rule change for Commission review pursuant to section 19(b)(2). A. Listing and Maintenance Listing Standards In order to qualify for the streamlined listing procedures, the particular narrow-based index underlying the proposed narrow-based index options must satisfy all of the following initial listing standards, and continue to satisfy the following maintenance listing criteria. 16 16 These standards were established in a coordinated effort with representatives of the Exchanges, and are consistent with many of the criteria that are currently utilized by the Commission in its review of options on narrow-based stock indexes.
