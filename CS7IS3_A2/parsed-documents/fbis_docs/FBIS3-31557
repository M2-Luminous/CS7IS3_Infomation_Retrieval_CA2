What is your opinion about these measures? [Karadzic] I fully understand the Greek Government and its sensitivity toward the name and symbols of Macedonia. I think that Skopje should return to Yugoslavia to prevent the dissolution of this country because Albanians would like to take the whole of Macedonia or to take the eastern part of Macedonia. Then there would be another Balkan war. Greece is right to be very cautious about what is happening in the neighborhood of Greece. We do hope that we will be always neighbors and maybe some time even be a confederation. [Correspondent] Really? [Karadzic] I would like to see this. [Correspondent] Is there any message for the Greek people? [Karadzic] Yes, thanks to the whole Greek nation, two governments, two oppositions, to the church for what they have done for the Serb people. We will never forget this. I do think that a good foundation for the Balkans is for Greece and Serbia to have good relations and I see now Bulgaria is also sympathizing with the Serbs and this is a good contact for peace. [Correspondent] And one last question, Mr. President. Actually, the ultimatum expires in some hours. What will actually happen if there is a bombardment? How are you going to react? Your troops against the blue helmets? [Karadzic] If we are attacked by anyone, no matter who it may be, we will defend ourselves. It is the legitimate right of the people to defend themselves. [Correspondent] Thank you.
