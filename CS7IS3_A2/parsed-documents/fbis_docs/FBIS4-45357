He was sentenced to the maximum term of 40 years in prison by the fourth district judge of criminal proceedings of the National Supreme Court, assigned to Guadalajara, Jalisco. In his decision, the administrator of justice in the federal jurisdiction found Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo to have acted with the aggravating circumstances of premeditation and advantage in the kidnapping and murder of the DEA agent, Camarena Salazar, and the Mexican aviator-pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar. At the conclusion of the criminal proceedings lasting nine years, the federal judge also found the implicated subject, considered the "czar of cocaine in Mexico" and the "drug traffic `capo' in Mexico" before his arrest in April 1989, guilty of crimes against health. The latter were in the forms of clandestine entry, illegal export, collection, purchase and sale, and storage of large amounts of cocaine. Hence, he decided to impose the maximum penalty stipulated in the Federal Code of Criminal Procedures at the time that the federal social representative brought penal action against him. Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo was informed of the sentence associated with proceedings 82/85 inside the Federal Maximum Security Center where he has been confined since 1992. He was transferred there from the Southern Crime Prevention Prison, where he had been held since 1989, following his arrest at a residence in the Chapalita subdivision of Guadalajara, Jalisco. The notification procedure was carried out based on letters requisitorial from the Jalisco federal judge sent to his counterpart in Mexico State, so that the hearing might be established and held in the federal maximum security prison. [passage omitted] If the sentence should be appealed, the trial against the implicated subject will be continued in the pertinent court with several judges, and the magistrates who are members of that body will be the ones to issue the pertinent decision, with which both parties may also express dissent.
