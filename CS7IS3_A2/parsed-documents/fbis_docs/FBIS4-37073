The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) spokesman in the northern Jaffna peninsula, said the group was willing to open political dialogue with the President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga's government without pre-conditions. Quoted by a BBC correspondent who travelled to the isolated area, LTTE idealogue Anton Balasingam said the group no longer insisted on a ceasefire and the lifting of an economic embargo on their Jaffna stronghold as a prerequisite to opening talks. Balasingam called for a political initiative from the Colombo government, but at the same time accused it of preparing for war in the north of the country, where the Tigers run a parallel administration. In February last year, the LTTE offered to compromise on its main demand for a seperate state called Eelam, and said it was willing to accept a federal constitution that would give minority Tamils greater autonomy. However, the government remained skeptical and described the LTTE overtures as a ploy to head off a military onslaught against the rebels who have waged a protracted guerrilla campaign since 1972. Government security forces in the LTTE-dominated north are confined to a handful of heavily defended military camps while the administration is carried out through civil servants of the minority Tamil community. Fourteen months of direct talks between the LTTE and Colombo collapsed in June 1990, leading to a revenewed round of bloodletting that continues to add to the daily death toll in the island's northern and eastern regions. The government for its part has insisted LTTE supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran must be directly involved in any future negotiations and that the Tigers must declare their "intent" to lay down arms and recognise other Tamil groups.
