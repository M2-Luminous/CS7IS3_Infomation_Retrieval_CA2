FBIS4-66552 "jpnea020___94060" JPRS-NEA-94-020 JPRS Near East & South Asia 30 March 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Janata Dal Still Fracturing, Mulayam Singh Gaining Janata Dal Still Fracturing, Mulayam Singh Gaining 94AS0245D New Delhi JANSATTA in Hindi 30 Mar 94 p 4 94AS0245D New Delhi JANSATTA Hindi CSO [Editorial: "Fracturing Janata Dal"] [Text] It is natural for the Janata Dal leaders to be upset and angry at the way Mulayam Singh has moved 10 Janata Dal legislators who supported his government into his party. This anger is reflected in the resolution sent by the U.P. [Uttar Pradesh] unit of the Janata Dal to the party's national president Bommai. It asked permission for the state unit of the party to take back the endorsement it had given to the Mulayam Singh government. However, a decision on this resolution is not expected soon because of the uncertainties and problems within the Janta Dal. One reason is that the disintegration of the Janta Dal has just begun, and even the party leaders do now know how many legislators will be left within the party in the end. They expressed fear that some of the remaining 17 Janata Dal legislator might join Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party. Another half dozen legislators are expected to follow Ajit Singh into the Congress Party. They were waiting until now because the one-third number required to avoid breaking the party-deserting law was not available. Now, in the shrunken Janata Dal, their number will be about one-third of the party. The other obstruction Janata Dal leaders' making a final decision about Mulayam Singh Yadav government is that even V.P. Singh himself is said to be in support of making Mulayam Singh stronger. Some other members believe that the 10 legislators who deserted the Janta Dal had his blessings. The disintegration of the Janata Dal is believed to be a foregone conclusion. The legislators who have joined Mulayam Singh were believed to be ready to go there from the very beginning. It was Mulayam Singh who was waiting for the right time for this division to occur. One reason for this wait was he did not want to help the legislators who were waiting to form one-third [of legislators] so they could jump to the Congress party. However, seeing the attitude of the Bahujan Samaj Party and then of the Congress Party recently, he felt that his government was in a precarious situation and he could be forced to have new elections any time. Mulayam Singh, on getting this feeling, started to strengthen his position among the Samajwadis, Yadavs, and Muslims. To this end, the first division was created in the Communist Party of India followed by the division in the Janata Dal. The leaders frustrated with Mulayam Singh's strategy have accused him of trying to steal some Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress Party legislators also. However, this is neither possible nor practical. First, because it will not be possible for him to convince one-third of the legislators to defect. Second, Mulayam Singh's government cannot survive even one day by making either the Bahujan Samaj Party or the Congress Party angry.
