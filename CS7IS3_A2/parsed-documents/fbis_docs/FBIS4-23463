The former senators have fallen victim to the determination of the Nigerian military regime, which has stepped up arrests to crush the opposition. Former Senate President Ameh Ebute and former Senator Polycarp Nwite were charged today by the Federal High Court of Lagos. The presiding judge, Babatunde Belgore, refused bail with surety when requested by defense lawyers. He ordered them to be kept in detention until 22 June, when their trial will begin. It also was learned today that, apart from the arrests that have already been reported -- four former senators and a former civilian governor -- Nigerian security forces are actively looking for other former national politicians. All political organizations and institutions were officially dissolved when General Sani Abacha took over power last November. Former Senator Bola Tinubu told AFP by telephone that the police came to his house several times and left a message for him to report to police headquarters as soon as possible. Since this call from his hiding place, all efforts to contact Bola Tinubu have been futile, and observers believe that it is quite probable that he has also been arrested. According to information received from several sources by AFP, four members of the opposition -- Anthony Enahoro (former minister of information under General Gowon's administration - 1966-1975), Michael Ajasin, Bola Ige, and John Oyegun, all three former civilian governors -- have been visited by police within the past 24 hours. Their fate was still not known this evening. Mr. A.A. Oriola, one of the defense lawyers for Messrs. Ebute and Nwite, told AFP that the main charge against the two accused was "conspiring to cause the overthrow of the head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, from power." On 1 June, the senators, in a communique signed by their president, declared the military government "illegal," and called for the formation of a government of national unity, led by Mashood Abiola. The two senators are the first to appear before a court since the beginning of the spate of arrests made by the Nigerian security forces within the ranks of the opposition. Far from being intimidated by these arrests, the opposition, under the banner of the National Democratic Coalition, plans to go to Moshood Abiola's residence in Lagos and ask him to form his government, a member of the dissolved House of Representatives, who asked not to be named, told AFP today. The Muslim billionaire, who is said to have won the 12 June 1993 presidential elections, canceled by the Army, stated recently that he would form his government of national unity as soon as an assembly representing, according to him, the aspirations of the sovereign people, asks him to do so.
