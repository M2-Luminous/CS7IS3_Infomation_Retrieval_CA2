What has had most effect here is the voluntary resignation of Yegor Gaydar, who has personified the policy of tough financial stabilization. In this situation banks and other money market players have started actively buying up currency, simultaneously stretching the deadlines for the compulsory sale of 50 percent of their currency earnings in the hope of making a huge amount of money from an increase in the dollar rate. There is information that considerable resources are now also being transferred from the short-term state bond market to the currency market. It is important to note another aspect. Since the beginning of the year nine auctions have already taken place at the Moscow exchange, at which over $1 billion has been sold. Around 1.5 trillion rubles was needed in order to pay for it. The latter figure throws doubt on the argument of advocates of state support for enterprises that the Russian economy needs additional injections of credit. As we can see, enterprises and banks do have money. How these resources are utilized is another question. I think the current situation in the currency market is giving monetarists some points in their long-standing dispute with supporters of state regulation. This situation unambiguously says that money will not be channeled into a structural reorganization of industry until it becomes possible to achieve financial stabilization,. At any rate, it is not clear how those who are fighting for additional injections of credit and those who are now acquiring decisive influence in the Russian Government can respond. It would be a great pity if they bank on tight control over the exchange rate and on abandoning market mechanisms of regulating the currency market. This would be not just a step back but effectively the abandonment of reforms.
