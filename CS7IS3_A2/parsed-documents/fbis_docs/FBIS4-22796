Polavskiy, program director: "The T-407 Skvorets Light Transport Plane"] [Text] An analysis of the demands of potential customers shows that there is a need for a light-transport plane, capable of taking on board up to 600 kg of payload and conveying it for a distance of up to 600 km, and operating at airports with a runway of up to 600 m. This concept is known as the "600X600X600." The basic version of the plane should have the possibility of being re-equipped in the following variants: - Ambulance and emergency-rescue; - Forest patrol, with the potential for air-dropping fire-fighter-parachutists; - Patrol, to monitor electric power lines and oil and gas pipelines, as well as to serve the state motor vehicle inspectorate; - Performing hydrometeorological and ecological survey; - Aerial photography; - An air taxi to perform official transport; - Instruction and training. In 1990, GosNIIGA [State Civil Aviation Scientific Research Institute] was given the technical assignment of working out this type of light, multi-purpose airplane on a competitive basis, with the participation of A.V. Medvedev, the institute's chief specialist. Because of the lack of financing and numerous organizational problems, however, the competition was not held. One of the most important criteria for determining the size, and to a considerable extent, the design of the plane was the type and amount of payload. In our case, the payload of 600 kg may lie in quite a broad products list -- from fuel drums and computer boxes to six people with luggage. The measurements of the cargo-passenger compartment should be determined on this precise basis. For convenience of loading and unloading there must be a large cargo door. This requirement makes it preferable for the transport plane to have the wing placed high, which ensures transport vehicles convenient approach and access to the cargo door. Having a strutted wing reduces the weight and simplifies the structural scheme of the plane as a whole. The aerodynamic loss (the struts) will be fully justifiable in the given range of speeds -- up to 250 km/hr. It is also quite important for the high-wing monoplane to have good stability characteristics at large angles of incidence. This simplifies the technique of piloting the plane at low speeds and makes it accessible to fliers with average qualifications. The design adopted for the high-wing monoplane successfully complies with the task of using the patrol version of the plane, where a good range of vision of the lower hemisphere is needed, and also for dropping parachutists. Since the payload is a given value in designing the plane, the choice of power unit variants is as a rule quite limited. Since the plane that we are talking about was needed, as they say, "yesterday," it would be extremely imprudent to incorporate in its design any promising, but not yet series-produced engine or propeller. Orientation toward engines and propellers produced in the West entails "cutting off" a considerable number of the plane's potential buyers within the country, in view of the impossibility of their paying part of its cost in currency. There is only one series-produced aircraft piston engine acceptable for us in the country today. This is the 360-hp M-14P engine. True, calculations show that to obtain the required combination of take-off and landing features and a flight cruising speed of at least 250 km/hr, a more powerful engine is needed. The M-14P has substantial merits, though. In the first place, its weight is quite low in relation to its power. In the second place, it is reliable, which was proven by its long operation in the Yak and Su sports planes. The 435 hp M-14NTK engine is a further development of the M-14P. The only series-produced propeller for the M-14P engine produced in our country is the V530TA-D35 two-blade variable-pitch tractive propeller. As for a choice between landing gear systems with nose and tail support, then given the planned operation of the plane on the basis of the airports of local airlines and the landing strips of the former DOSAAF [All-Union Voluntary Society for Assistance to the Army, Air Force and Navy of the USSR], it is very tempting to settle on the system with nose support, which gives well-known operating advantages: convenience in loading and unloading, a good range of vision when taxiing and less likelihood of a nose-over during a rough landing. To perform the tasks involved in landing on an unprepared area, however, a plane of the basic design with tail support may be suggested. The conditions for operating the plane must also be taken into consideration when selecting the type of shock absorbers. Since it will not just be operated at concreted airports, the need arises for shock absorbers which will absorb the considerable energy of the shock when hitting uneven dirt areas during take-off and landing. Landing gear with traditional liquid-gas shock absorbers have this ability. Springs may also be used, but only in combination with a reverse liquid damper. Since we are talking about a plane that is simple, quite reasonable in price, undemanding and reliable in operation, the question of retractable or fixed landing gear is clearly answered in favor of the "fixed type." On the other hand, retractable landing gear, in addition to complicating the structure, entails a number of operational inconveniences, stemming, for example, from the fact that the recesses for the landing gear get choked with dirt or snow when the machine is operated from dirt landing strips. All this speaks in favor of using the simple fixed landing gear on airplanes of this class. The low cost of the plane is also achieved only by using simple structural designs and already developed materials and technology. The high level of technological feasibility and manufacturing simplicity incorporated into the design makes it possible to develop series production of the plane in the shortest time possible. This may prove to be the decisive factor under the present-day conditions of economic instability. The structure, which has a welded truss made of pipes and sheathed with non-supporting panels as the air frame of the fuselage, may provide great advantages in this plan. As practical experience shows, the technological equipment for assembly of the truss fuselage is considerably simpler than the equipment needed to assemble a fuselage with a "semi-monocoque" type of structure, the most common in aviation today, the assembly of which is carried out with the basic parts of the frame following an exterior theoretical contour. In the case of a truss structure, the basic load-bearing element -- the truss -- may have a simple geometric shape. Moreover, there is no need to maintain small tolerances on the outside of the fuselage contours. The latter are formed by the non-load-bearing panels, which considerably simplifies their manufacture. Precision in adhering to the outlines is ensured by compensators, when the panels are installed on the truss. It is not possible to use thinner sheathing and supporting elements of the non-load-bearing panels than is dictated by technological considerations. In this case, of course, we have a certain weight disadvantage as compared with the traditional structure. This is a sacrifice which must be borne for the sake of production feasibility and repairability during operation. Unfortunately, as experience in working with truss structures in domestic aircraft building has shown, very careful selection of material is required. The heat treatment necessary after a structure made of 30KhGSA steel is welded often leads to its deformation. VNS-2 steel retains its strength characteristics in the area of the weld, and without subsequent heat processing, but is a quite expensive and scarce material. The overwhelming majority of light planes of similar structure, built in the West, use as truss material steel analogous in its characteristics to our 20 steel. This is what is advisable for use in the truss structures. The sheathing panels of the fuselage can be made of aluminum alloy, fiberglass-reinforced plastic or dacron. To simplify the technology, they can be made flat or with a slight single curvature. Based on the above-discussed considerations, the Aeroprogress enterprise is developing the light-weight multi-purpose T-407 airplane. It is a strutted, high-wing monoplane with a normal aerodynamic design, a single-piston engine and a tractive propeller. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Basic Flight-Engineering Data | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Engine: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |--number |1 |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |--type |M-14P |M-14NTK | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |--horse power |360 |435 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Crew/passengers, persons |1/6 |1/6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Take-off weight, kg |2,080 |2,080 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fuel reserve, kg |300 |300 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Payload, kg |600 |600 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Flight speed, km/hr |220 |260 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Flight altitude range, m |0-4,000 |0-4,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Flight range, km | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |--with maximum payload |600 |500 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |--with maximum fuel rese-|1,600 |1,200 | |rve | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Take-off distance (up to |400 |300 | |N=15 m), m | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Landing distance (up to |550 |550 | |N=15 m), m | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Overall dimensions of co-|4.3 x 1.34 x 1.3 | |ckpit-cabin: length x wi-| | |dth x height, m | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE WING AND TAIL ASSEMBLY have a traditional structure made of aluminum alloy. Single-slot swivel flaps are placed along the rear edge of the wing. THE FUSELAGE is a truss structure. The truss material is 20 steel. The panels of the sheathing are made of aluminum alloy. THE LANDING GEAR is non-retractable, triple support, with a free-oriented nose wheel. The shock absorbers are main and front strut --liquid-gas. The wheels of the main struts, the braking wheels, with 500X150 mm tubeless tires, can be equipped with an automatic anti-skid system, if the buyer wishes. The wheel of the front strut has a 400X150 mm tubeless tire. THE POWER UNIT. A series-produced M-14P 360 hp air-cooled piston engine with a V530TA-D35 double-bladed variable pitch tractive propeller is installed on the plane. The fuel tanks, with a total capacity of 380 l, are located in the rear parts of the wing brackets. THE CABIN AND CARGO-PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. In the basic version of the plane, only the pilot's seat at the left is equipped with controls. The possibility of equipping the instructor's seat at the right with controls is provided for in the training variant. The cargo-passenger compartment is designed to accommodate cargo with a total weight of 600 kg or seats for six passengers. Its floor is designed for a unit load of 400 kgs/m[.sup]2[/]. The floor and side of the compartment are equipped with hitches to moor the cargo and with installation points for the passenger seats. The measurements of the door of the cargo-passenger compartment, located on the left side, are 1.2 x 1.2 m. The pilot's cockpit is entered through doors at the right and left side. There is a footboard in the area of each door which is let down at the same time the doors open and retracted when it is closed. There is passage between the crew seats to the cargo-passenger compartment. An emergency exit is located along its right side. AIRPLANE SYSTEMS. The electric power supply system is 27 V, direct current. The electric power sources on the plane are a 3kWt generator and a 25 Amp-hour-capacity storage battery. The air system provides the engine startup and basic (differential) and emergency wheel braking, as well as retraction and lowering of the flaps. The fire-fighting system consists of a fire-signal system in the engine compartment and a fire-extinguishing system. The pilots' cockpit and the cargo-passenger compartment are equipped with a ventilation and heating system. Onboard Equipment The plane's piloting-navigation and radio-communication equipment provide manual plane piloting along the air routes of local airlines, in the second daytime category, at any time of year, in accordance with the rules of visual flight over dry land if no thunder activity is expected, piloting in accordance with homing radio beacons, manual approach for landing at airports not equipped for landing by radio-engineering systems, and also approach according to homing radio beacons. If the buyer demands it, the plane may be equipped with a meteorological locator and an autopilot. The plane's radio equipment consists of two USW-range radio stations, ensuring two-way voice communication with air-traffic control services on the ground and other airplanes. In addition, an air-traffic control transponder and onboard registration device are installed on the vehicle. The make-up of all the airplane systems and onboard equipment was organized solely on the basis of units and instruments found in series production. The basic features of the new aircraft are: - Reliability and good repairability; - Simplicity of technological and structural designs; - Use, in the structure, of reasonably priced materials and domestic units and systems in series production; - Ease of piloting and technical service; - The possibility of operation on the existing network of local airline airports; - Convenience of loading and unloading; - Low cost. In the development, the task was posed of creating a simple, inexpensive airplane, meeting the demands of potential buyers, which could be produced both at large aircraft enterprises and at small aviation plants. At the buyer's demand, a T10-540-AE2A Lycoming engine and set of Bendix King equipment can be installed on the plane. The State of Development - Manufacturing plan ready; - All experimental and research work completed; - A full-scale mock-up has been built, and the placement of the units and systems on it has been worked out, as well as the routes and communications (the mock-up was exhibited at the International Air-Space Show, Room 93); - Manufacture of experimental models of the airplane is in progress; - Contracts have been concluded with Peru and New Zealand for joint manufacture of series-produced airplanes.
