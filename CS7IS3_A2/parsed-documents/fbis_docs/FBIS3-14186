It is known that Ambassador Egan was the real dynamo in the U.S. Embassy in Cairo during a critical and crucial period of time. Robert Pelletreau, a Palestinian affairs expert, was ambassador at the time and Egan was deputy chief of mission. In this context, it was not a surprise to see Carl Brown, a renowned U.S. historian and Middle East expert, come to Amman to give lectures--four in one day--through which he tried to convince our citizens that the Americans, including Schwarzkopf and Bush, are the new angels, and that the Arabs, including Saddam and Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman, should heed their message. Twisting historical facts, the Harvard University professor denied that American culture is affected by the roots of Jewish thought, which believes in millenarianism, an ideology which requires that the promised land be purged of Arabs and their holy places on Temple Mount be removed! Professor Carl Brown also attempted to undermine the main theme in Dr. Edward Said's writings, in which Said explains that the seeds of anti-Arab Talmudic ideology are implanted in the U.S. mentality and control its rhythm during times of political emergencies. Dr. Said also explains that the contemporary U.S. political course is a disguised, cunning extension of the historical Western onslaught against the Muslim East, an onslaught that began with the crusades centuries ago, before being developed into a European military, political, and demographic hegemony in the past two centuries. In addition to the four "missionary" lectures, yesterday's lecture by Richard Armitage, a former deputy U.S. defense secretary, tried to convince us as Arabs that we needed the massacre of worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque to resume the Washington negotiations. I have to wonder in astonishment: Didn't the Washington negotiations attain their highest impetus several days before the massacre? Has the blood of the Hebron martyrs been forgotten so soon after 25 February 1994? What is the political price that the enemy has paid? Didn't UN Security Council Resolution 904 constitute a political and moral gain for Israel when [Washington] failed to recognize East Jerusalem as an occupied Palestinian territory, something which would later lead to considering it an indivisible part of the unified capital of Israel? Our political stupidity has led us to a weaker political position after the massacre than before it. Hasn't there been a change in the view on the Israeli settlements on Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim territory? The settlements, which were once viewed as "illegitimate," then as "an obstacle to peace," are now viewed as "part of the status quo." Furthermore, in a show of extreme political humiliation, the Arabs only demanded that the settlers be prevented from carrying weapons inside Arab cities. This is a humiliating image of submission which reminds us of the story of one of Timur Lenk's soldiers who stopped some Damascus residents in an alley and ordered them not to move until he comes back with his sword, which he forgot to carry on that particular day. To his surprise, when the soldier came back with his sword, he found them in the same place, humbly and submissively awaiting him. He killed them. I believe that the U.S. propaganda campaign in Jordan that seeks to brainwash us into forgetting that millenarianism, includes the seeds of racist rancor against Muslim Arabs in general and against the Palestinians in particular. In terms of haughtiness, it is a Nazi thought. It is an idea Oliver North believed in, Jimmy Carter, the priest president, preached, and some U.S. policy planners embrace. It is the same thought that despises the Muslim Arabs for "desecrating" Temple Mount. Some of the preachers of messianism believe in the need to expedite the return of the "savior" to forgive their sins and to allow them into his Kingdom. According to some of their scriptures, this will not happen before the chosen people are reinstated over the entire promised land. Here we say: The United States is the incubator of the criminal ideology targeting the sons of Palestine. The training camps of the Jewish Defense League in New York, Tallahassee, Nevada, and Oregon have supplied Kahana [movement] with all the money and men that it needed in the past. These are the same camps that transferred $3 million to Marzel, chief of the Kahana Hay movement. Barukh [Goldstein] was the first of the group's members to move to Hebron, and he will be followed by a second, third, and twentieth Barukh in the al-Aqsa Mosque, the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, and the Dome of the Rock. I had hoped that U.S. Ambassador Wesley Egan, who is a seasoned veteran and experienced man, would have started his mission in Jordan by communicating to us a decision by the U.S. Administration to prevent the Defense League and Kahana Hay organizations from setting up their terrorist camps in the United States and to ban encouraging raising funds for those organizations through tax exemptions. I had hoped that I would have seen a good gesture of lifting the siege of the port of al-'Aqabah by the U.S. warships, a siege that is aimed against Jordan rather than Iraq, as evidenced by the fact that Turkey is allowed to carry out all forms of commercial transactions with Iraq, as has been stated by Turkish Prime Minister Ciller. The sons of this homeland, both Palestinians and Jordanians, are clever. The recent brainwashing attempts will be useless on them. The blood of our martyrs in Palestine, Hebron, al-Karamah [a Jordan Valley area in which a battle between Jordanian and Israeli troops took place in 1968], Gaza, the al-Ruwayshid Highway, and Jerusalem has been turned into a vaccine which will immunize us against the arguments of Armitage and Carl Brown and the implicit and explicit techniques of psychological warfare. When 'Ala' Hijazi and 'Imad 'Aql [Hamas activists] were martyred, both of them became targets of an intensive U.S. television campaign that sought to obliterate our genuine character through professional messages addressed to the subconscious. However, the martyrs vaccine eventually prevailed, because Almighty God blessed this homeland when He said: The al-Aqsa Mosque "whose precincts we did bless." [part of Koranic verse]
