The solution is to help them at home, according to Justice Minister Erling Olsen (Social Democrat). Justice Minister Olsen fears intense pressure on the Danish borders as a result of emigration from the former Soviet Union. "It is the nightmare of the entire western world," he said against the background of the statements made by the Russian refugee authorities that BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's Moscow correspondent talked to. They estimate that 6-8 million refugees from the former Soviet republics will inundate Russia in the next couple of years. At present the Russians cannot accommodate the many refugees who will put increasing pressure on the Scandinavian borders. "The pressure could be enormous. It will require very stringent border control and it could be very unpleasant," Olsen said. Foretaste "A real migration could be a threat to the entire western world. Television tells them about our living conditions. The boat people who drifted ashore near Koge gave us a small foretaste of what lies ahead. It is an enormous problem that we have been warned about for some time. ``And the solution is not to build a fortress around all of Europe but to give them so much assistance that they would rather stay at home. This will require economic sacrifices on our part,'' said Justice Minister Olsen. The Russian refugee authorities are urging the Scandinavian countries and Germany to devote all their energy to a cooperation with Russia that will stem the tide. Olsen admitted that there are no concrete proposals for warding off the pressure, but referred among other things to the Nordic Council, which will take the matter up next month.
