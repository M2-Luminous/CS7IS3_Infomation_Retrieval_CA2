FBIS4-52285 "dreas089__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-089-A Daily Report 2 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Technology Cooperation Accord Reached With U.S. Technology Cooperation Accord Reached With U.S. OW0905014994 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 2 May 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0905014994 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Japan and the United States have consolidated the contents of an agreement on "cooperation regarding development of private-sector industrial technologies." The possibility of promoting cooperation was studied at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The details of this agreement indicate that the Japanese and U.S. Governments will select 10 topics such as development of materials for producing semiconductors and development of carbon fibers, and start joint research this fall. The governments of both countries will sign the agreement in early June. They will promote cooperation mainly in the area of utilizing military technologies to produce civilian goods by combining U.S. military technologies with Japanese technologies for production of nonmilitary goods. Both governments will ask private industry in their own countries to take part in the cooperation. It is expected that Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade and industry, and Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown--who will attend the East and West economic officials' meeting scheduled to be held in Warsaw, Poland, from 6 May--will agree on an outline of the cooperation. At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks held in Washington, Japan and the United States disagreed over the issue of objective criteria, including numerical targets, and failed to reach an agreement in three areas; government procurement, insurance services, and automobiles and auto parts. However, both countries agreed to promote "cooperation from the viewpoint of global prospects," such as population and environmental issues. As one field of "cooperation between the two countries in the area of ultramodern technology," both countries, as stated in the Washington agreement, were scheduled to have detailed discussions to finalize contents of cooperation in private-sector industrial technology. Four proposals of the 10-point plan will be implemented first. They are applications of nitride aluminum, which is used for tank armor plating and other purposes; applications of carbon fiber composite material, which is used to produce structural materials for space shuttles and aircraft, and for production of nonmilitary goods; application of environmental technologies for treatment of factory waste fluids and noise prevention; and structural analysis of proteins. In addition to these four proposals, other projects to promote technological cooperation have also been mentioned. Among them are plans to develop a factory automation (FA) system by using the target-tracking device on missiles with machine tools to achieve highly sophisticated factory automation, and to develop an LCD device to be used for high-definition televisions. Both countries will improve development efficiencies by combining U.S. military technologies and Japanese application technologies. Ultimately, they plan to promote joint development for all proposals in the 10-point development plan. The U.S. Government intends to send a joint study group composed of both government officials and private-sector personnel to Japan in June, and hopes that a final agreement can be reached on cooperation in research work. Following the investigation team's trip to Japan, Japan and the United States will establish a joint project team composed of members of state research institutes, and start research as early as this fall on each proposal. Through the New Energy Development Organization (NEDO), which is a corporation having a special status, the Japanese Government will ask private corporations to join the plan.
