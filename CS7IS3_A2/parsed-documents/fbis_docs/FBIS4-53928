The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) recently asked sausage manufacturers to submit details of their damages resulting from Korea's massive disposal of American sausages, the official said. USTR also requested the producers to state their complaints and recommendations following Korea's shortening of shelf life to 30 days from former 90 days. The American Sausage Producers Association had advised Washington to designate Korea as a priority foreign country in accordance with the Super 301 trade act for Seoul's cutting shelf life of American products and then disposing of them on the grounds that they are hazardous to public health. "I think USTR began to investigate into the problem in order to present documental proof that Korea's action was unfair in future trade talks," the official said.
