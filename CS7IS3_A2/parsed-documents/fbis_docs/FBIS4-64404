The Community executive will approve tomorrow (Wednesday) its Annual Economic Report, which as usual includes short- and medium-term economic and social forecasts for all member states, including Spain. The document, prepared by the staff of commissioner for economic and financial affairs Henning Christophersen, takes a positive view of measures taken to reform the Spanish labor market but believes they will need more time to bear fruit. Initially, it expects business and industry to take advantage of labor's greater flexibility to complete workforce downsizing, and this will add to the state's financial burden by putting more people on the unemployment rolls. "In the short term, it may exacerbate unemployment, adding to the cost of social services. However, in the medium term, there is hope for improved competitiveness, higher levels of investment, and creation of new jobs," says the five-page chapter devoted to Spain, to which DIARIO 16 obtained access. In its review of the Spanish economy, it described as "optimistic" the government's avowed goal of keeping the fiscal deficit at 6.4 percent of Gross Domestic Product [GDP], "unless there is significant economic recovery." Economic experts in Brussels say one of the biggest problems is resistance to the need to cut social spending. However painful it may be, says the report, "the deficit demands a reevaluation of social spending in light of the country's financial capacity, and more selective access to welfare benefits." Also, the commission notes that decentralization is impeding the central government's efforts to directly influence the deficits run at regional and (most importantly) local levels, i.e., the municipalities. "It would be appropriate to improve coordination between the various levels of government," says the aforementioned report in its chapter on Spain. The Spanish economy's competitive position improved in 1993 with devaluation of the peseta (13 percent against the German mark), but it would have been even better if accompanied by greater restraint in wage increases. (The effects of devaluation) "were somewhat attenuated by the poor behavior of the labor market." Brussels experts fear that the recent amelioration of inflation, which stood at 4.6 percent last year, cannot continue. "It cannot be taken as certain that the progress in dampening inflation will continue in 1994. The impact of the peseta's devaluation on domestic prices, combined with a recovery in demand, may push prices up again. Prospects will continue to deteriorate without better wage restraint." The report opines, however, that Community economies overall have "succeeded in weathering the worst of the recession," even if "the most recent indicators offer scant evidence for a rapid recovery." For example, the commission report says that GDP in the EU will grow by 1.3 percent this year. Unemployment will rise by 0.5 percent to 11.5 percent of the work force. Average inflation will be 3.5 percent, versus 3.8 percent last year. The European Commission says growth in 1995 will be 2.1 percent and there will be a net increase in number of jobs (+0.2 percent).
