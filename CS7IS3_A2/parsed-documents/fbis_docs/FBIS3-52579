The analyst, Mr. Barzan al-Tikriti said in an article published by AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper today that such kind of peace could be achieved if bravery was available with those decision-making people to wrap up chapter of the past and start a new chapter through serious and realistic debate of affairs and realities despite their bitterness to reach a new and sound frame that clarifies the nature of relationship and obligations. The Iraqi analyst warned against the probabilities in case of non-availability of good intentions and the bravery for realizing a settlement of leading to dangerous developments that cause blood and destruction. Mr. al-Tikriti believes that inter-actions of 1994 will be governed by the quality of the relationship between two courses. First of them is the feeling of fatigue from the conflict and the second is an increased move toward regionalism especially in the Arab region as a result to previous events and mainly to the events in the Arab Peninsula and Gulf. The Iraqi analyst justified the Zionist-Palestinian self-rule agreement to the feeling of fatigue of the conflict parties and said that that feeling could be the reason behind the probability of achieving peace in Ireland and other hot-beds in the world. Mr. al-Tikriti further predicted an end to other conflicts in other parts of the word like Afghanistan. Former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Yemen in addition to the conclusion of peace agreements by concerned Arab countries with Israel. The analyst was of the view that all those issues would be liable for settlement because of the weight of pressure of fatigue from conflict unless a decisive factor could be introduced in those conflicts and differences and namely the motive of regionalism. Mr. al-Takriti ruled out the possibility that the Arab homeland could witness a real attempt for unification neither in general nor on the level of regional entities and that there are increased fears over the possibility of maintaining Iraq as integral entity. The analyst replied on such fears by saying that Iraq would remain unified for reasons including that what could be applied on Iraq is applied on countries of the region unless those countries would accept what the others decide for them or were not knowing what is going around them or within their borders. The Iraqi analyst further predicted an escalation to the extreme fundamentalist trend in the Arab region in the manner that threatens of changes in the Arab Peninsula and the Gulf states, Egypt and other Arab countries.
