In an interview given in Moscow after his talks with Russian officials, Karadzic pointed out that he had asked Andrey Kozyrev and his aides to tell the contact group that the Serbs had to have their part of Sarajevo. According to Karadzic, the central part of Sarajevo, except for Grbavica, will be given to the Muslims, and the republic of Srpska should get Dobrinja, Ilidza, Lukavica, Hrasnica, and Rajlovac (western districts of Sarajevo). "We will not give up the right bank of the Una river under any circumstances, and there can be no haggling over Sanski Most, our part of (Bosanska) Krupa, Novi Grad (former Bosanski Novi), and Prijedor (all Serb-held towns in western Bosnia), or over Podgrmecje and Potkozarje (areas in western Bosnia)," Karadzic said. Karadzic told the Russians to convey to the contact group that the Sava river would be the best and the only possible natural border in Posavina (Northern Bosnia). He said that the republic of Srpska is very interested in a 1- or 2-km widening (of the corridor) near Brcko and stressed the readiness to allow the Muslims to use part of the Brcko port, but any interruption of the republic of Srpska's territorial integrity is out of the question. Karadzic pointed out that Croatia is offered an honorable (Serb) proposal to get 250 square km in the Dubrovnik hinterland in exchange for 30-35 km of the coast, between a point north of Molunat and Prevlaka. Saying that very soon it will become clear whether or not the United States is trying to involve Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the war, Karadzic specified that United States' insistence on a peace plan and maps dividing Bosnia, which will be unacceptable for the Serbs, would be a clear indication of this.
