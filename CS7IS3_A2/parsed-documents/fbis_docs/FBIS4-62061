Following consultations with deputies' groups, Crimean Parliamentary Speaker Serhiy Tsekov proposed that the candidacies of Oleksiy Melnykov and Viktor Mezhak for the posts of Supreme Council deputy chairmen be voted on for the second time. As a result of the vote, Oleksiy Melnykov and Viktor Mezhak became Republic of Crimea Supreme Council deputy chairmen. Oleksiy Melnykov was born in Moscow and served in the Pacific Fleet and since 1986 in the Black Sea Fleet. He swore allegiance to the Armed Forces of the USSR and intends to swear no allegiance to anyone else. He was against Black Sea Fleet sailors taking an oath of allegiance to the people of Ukraine. In his words, there is no Black Sea Fleet problem as it was and is Russian. Viktor Mezhak was born in Crimea. His profession is building engineer. He was elected as deputy of the City of Simferopol and Crimean Oblast Councils of People's Deputies in 1990. He is an activist of the Republican Movement of Crimea. He assumed the leadership of the People's Party of Crimea in the fall of 1993. Both deputy speakers represent the Russia bloc, as does the speaker, Serhiy Tsekov. Fears of "the Crimean president getting a `puppet' parliament," expressed by Refat Chubarov, the leader of the [Crimean Tartar people's] Kurultay deputies' group, are, in the opinion of observers, proving true. Parliamentary deputies then went on to address the question of elections to permanent commissions. Voting resulted in the finalization of their number. [There will be] 11 of them. [They are the commissions for] credentials, deputies' ethics, and Supreme Council work organization; legislation, legality and order; state construction; economic policy, and budget and financial matters; agrarian matters and food supply; ecology and land matters; social matters and health protection; military matters; education, science, culture and youth matters; mass media and public relations; and deportees' matters. Tsekov said at the parliamentary sitting that it was possible the third Supreme Council deputy chairman would be elected in a while. It has become known from sources close to government circles that a Crimean Government delegation, to be led by Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov, on 12 May is to fly to Moscow in order to sign an agreement on economic cooperation between the Republic of Crimea and Russia.
