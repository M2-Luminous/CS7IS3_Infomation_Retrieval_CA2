Attila Kert reports on this morning's consultations among the Socialists. [Kert] The MSZP would like a coalition government even if -- on the basis of the results of the second round -- it gained an absolute majority in parliament, said Chairman of the Socialists Gyula Horn, who was today making his first public appearance since his accident. Horn stated before the MSZP parliamentary candidates: We do not want to bring into being a one-party government such as the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] conducted in the past four years. He stressed once again that the MSZP does not want any kind of calling to account or taking to task in connection with the past four years. In connection with the coalition speculations, Horn stated: After the elections, the prime minister will be provided by the party that has gained the most votes. In connection with this, Executive Deputy Chairman Imre Szekeres noted: At the coalition discussions the MSZP will wish to clarify four issues, and these are: the new government's most important concrete tasks; the shaping of the new governmental structure and style; the social contract to be concluded with employers and the employees; and finally, the shaping of the new relationship with the opposition. All personnel issues, stressed Szekeres, can only come up in terms of a reply to this question. If, however, the coalition discussions turn out to be unsuccessful, stated the MSZP's executive deputy chairman, the MSZP will even then undertake to form a government, because otherwise new elections would have to be called, which society, in his view, would accept only with great difficulty. At the press briefing after the debate, Horn said the new government's most important constitutional tasks were the clarification of the sphere of competence of the president of the Republic; the strengthening of the parliamentary control of government; and the enacting of the media law. Deputy Chairman Ferenc Baja described, as the most important characteristic of the new government's structure, the fact that it will be built not on personal relationships but on a coalition agreement, and its main task will be the realization of the four-year government program.
