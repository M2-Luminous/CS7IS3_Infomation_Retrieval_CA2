FR940810-2-00133 FR940810-2-00077 9. The prospectus of each Fund will include a statement to the effect that any person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Fund. 10. Any distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of a Fund to agree to conform to such standards. 11. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors of the Funds with respect to the Multiple Class Plan will be set forth in guidelines, which will be furnished to the directors. 12. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally, and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement of sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Fund's net asset value and public offering price will present each class of shares separately. 13. The initial determination of Class Expenses that will be applied to a class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of directors, including a majority of the independent directors. Any persons authorized to direct the application and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the board of directors, and the directors shall review at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. 14. Any class of shares with a conversion feature will convert into another class of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion. 15. If a Fund implements any amendment to a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a Shareholder Service Plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by the shares of a Target Class under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into the Target Class unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The directors shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class'') identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into the Target Class. If deemed advisable by the directors to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target Class. New Target Class or New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the directors reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 3, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class or New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the adviser and the distributor. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. 16. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemption requested by the application will not imply SEC approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to Rule 12b-1 Plans or Shareholder Service Plans in reliance on the exemptive order. 17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H.
