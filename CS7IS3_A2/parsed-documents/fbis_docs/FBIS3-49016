I am not an optimist when it comes to signing the agreement as envisaged by Lord Owen. Both the agreement and its draft will resolve nothing in Bosnia. In other words, it is merely an academic paper that neither tackles the essence nor raises the main issues facing this state. We would like to avoid the war option but we expect Serbia to launch a new attack. The regime in Serbia sees the continuation of the war as crucial for its survival. However, they are not as strong as they think they are. They have artillery, criminal units, but they have no popular army. On the opposite side they are facing an army of volunteers. As for the Croatian state, which has disintegrated on all fronts and which is trying to step up its aggression against a sovereign state, it is obvious that Tudjman's behavior is preparing the ground for sanctions against Croatia, Ganic stressed. In eastern Bosnia, we will not allow homes and the land belonging to Bosniak Muslims to be taken over by a single Serb family. My message to the Serbs is this: Do not go there, do not move into houses and land that belong to someone else. Something terrible will happen to you, today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, or in six months, it does not matter. Those whom you have expelled have nowhere to go. They are strangers in both Sarajevo and Vienna. The solution is to return these people to where they came from, Ganic said. The proposal for a union [in Bosnia-Herzegovina] will be difficult to implement, Ganic said. If we are to accept the proposal, at least 1 million people will have to be resettled. To resettle them we would need at least $2 million daily or about $700 million annually to relieve the misery of these people. The union proposal is not a serious one because it does not reflect reality. We are not in the process of setting up a Muslim state. We want to create a state of Bosnia with Croats, Serbs, and Bosniak Muslims living in it. I think that the idea of a Muslim state was planted on us and has, in the meantime, become transparent. Here the feeling of patriotism is much stronger than any other passion. I am in favor of Bosnia as a state of Bosniak Muslims, Serbs, and Croats but am not in favor of an artificial peace. I advocate the rule of law. It is realistic to expect a turnabout in Croatia's policy in Bosnia. Its policy will hit rock bottom unless Tudjman has reached an agreement to hand over the occupied territories in Croatia to Milosevic. This would signal an end to Croatia as a state, Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, said in his interview to VJESNIK and VECER.
