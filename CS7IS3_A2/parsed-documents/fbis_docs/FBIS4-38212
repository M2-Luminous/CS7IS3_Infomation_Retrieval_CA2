I hope that you are in a good health and are being successful. As you can see, we are now in Seya Sang Neqleya [near Kabul]. Not only the members of the armed forces' various units, but mojahedin of the various provinces also took part in this victorious operation. The mojahedin of Kapisa also took active part in this operation. I will interview one of the most famous commanders of this province -- commander Habib Afghan. May we draw your attention to this interview: Esteemed commander, would you please tell me about the role of your mojahedin in the recent victories? [Habib Afghan] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. We -- the mojahedin of Kapisa -- have been taking part in the operation since the beginning of the revolution but most actively since the coup launched by the Dostam and Golboddin. Recently we took part in the operation carried out in Seya Sang. Here we seized six tanks [word indistinct] rifles, and a large quantity of ammunition in these depots. We seized an enormous amount of ammunition in other depots for example: in Kasa Borj and Tapa-e Nader Khan we seized a countless amount of ammunition. All the enemy's supplies were seized by the mojahedin. [passage indistinct] The enemy have lost their morale and we should not put our guns down until their final defeat. We must work hard for the victory of our jihad. [Correspondent] Esteemed commander, please tell us where your forces are stationed, and how long will you continue your operation? [Habib Afghan] My own forces are stationed in the Seya Sang region. This region was under the control of Dostam/Golboddin forces. We are not going to put down our guns while Dostam is in this land and Golboddin does not repent from his evil actions. We are not going to make any more concessions. We have given many concessions in the past. They fought sometimes in the name of Islam and sometimes under the pretext of militia. In every name they have been fighting against Muslims. Look at these houses yourself? Who were living in these houses -- Muslims or non-Muslims? They have looted all these houses and set them on fire. We cannot put down our guns until we (?expose) all their evils. As long as our nation is on our side -- Almighty God is with us -- we are on the right side. They are not prepared to compromise; they are not prepared for peace; they are not prepared for Loya Jerga. [passage indistinct] They are foreign agents. I have captured three Pakistani men here -- in Seya Sang -- myself. They are now under arrest; if you want I will show them to you. If disputes are going on in our country, what are Pakistani men doing here? What are the Americans are doing here [as heard]? What are the Arabs doing here? We are Muslims and we are not infidels. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] As you can see, we are now in Tapa-e Naqleya Seya Sang. We want to interview a commander in this unit. Esteemed commander, please introduce yourself to the viewers of television and esteemed listeners of Radio Afghanistan. [Safiollah] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. My name is Safiollah, commander of Battalion 40, Bagram Division. [Correspondent] Please tell us about the duties you are going to accomplish after the operation? [Safiollah] On 25 June, we received an order from the Islamic State of Afghanistan and the Ministry of Defense. Our mojahedin captured localities from Jada-e Maywand [in Kabul] to Chaman and up to Tapa-e Maranjan. And now we are here; as you can see, we are stationed in Tapa-e Seya Sang. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] We are continuing our interview, as you can see we are now in Chaman. A number of our brethren of the first district are stationed in here. I am going to interview the esteemed commander of District 1 [as heard]. Esteemed commander, above all tell us something about the clearing up operation carried out by the army of the Islamic State of Afghanistan? [Unidentified commander] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate, [passage indistinct] the Islamic State attacked the area held by the Dostam-Golboddin militia. In stationing our forces in Chaman, our groups began to advance toward Seya Sang region. With the help of God these people were wiped out from Bala Hesar region and now we can safely advance toward Charasiab. [passage omitted] Our brethren of the Islamic State are planning to advance toward Charasiab. This place must be cleared of enemies so that the poor and persecuted people of Kabul can be relieved from the fighting and difficulties. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Dear listeners, as you know the army of the Islamic State of Afghanistan have been carrying out clearing up operations during the past two or three days in the direction of Tapa-e Maranjan, Bala Hesar, Pol-e Charkhi, and Arzan Qemat, and the units and companies of the Islamic State's Army achieved enormous gains. One of these units who took active part in this military operation and achieved enormous gain is Unit 622 or Regiment 622 of the national guard of the Islamic State of Afghanistan. We are now conducting an interview with esteemed Gol Hayder, the commander of Regiment 622 of the National Guard of the Islamic State of Afghanistan. May we draw your attention to this interview. Esteemed commander, please give us information regarding the recent mopping up operation, and could you also tell us about the duties of your regiment, their location, and what have their gains been? [Gol Hayder] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The enemy had a plan to attack our unit on 23 June at 0500 in the vicinity of Pol-e Mahmud Khan. We had advance information regarding this plan. Our units saw duty in various locations. The enemy intended to attack, but with the blessing of God, before they attacked we took the initiative. We attacked first Darwaza-ye Lahori and Dahan-e Jada. There the enemy could not resist even for one or two hours. The positions that they held for the last two years, we seized them the first day -- places like Darwaza-e Lahori and Dahan-e Jada. Over the hill, there were other units who captured Bala Hesar. The next morning at 0600 we attacked Ghazi Stadium. The enemy could not resist even for five minutes. After five minutes, we entered Kabul Theater. Then, jointly with our brethren from Ettehad-e Eslami [Islamic Union of Afghanistan], we quickly seized Tapa-ye Maranjan from the enemy who put the Kabul citizens in pain and difficulties for the last two years, but now with the help and blessing of God were defeated, and they could not resist in these regions even for two hours. We have taken these places from them. [Correspondent] How do you assess the enemy morale, in particular the militia morale in comparison to the early days of the fighting, when you launched a clearing up operation? [Gol Hayder] God is with us. Hekmatyar did not seek refuge from the God but he sought refuge from Dostam. As you know, a few days ago he gave a warning to the people in Kabul of his large scale fighting and his intention to capture Kabul. When we took action we found that he is nothing. He sought refuge to Dostam whereas he did not resist even for five minutes; his forces will be nothing to us -- with the help of God. [Correspondent] Have you any information from the Pol-e Charkhi direction? Are the units of the Islamic army advancing in this direction? [Gol Hayder] Earlier I was in Tapa-ye Maranjan; the area of Dehkhodaydad and the hill of Dehkhodaydad, this large area was cleared up on the first day. Now our mojahedin are advancing toward Arzanqimat and over the hill of Bagrami. [Correspondent] What is the enemy doing? Are they resisting or fleeing? [Gol Hayder] We see no resistance from the enemy. The fact that Dostam lost his two-year-long held position in a few minutes and could not resist, they could not resist even for three minutes in Dahan-e Jada, in Daramsal-e Kohna and in Shah-e Shahid held by Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan]. They could not resist, but have escaped. [Correspondent] Thank you, esteemed commander. I wish you and all mojahed brethren success and victory.
