The reassurance from Cambodia's first Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh came after Chuan, making his first official visit to Phnom Penh, reaffirmed that Thailand does not help any group not a part of the legitimate government of Cambodia. At the same time, Chuan and his official delegation sought assurances that Phnom Penh would protect legitimate Thai investment in Cambodia while weeding out business people seen to be exploiting the country. Prince Ranariddh spoke to reporters after meeting with Chuan. "The meeting has made progress and smoothened our relationship," Prince Ranariddh said. Also present at the meeting was Cambodia's second Prime Minister Hun Sen. Chuan told the Cambodian premiers that as Bangkok does not want anyone to interfere in its internal affairs, it has never, and will never, intervene in Cambodia's domestic issues, especially as far as the Khmer Rouge is concerned. Chuan's closed-door meeting with Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen was also attended by Thai Defence Minister Gen Wichit Sukmak, his Cambodian counterparts Gen Tie Banh and Gen Tea Chamrat, Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri and Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut. Prince Sirivut had recently demanded that Bangkok state specifically which group, the Cambodian govemment or the Khmer Rouge, it supported. Thai government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said the Cambodian officials told Chuan they were grateful to Thailand for playing a major role in helping to restore peace and for assisting in full reconstruction and reconciliatiun. Both sides agreed to more direct contact in the future to avoid misunderstandings from escalating into major problems. An informed source at the meeting said Prince Sirivut blamed the media for exaggerating his demand for clarification from Chuan. Meanwhile, Chuan asked Phnom Penh to take tough action against Thais involved in illegal activities in Cambodia, but demanded fair treatment and protection for legitimate businesses. "Cambodia reaffirmed it had no intention of revising agreements that Thais have signed with previous Cambodian governments for any benefit. "It reiterated it would honour the agreements," he said. Chuan raised the issue at the meeting with Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen. Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan, Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin and Wichit Suphinit, governor of Bank of Thailand, were at the meeting. Chuan said there were some companies operating in Cambodia without an agreement. But Phnom Penh had promised to discuss some arrangements with the companies based on mutual interest. Cambodia's Economic and Finance Minister Sam Rangsi said his government would honour "good" agreements. Chuan said this confirmation would create more confidence among Thai investors in Cambodia. Because Cambodia was still in the transition stage of its reconstruction and rehabilitation, it had yet to set up an organization to handle economic and trade issues. Cambodia agreed in principle to a Thai proposal to upgrade a temporary border checkpoint in the Sa Kaeo-Poipet area to permanent checkpoint. However Cambodian officials asked for more time to study the details of the proposal. National Security Council Gen Charan Kullawanit said Cambodia needed more time because it did not have enough qualified customs and immigration personnel to man the checkpoint. Officials are still being trained, he added. Aphisit said the two governments agreed that permanent checkpoint would boost trade and help each country to collect trade taxes. The meeting agreed to conduct more studies into the Thai proposal to have 11 body to oversee the boundary, and another body to coordinate border issues.
