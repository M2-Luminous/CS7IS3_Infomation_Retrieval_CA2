The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. As identified above, the proposed changes to the requirements for Isolation Actuation instruments common to RPS or ECCS have a negligible impact on the average isolation unavailability when combined with the individual valve failure probability. The analyses demonstrate that the individual valve failure probabilities dominate the overall isolation failure probability. The proposed changes to the requirements for Isolation Actuation instruments not common to RPS or ECCS decrease their average isolation failure frequency approximately 1.97x10 ^8 /year. The small increase in average Isolation Actuation instrumentation failure frequency of the instruments common to RPS or ECCS are offset by the safety benefits such as a reduction on the number of inadvertent test-induced scrams and engineered safety feature actuations, a reduction in wear due to excessive test cycling, and better optimization of plant personnel resources. As a result, the NRC Staff's Safety Evaluation Reports for these BWROG report concluded that these proposed changes would have a very small impact on plant risk. In addition, RBS has confirmed that the proposed changes to the functional test intervals will not result in excessive instrument drift relative to the current, established setpoints. Therefore, the proposed changes do not result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Other Technical Specification Instrumentation 1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. These proposed changes do not involve a change to the plant design or operation, only the Allowable Outage Time (AOT) and frequency at which testing of the associated instrumentation is performed. These instruments are designed to mitigate the consequences of previously analyzed accidents. Failure of these instruments cannot increase, and is independent of, the probability of occurrence of such accidents. As a result, these proposed changes cannot increase the probability of any accident previously evaluated. As identified in GENE&hyph;770&hyph;06&hyph;01, although not specifically analyzed, these proposed changes are bounded by the results of the analyses discussed in Parts I through IV of this request. Such analyses have shown that the safety function failure frequency is not significantly impacted by similar proposed changes. In addition, any increase in the probability of failure of these instruments to perform their required functions would be offset by safety benefits such as a reduction in the number of inadvertent test-induced scrams and engineered safety features actuations, a reduction in wear due to excessive equipment test cycling, and better optimization of plant personnel resources. Therefore, these proposed changes do not result in a significant increase in the probability or the consequences of any accident previously evaluated 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not result in any change to the plant design or operation, only to the AOT and frequency at which testing of the associated instrumentation is performed. As a result, these proposed changes can at most affect only accidents which have been previously evaluated. Therefore, these proposed changes cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3.
