At a press conference, Kabatepe, speaking on behalf of the organizing committee, said that the Liberal Movement had been created on the grounds that the existing parties and politicians had failed to meet the people's expectations. He said that the Liberal Movement would complete its organizing by June and would establish a party to take part in the first general election after that time. he said there was no liberal party in Turkey and that no consensus existed between the Liberal Movement and the current parties. He stressed that he and his friends had launched the new movement in the belief that the ossified structures of political parties did not allow them to put their principles into practise. Among the principles of the Liberal Movement are the removal of the political ban on students and university lecturers through an amendment in the Constitution, and holding a referendum on the presidential system at the time of the next presidential election. Stressing that the terrorism of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) should be separated from the Kurdish problem, the movement's principles urge active struggle against terrorism and complete observance of human rights. Kabatepe said that the Kurdish issue could be solved through "national consensus." Stressing that the terrorists should be treated the way they deserved, Kabatepe said that it should not, however, be forgotten that those who lived in Turkey's Southeast Anatolia region were Turkish citizens. "They also have the right to live in peace like everyone else. Dialogue is a must. However dialogue is only meaningful in an up- to-date democratic system in which every one is represented," he said. He went on to say that he and his colleagues did not think that the removal of the legislative immunity of six Kurdish based Democracy Party (DEP) deputies and two other independent deputies was appropriate. "Freedom of expression should be made a genuine right in Turkey," he said. "There should be no need for lifting immunity for freely expressed opinions. There should be no difference between the members of parliament and the ordinary citizens." Emphasizing that the main principle of the Liberal Movement was to reduce state interference in the economy to a minimum, Kabatepe said that the state should only assume a guiding role. He said while the state should be very active in the fields of security, defense, justice and social assistance, it should play a lesser role in the fields of infrastructure, education, health and social security. He also said that the and his colleagues believed in the complete autonomy of the Central Bank. Kabatepe claimed that Turkey was missing important opportunities to become stronger in a world that would no longer have super-powers but where a balance of powers would prevail. In this situation, Turkey had a major part to play. He declared that Turkey, which has not yet been accepted into the European Union, would not become a full member in the near future. NATO had entrusted Turkey with the role of "guard" in the Middle East, while it remained a mere spectator itself to the real danger emerging in the north. Even, he said, it was giving its support to Russia's expansionism. He said Turkey should review its policy regarding the Turkic republics and reinforce its commercial and economic cooperation with those countries. Emphasizing that the new balances in the Middle East should be carefully assessed, Kabatepe said Turkey should both reinforce its relations with Arab countries and improve its commercial ties with Israel, while giving its support to international initiatives for peace in the region. Kabatepe said that no one should rely on Turkey becoming a member of the EU, but that all efforts should be made to improve living standards and democratic rights in the country. As far as relations with the United States were concerned, priority should be given to economic and commercial cooperation rather than to military issues.
