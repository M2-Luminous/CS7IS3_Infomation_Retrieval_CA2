FR940805-1-00036 FR940805-1-00006 Some production companies developed training programs for production workers that provided training at a level equivalent to that mandated for drilling. Other production companies developed minimal courses and did not require their workers to repeat training on a periodic basis. In January 1991, MMS expanded the training provisions to establish requirements for well-completion, well-workover, well-servicing, and production operation workers which were similar to requirements for drilling operation workers. The current system ensures that minimum standards are met by all workers in the OCS and requires submittal of training courses from schools to MMS for review and approval. The MMS reviews plans and attends one of the courses to ensure that the course properly implements the submitted plan. While the system has provided for the training of offshore workers, it may also limit the flexibility available to lessees and contractors and their ability to integrate their training requirements into their overall safety program. The MMS is seeking ways to ensure that lessees and contractors continue to properly train offshore workers, while reducing paperwork and providing more flexibility. This notice is the first step in that process. To help generate comments, MMS has identified five approaches to modifications of the regulations_listed below as options 1 through 5. Questions follow each option to solicit specific information. These options and questions are intended to provide a basis for comments and are not intended to limit ideas. In addition to comments on the five options and answers to questions, interested parties are encouraged to submit other approaches which will meet the needs of MMS and of lessees and contractors, other ideas, and any available information to support the ideas. Option 1. The MMS is aware of other training standards based solely on testing. Under Option 1, MMS would eliminate its current system of school certification in favor of a more performance-based system and measure the performance of the school through testing of students. The system could either provide for testing by schools, testing by an independent third party, or testing by MMS. 1. If approach 1 is used, how can MMS measure the performance of a school? Are written tests and hands-on testing conducted at a facility the best way to measure performance of schools? 2. If MMS-developed tests are used to determine performance, should tests be prepared by MMS and administered either by schools or by an independent third party, or should the tests be developed and administered by MMS? 3. Are there aspects of training that need to be included but cannot be adequately tested? Option 2. As with option 1, MMS would eliminate its current system of school certification in favor of a more performance-based system. This would require MMS to assess the ability of a worker to safely perform in the OCS. This option might include testing of personnel at an offshore location (including use of a simulator) or the use of drills with MMS personnel observing the actions of workers during these drills. If deficiencies are found, MMS would require lessees and contractors to determine the changes needed to provide for safety in the OCS. Changes may include more training, better training, better simulators and training facilities, or different operational conditions that better match the training to the operation. Identifying deficiencies in a given school would then be the responsibility of the lessees and contractors. 4. What methods should MMS use to assess the effectiveness of the training that has been received by offshore personnel?
