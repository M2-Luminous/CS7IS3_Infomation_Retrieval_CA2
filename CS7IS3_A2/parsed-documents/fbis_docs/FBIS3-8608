As a result of his influence, Russia's internal policy has been changing, the bombing of Serbia has been prevented, and an amnesty has been declared, among other things. At a news conference in Warsaw on 12 March, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] of Russia pointed out that Russian policy was changing according to the ideas put forward by this party. He said that Yetsin "had to take into account the results of the parliamentary elections", in which the LDP gained the support of 25 percent of the electorate. Enemies of a strong state, among whom Zhirinovskiy includes Gaydar, Fedorov, and Burbulis, are being removed from the government. He stressed that he hoped that Kozyrev and Shakhray would leave the government by the beginning of June. "Russia will celebrate when it gets a new minister of foreign affairs," Zhirinovskiy said, when asked to comment on Kozyrev. The LDP leader wishes the present president of Russia to be able to survive to the end of his term in office, although, as he stressed, it may also happen that elections will take place earlier than planned--that is, in 1996. "If members of the electorate retain their current affiliations, I shall be able to win the elections," Zhirinovskiy said. He emphasized several times that his aim was to build a strong Russia. He came out in favor of a free Europe, a Europe of many partners free of any political or military pressures. "I am not threatening anyone, but I am warning that, if there is any danger to Russia, I shall harden my policies," he said. If he becomes president, he will, in case of "a mortal" danger to Russia's national interests, use all of the possibilities, "not excluding nuclear weapons." Zhirinovskiy expressed his "categorical protest" against the use of foreign armed forces to solve conflicts, as, for example, in the former Yugoslavia: "Everyone should solve his problems himself; nobody should impose his precepts." When asked about his earlier statements, in which he questioned Poland's borders (among other things, he mentioned a joint Russian-German border), he said that "the best border between Russia, Poland, and Germany is the sea border--the Baltic Sea."
