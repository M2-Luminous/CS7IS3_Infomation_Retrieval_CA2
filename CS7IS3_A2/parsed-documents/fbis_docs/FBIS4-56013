This was stated at a news conference held today by Jaroslav (Cantos), a member of the preparatory committee of the Slovak Green Party, when he talked about the formation of this new political entity in Slovakia. Our reporter Otto Goerner has more details. [Goerner] The preparatory committee of the Slovak Green Party has issued a statement in regard to this step which says, among other things, that for the reasons given above, as well as due to certain differences of views on the approach to tackling certain environmental issues, they have decided to form a new party. They also see in this a new alternative for those voters who want to support green philosophy but who at the same time find it unacceptable to give their votes to the SDL. The new party also provides an opportunity for those members who had decided to quit the party following the formation of the coalition with the SDL. The necessary one thousand signatures that are required for the party to be registered at the Interior Ministery had been collected last week and the party has lodged an application at the Interior Ministry. [passage omitted] In the coming parliamentary elections the new Slovak Green Party wants to appeal primarily to the parties of the national block. The new party will in no case however refuse to cooperate in technical matters with the other Green Party.
