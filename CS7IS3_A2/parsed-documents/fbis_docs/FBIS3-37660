Its members, which include Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian president and Russian Federation deputy foreign minister, and Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of the Russian airborne assault troops, have to tackle a number of practical issues relating to the redeployment of a unit of the Russian "Blue Helmet" battalion from the Vukovar area to Sarajevo. The operation is being carried out within the framework of Russia's initiative aimed at settling the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and at removing the threat of NATO air strikes on the positions of the Bosnian Serbs. During its stay in former Yugoslavia the Russian delegation plans to see the situation at first hand and to hold talks with the UN forces command and the leadership of the Bosnian sides to get the necessary guarantees for the successful and safe implementation by the Russian contingent of its peacekeeping mission in the hottest part of the Bosnian conflict. After arriving in Belgrade the commander of the airborne assault troops left for the Russian battalion, which had already started to move toward Sarajevo. After that Ye. Podkolzin and V. Churkin will fly on to Zagreb where the main headquarters of the UN forces command in former Yugoslavia is situated. On Sunday they will go to Sarajevo to see the situation at first hand and to meet the representatives of the confronting sides. In an arrival statement Vitaliy Churkin stated that the Russian delegation's main work would be in Sarajevo, where there are to be talks with representatives of the sides and the local UN command on the tasks of the Russian contingent. We want also to acquaint ourselves with the progress in the withdrawal of the heavy weapons from the city. We plan to stay in Sarajevo until the evening of 21 February to see that "there are absolutely no surprises," the Russian diplomat said, having in mind the expiry at midnight on the 20th of the NATO ultimatum on air strikes. If snowfalls and snowdrifts prevent the Serbs from completing the withdrawal of their artillery from the city, will the NATO forces not use this pretext to inflict air strikes, V. Churkin was asked. "I think that it will be simpler to ask us to resolve all the issues than to inflict strikes and undertake other reckless and risky steps," he replied. "We are willing to give priority attention to ensuring the safety of our fighters in Sarajevo," the commander of the Russian airborne assault troops stated. "This is going to be one of the most important points in our upcoming conversations with the command of the UN troops and with representatives of the Bosnian sides. We want to obtain firm assurances from them and guarantees protecting our fighters from all surprises," Ye. Podkolzin emphasized. One of the sides gave such guarantees without any delay. Army General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander who arrived in Belgrade especially to meet with the Russian delegations, said that the Russian fighters can have full trust in the Serb side. We are very interested in seeing the Russian peace-keeping contingent operate in Sarajevo and we hope that its presence will speed up the achievement of peace, he said.
