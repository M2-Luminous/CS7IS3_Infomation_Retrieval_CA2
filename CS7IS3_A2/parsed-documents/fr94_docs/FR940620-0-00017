FR940620-0-00017 FR940620-0-00005 4. One commenter asks why operational checks would be required at more frequent intervals following installation of an additional safety feature than prior to its installation. The FAA recognizes the concerns of these commenters regarding the requirement for periodic operational checks of the sync-lock following its installation. However, the FAA finds that the operational checks are necessary in order to provide an adequate level of safety and to ensure the integrity of the sync-lock installation. The actions required by this AD are consistent with actions that have been identified by an industry-wide task force as necessary to ensure adequate safety of certain thrust reverser systems installed on transport category airplanes. Representatives of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) of America, Inc., and the FAA comprise that task force. Representatives from other organizations, such as ATA, have participated in various discussions and work activities resulting from the recommendations of the task force. The FAA acknowledges that the operational checks specified in this AD and CMR items are similar in terms of scheduled maintenance and recordkeeping. This AD addresses an unsafe condition and requires installation of the sync-lock to correct that unsafe condition. The FAA has determined that the requirement for operational checks is necessary in order to ensure the effectiveness of that installation in addressing the unsafe condition. This determination is based on the fact that the sync-lock is a new design whose reliability has not been adequately proven through service experience. In addition, service experience to date has demonstrated that failures can occur within the sync-lock that may not be evident during normal operation of the thrust reverser system and may not result in activation of the sync-lock ``unlock'' indicator. The ATA's suggested alternative to accomplishment of the operational checks would permit each operator to determine whether and how often these checks should be conducted. In light of the severity of the unsafe condition, however, the FAA has determined that allowing this degree of operator discretion is not appropriate at this time. Therefore, this AD is necessary to ensure that operators accomplish checks of the integrity of the sync-lock installation in a common manner and at common intervals. The FAA also finds that addressing operational checks of the sync-lock integrity in a recommended action, such as an MRB report, will not ensure an acceptable level of safety with regard to the thrust reverser system. However, the FAA recognizes that an operational check interval of 4,000 hours time-in-service, which will be recommended by Boeing for inclusion in the next revision to the MRB report, corresponds more closely to the interval at which most of the affected operators conduct regularly scheduled ``C'' checks. The FAA has reconsidered the proposed interval of 1,000 hours time-in-service for accomplishment of repetitive operational checks. In light of the safety implications of the unsafe condition addressed and the practical aspects of accomplishing orderly operational checks of the fleet during regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be readily available, the FAA finds that accomplishment of the checks at intervals of 4,000 hours time-in-service will provide an acceptable level of safety. Paragraph (c) of the final rule has been revised accordingly. Boeing requests that specific references to page numbers and revision dates of the Boeing 757 Airplane Maintenance Manual (AMM) be eliminated from paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of the AD. Boeing recommends that the proposed AD specify only the ATA Chapter-Section-Subject pageblock title and task title in these paragraphs. A second commenter states that the referenced pages could not be found in its latest copy of the AMM. Boeing explains that the AMM's are customized for each operator to reflect all of the equipment in that operator's fleet. Therefore, the number of pages for any given procedure is variable, depending on the number of different equipment configurations documented in an operator's AMM. Boeing also indicates that AMM procedures are revised periodically for non-technical reasons. Boeing adds that changes to the structure of the procedures are necessary to accommodate an upgrade of the publishing system that is currently under way, which, in addition to repagination, will necessitate the issuance of revised AMM pages. Boeing states that the effect of specifying AMM page numbers and revision dates in the AD is that operators may be unable to use the procedure contained in the AMM to perform certain tests required by the AD. Each operator would be required to maintain an obsolete version of the procedure, or to request FAA approval of an alternative method of compliance with the AD that would allow the use of the current version of the AMM. The FAA concurs partially. In light of the information submitted by the commenter, the FAA finds that specific AMM page numbers and dates should not be specified in the final rule. Therefore, such references have been removed from paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of the final rule. However, for those paragraphs, the FAA does not agree that copies of the specific procedures should be included in the final rule. Therefore, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of the final rule have been revised to cite only the appropriate section and task title specified in the AMM for accomplishment of the tests required by those paragraphs. The FAA's objective in proposing periodic operational checks of the sync-lock device, as specified in paragraph (c) of this AD, is to ensure the integrity of the locking function. However, subsequent to the issuance of the proposal and the receipt of Boeing's comments to the proposal, Boeing has submitted to the FAA separate procedures for accomplishment of the operational check of the sync-lock integrity. These procedures have been defined in paragraph (c) of the final rule; therefore, the AMM references specified in paragraph (c) of the NPRM have been removed from the final rule. Additionally, the procedures for the operational checks are accomplished independently of the other thrust reverser system tests specified in paragraph (c) of the proposal. Accordingly, the FAA has revised paragraph (c) of the final rule to require periodic accomplishment of operational checks of the sync-lock integrity only, and has removed the requirement for accomplishment of other tests specified in that paragraph of the proposal.
