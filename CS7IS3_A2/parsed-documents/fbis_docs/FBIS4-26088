Clinton said at a White House press conference today that there are reports that the DPRK may have offered new steps to resolve its nuclear dispute with the U.S. and the IAEA. In discussions with U.S. former President Jimmy Carter who is in Pyongyang for a private visit, DPRK leaders said that IAEA's inspectors and monitoring equipment would be left in place, according to Clinton. The DPRK also "desires to replace its present nuclear program with a new light water reactor technology that is more resistant to nuclear proliferation," Clinton said. Clinton said he is interested in hearing more about the DPRK's offer and described the latest development as a promising one. "If today's development mean that North Korea is genuinely and verifiably prepared to freeze its nuclear program while talks go on," Clinton said, "then we would be willing to resume high-level talks." But in the meantime, the United States will continue to pursue its consultations on sanction against the DPRK at the United Nations, Clinton added. "We are hopeful that this development today will be positive, and we are awaiting further evidence," Clinton said. Before Clinton made the remarks, the White House issued a statement, saying that "the United States welcomes indications given to President Carter [as received] that North Korea desires to find a constructive solution to the very serious issues between North Korea and the international community." "After confirming this meaning of the message from North Korea in diplomatic channels, we would be prepared to go to a third round of talks," Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci said in the statement. "The point today, I think, for you is that there may be in this message a basis for returning to talks with the North Koreans," Gallucci said.
