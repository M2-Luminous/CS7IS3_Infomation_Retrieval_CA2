Taking part in Kragujevac Radio's "Pecat Vremena" program, Krajisnik said that all other statements were means of exerting pressure to make the Serbs give up more territory. However, Krajisnik said that other things apart from the percentage of the territory were also important. Quality is also important and the Serb side will insist on this. Asked about the Serb position for the tripartite talks which will take place next week, Krajisnik said that many matters were already settled except for the territorial demarcation. "Two entities exist on the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina now--the Muslim-Croat federation and the Srpska republic. We have also agreed to discuss other, previously settled, issues so it cannot be said that we do not want to cooperate," Krajisnik said.
