On 4 June, the Middle East Broadcasting Corporation, MBC, cited its correspondent in Aden on the arrest of some Iraqis claiming they were fighters recruited within the ranks of the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, when in fact they are Iraqi teachers who had been teaching in the Hadhramaut Governorate. The forces of the gang of rebellion and secession arrested them and showed them on television claiming they were Iraqi fighters, thus committing a new moral scandal that is added to the series of moral scandals committed frequently by the gang of rebellion and secession. This gang is experiencing its death-throes and is trying, in vain, through these fabrications and cheap blackmail, to win foreign sympathy and intervention to save it from inevitable doom. The First Channel Television yesterday evening screened documentary evidence that refutes the successive fabrications of the gang of rebellion, secession, and treason and those of suspect and hostile media organs.
