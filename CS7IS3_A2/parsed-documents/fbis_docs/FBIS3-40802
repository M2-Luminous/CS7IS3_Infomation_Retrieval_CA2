Oman's Deputy Prime Minister for Financial and Economic Affairs Mr. Qays Bin-'Abd-al-Mun'im al-Zawawi said that the volume of estimated spending for 1994 was nearly 2.033 billion Omani rials [RO] (or nearly $5.285 billion) as against almost RO2.263 billion (about $5.883 billion) last year. This is a decrease in public spending of RO230 million (about $598 million). Despite this drop, which the Omani official attributed to the delicate and complex economic conditions resulting from the fall in oil prices, the Omani budget's estimated deficit will approach RO301 million (or a little closer to $800 million). The estimated budget deficit is 17.4 percent higher than total revenues. This, an economic source told AL-HAYAH, "exceeds the limit set by the current five-year plan (1991-95), which is that the deficit between total revenues and services may not exceed 10 percent of total revenues as a maximum." Estimated revenues for 1994 will amount to about RO1.732 billion (about $4.532 billion), a small increase over 1993's revenues, which did not exceed $40 million [sic]. The oil sector occupied its traditional place in the structure of Omani income, with 76 percent of revenues, with all other non-oil sectors making up the remaining 24 percent. Defense Outlays It was striking that despite the sizeable drop in general expenditures, the defense and national security sector by itself commanded nearly a third of spending, with 30 percent of allocations of more than $1.5 billion. AL-HAYAH has learned from a foreign diplomatic source that, despite economic rationalization measures, the Omani Government will not cancel arms deals signed last year with several countries, chiefly the deal to purchase 36 British Challenger-2 tanks. Oman had to cancel a deal for the purchase of Tornado planes after the "mid-1980s crisis," which saw oil prices fall to less than $10 per barrel. Also, despite the marked decrease in current and recurring expenditure for ministries and civil departments, its share amounted to about 37.6 percent of spending. The goverment's commitment to the basic provision is guiding these expenditures; this is the government salary provision, of which the Omani deputy prime minister said when he announced the budget, "it is a right possessed by citizens, guaranteed under the law, and cannot be violated." The decrease in "investment expenditure" spending was extended, with 21 percent of total spending, estimated at $1.1 billion, or nearly $700 million dollars less than estimated investment expenditures in last year's budget. But Qays al-Zawawi believes that the drop in investments will not severely affect the volume of the program authorized in the five-year plan, especially for priority projects; nor would it affect the ability of ministries and government offices to start projects and enter into new commitments and contracts this year. Announcement of Austerity Decision Economic sources, however, expressed to AL-HAYAH their fears that the drop in government spending, especially in its investments, would lead to a slowdown in economic growth, and a return to the economic recession, as occurred in the wake of the 1986 oil crisis, from which it took the Omani economy nearly three years to recover. The sources alluded, in this regard, to the "indirect decrease" not shown in the budget numbers, but confirmed by the first official government confirmation, reflected in the austerity decisions the government made in 1993 to deal with the public budget deficit. Oman's deputy prime minister said in an exclusive AL-HAYAH interview last October that the government had adopted fiscal policies that included a cut in senior officials' allocations, a drop in compensation for work specialties that some groups in the government receive and in payment of 75 percent of the cost of employees' annual travel tickets, plus the cancellation of government rental of expatriate housing, granting [expatriates] instead a "lower rental allowance." Economists tell AL-HAYAH that these measures might save the government more than $100 million, but could lead to a recession in the country's flourishing contracting and furniture sectors, which primarily depended upon the government's rental and furnishing of housing for its expatriate employees. Maintaining Reserves Omani officials pointed out what seems to be a major source of concern to economic authorities here: that the scope of the deficit could lead to the exhaustion of the state's financial reserves, the reserves in the reserve fund, to which 15 percent of all oil revenues are transferred annually. The huge tremendous excess in real expenditures in 1991 and 1992 on one hand and the nearly one-third drop in oil revenues in 1993, after the fall in oil prices on the other hand, could lead to a greater drawing down of the reserve accounts than was estimated in the five year plan for the first three years of the current plan (1991-1995). In the current year, despite the fact that the basic principle "heeded in the budget was the creation of a balance, as much as possible, between resources and spending, and narrowing the gap between them. This would reduce dependence on drawing down the state's current reserves." More than 70 percent of the methods of funding and ending the budget deficit (nearly $575 million) will come from making withdrawals from the state's reserve accounts." Economic policies and Omani budget indicators are in line with the policies and indicators adopted and announced in the budgets of the other Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, who reduced their budgets by nearly 10 percent as a result of the retreat in oil prices and revenues.
