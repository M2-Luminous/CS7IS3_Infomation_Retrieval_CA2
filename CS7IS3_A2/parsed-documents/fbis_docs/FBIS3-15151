He is Belarusian. His father died at the front in the Great Patriotic War. He is a professional lawyer and graduated from the Law Department at the Belarusian State University, specializing in jurisprudence. He worked in the republic's law-enforcement organs and in 1985 became head of the Vitebsk Oblast Soviet Executive Committee Internal Affairs Administration. He is a militia lieutenant general in the reserve. In 1990 he became a people's deputy and member of the Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet Presidium and chairman of the Supreme Soviet's Commission on National Security, Defense, and Combating Crime. His wife is an accountant. They have two children: Their son is a doctor, their daughter a student. On 28 January 1994 he was elected chairman of the Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet. One hour before the results of the second round of voting were announced, I approached him in the foyer where deputies were waiting for the verdict of the tellers' commission. "It is tempting providence to congratulate you on your victory, Mechyslaw Ivanovich." "It is hard to say what is better," he replied, pensively. "My wife has not spoken to me since she heard what kind of harness I am putting my head into." Indeed, Mechyslaw Hryb himself immediately refused point-blank to allow his nomination to be put forward. The members of the presidium met and spent half a day trying to persuade him. Now the scene shifts to the office of the chairman of the republic's Supreme Soviet where our conversation took place and my first question was this: [Stepanenko] So, is it a case of congratulations or commiserations? [Hryb] Commiserations would be better -- such a burden, and at such a time. [Stepanenko] The impression gained from your first interviews and speeches as chairman are unambiguous: You are fully aware of how hard it is to extricate the republic from the crisis into which it has been plunged in the past two years. In your view, what are the reasons for this crisis and what are its true dimensions? [Hryb] When assessing any phenomenon I usually rely on objective data. On things that can be compared and calculated. For example, in the past two years national income has fallen by 20 percent. And although the rate of decline is much less than in other countries of the CIS and the Baltic region which are former republics of the USSR -- its scale is awesome. If you consider that back in 1989 the national income growth rate was 8 percent and was perhaps the highest in the world, it is not hard to see that the calamity which was building up is hitting us particularly hard here. The main cause of the crisis is undoubtedly the breakdown of the ties which permeated the vital economic organism. The destruction of production-sharing dealt the republic a heavy blow. Belarus, as you are aware, was known as the assembly shop of the Union: machine building, electronics, chemicals, and other sectors of industry manufactured end products here using components and raw materials received from many republics. We received 70-80 percent, in some cases the full 100 percent, of our oil, gas, and metals, for example, mainly from Russia. After the disintegration of the USSR the volumes of those supplies fell sharply and prices rose incredibly. Furthermore, prices of oil and gas for our enterprises were four times higher than for Russian enterprises. Added to that there were customs duties, which raised prices by a third. That is the reason for the slump in production, the explosion of inflation, and the further decline in the living standard. [Stepanenko] All these are external factors, as it were. But there were internal ones, were there not? [Hryb] Of course. I have said a number of times that in the process of perestroyka and reform we lost control of the republic. The old party-state system was destroyed, but a new system of management was not created. This aggravated all the negative processes. The growth of crime, speculation, corruption; the opportunity for the unearned fast buck, which demoralizes socially inexperienced youth above all and undermines society's future; the iniquitous enrichment of some against the background and at the expense of the impoverishment of a considerable section of the people; the erosion of the moral principles and values inherent in our people since time immemorial -- all these factors jeopardize society's stability. [Stepanenko] What do you intend to do to rectify such an explosive situation? [Hryb] I intend to use all the strength, experience, and ability that it takes to eliminate the causes of the crisis. As for the external causes, it is necessary first of all to immediately rebuild the wrecked economic ties with the former republics of the USSR. Especially with Russia. As I have already remarked a number of times, the situation can only be remedied by an economic union and a singe monetary system -- measures, I stress, which are exceptionally effective and mutually beneficial. Despite the resistance of the opponents of such integration, a contractual basis for the single monetary system has been prepared and, I hope, will be adopted in the near future. [Stepanenko] What about the elimination of the internal causes? [Hryb] Briefly, it is necessary to restore the government of the republic. As quickly as possible, furthermore. [Stepanenko] What is being done to achieve that? [Hryb] As I promised right after the election, I am trying to take every measure to unite deputies and the presidium as far as possible. Unless consolidation is achieved at the top, not one of the tasks aimed at creating an effective system of government will be accomplished. And there are a great many tasks of that kind. Of course, some of them are more important than the rest, and unless these are resolved we cannot even hope to find a way out of the crisis. The most important thing today, in my view, is to define the form in which the state is to be organized. Belarus and Tajikistan are the only former USSR republics not to have done that yet. The other day, as you know, the Supreme Soviet Presidium issued a statement which set out what are in our view the main measures involved in building and equipping the state. First it is necessary to institute the post of the supreme official who is to be elected by all the people and who is at the same time the leader of the state and the executive. In our opinion, this will ensure personal responsibility for the state of affairs in the republic. In addition, it is necessary to define in law the appropriate system of state organs to ensure the observance of citizens' rights, the efficient development of the economy, effective management, control, legality, and law and order. During this very session we must work to adopt a new constitution and hold nationwide elections of state and executive branch leaders in the first half of the year, elections to the Supreme Soviet in the second half of the year, and elections to the local soviets in March next year. We are convinced that in this way the continuity of power and stability in society and the participation of the whole population in the renewal of the state organs will be ensured on the basis of the laws. [Stepanenko] Mechyslaw Ivanovich, not everyone supports this program, as we know. Let us begin with the intention of uniting the deputies. The views, approaches, and programs of those who belong to communist deputies' formations, the People's Movement of Belarus (PMB), for example, and the Belarusian People's Front (BPF), conflict on the fundamental questions of socioeconomic organization and policy. The former, for example, support a union with Russia, the BPF is against. Uniting them, combining the uncombinable -- do you not think that this is idealism, romanticism, a utopia, if you like? [Hryb] I am not so naive as to fail to understand that it is impossible, of course, to try to consolidate and unite the forces of the communists and the BPF, for example. But I do think it realistic to try to unite them to resolve a specific task. You only have to reason and try to convince them -- they are living people and, believe me, they do listen when people speak to them and try to convince them by means of arguments. We, too, must listen, consider, and accept all of our opponents' reasonable suggestions. Unity has been achieved on a number of questions of building and equipping the state, and both the communists and the representatives of the BPF voted for many articles in the new constitution which have now been adopted. [Stepanenko] Suppose, Mechyslaw Ivanovich, that you do manage to achieve a certain consolidation of the deputies, nevertheless a unification within the political hierarchy which divides people and society from below (and that, after all, is the only outcome of a course of market reforms aimed at capitalization) will not lead to stabilization, peace, reliable manageability, or accord. For example, who is going to agree to latter-day capitalists becoming rich at other people's expense? Clearly what is needed first is a concept of a socioeconomic arrangement which unites people, is it not? [Hryb] We do not need to build capitalism and we will not build it, even if only because with our people we will not reach capitalism, we will not succeed in building it. [Stepanenko] The supporters of capitalization are touting this idea of yours around everywhere, Mechyslaw Ivanovich: Hryb himself has said that you will not build capitalism with our people: They are the wrong people, bad people. [Hryb] Why are they "bad"? It is simply that we are by nature somewhat different, we have a different mentality. The Belarusians, the Russians -- the Slavs -- and indeed not only the Slavs but everyone who has lived on the territory of the former Soviet Union, the majority of these people have a different inner, spiritual core. It is based on a desire for justice, the struggle for justice, and a belief in the triumph of a justice with which the principles of "buy and sell" and "make as much money as you can" are incompatible. Just like the principle of dividing and judging people according to capital and wealth. [Stepanenko] When addressing the first session of the presidium after your election as chairman of the Supreme Soviet Presidium you cited a purely worldly example: Before laying a road, the smart administrator first looks to see which way people tend to go and only then starts laying the asphalt. [Hryb] Yes, that is one of my main principles, people will not get it wrong, believe me. My greatest faith is in people, in the fact that they will work things out for themselves and decide for themselves how they should live. I am convinced that we have still not made any major or irreversible mistakes and have taken a balanced approach to the reform of the economy. I am a convinced supporter of the need to reform the old economic system. It was too restrictive and to a large extent tended toward a leveling approach. Everything was dictated from the top. Neither collectives nor individual workers had scope for development. People were suppressed, the level of wages was restricted. Just exceed that restrictive limit a little and immediately they revise the norms and the rates. But we need to give the producer and the worker freedom. Of course, that freedom must not harm others or society. [Stepanenko] You are a supporter of the presidential form of rule, but many people, including a section of the deputies, are opposed to it. I have just had a call from a reader who cited some lines from a newspaper report: "The institution of the presidency tore our Union to shreds. Each president, great or small, took pains to organize his own little nest and promised the people an abundance of 'golden eggs.' We know what the result of that was. Moreover, it cannot be ignored that presidential rule tends more toward an individualist rather than a collectivist psychology...." [Hryb] I beg to differ. In the first place, I do not believe that it was presidential rule which led to the disintegration of the Union.... In the second place, there was a president in the USSR even before perestroyka. Only in those days he was called a general secretary. I am convinced that, now that governability has been almost completely lost, such an instrument is needed. [Stepanenko] What about a parliamentary republic? People's power in the form of the soviets? [Hryb] Soviet power as a form of popular representation after the appropriate improvement, and its supreme organ -- the Supreme Soviet -- remain and will exercise their functions in close cooperation with the president. [Stepanenko] Many are convinced that before adopting the constitution it is necessary to decide on a sociopolitical and economic structure. That it is necessary to begin not with the roof but with the foundations. [Hryb] I can understand them but I cannot agree with them. While we are making up our minds there will be nothing left of the roof but fragments. In a society out of control only one type of process -- a destructive one -- is possible, and for that reason the most important thing is to establish a firm vertical administrative structure, that is my opinion, my conviction. [Stepanenko] The draft of the new constitution stresses the priority of human rights over the rights of the state. The supporters of that approach assert that this is how things are in all rule-of-law states in the West.... But is the absolutization of human rights in our country not one of the causes of chaos? [Hryb] We have lived through the stage of "thinking about the motherland first, yourself afterward." They were good words, a fine idea, but we remember what resulted from the disfigured absolutization of this idea. When a person could not leave the village unless the chief gave him a reference, when he could not take someone who had offended him to court or to the executive committee or any other organ of power. [Stepanenko] But those were distortions. [Hryb] Yes, but the soil for such distortions existed. I believe that human rights must be defined as a priority in the constitution. But in conjunction with obligations. Obligations to society, the state, and other citizens. When we organically combine all these factors, there manifests itself an integral state structure in which no one will be able to shelter behind the freedoms and rights of the individual to harm another person, the collective, or society. [Stepanenko] I would like to thank you for this frank conversation and congratulate you on behalf of myself and my PRAVDA comrades on your election to this supreme state post. And of course to wish you success in your difficult state work. [Stepanenko] Thank you, and I also wish PRAVDA and its staffers new successes.
