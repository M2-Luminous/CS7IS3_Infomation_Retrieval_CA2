The paper says: This massacre not only reminds us of the terrorist massacres and mass killings in Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, Kafr Qasim, Bahr al-Baqar, Da'il, and al-Samu', it also proves the impossibility of coexistence between Arabs and Israelis as a result of the fascist Zionist rancor against the Arabs. TISHRIN says: This massacre was premeditated, planned, and carefully studied. This is confirmed by the number of victims who were killed or wounded. This is also revealed by the killing of Palestinians which continued after the massacre at the hands of the occupation troops in Hebron, Bethlehem, the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, and Nabulus, and which also extended to Nazareth and the entire 1948 territories to 'Ayn Mahil, Kafr Kanna, and Umm al-Fahm until they reached the Golan. TISHRIN adds: Our people's wrath indicates that occupation will inevitably vanish, that resistance must be escalated against all the manifestations and pillars of the occupation, and that capitulation and relinquishment of rights is calamitous, especially since the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre was only one of the manifestations and results of the Oslo agreement which gave Israel all that it wants and granted it all that would enable it to continue its occupation and impose its control on our people's destiny and their national and pan-Arab will. What kind of peace is that which was produced by the Oslo agreement? It is the peace of settlers who kill Arabs, violate honor, defile sanctities, control the land, and imposes capitulatory conditions. TISHRIN stresses: Israel is still completely hostile to peace. It still adheres to all its crimes. It perpetrates massacres and falsely claims that they are perpetrated by individuals. It shamelessly conceal the facts of its hideous terroristic practices. Concluding, TISHRIN says: Although it is difficult to forget the results of the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque without forcing Israel to pay the price for what it has done to our people, it has also unequivocally proved that occupation and peace cannot go together, and that the road to peace cannot pass through partial agreements and separate deals, but through the full termination of occupation and the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace. In two articles, the newspaper also writes about the bloodbath at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in the occupied city of Hebron at dawn yesterday. Under the headline "Crime and Responsibility," AL-THAWRAH says: Yitzhaq Rabin's government has hastened to acquit itself of responsibility for the massacre and to hold one person responsible. It came out with several stories harmonizing with its known policy of blaming provocative mass carnages on deranged Israelis, as it claims. AL-THAWRAH stresses: The Rabin government's disinformation campaign concerning this heinous massacre and its attempt to acquit itself of responsibility for it cannot be accepted by anyone, especially since the occupation forces guard all entrances to the Ibrahimi Mosque, and consequently, no armed man can enter without the approval of those Israeli forces. AL-THAWRAH says: Moreover, we cannot separate the occupation soldiers' killing and wounding of a large number of Palestinians who were shocked by the crime and took to the streets in the cities and villages of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip from the timing of the massacre. It says: Killing Palestinians in the occupied territories and dealing with them as if they were strangers, and arming Jewish settlers and supporting their crimes against Arab citizens have become an official policy adopted by the Rabin government. This policy has been escalating since the Oslo agreement. This shows the Rabin government's hostility to peace and stability, and its adherence to Israel's 1948 policy which was based on a firm ideology concerning the perpetration of massacres and daily killing of Palestinians. This also proves that this government has no intention to withdraw from the occupied territories or even to stop the establishment of Jewish settlements on them. Concluding its article, AL-THAWRAH calls on the U.S. Administration, the cosponsor of the peace process, to adopt fair stands toward what is taking place in the occupied territories in harmony with its principles of preventing aggression and terrorism. Moreover, all aid to Israel should stop, and the principles of the international legitimacy should be implemented to achieve peace and stability in the region. In another article on the same subject, AL-THAWRAH calls on the international community to immediately and bravely assume its responsibilities and to take the necessary measures to secure protection for the Palestinians under the Zionist occupation by terminating this occupation, especially after this crime has proved to the world the extreme danger of the continuation of occupation of Arab territories and of settling on these territories. This danger can only by eliminated by enabling the Palestinian people to determine their future in accordance with the UN Charter and resolutions, particularly those resolutions on which the peace process is based.
