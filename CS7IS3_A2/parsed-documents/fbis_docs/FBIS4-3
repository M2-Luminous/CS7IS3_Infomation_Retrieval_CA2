S.-IAEA DPRK Hints at Willingness to Talk With IAEA on Inspection DPRK Hints at Willingness to Talk With IAEA on Inspection SUMMARY Pyongyang has used the authoritative vehicle of a Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement to hint that resolution of the current impasse over nuclear inspections through direct negotiations with the IAEA is still a possibility. END SUMMARY Pyongyang's latest authoritative statement on the nuclear inspection issue, a 31 March Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, seemed to fall short of conditioning resolution of the issue on the resumption of high-level bilateral talks with Washington. It also avoided ruling out direct negotiations with the IAEA for further nuclear inspections. In what appeared to be deliberately vague phraseology, the statement said that Pyongyang "would not oppose" solving the issue "through negotiations," if Washington 1) stops attempting to apply "international pressure" and 2) "proceeds with the reestablishment of the foundation of the DPRK-U.S. talks" (Pyongyang radio, 31 March). The statement failed to specify who should "negotiate" with Pyongyang on the inspection issue, what it means by "reestablishing the foundation" for bilateral talks with Washington, or how to "proceed" toward that goal. Thus, Pyongyang appeared to leave open the possibility that Pyongyang could start negotiating with the IAEA on additional inspections before high-level U.S.-North Korea talks reconvene--something Washington had been urging North Korea to do. Nevertheless, the statement left no doubt about Pyongyang's preference for resuming bilateral talks with Washington first. It declared that had the bilateral high-level talks previously slated for 21 March in Geneva been held, "routine and ad hoc" IAEA inspections could have resumed and the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys would have taken place. Implying that Pyongyang still hopes to salvage bilateral talks, the statement said that if Washington continues to "abuse" North Korea's efforts to resolve the nuclear issue, it will "no longer" pin its hopes on the DPRK-U.S. talks. The statement attempted to explain the disagreement over recent IAEA inspections by revealing what it depicted as the understandings reached at a series of working-level contacts with U.S. officials in New York, meetings that preceded the recent IAEA inspections in North Korea. The statement claimed that Washington had agreed at the talks that the IAEA would conduct "strictly limited" inspections and had asked Pyongyang not to publicize the "limited" nature of their agreement in order to "save face." It also alleged that the U.S. side had agreed to attend the high-level talks once the IAEA inspections were made, "irrespective of their results." Conciliatory Tone Demonstrating Pyongyang's aversion to being seen as caving in to international pressure to make concessions on the nuclear issue, the statement used the unprecedented(SEE NOTE) format of a question-and-answer session with an unidentified KCNA reporter, a format apparently designed to give the impression that the spokesman is simply clarifying North Korea's stance and not making any new proposals. Yet, in sharp contrast to the 21 March Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, which openly threatened North Korean withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the 31 March statement contained no threat, promising only that Pyongyang would "counter" any U.S. pressure. Although the statement repeated allegations of U.S. bad faith, using words such as "faithless," "false promises," and "unjustifiable preconditions" to describe Washington's action, it was devoid of the kind of bluster that has marked recent North Korean pronouncements. (NOTE: Although Pyongyang media have occasionally carried a Foreign Ministry spokesman's answers to questions that were purportedly posed by KCNA reporters, they had not been observed to carry their questions.) Implications The 31 March statement seemed designed to give the impression that Pyongyang could still negotiate with the IAEA to resolve the current nuclear impasse in return for some symbolic gesture from Washington.
