The document of the Pekin Guerrero Group, with that significant shift, opens up room for a Sandinist consensus on programmatic issues. This is made even more encouraging by two facts: 1. The fact that some strong intellectuals have made positive contributions to this document; and 2. The fact that among the members of that group there are people who just recently had been attacking, excluding, and criticizing those of us who, for a long time--and in some cases like mine, for years--had been calling for a profound democratic transformation of Sandinism, by updating its historic roots along the lines of democratic neosocialism. This creates hope that exclusionary tactics and abusive language may now be buried forever. However, the document has some gaps on which we need to reach consensus before the Extraordinary Congress. I am only going to list them in order to promote a Sandinist debate of these issues: 1. We need to design a viable socioeconomic alternative to offer to oppose neoliberalism and statism, an alternative which will define the ground rules in our relations with the government and with other political parties, and will serve as our standard for the 1996 elections. 2. We need to adopt a self-critical position on the policies and actions of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], a self-criticism we owe to all Sandinists and to the Nicaraguan people. 3. We need to insist that the Extraordinary Congress establish effective controls for the transparent management of party assets. 4. Equality among all Sandinists needs to be established with complete clarity, rejecting any form of political elitism by dividing people into first- and second-class members. 5. From general statements on party organization on which we all agree, we need to move to organize clearly collective democratic leadership groups that correspond to the initial Sandinist form of collegial leadership, and do away with unipersonal authoritarian forms. Only in this way, with a collective democratic leadership, can we make the approach of the democratic left and humanistic socialism become a reality, and only in this way will we be able to bring about a profound transformation and renewal in unity.
