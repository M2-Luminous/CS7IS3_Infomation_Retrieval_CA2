He pointed out that the government has decided to withdraw its troops from within the communities in Chiapas State and station them on the outskirts of the towns. Camacho said the troops will no longer be in the towns nor will they provide surveillance and patrols in cities or towns. The government has also decided that the humanitarian tasks the troops were carrying out, such as medical treatment and the distribution of food, will gradually be transferred to the local authorities, the Red Cross, and humanitarian organizations. Camacho Solis said that these actions will contribute to detente in Chiapas State, adding that the constitutional government's goal is, above all else, to foster peace and reconciliation in the region. Camacho Solis said that in this way, the Mexican Republic will be strengthened. [Begin Camacho Solis recording] With institutional strength, with a government that favors negotiation, and with an extraordinary consensus within civilian society in favor of peace, Mexico is not only capable of resolving the very difficult situation in Chiapas, and thereby avoiding the very high costs experienced by other countries, but it is also capable of taking new steps in favor of justice, respecting the Indians, creating broader opportunities for political participation, and supporting Chiapas State, as it has already begun to do. [end recording] Camacho Solis declined to answer questions from reporters; he only read the communique. Meanwhile, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has decreed a waiver and tax exemptions on various taxes, thereby providing Chiapas residents with administrative facilities. Taking into consideration that the state's economic situation is normalizing, and in an effort to ease the people's fiscal and administrative expenses, it has been decreed that, beginning this month and until June, income tax payments will be waived for taxpayers who are paid salaries, without affecting their right to receive in cash the funds they are due as credit on their salaries. Also exempted from tax payments are taxpayers whose homes or establishments are in the affected areas. Also, individuals who must file tax returns or pay federal taxes will be able to conduct those procedures and payments by 31 July without paying any fines whatsoever. During the current fiscal year, there will be no charge for the issuance of nonimmigrant permits; this will benefit bus drivers and the operators of cargo and dump trucks at the Ciudad Hidalgo customs post in Chiapas State. Among the municipalities that will benefit from this decree are Altamirano, Ocosingo, San Cristobal de las Casas, Comitan, Las Margaritas, La Independencia, Chanal, Oxchuc, Chilon, Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacan, and San Juan Cancun. This decree, which will be published in Friday's edition of the Official Gazette, states that these actions are aimed at restoring order and harmony in Chiapas State. I would also like to comment that about one hour ago, approximately 40 community representatives from Chiapas State arrived at Los Pinos Presidential Residence. They are holding a private meeting with President Salinas and I am waiting for them to emerge to talk with them.
