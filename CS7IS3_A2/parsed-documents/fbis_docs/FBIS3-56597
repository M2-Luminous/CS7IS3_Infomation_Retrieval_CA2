He received 38.5 percent of the vote on 16 January in the first round of elections. Yuriy Meshkov told journalists that the persuasive results of the voting in Crimea testify to the possibility of improving relations between Crimea and Ukraine and put relations with Russia on a qualitatively new level. Responding to a question about a possible reaction from official Kiev toward new Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov expressed confidence in the ability of Leonid Kravchuk, as one of the outstanding politicians of the present time, to regulate the political situation in Ukraine and beyond. In the words of Yuriy Meshkov, the Ukrainian president stated earlier that the dislocation of forces in Crimea ruled out a forcible intervention from outside, since it would lead to unforeseen consequences. "I have no grounds for not trusting Kravchuk," Meshkov stressed. In spite of the fact that the central point of Yuriy Meshkov's electoral program is the holding of an all-Crimean referendum on the status of the peninsula, the presidential candidate refrained at the news conference from stating the act of will by the Crimeans, but noted that this will, which was expressed during the elections on 16 January, should be given legal form. [Words indistinct] that the referendum will be held on 27 March. Yuriy Meshkov confirmed his position regarding the nonacceptance of quotas in the Supreme Council of the Republic of Crimea for deported peoples, noting that quotas for Crimean Tatars in the future parliament would be a violation of the norms of international law. The candidate for president of the Crimean Republic described the Assembly of the Crimean Tatars as a real civil and political force. He also said that Crimea has enough state attributes but not enough state content: "What we need are not the outward signs of statehood but the possibility of resolving all economic, political, and sociocultural issues by taking into maximum account the Crimean Republic's interests."
