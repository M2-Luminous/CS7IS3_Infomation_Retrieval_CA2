Ma Yuzhen was reported as saying at the weekend that anger in China over Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's plans meant British companies' "client relationship" and "public relations" would compare unfavourably with that for French, German and American firms. Mr Hurd told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee that British officials had raised the matter with Mr Ma and that his remarks were discussed at yesterday's meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. Mr Hurd said he was aware of suggestions to businessmen "that British interests will suffer as a result of discrimination against them in the China market because of the arguments over Hong Kong." But he said: "I am not saying he is exceeding his functions, but I think British businesmen would be well advised not to take his analysis at face value. "That kind of discimination for political reasons is something which the EU would have to take very seriously and would take very seriously." A spokesman confirmed Mr Ma was called to the Foreign Office "within the last week" in response to his statements. David Wright, deputy under-secretary with responsibility for Asia, had told him such remarks to British companies in China were "unhelpful." Mr Hurd, defending Mr Patten, said: "The Chinese have chosen to focus their opposition to some of his proposals -- put forward of course with our full knowledge and agreement -- to personalise that disagreement on Mr Patten to some extend. "I think that's a pity. I think that gets in the way of sorting these matters out as we would wish to do." He said the Chinese were given advance notice of Mr Patten's 1992 speech in which he first set out his democratic proposals, and the UK had stressed it was open for discussion: "Throughout we have sought to act by agreement, because it obviously makes sense if possible to reach agreement. We continue to seek agreement. It has been elusive, but that is not our fault." He stressed it was in China's interests to take over a flourishing and confident Hong Kong, and he hoped Beijing's appreciation of that fact would prevail and talks could resume. Mr Hurd also told the committee the UK would continue to raise human rights issues with China "regardless of events or agreements or disagreements in Hong Kong.... There has been no soft peddling." But he conceded the UK's progress in tackling human rights with Beijing could be "measured in teaspoonfuls...frustratingly slow." Asked if China's application to join General Agreement on Tarriffs and Trade might be linked to its improving its human rights record, he said: "I don't at the moment feel, and the EU doesn't feel, that it is in our interests to attach a human rights conditionality to China's Gatt application. There are quite strong reasons from our point of view for China joining the GATT."
