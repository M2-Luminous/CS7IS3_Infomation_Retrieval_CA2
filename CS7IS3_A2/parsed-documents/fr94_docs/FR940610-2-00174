L. 96&hyph;193) (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act'') and 14 CFR part 150 by the City of Phoenix, Arizona. The Noise Compatibility program was submitted subsequent to a determination by FAA that associated noise exposure maps submitted under 14 CFR part 150 for Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport were in compliance with applicable requirements effective November 17, 1988.

The proposed second revision to the approved noise compatibility program will be approved or disapproved on or before November 23, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of the start of FAA's review of the revision to the approved noise compatibility program is May 27, 1994. The public comment period ends July 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David B. Kessler, Airport Planner, Airports Division, AWP&hyph;611.2, Western-Pacific Region, Federal Aviation Administration, P.O. Box 92007, Worldway Postal Center, Los Angeles, California 90009&hyph;2007, Telephone: 310/297&hyph;1534.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice announces that the FAA is reviewing a proposed second revision to the approved noise compatibility program for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport which will be approved or disapproved on or before November 23, 1994. This notice also announces the availability of this revision for public review and comment. An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses. The FAA has formally received the second revision to the approved noise compatibility program for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, effective on May 27, 1994. It was requested that the FAA review this material and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program under section 104(b) of the Act. On April 2, 1990, the FAA approved the noise compatibility program for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. An announcement of FAA's approval of the noise compatibility program was published in the Federal Register on May 1, 1990. Revision Number 1 to the approved noise compatibility program was approved by the FAA on August 14, 1992. An announcement of FAA's approval of the Revision Number 1 was published in the Federal Register on September 14, 1992. Preliminary review of the submitted material for the second revision indicates that it conforms to the requirements for the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or disapproval of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before November 23, 1994. The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR part 150, ยง150.33. The primary considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measure may reduce the level of aviation safety, create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses. Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed revision with specific reference to these factors. All comments, other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable. Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed second revision to the approved noise compatibility program are available for examination at the following locations: Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., room 617, Washington, DC 20591.

Bliss, Manager, Airports Division, AWP&hyph;600, Western-Pacific Region. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14143 Filed 6&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
