FR940414-2-00009 FR940414-2-00004 On June 18, 1993, NMFS submitted the request for incorporation of the dory fleet to the Council for its review and recommendation. At its September, 1993, meeting, the Council tentatively approved incorporation of the Newport Beach dory fleet under the groundfish license limited-entry program, pending the provision of information to NMFS from the City of Newport Beach that confirms an effective local limited-entry program is in place and the provision of other information necessary to complete the fleet's application (e.g., identification numbers for vessels included in the fleet). NMFS has received the information requested by the Council and is satisfied that the City of Newport Beach adequately controls both the number and size of the vessels that participate in the fishery. Examination of California landing records for 1990 indicated that the Newport Beach dory fleet landed about 152,000 pounds (68.9 mt) of sablefish. Given that the total West Coast nontrawl sablefish landings were in excess of 3,600 mt (nearly 8 million pounds), the Regional Director has determined that the Newport Beach dory fleet harvest, which represents less than 2 percent of the total nontrawl harvest, has a negligible impact on the groundfish resource. Based on the factors described above, the Regional Director certifies that the operation of the Newport Beach dory fleet is consistent with the objectives of Amendment 6 and has incorporated the dory fleet into the limited-entry fishery. NMFS will issue limited-entry permits to the current members of the Newport Beach dory fleet. Such permits can only be used by vessels operating in the dory fleet. Classification The determination to take this action is based on the most recent data available. The aggregate data upon which the determination is based are available for public inspection at the Office of the Director, Northwest Region (see ADDRESSES ) during business hours. This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR 663.34(a)(3). List of Subjects Administrative practice and procedure, Fisheries, Fishing, and Recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Dated: April 8, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
