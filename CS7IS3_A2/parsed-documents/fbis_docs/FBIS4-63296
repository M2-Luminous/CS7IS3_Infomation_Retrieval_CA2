Oleg Shenin, the chairman of the Council of the Union of CPSU Communist Parties, noted in his opening speech that the dictatorial and criminal regimes in the republics of the former USSR are gaining strength and if communists are idle, then, according to Shenin, the people will not forgive them. [Shenin] All the program documents of all the Communist Parties say that they will strive to restore a single union state. [Masyuk] At today's conference the leaders of Communist organizations discussed two issues. Firstly, the social and political situation on the territory of the USSR and methods to strengthen the Communist movement. The second question--a draft concept for restoring a renewed union. The concept's author is Yegor Ligachev. [Ligachev] The concept contains the main principles for the restoration of a single union state in accordance with the will of the people. [Masyuk] Can it be said that the Russian Communist Party is the leader among the Communist Parties of the CIS countries today? [Gennadiy Zyuganov, Russian Communist Party leader] There is no leading, directing party. There is unity of action. [Masyuk] In the intervals between sessions a small number of Communists visited the local Lenin Museum. Why did you decide to all meet together in Gorkiy Leninskiye? [Shenin] I think that it was so as once again to remind all those who came here and ourselves of the responsibility we bear toward the founders of our parties.
