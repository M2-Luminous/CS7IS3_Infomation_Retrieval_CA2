"We believe that the potential for our company is enormous," Xu told a group of reporters at the Bank of New York, which has been selected to act as the depositary for the sponsored level-1 ADRS of the Shanghai company. The Bank of New York announced on March 21 that Shanghai Chlor- Alkali Chemical Company's ADRS were effective and are traded in the ratio of one ADR representing ten "B" shares traded on Shanghai Stock Exchange. They will trade on the over-the-counter market in the United States. The Shanghai company, a Sino-foreign joint stock company established in July 1992, produces over 20 kinds of products with over 40 different styles of four categories. With the capacity to produce 350,000 tons of caustic soda and 220,000 tons of PVC [polyvinyl chloride], the company's products have been exported to over ten countries and regions, such as Japan, the United States and Italy. Shanghai Chlor-Alkali's B shares owned by foreign investors now represent 34.9 percent of its total shares outstanding. In 1993, based on international accounting standards, the company's total sales were 1.3 billion Chinese yuan and profit after tax was 171 million yuan. According to Wu Yalun, vice chairman of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Shanghai Chlor-Alkali now became the third Chinese company to have ADRS traded at the U.S. market. He expected that there would be more Chinese ADRS to enter the U.S. capital market if they perform well.
