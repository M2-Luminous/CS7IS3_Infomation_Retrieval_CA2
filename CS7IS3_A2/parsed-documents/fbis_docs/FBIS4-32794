The issue can be stated simply: How does the island's congressional apparatus work? Apart from the formal tasks an entity such as this must carry out, it has other special characteristics, as a consequence of the political system the Cubans have adopted. Addressing this issue inspired both interviewee and interviewer, especially when one takes into account that Alarcon, who expresses himself with ease, has an accumulation of experience as a diplomat, a negotiator for his country in difficult international situations, and a representative at the United Nations. He is now one of the main players in what could be called the modernization and recognition of the special role the Caribbean nation's legislative body plays in such an exceptional moment in its history. On this, Alarcon outlined the following conclusions: In a modern world and for the first time, only socialism can offer us the opportunity of executing and examining how to exercise the authority of the people, within the characteristics of a more complex society. He adds: The only way to do this is to develop a system, with new formulas every day -- an infinite multiplication of the parliament -- in an effort to enhance the relevance of direct democracy. In referring to the ideas of a celebrated Austrian author, Alarcon cites the theory of making society a part of the legislative body, as an effective way of involving every citizen of a nation in the decisionmaking processes, which concern precisely them. The way to reach this essential level of participation is to expand the assembly's activity through collective and continuous discussion, everywhere, and not by annulling it. There is, he adds, very recent proof of this theory in the parliaments of the workplace. These assemblies studied the viability of the latest measures taken to cleanse the economy. More than 80,000 meetings at an equal number of workplaces across the nation took place during the last few months in Cuba. Workers in the areas of production and services, as well as the members of student, peasant, and women's associations, discussed the current national economic situation. Alarcon explains that the national, provincial, and municipal deputies participated in these meetings. This allowed them to come to the extraordinary session of the ANPP with an impressive amount of information about the people's opinions regarding such important issues. The deputies came to the assembly after having spent many more hours examining the issues in question than any other deputy on the face of the earth has ever dedicated to any issue. Furthermore, millions of people participated in the meetings and debated something that in other countries is never brought before the people at all. For our interviewee the key to this whole matter is to develop this concept of democracy. This, in the end, will make the people true participants; a subject of society and not just a passive object, who is only invited to participate in the process every once in a while to put a ballot in a ballot box. In one part of the conversation, Alarcon pauses and strongly criticizes the so-called Western representative democracies, which he described as true democratic fiction, removed from the people's interests. The tendency among the population of the countries with that system is electoral shyness characterized by not voting because it increasingly makes less sense to do so. You can count on the fingers of one hand the times an elected candidate meets with those who voted for him so as to be held accountable before them, he said. Regarding his country, Alarcon said it has the possibility of playing out a true democratic ideal in a society based on human solidarity and equality, improving the mechanisms for the effective participation of its citizens. It is impossible to gather all 11 million Cubans at the same time, but it is possible to do it throughout a process, a difficult mechanism, which requires a dose of creativity and originality. The process preceded the decisions made by our assembly regarding the strengthening of the national finances. The method used to implement these types of things is already being practiced in the ANPP's daily work, in its various entities, including the permanent commissions, and Alarcon explains it by listing specific examples. As for the education budget problem, the education commission did not limit itself to giving its opinions and to approving the proposals made by the corresponding ministry, but practically visited all schools in the country, closely observing existing problems and providing solutions to them. The services commission paid special attention to matters related to the tourism industry, which is being completely expanded in the country, and to self-employment, including existing regulations and their observance. The defense commission did its work based on the observance of the guidelines of the struggle against crime, currently of great interest to the entire population, as well as based on the implementation of Revolutionary Armed Forces Ministry instructions for the decrease of budget expenditures on the military. The supervision of the food program, in a programmed and continuous manner, is also part of the work of the parliamentary commission members, who review the situation during visits to production centers and participate in the analysis made by the Agriculture Ministry. Another important example is that of the legal and constitutional affairs commission, which is currently working on the discussion of a citizenship law, for which it is collecting opinions, not only among the appropriate organizations but even with representatives of Cubans living abroad. The work carried out by the commissions has an interesting ingredient since they were created because each one of the commissions has representatives of all Cuban provinces, which gives a national vision to the statements and agreements submitted to the ANPP plenum. An important part of the current work has to do with the process initiated on the control and supervision on the use of the national budget at the various levels, the results of which have been a series of ideas and initiatives aimed at reducing expenditures and increasing state revenues. According to Alarcon, this activity must contribute to the strengthening of the country's finances and the elimination of the budget deficit, an effort carried out with a dose of creativity by the municipal and provincial assemblies of the People's Government. The representativeness claimed by other systems is only fictitious, and we hope that in Cuba, we can increasingly develop the exercise of a true and direct democracy, the ANPP president concluded.
