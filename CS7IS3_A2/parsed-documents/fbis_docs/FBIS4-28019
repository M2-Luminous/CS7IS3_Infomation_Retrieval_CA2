As of mid-May 1994, Taiwan even surprisingly replaced Hong Kong, which had long been ranked second in the list of foreign investors in Indonesia since 1967. As of mid-May 1994, Taiwanese investment in Indonesia totaled U.S. $8.68 billion, while Hong Kong's amounted to U.S. $7.17 billion. Up to last April, Taiwan ranked third with U.S. $5.25 billion worth of investment in 277 projects, while Hong Kong ranked second with U.S. $5.98 billion worth of investment in 270 projects. Taiwan was ranked ninth five years ago. Haji Ir. [academic title] Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, minister of state for investment affairs and chairman of the Investment Coordinating Board, told reporters following a coordinating meeting on industrial and trade affairs on Saturday that the situation proved that the rumors about Taiwanese investors leaving the country were not true. According to him, Japan remained in the top slot with U.S. $17.37 billion worth of investment, representing about 23.2 percent of the total foreign investment from 1967 to 15 May 1994. Taiwan and Hong Kong ranked second and third respectively. The United States ranked fourth with U.S. $6.99 billion worth of investment, Great Britain fifth with U.S. $6.95 billion, the Netherlands sixth with U.S. $6.06 billion, Singapore seventh with U.S. $5.92 billion, South Korea eighth with U.S. $3.76 billion, Australia ninth with U.S. $1.99 billion, and Germany tenth with U.S. $1.96 billion. The Investment Coordinating Board approved 314 projects with domestic investment totaling 22.75 trillion rupiah from January to mid-May 1994, while only 156 projects with domestic investment totaling 8.8 trillion rupiah were approved during the same period in 1993. There was a 257.3-percent increase in terms of the value. The Investment Coordinating Board approved 131 foreign investment projects worth U.S. $5.02 billion from January to mid-May 1994, while only 85 foreign investment projects worth U.S. $3.33 billion were approved during the same period in 1993. There was a 150.6- percent increase in terms of the value. Sanyoto was optimistic that the investment target during the Sixth Five-year Development Plan will be met in view of the huge increase in the amount of investment. Although a new investment policy is yet to be issued to replace Government Regulation No. 50/1993, there has been a tendency toward more investment. He hoped that the new policy will spur further investment. Sanyoto pledged that a new regulation to replace Government Regulation No. 50/1993 will be issued soon. He said that the government will approve several large projects in the next two months. "The interested investors have already put forward the large projects, and we are considering our approval," he said. The large projects are power plants and oil refineries to be built by Hong Kong and Arab investors respectively. "I am optimistic that there will be more foreign investment projects in 1994 than in 1993," he said. Sanyoto admitted that the realization rates of foreign and domestic investment projects remain low. The realization rate of foreign investment projects is just 50.8 percent, while that of domestic investment projects even is much lower. During the coordinating meeting on industrial and trade affairs that took place in Jakarta on Saturday, the coordinating minister for industrial and trade affairs asked the minister of state for investment affairs and chairman of the Investment Coordinating Board to monitor more accurately obstacles facing investors that led to the very low realization rates. "This should be studied to raise the realization rates," Sanyoto quoted Hartarto as saying.
