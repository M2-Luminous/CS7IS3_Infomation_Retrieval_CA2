Yet, the SPD continues to oppose the use of Bundeswehr troops in missions outside NATO territory. This was stated by Bundestag Group Chairman Hans-Ulrich Klose, talking to DIE WELT. Klose, who is responsible for the foreign policy part of the SPD government program, referred to the existing party conference resolutions that do not allow any participation in peacekeeping missions. "But I expect that the Federal Constitutional Court will decide on the SPD complaint in May or June. We will then take it from there," Klose said. Klose, who is personally in favor of full German participation in peacekeeping missions, excludes a Bundeswehr mission in former Yugoslavia for "historic reasons." The presence of German troops would not only make the conflict in the Balkans more difficult to solve, but it would also create new potential for conflict. "There is complete agreement with the chancellor in this respect," Klose said. At the same time, he criticized Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who -- for tactical reasons in connection with the election campaign -- acts as if the Germans were being requested to assist right away. "We are withdrawing from Somalia, a German mission in former Yugoslavia is out of the question, and there are no further demands in sight. There is, therefore, no obligation to act," Klose said. Rudolf Scharping's chief foreign policy expert positively judged the fact "that the Russians are back as an active superpower." Everyone is profiting from this: NATO and the United States because this has made an air strike on the surroundings of Sarajevo superfluous; the Russians because this success is a success for Yeltsin, which strengthens his domestic policy standing. "The Russians have proved to be part of the forces interested in stability," Klose said. At the same time he criticized the "fearmongering" among the nationalists surrounding Vladimir Zhirinovskiy; fear of the Russians has a long tradition in Germany and is currently being irresponsibly stirred up by the media. For the debate on the SPD government program, the draft of which is to be presented in four weeks' time, Klose has worked out an eight-page foreign policy paper that is to be reduced to a page and a half in final editing. "This is not the foremost topic in this election year," the SPD group chairman said. In spite of all the common principles the SPD shares with the government, which Chairman Scharping emphasized in Munich recently, the paper will point out that in solving international conflicts, the SPD does not primarily think in military and diplomatic terms, but wants to tackle the reasons for the conflicts first. "As long as Europe is divided into poor and rich, there will always be conflicts," Klose said. Against this background, the SPD has suggested extending the NATO Partnership for Peace offer to the former East Bloc countries to a "Partnership for Development" program. This suggestion has been welcomed by the Polish government. The SPD wants to keep NATO and the Western European Union as security instruments, but by linking various levels of dialogue, it wants to achieve "a completely new security infrastructure" in the long run. In this process, the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe could gain new significance.
