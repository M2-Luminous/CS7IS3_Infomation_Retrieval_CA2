Even now there is one alarm signal after another. Entire regions are dying out, every hour thousands of motors are grinding to a halt. The fields have not been planted, the children in certain settlements are eating manufactured concentrated animal feed. How are we to cope with this catastrophe? And in August 1993 again there were rumors of a state of emergency, more use of violence against the people, opposition.... At this crisis moment we signed the declaration "Accord in the Name of Russia"--a kind of broad coalition that unites people with various ideological views and values. You, Valeriy Dmitriyevich, were at the source of the idea, the main initiator of this movement. I signed the document but I still have secret doubts--is it possible to have "Accord in the Name of Russia" under conditions where we, judging from everything, are "rushing" to the peak of a systemic crisis? [Zorkin] You are right: The crisis is accelerating and at extremely rapid rates. During January and February of this year the decline of industrial production considerably exceeded last year's indicators. Economic, social, and regional antagonisms in the country are being aggravated. One can already say quite definitely that the current higher-ups of the regime do not know exactly what to do. The state power is becoming increasingly ineffective. Therefore certain little groups in the upper echelons are again trying to place their bets on power methods. But that will help the regime now in the same way that it did in October. In this situation it is no wonder that the declaration "Accord in Name of Russia" was proclaimed. I would even say that it is not only a movement of left-wing forces but a movement of all people of sound mind in our country. After all, all sober-minded people, regardless of their political differences, understand that there is trouble in the country, and in order to overcome it we need some form of social consolidation. The alternative--civil war--will be suicide. We are suggesting that we conclude a social contract of all those forces for whom the Motherland is an enduring value. We must recognize that perhaps the most dangerous threat of the 20th century has been hanging over our Motherland. In the face of a threatening catastrophe, political antagonisms and differences must recede into the background. At least for a certain amount of time. In our declaration we have formulated the most important and common goals that both the liberal and the communist, the entrepreneur and the worker really do have in common. [Prokhanov] Last autumn showed that good intentions can be counteracted by obtuse rigidity and gross military force. And all the perpetrators of the violence in October understood quite well that force in and of itself cannot resolve any contradiction in society, and this was clearly demonstrated after the October events. The crisis was exacerbated. And again scenarios involving all-out violence are being worked out in the narrow interests of the present regime, whose social base in becoming ever narrower. What prompts your intuition? Is it possible to have a repetition of bloody October of 1993? [Zorkin] I would say that the October events were the culmination of a clash of two tendencies. One of them was capable of bringing Russia to peace under the condition that we took advantage of the small chance of proceeding step by step to build a foundation that would provide for the rule of justice and law. Nobody can transgress this law. Any violator--from the rank-and-file citizen to the president--would be specifically liable for this. Another tendency was working against this chance and, although it officially declared the priority of democratic values, it was aimed at establishing absolute rule, a totalitarian regime. They were preparing a scenario that has been played out in Russia's past--both during the past 70 years and even before that, when no law, no rights, and no justice were taken into account. And arbitrary behavior occupied first place in all of this baseness. These two tendencies were stirred up in October, but it is now clear that they lay considerably deeper and had been manifested repeatedly in the past. Each was defended by people who had their own goals. Did the people share these so-called "consumer" goals? Great doubts arise here. After all, there is no need to rely on violence if the citizens agree with the ruler. The people live in peace with their ruler and the ruler with his people when they have a consensus, agreement, a basis of legitimacy. This has been the case in various periods of Russia's history. Even in that peak situation when Minin and Pozharskiy liberated Moscow, national accord was established. And when the great Aleksandr II, the Liberator, began the peasant reforms. He had prepared a platform. Yes, there were those who resisted, there were backlashes, but there were no pogroms or big fires or uprisings or civil wars. And Russia began a great reform. "Accord in the Name of Russia" is the effort of patriots to overcome the catastrophic course of development. [Prokhanov] Yes, they were quite special impressions--during those days beginning on 21 September...the candle ends on the deputies' desks, the barbed wire, the barricades made of pipes, the smell of the fabric of soldier's uniforms. The machine gun fire and the explosion. What struck you most at that time? [Zorkin] People were unable to believe that such a thing could happen. When they started talking in front of this terrible barbed wire, when they began to absorb the information that the president had resorted to the extreme scenario, the members of parliament still could not believe it! Khasbulatov could not believe it. I met with him and I can assure you of this. The people refused to believe it because all of this was beyond the limit. It is one thing to make a political mistake, to show a lack of professionalism, but here everything was accompanied by such terrible cruelty, immorality, corruption.... This was indeed the apogee of the politics of evil. And, moreover, I was shaken by the easy justification of the potentates who committed the gangsterism. Because the people invested them with this very power, the defenseless people trusted them with their souls. And all this was trampled upon.... Before my eyes passed all these gentlemen in a row, court politicians asserting that there simply was no other way in Russia, the president, speaking against the Constitution, was purportedly defending justice...all this left a memorable impression: On the one hand, a lack of acceptance of all this cynicism and immorality, and on the other--dumb amazement: Why is this so, what for? The question arises: How can we motivate those who do not even know the concept of repentance to return to the law and legal behavior? I do not think that today we are faced with the dilemma of "adventurism-democracy" at all. That was the way things stood before the October events, when political scientists close to the president told him: "You must switch to authoritarianism as quickly as possible." Now because of the efforts of these "founders" and even practical workers who have armed themselves with these theories, we have ended up in a situation that is considerably worse, from which it will take a very long time to extricate ourselves. [Prokhanov] After our first meeting I asked myself what kind of political thinking I had encountered in you. I told myself that you were apparently a type of liberal statesman who is absolutely rare in Russian political practice. What happened in October was, in my view, a surfacing of ancient, morbid political forces linked to the idea of totalitarianism. They pushed through again as water does through delicate crystals of ice, through that brief, apparently unique, liberal period that began with Gorbachev and lasted through these two "Yeltsin" years, the period that you frequently embody with your way of thinking and ideology. History, after all, passes through individuals and actions. And the drama of what happened is not just a drama of the destroyed liberal period; it lies elsewhere as well. The Russian national tradition was initially oriented toward the Orthodox monarchic ideal, a kind of authoritarianism ordained by God. This situation was destroyed by the Bolshevist revolution. Another situation appeared--a different authoritarianism that was linked to the idea of the leader, the elimination of all that was mystical and hence justifiably eternal. The liberal approach in which we have all ended up has destroyed the red-Bolshevist dominant and crushed all the principles by which our nation lived. Now Yeltsin has also destroyed the liberal plan. Throughout this century enormous violence has constantly been committed against the national consciousness. The national archetypes have been turned into trash, to dust. Today the public consciousness, in my opinion, is not capable of any kind of construction. It is impossible to build anything on trash, on powder, on dust. And the drama that occurred, in addition to all the legal, social, moral, and ethical aspects, has this one as well. [Zorkin] You have touched upon a very important question having to do with the character of power. It seems to me that above all it should be fair and based on that which from ancient times has inhered in Russia, which is called upon to unite freedom and legality. The citizens must finally feel that they are free people, not slaves to a despot, general secretary, or another Boris. But this can be achieved when the primacy of the Constitution is established, when the demandingness of authority is combined with restrictions which are placed on it by the law, that is, the principles of a rule-of-law state are included in the system of social values and we accept them. First of all let us agree: Do we need order? Or would we live under conditions of arbitrariness, lawlessness, mafia rule, and corruption?... Yet order cannot be effective unless it is accompanied by development and progress. Order and development--join these two words together. But this, in turn, is possible only with the achievement of stability. Any reforms will simply collapse under the conditions of the present chaos and arbitrariness. What kind of entrepreneur is prepared to anticipate or guarantee anything today if he does not know what could happen in the country in a couple of months? That same entrepreneur of ours, as sociologists from legal protection institutions assert, will "fork over" to bureaucrats approximately four times more than the mafia structures will. All this is a cancer that is afflicting society. But why is it growing? Because we have neither order nor stability. And with all the loud declarations of our intention to fight crime, with all the bloody shooting up of parliament, also under the guise of striving for order, we are actually being thrust into anarchy and chaos. And the authorities are undermining themselves because stability in society can be provided only by relying on law and legality. And authorities who resort to unconstitutional measures for the sake of immediate political advantage will become ineffective in the future. Can they really introduce order into the country if they themselves are professing the principle of grabbing as much as they can and taking advantage of force and lawlessness? Such authority dooms itself to inevitable failure, and society--to chaos. Let us begin with the extremely important question of relations between the center and the regions. We live in a federative state--we must take this into account! After all, since ancient times the monarch has taken action when the territories resisted. But here, conversely, the territories said on 18 September: We are in favor of order, in favor of stability, Boris Nikolayevich. And on 21 September he began these misdeeds and then brushed aside the Soviet of the Federation, which for a month before that had been set against the Supreme Soviet. What is this? Friends, do I like it when everyone around me is trembling and at each other's throats? That is what happened. There was squabbling everywhere: the regions with the parliament and with one another, and the executive chief with the chiefs of the legislative power. Will this not actually lead us away from order and stability? Essentially we have had no transformations. Public wealth is being plundered under their guise. And instead of systematizing and applying everything positive in the world for changing from a centralized system to new principles and giving people incentive to work, everything is being done to extinguish these incentives. First we devalued the investments, thus eliminating potential small and medium-sized property owners who, on the basis of cooperation, could have bought bakeries, small productions, shops, etc., and could have created labor joint-stock companies. Then they began to "give away" all the enterprises according to the mafia-bureaucrat principle. For instance, in Omsk or some other city immense plants are being sold to people at a symbolic residual cost. The next day the new owners issue stocks and the prices of them are immediately raised to the real market prices. A gang of people get fat at state expense this way. And this is called transformation? Why did they not take advantage of the experience of Spain or America or even our home-grown communal principles? If the labor collective itself owns the enterprise and if the worker is no longer hired but is part owner, he will work quite differently. It has turned out this way for us: People's psychology regarding work has not changed--we have the same nihilism, the same alienation, although we have a different owner; the private property owner has taken the place of the state. For me the main thing is this: Regardless of what method of privatization may be applied, it is necessary for the people to become the owners. Otherwise after a certain amount of time we will inevitably arrive at a point where things are divided up once again. In order for the people to enter this new economy, the underprivileged strata must definitely have insurance. Here again it is impossible to avoid assigning the state an immense social-regulatory role. But our levers and incentives are first weakened and then restored again in a new mafia-criminal form--they intervene, they redistribute, and they direct.... We must get away from the past, but not to a new disgrace but to a normal, healthy, regulated economy that benefits the workers. I think the owners of capital are interested in this as well. They do not want to be protected by barbed wire or defended with automatic weapons from the furious crowd. But what has the government done? Instead of taking this reasonable path, it has used force to impose its own version of shock therapy, and now they are saying that it is not over yet. No, it was not carried out fully, but its elements were launched in the most primitive and egregiously criminal form. As a result, we ended up with a gang of rich people, and instead of a middle class the foundations for democracy and rule of law are made up of an impoverished crowd. The people have simply been deceived! The main point of the transformations is justice. If certain people take but they do not give to others and those that have even take away more--this is highway robbery. Justice and truth are not simply words, they are not simply our age-old Russian values. They contain something like what issues from universal reason. Because if values are rejected and society is divided into thieves and those who are robbed, it will ultimately fall apart. I think that this is the main lesson we must draw from the October tragedy. And if the ship of immense Russia is to be led further along the path of this narrow-minded, egoistic understanding of privatization or if it follows instructions from the West, we will end up with a country of beggars, a desert country. It will become a foreign colony, a region for labor therapy. [Prokhanov] We have just experienced the most severe structural crisis in which the political machine in the form of the Supreme Soviet was broken. Speaking metaphorically, destructive energies were introduced into it and it exploded from within. Some different kind of mechanism is being created now. What is this, this new Constitution? [Zorkin] The process is contradictory. In order to understand we must turn to the past, to what we have lost. We had the rudiments of real transformations and there was the sense that step by step we could arrive at democratic transformations, at an adjusted course in the economy. But when the people in power got a sense of this, what did they start saying? That the Constitution was Brezhnevian and all our institutions were obsolete. This was out-and-out deception. The Constitution was changed radically in April 1992 and all the institutions were adapted to the new conditions. But the tendencies that were developing did not favor the absolutism of the executive power. The social problems have been aggravated. Mafia and criminal elements have developed to such a point that they have actually buried the hope of any law and order under the people who are now in power. There has been further degradation of the culture and the moral condition of society. There has arisen the question of how we can escape from this systemic crisis. It was possible on the basis of consensus and accord, not some spineless compromise but a real one accepted by society in order to escape from a condition verging on civil war. Instead of this, they began to use force to impose their own position, which actually led to the collapse of the state--economic ties were broken and disintegration gripped not only the nearby foreign countries but also the Russian regions. Transformed into a minority and defending previous catchwords, they were simply forced to destroy even the fragile chances of democracy and to switch openly to totalitarianism. But what next? To say that there will be another upheaval like the one in October--these are all conventionalities. But still we can escape this possible bloody future if society recognizes that the authorities have deceived and betrayed the people and that it is necessary to consolidate in order to emerge from the crisis peacefully. But look at what is happening. Today the ruling regime is again dressing itself up in foreign clothing and raising a foreign flag. During 1990-1992 they dressed themselves up as democrats even though they had nothing in common with them. Now they are dressing in the clothing of patriots, centrists, and statesmen, that is, they have seized upon ideas that quite recently they called fascist. When they understood from the results of the election that the people were in favor of these ideas in a healthy, reasonable version, they immediately decided to change colors. But what about their insides? In general do they understand the essence of what is involved with the Motherland and patriotism? In October our society experienced a shock, there was a rebellion. As long as the people's soul is alive, it will never put up with the situation, it will gather its forces and consolidate. And if the regime does not degenerate, it will prepare for this national action. These signs are in evidence: They are apparent above all in the reorganizations in the power structures making them directly subordinate to the president. Of course, the crisis will also develop further. And the task is for all positive forces that do not want the destruction of the society to consolidate. Which forces? All those that are in favor of preserving the Motherland--that immense state, not some monster, but a state as a living organism. I think that these positive forces will include not only the dissatisfied masses but, for instance, entrepreneurs as well. For the present entrepreneurship under conditions of a thoroughly corrupt mafia regime is simply impossible. Only criminal economic activity can succeed. All this is objectively leading to a situation where unless consolidating forces arise, this regime will fall. But the problem is to make sure that all this occurs in a more or less civilized framework. All this must not be overcome by crude force or universal war. The task is to restore constitutional order and stability and to make real transformations with the least possible losses. If these positive forces are consolidated, we will be able to hope for a successful solution to the crisis. But we must not forget that during 3-4 October with the firing of weapons against parliament a crude force was placed on the political scene, the road was opened up to it. And if we do not conduct a maneuver, if we do not restore the constitutional system, I do not think we can rule out the possibility of military coups. [Prokhanov] This idea of consolidation is at large in society. And the question of how to unite power with justice, law, and the Constitution, of course, is one of the most crucial ones today. If it were possible to have a broad coalition of all who are in favor of such immediate strategic goals as restoration of constitutional order and transformations on the basis of stability and justice, I think it would be possible to escape all this hell. [Zorkin] Such a coalition cannot exist today unless it becomes a coalition of all the people, a kind of popular agreement. There can be various paths to it, but it absolutely must be based on all the strata, classes, and structures--entrepreneurs and workers and cultural figures and the church etc. We are speaking not simply about economic reform but about rescuing civilization in that space that is called Russia. Therefore this must be not a party but a kind of popular congress based on general agreement, above all spiritual. Unification into a coalition has a specific purpose--to change the regime. Then, after that purpose is accomplished, secondary interests will appear, various ones, and pluralism will arise. Society must have various interests, they must compete, and there must be a certain amount of struggle, for otherwise there will be stagnation and a swamp. But it must be carried out according to certain rules. A two-party system corresponds to the natural physical bipolar model, to symmetry, and the Americans, for example, have simply intuitively adapted it to political life. Or we can make sure that those who oppose this coalition are transformed into a civilized opposition. Yeltsin's problem is that he is striving for autocracy and he should have provided for an effective two-power system. For is it not understandable that from the very beginning it was necessary to support the construction of a strong presidency and a strong parliament? This was the guarantee of preservation not only of the Russian political organism but also the presidency as an institution. The gunfire directed at parliament certainly did not make the president strong. On the contrary, he became extremely vulnerable. Tomorrow force could be used to eliminate not only the president but also the institution itself. And the where will they look for a legal mechanism to protect them?... What will the general agreement consist of? Unless we are aware that, for example, miners cannot receive normal wages while the entire organism is sick, nothing that makes sense will obtain. The upper echelons are manipulating: Today they give something to the miners, tomorrow--to the teachers, next--to the newspaper workers. But we need an entirely different system of coordinates: A society in which miners and engineers and entrepreneurs and teachers will all live well. We must also recognize that Russia is a unified living organism. If the regions are concerned only about seizing as much sovereignty as possible or finding a special entry into the halls of centralized power and gaining credit--this is fatal too. This can work from time to time, but then it will fail nonetheless. We need a new federalism. In a word, a renewed Russia--this is what the coalition must rally around, what we have been discussing, what we have called "Accord in the Name of Russia." [Prokhanov] You speak about the possibility of moral and political resistance. But for now everything is in the hands of the present power: means of suppression, intelligence, finances.... At the same time during the past five years of confrontation society has been restructured--at the psychological, social, the most fundamental level. And to come together and smoke the peace pipe once again will require colossal efforts--moral, philosophical, perhaps efforts of some group of irreproachable, respected people in society who could unite the un-unitable. How are we to overcome this social dissension? [Zorkin] Yes, it is difficult to do, but what are we talking about? We are giving a diagnosis: If we cross over this last threshold we will die. We must arouse in ourselves an ability to understand the rational, if you will, an instinct for self-preservation. For example, I have no problem engaging in dialogue even with people I do not like, who have ended up in the other camp. If we agree not to allow the collapse, the death of Russia, we must pass over emotions, antipathies, and mistrust for the sake of general survival. I hope that the majority of people are prepared for this. Of course the coalition must not be merely an abstraction: People say, let us create a program and we do not need power. I think we have already passed this stage. It must be prepared to take responsibility on itself: to adjust the course, to earmark a strict transition period, both in the sense of demandingness and in the sense of clearly worked-out stages and deadlines. If we come to power as Gaydar did--transformations are needed; let us give freedom to the market--the same thing will happen, that is, nothing specific and tested, and it is better not to take up the cause at all. I think the people must respond to conviction, professionalism, honesty, and devotion to justice. Because if this coalition of intellectuals, pragmatists, and practical workers intends to change our present course and do it without truth--that is all, they are defeated. The truth is needed so that people will believe. And this is precisely where we must begin. Here is a team that is suggesting to all of us citizens of Russia that we take our destiny into our hands. That we not place our hopes in mythical help from abroad, in another leader-savior, in the idea that suddenly everything will work out of its own accord, but try ourselves to drag the country out of this quagmire. We are uniting so that the force that strengthened the present power during 3-4 October will not be used for general destruction but will be used for something else. Against what will the first drive of our struggle be directed? Against everything criminal in society. Unless we do this, no transformations will help, because criminals in power, in the economy or in any other sphere, will always act in a criminal way. The question arises: How can we overcome everything that is criminal that has become so terribly overgrown in our society? We need a very strong, I would say, strict power that is based on the law. But the law in this case must be an absolute expression of the principle of justice, that is, it must stand on the side of the people, statehood, and Russia. Power and the law can be used for good only if they are not used to satisfy personal ambitions to provide personal well-being. As soon as the struggle begins, the devilish elements will be on the watch. When I say that we need truth, this means not only to pronounce it. After all, we have seen how those who gave the commands on 3-4 October suddenly started talking about saving the people, about patriotism, and even about accord. [Prokhanov] I recall a theory developed by one noble professor, an old man who had been wounded in battle. He divides human types into two categories: rulers and harmonizers. They are distributed in all spheres of life. The ruler is the person who wields power in the state, the family, the design bureau, or production in order to savor it, to experience it, to enjoy it, to use it for his own good. The result is almost always the same--destruction and impoverishment. He exploits the environment and leads it to disaster, conflicts, wars, repressions, and ultimately degradation. But the harmonizer is a special person of a religious disposition. When he ends up on the throne or at the head of a family or in a garrison or the environment is entrusted to him, he enriches it, brings it to prosperity, even in war he preserves and minimizes losses. By nature this is the pastor, the tiller of the fields. This is Marcus Aurelius, this is Tsar Aleksey Mikhaylovich...these two types have figured very frequently in Russian history and they are noted in religious and philosophical thought. But now that we have experienced this period of obvious rulers for whom power is a goal in itself and its achievement can threaten the nation and the state with collapse, self-destruction, apparently the time has come for the other type of leaders. God forbid that this regime be replaced by another one headed by a general with a thick skull and the enormous fists of a paratrooper. In fact Russia is waiting for a harmonizer. And this does not mean that in the period of restoration, which will be severe and demand sacrifices, that this new leader will be soft, vapid, and blissful. No, he will be very firm, but he must embody that super-task of the harmonizer, the savior, the healer. How do you envision the typological features of the future leader? What qualities must he have? [Zorkin] It seems to me that he must combine several extremely important qualities. First, I agree with you, he must not come to power for its own sake. They say that such negative qualities can be registered on modern lie detectors. But I think the Russian political elite, when it was viable and led the country to greater heights, conducted that kind of testing of leaders. Just take the election of Mikhail Romanov. There is the opinion that he was a weak ruler. But in that stage, when Russia was fragmented, dispersed, when every local ruler was laying claim to higher power, who was needed? A unifier. He could not lay claim to very much, but had to listen to opinions, be able to get everyone to sit down at a roundtable, as we say today, and say: Let us decide--either we die or this is the first rule of behavior, this is the second, this is the third.... Figuratively speaking, it goes like this: Since we are all in the same boat, let us agree to row in the same direction, nobody has the right to stand up, to go wherever he wants to, or hit his partner on the head with the chess board because he has put him in checkmate. The modern leader must have a sense of what unites people, he must comprehend the ultimate task of the time. His second quality is the will and resolve to carry out this task. For instance, Andropov. He by nature seemed to be soft, in general he reminded one of a professor: He had such a calm look in his eye. That is the impression I got of him. And it seems to me that when he was in power decisions were made in this same intelligent manner. But he had an immense will. Third--a leader must be in tune with the people. People must understand that this person has taken on the burden of power not out of selfish motivations: He lives and makes decisions in the name of some higher goals. Why did Yeltsin come to power? He was perceived as one of our own. Why was he not perceived like Ryzhkov? I communicate with him--I assure you that he is an excellent person. But people did not know him well and after he raised the price of bread--quite insignificantly by today's standards--his enemies skillfully took advantage of this and turned him into an alien who wanted to multiply the people's unhappiness. And then there appeared a person who said: "People, I know your needs. I know that you are not driving Mercedes but Moskviches--I entered the Kremlin in a Moskvich. The majority of you ride buses, and I also ride with you. I know that you want peace, confidence in the future, and no waiting lines." The next extremely important quality is uniqueness. A leader without an idea is nothing. Therefore any elite strives to put forth a leader with his own image and ideas, or at least they create such an appearance for him. All this is because the calling of the leader is to take people forward. He must have professionalism, he must be able to anticipate and calculate his steps. If he has said that by autumn he will achieve such and such, he must do it. [Prokhanov] But then there is another quality that has been implied in all of your postulates. The leader is in tune not only with the times and the nation, but also with what we have become accustomed to calling the spheres. He must be fully in tune with Providence and understand that he was called at a tragic moment for his Motherland as a person who has been entrusted by fate to save the country from disaster. This sense of purpose, this absolute harmony with the historical and divine has made great Russian people real popular leaders. They were not simply politicians singled out by the elite, generated by civil wars and strife. They were spiritual personalities.... [Zorkin] I do not know whether they felt this themselves but they were definitely in tune with the people. The leader and the group of people around him virtually led everyone forward so that instead of depression there was hope, a general will for action. This heroic conduct has always been based on spirituality and morality. I am convinced that if base material interests rule the person, he is not capable of contributing to the development of society. A noble idea moves the leader. In this sense I agree: This could be called a sign from the heavens.
