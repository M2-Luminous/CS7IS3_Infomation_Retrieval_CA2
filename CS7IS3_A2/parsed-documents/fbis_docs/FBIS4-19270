Speaking after the meeting, Denktas said: [Begin Denktas recording] They are making an effort to establish why we are insisting on certain matters and why the Greek Cypriot side is refusing to agree to certain points. That is what we discussed. The newspapers published Glavkos Kliridhis's speech in the European Parliament. We have read his speech. You will see when you read it that it is neither related to the UN secretary general's package of confidence-building measures [CBM's] nor to the principle of the solution of the Cyprus problem between the two equal communities on the island. Kliridhis clearly said: The Cyprus problem is a question of occupation. The occupation must be removed. Those who have come from Turkey must leave. All the refugees must return to their homes. Europe must help Cyprus on those matters. The person who said all that purports to be holding talks with the Turkish Cypriot side on the CBM's package. We stressed all that and drew Mr. Lamb's attention to that state of affairs. We cannot accept the view that politicians make such statements. What Kliridhis said was not just a statement by a politician. What he emphasized was the continuation of a policy that has divided Cyprus into two parts ever since it was put into effect in December 1963. The Greek Cypriot side has persistently maintained the same leaning. Therefore, we are obliged to talk in a way that safeguards our rights. We will continue to clearly express our opinion on the proposals that are made to us. We will continue to do that in goodwill. Regarding the additions that have been made to the CBM's package, some of them can be acceptable if they are changed. There are those which cannot be accepted. We explained that as well. [end recording] A correspondent asked Denktas the following: [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, have the foreign officials adopted an understanding approach to our problems and anxieties? [Denktas] Diplomats are like people who play poker. Their faces and eyes will not reveal anything. They do not comment but listen to what you say and then leave. [end recording]
