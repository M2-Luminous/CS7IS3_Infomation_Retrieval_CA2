When facing the challenge of the market economy, can this principle still be maintained? This has become a question concerning the CPC leaders. History has repeatedly proved that as long as the armed forces are being effectively control, the whole country will be kept under good control. Therefore, the CPC has long made good preparations for this, and other people do not need to worry. The CPC has worked out a series of countermeasures to ensure that the armed forces will not be affected by the torrents of the market economy, and the purity of the armed forces will be conscientiously maintained. According sources from Zhongnanhai, the CPC authorities will soon adopt two important measures for the purpose of controlling the armed forces. One is to prohibit the armed forces from engaging in business activities, and the other is to substantially increase the military expenses this year in order to boost the morale of the troops. Both measures are serious matters. If they are not arranged and carried out carefully, they may not achieve the expected results and may end up with a fiasco. First, the armed forces have developed into a gigantic economic entity in recent years, and have become the third largest foreign exchange earner in China (including the export of armaments). Although a large part of such foreign exchange income was handed over to the central authorities, the armed forces still gained political credit for such contributions. However, the economic benefit was a strong magnet for military personnel, who are living in difficult conditions. In the previous years, the central authorities could not allocate substantial amounts of money to support the armed forces, and the military units were allowed to engage in profit-seeking business activities. The vested business interests of the armed forces have become a fait accompli, so the central authorities can no longer turn a blind eye to it. However, while engaging in business activities, the armed forces also found that its combat strength declined. Moreover, the central authorities decided to further reduce the size of the troops from some 3 million people to 2.5 million people (but the pace of disarmament will not be too quick). Thus, the combat strength of the armed forces will become more questionable. In addition, as the armed forced are involved in economic activities, there are increasing opportunities for their cooperation with local governments, and this may enable them to form a certain type of alliance against the central authorities. This will be very unfavorable to the central authorities. Therefore, the central leadership must do something to remove such hidden perils. Through consideration and after consulting major military leaders, the CPC central leadership decided to "again focus the efforts of the armed forces on national defense construction by adopting some orderly steps." To put it more plainly, that is to prohibit the armed forces from engaging in business activities. Recently, when talking about government work, Jiang Zemin, CPC Central Military Commission Chairman, and State Council Premier Li Peng announced this intention by saying that "the central leadership has decided to stop the production and business activities undertaken by the armed forces, and transfer all the enterprises run by military units to local civilian institutions." This decision will produce a major impact. Will the military units which are making handsome profits obediently give up their money-making means? What financial resources will be used to support the armed forces then? And will this change the relationship between the armed forces and the central authorities? It is learned that the central authorities will adopt three measures to solve these questions. First, personnel affairs related to enterprises currently run by the armed forces should be properly arranged so that they may officially be separated from the military establishment and the enterprises can be turned into independent legal persons. The enterprises originally run by the armed forces will be turned into state-owned enterprises run by demobilized soldiers as representatives of the legal person appointed by the state, and the state will protect their gains and interests. Second, the state will increase the military budget and ensure that the living conditions of military personnel will be improved. Jiang Zemin and Li Peng both said: "Military funds must be allocated to the armed forces, which should depend on the state's allocations. As the commodity economy is being developed in the whole country, people have improved their livelihood but the troops still live in rather difficult conditions. This may affect the work of the armed forces. Then what should be done? After the enterprises run by the armed forces are taken over by the state, the central authorities will increase the appropriations to the armed forces. As the armed forces are carrying out the mission of defending the motherland, funds must be allocated to them." Therefore, at the forthcoming Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, it is certain that the military budget will be directly and indirectly increased by a big margin. Last year, military expenditure increased by 14 percent over the previous year, and this marked the most prominent increase among all budget items. It is expected that this year, the military budget will be increased by at least 10 percent. The third measure is to convince military leaders (especially those at advanced ages) and solicit their endorsement and support. In the past, in addition to stressing military modernization, they always stressed the need to maintain the quality of the armed forces. In general, the old guard, being different from the younger officers, tend to accept the opinion of the central leadership on giving consideration to overall interests. It is learned that the two vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission, Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, have agreed in principle to shift the enterprises run by the armed forces to the state. However, they held that this matter must be handled prudently and properly. If the enterprises run by the armed forces are actually separated from the armed forces, this will promote the process of turning the armed forces into the hands of the state. However, in the eyes of the CPC, the most important purpose of this change is to ensure that the armed forces will have to rely on the state's financial support (and the state is also the party). Eventually, the armed forces will remain subject to the party's absolute control. This will prevent the armed forces from possessing their own financial sources and thus becoming independent from the party's control. That is, this will prevent a tendency towards independence in the armed forces.
