"Southeast Asia is one of the fastest-growing areas and is attracting ever-increasing attention from other parts of the world," Li said while meeting with a group of foreign bank executives here to attend the 29th Conference of Governors of Southeast Asian Central Banks (SEACEN). Li said Southeast Asian countries have become less reliant on markets outside the region while intraregional trade and investment has risen steadily since 1990. "I believe this trend will continue in the years ahead," he noted. In line with the trend, Li said, Taiwan has adjusted its overseas investment strategy and has encouraged entrepreneurs to increase investment in Southeast Asian nations. Li said he exchanged views on promoting bilateral economic cooperation and regional economic development with leaders from the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand during his February trip to those countries. "We'll continue to strive for closer economic ties with countries in the region," Li added. Those present at the meeting included Lord Kingsdown, former governor of the Bank of England, Dr. J.E. Esmael, executive director of the International Monetary Fund, and central bank governors from 10 SEACEN member states -- South Korea, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Nepal, Myanmar [Burma], Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the host Republic of China [ROC]. The SEACEN meeting opened Wednesday and will close Friday. A joint statement will be issued at the end of the meeting reaffirming member states' commitment to gradually liberalizing their financial markets and promoting regional economic and financial cooperation.
