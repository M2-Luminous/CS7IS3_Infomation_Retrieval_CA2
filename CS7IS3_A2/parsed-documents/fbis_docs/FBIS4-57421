A PRD delegation and a delegation from the Santo Domingo Accord lodged an appeal this morning in the predawn hours with the Central Electoral Board [JCE] requesting the vote count be stopped, no more bulletins be released, and no winners be declared in this election. The appeal to the JCE also demands a new vote tally sheet count. The Santo Domingo Accord is the name of the alliance that nominated Jose Francisco Pena Gomez for president and Fernando Alvarez Bogaert for vice president. The PRD says there were serious discrepancies in these elections ranging from switched voter lists to an illegal increase in the number of voting tables at some polling centers. The PRD also claims there are discrepancies between the numbers published in public bulletins and those on diskettes [preceding word in English] distributed to the parties. The JCE scheduled a meeting for this afternoon to evaluate the PRD's claims, particularly the alleged list irregularities and the results given. The last JCE bulletin shows Joaquin Balaguer ahead with 42.76 percent of the votes counted. Pena Gomez is in second place with 40.95 percent. These results are for 80 percent of the electoral tables throughout the country.
