At the same time, police patrol cars continually pass through the city. Although the cities are apparently calm, they are full of disorder. The roads between the cities are reported restless. Reports show that armed Baluchis attack automobiles carrying armed forces. In attacks that took place between 11 and 16 Bahman [31 January-5 February], a number of revolutionary guards were killed and wounded. Likewise, three police personnel were taken hostage by the Baluchis and there is not yet any information about what became of them. One of the attacks, during which tens of people were killed and wounded, took place on the Nikshahr-Iranshahr Road. The National Security Council, meeting in continuous session, issued a statement attributing the "revolts" in Zahedan to the work of "elements" who have "lost their interests during security operations by the Islamic Republic's security forces," and in this statement, in contradiction to previous statements, it called those "elements" "brigands and smugglers." According to a report from Radio Tehran, 'Ali Khamene'i, the leader of the Islamic Republic who is also commander in -chief of the armed forces, designated minister of the interior 'Ali Mohammad Basharati-Jahromi to take his place for three years in the police forces. In the relevant order, Khamene'i gave Basharati "full authority" to establish order and security in the country. On the other hand 'Ali Sham'khani, commander of the Islamic Republic's Naval Forces, went to Pakistan last Saturday. On this trip he will meet with various Pakistani officials. Political observers connect Sham'khani's trip with the ongoing disturbance and unrest in Baluchestan. Officials of the Islamic Republic believe that the Baluchi rebels get most of the weapons they use to fight the armed forces from Pakistan. It is worth noting that the Islamic regime's officials spoke of uprisings months ago and studied ways to fight it in the Supreme Council for National Security. Observers say that despite the government's willingness to fight the uprisings, because thinking has been done only from the technical and military standpoint, there are likely to be larger and greater uprisings in other Iranian cities. The same observers believe that if there is an uprising in Tehran, the police will have very little luck putting it down.
