FR940405-1-00011 FR940405-1-00004 FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION 12 CFR Part 304 RIN 3064&hyph;AB33 Form, Instructions, and Reports AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). ACTION: Proposed rescission of rule. SUMMARY: The FDIC is proposing to rescind section 304.6 of its regulations, which currently requires all insured banks, with the exception of insured bankers' banks, to give the FDIC prior notice of planned rapid growth as a result of any ``special funding plan or arrangement.'' For purposes of this requirement, such a funding plan is an effort to increase the assets of a bank through the solicitation and acceptance of fully insured deposits obtained from or through the mediation of brokers or affiliates (that is, insured brokered deposits); the solicitation of fully insured deposits outside a bank's normal trade area; or secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements. The proposed rescission would lessen the regulatory burden on banks which are currently required to comply as well with the FDIC's brokered deposit regulation and the prompt corrective action rule, both of which were designed in part to address the same risks resulting from rapid growth. The brokered deposit regulation was mandated by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) and amended to conform to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). The prompt corrective action rule was mandated by FDICIA. The rapid growth rule was not mandated by any statute, but was authorized by the FDIC's general regulatory powers. DATES: Comments must be received on or before May 5, 1994. . ADDRESSES: Send comments to Robert E. Feldman, Acting Executive Secretary, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20429. Comments may be hand-delivered to Room F&hyph;402, 1776 F Street, NW., Washington, DC, on business days between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. [FAX number: (202) 898&hyph;3838.] Comments may be inspected in the FDIC's Reading Room, room 7118, 550 17th Street, NW., between 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on business days. FAX number: (202) 898&hyph;3838. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William G. Hrindac, Examination Specialist, (202) 898&hyph;6892, Division of Supervision, FDIC, 550 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20429, or Adrienne George, Attorney, (202) 898&hyph;3859, Legal Division, FDIC, 550 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20429. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Although rapid growth is not necessarily an indicator of unsafe or unsound banking practices, and many banks have been able to manage rapid growth safely, rapid growth does present special risks to a bank (and to the FDIC's insurance fund). Because these risks warrant special monitoring, the FDIC adopted a rule requiring advance notice to the FDIC of planned rapid growth. That provision of the FDIC's regulations, 12 CFR 304.6, known as ``the rapid growth rule,'' states that an insured bank may not undertake any special funding plan or arrangement designed to increase its assets by more than 7.5 percent during any consecutive three-month period without first notifying the appropriate FDIC regional director for supervision in writing at least 30 days before the implementation of the special funding plan or arrangement. A special funding plan or arrangement is defined as any effort to increase the assets of a bank through (1) the solicitation and acceptance of fully insured deposits obtained from or through the mediation of brokers or affiliates (that is, insured brokered deposits), (2) the solicitation of fully insured deposits outside a bank's normal trade area (depending upon the circumstances, these may be insured brokered deposits) or (3) secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements.
