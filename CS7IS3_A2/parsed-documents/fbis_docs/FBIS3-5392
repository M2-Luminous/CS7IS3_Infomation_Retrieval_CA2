It is in such times that the ability of government officials, who support the nation, to manage a crisis matters greatly. Yet the question is whether Japanese officials have such an ability. Grave Blunder in Economic Measures The Japanese economy is about to start a countdown toward its destruction. Three years have passed since the "Great Heisei Recession" started early in 1991 following the collapse of the "bubble economy". The current slump is certain to be the worst and the longest recession since the war, lasting longer than the 36-month recession of the second oil shock. The causes of recessions up to the second oil crisis were external. It was as though business, in its declining phase in the cycle, caught an extremely bad cold which developed into pneumonia. In contrast, the current "Great Heisei Recession" occurred because the Japanese economy had become fat through the bubble economy. It is, so to speak, suffering from adult diseases. Adult diseases do not worsen suddenly if an accurate diagnosis is made and proper treatment is given in the early stages. If one's constitution is improved carefully, the diseases are not so frightening. Nevertheless, the authorities' diagnosis of the state of the economy was definitely wrong, and the cure was always one step behind. As a result, financial institutions, the heart of the Japanese economy, have suffered arteriosclerosis because of their bad loans which are now said to amount to 100 trillion yen, and the sharp fall in stocks is causing cardiac infarction. Now, it has come to the point that an economic panic could happen any time. The Japanese economy now requires crisis management in the intensive care unit. The name Masaru Yoshitomi, former director general of the Economic Planning Agency's [EPA] Coordination Bureau, has to be pointed out, though this cannot mend the matter now, as the person responsible for further deteriorating the situation by making a definitely wrong diagnosis and choosing wrong measures to deal with the problem. Yoshitomi should be held highly responsible, because he was not just a mere economist at that time but the director general of the EPA's Coordination Bureau, an important post for coordinating economic measures and foreign economic policies within the government. While I am sorry for Yoshitomi, his judgment is hopeless because, when the fall of the economy was evident to everybody in the spring of 1992, he was still saying publicly, "Where do you see a recession?" citing the tight labor market. Corporations and financial institutions' latent profits were lost in 1990 due to the steep fall of stocks when careless land loans became bad loans one after another as a result of a sudden attempt to stop the bubble economy by Bank of Japan [BOJ] Governor Yasushi Mieno. Then in 1991, scandals involving securities and financial institutions came to light successively, withering business sentiments at once. Such a trend in the overall economy must have been totally invisible to Yoshitomi. In May 1992 when Yoshitomi was repeatedly saying, "How can you say that we are in a recession when the unemployment rate is slightly higher than 2 percent and the ratio of job openings to job seekers is higher than 1:00?," the Business Sentiment Index of Principal Enterprises in the BOJ's Tankan [Short-term Business Survey of Enterprises] was 124. The index is an index of companies that said business is "bad" subtracted from those who said it is "good." The figure 124 is comparable to the number at the worst period when the recession brought on by the yen's appreciation in the first half of 1987 was causing a stir in society. In spite of such an index, Yoshitomi was attempting to somehow produce the longest economic growth, exceeding the 57 months of the "Izanagi Boom," during his term in office. Thus, making an objective diagnosis was downright impossible for Yoshitomi. Takao Akaba, former vice minister of the EPA, once said in an interview with this writer, "The economy has a long-term big wave and a short-term wave. This wave was a big one in the economy's expansion phase. So the wave was still at a high level even after the economy peaked and was on the downturn. That explains why the shortage of labor looked serious and people were confused in thinking that the economy was still expanding." A crisis occurred immediately after Yoshitomi insisted, "the economy is still expanding though its speed has slowed." From mid to late July 1992, the Nikkei average declined more than 2,000 yen in ten days, and dipped below the 15,000 yen level on 11 August. Although some people think Germany's interest rate hike in July triggered the situation, the definite statement of Mamoru Ozaki, who took office as vice minister of the Ministry of Finance [MOF] in July, that "deficit-covering bonds will not be issued" had an effect. The market, which had been expecting the government's pump-priming measures, was disappointed and reacted negatively. When the Nikkei average falls below the 15,000 yen level, financial institutions and business corporations holding high-priced stocks will have to face enormous losses. Alarmed by the situation, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa strongly directed the MOF and the BOJ, which had been saying that the economy was all right, to work out measures to maintain stock prices and to stimulate the economy. But, Miyazawa, who advocated a positive financial policy, and the MOF officials, who put the rebuilding of the government's finances above anything else, were not getting along well with each other. Just before settling on the "economic stimulus package" in August 1992, Ozaki, who had just become vice minister, is said to have telephoned a certain out-of-office economist who is close to Miyazawa to ask him to convey his message to the prime minister. A crisis can never be handled when the MOF vice minister cannot see the prime minister in person, and has to ask an economist who is not in the government to relay his "real intention" to the prime minister. Anyway, at this time, since the government announced its "monetary policy for the moment", business operators were relieved and the market stabilized again. However, this "tentative policy" was just postponing solving the issue by allowing, so to speak, "leaving out" losses on accounts in which the loss of stocks did not have to be redeemed in the September midterm earnings report, but could be postponed until the settlement of accounts in March 1993. Thus gaining time, the government tried to bring the economy back with the largest ever "pump-priming package," worth 10.7 trillion yen. Although the amount of the package was big, the "fresh water" contributing immediately to a rise in the economy was not more than 3 trillion yen. Still, these two policies were effective temporarily, and the Nikkei average recovered to the 20,000 level, avoiding a crisis. However, since the diagnosis was fundamentally wrong, the policies could only work as first aid. If the economy is young, possessing potential for growth, it can be revived vigorously by giving it a nutrient like public works, even if the economy weakens temporarily due to overproduction. But for the current Japanese economy, which suffers from adult diseases developed by gaining fat, providing a nutrient cannot bring back its health. After all, the economy deteriorated further instead of getting better, and the MOF only maintained stock prices from beginning to end by carrying out the so-called PKO (Price Keeping Operation). That is, the MOF managed to keep stock prices by buying stocks, using public funds such as postal insurance and savings, while pressuring life and nonlife insurance companies not to sell their stocks. Because of that, the market became a completely managed market in which dynamic trading was confined, and the market itself was dead. Speaking of public funds, not much could be expected based on the amount of funds for investment. Also, it was obvious that the artificial stock prices were maintained by controlling selling. Also, everyone knew that once the underpinnings were removed, stock prices would go down. It is better not to carry out such a measure if the tricks of the authorities are so clear. At that time, MOF senior officials Ozaki; Nobuyuki Teramura, director general of Banking Bureau; and Tadashi Ogawa, director general of Securities Bureau, concentrated only on making the numbers consistent through the PKO because they were afraid the fall of stock prices would cause the loss of nominal latent profits, and lead to the failure of financial institutions. But, they were also trying to expand their colonies using the taxpayers' money. The best example is that the MOF sent former Banking Bureau Director General Masateru Yoshida with a dowry to the almost failed Hyogo Bank to be its president . The bud for rebirth can only be seen after what has to be removed is removed. Nevertheless, since the MOF officials concealed the actual condition with a stopgap measure, suspicion and the fear of recession prevailed all the more, shrinking consumption. In that respect, it cannot be helped if they were criticized for amplifying the crisis. At any rate, they had continued to deceive the market, and Ozaki retired in July 1993. Also, Ogawa was transfered from being director general of the Securities Bureau to chief of Tax Bureau. Teramura was left to continue to carry out the makeshift measures to save the banks. Ozaki and Ogawa's successors, MOF Vice Minister Jiro Saito, and Securities Bureau Director General Shohei Hidaka seemed to continue the stopgap measures. The listing of JR Eastern Japan stock on 26 October 1993 is illustrative. The authorities' intention must have been to direct the desire of the general public, which is naive about stocks, to the share market by listing the well-known JR Eastern Japan stock, and thus raise stock prices. In fact, the market must have been moving according to their scenario until the initial transaction price of JR Eastern Japan was pushed up to 600,000 yen, by setting the initial offering price at 380,000 yen and creating an atmosphere that made the stock scarce. But, individual investors, who had learned distrust from the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. stock case, did not buy. As a result, only sophisticated semiprofessionals, in expectation of a high price just after the listing, bought JR Eastern Japan shares for short-term profitmaking. Because of that, once the stock reached a high price, the sell orders flooded in the next day, and JR Eastern Japan stocks fell in reaction. Since the fast sell orders for the JR Eastern Japan had swamped the market, the computer broke down and the trading of the stocks was suspended. Most investors were not able to sell their JR Eastern Japan stocks even though they wanted to, and had to hold the falling shares. In addition to the steep fall of JR Eastern Japan stock, other stocks declined substantially also. This is because the semiprofessional investors bought the shares of JR Eastern Japan by selling their holding stocks, not using new funds. Under circumstances in which the daily trading volume continues to be at the 100 million level, one tenth of the volume at the time of the bubble economy, if JR Eastern Japan stock absorbs 1 trillion yen from the market, it will immediately be the start of a steep decline. This is like forcing a patient to run who is suffering from cardiac infarction by giving an injection of a stimulant. November's trading started to fall. The Nikkei average dropped nearly 3,000 yen in a month, and on 29 November it temporarily fell below 16,000. This sudden fall is attributed mainly to the attempt of financial institutions suffering from the recession to make a profit by selling stocks while, in a way, strangling themselves. When the average falls below 16,000, there will be some banks which cannot meet the BIS [Bank for International Settlement] rule. In that case, the average will decline to 12,000 at once, because investors will sell their stocks at a loss before prices hit bottom. Then, the latent profits of city banks will be lost, and the Japanese economy will have heart failure, leading to a series of large-scale bankruptcies. While this was a crucial moment for crisis management, there was still no sign that an economic stimulus package has materialized. Do bureaucrats consider the PKO, control of selling, and the raising of stock prices by listing a new stock, which are obvious stopgap measures, to be crisis management? The Japanese economy will be in serious trouble unless government officials work on crisis management seriously by cutting out the affected parts and let the pus out, and sacrifice oneself to carry out deregulation. The economy has been Japanese officials' strongest area, but MOF officials, who are supposed to be the most brilliant, are not able to cope with the structural change at all. Still, the situation is more serious. In addition to economic problems, crisis management related to the nation's security needs more attention, and this is where the bureaucrats' weakest point is revealed. Farce of Unorchestrated Ministries The issues of North Korea's nuclear and economic sanctions have now become critical. North Korea continues to reject inspection of its facilities, suspected of developing nuclear arms. Having lost any further means, Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, spoke at the UN General Assembly on 1 November 1993 to urge North Korea to accept IAEA inspections. The assembly adopted a resolution, demanding the inspection of North Korea's nuclear sites by an overwhelming majority. On 3 November, immediately following the UN resolution, then U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin, during his visit to Japan, said, "Economic sanctions are an option if diplomatic means fail." In other words, taking the issue to the Security Council and adopting a resolution to impose sanctions against North Korea is the only alternative left for the IAEA if the UN resolution is ignored by North Korea. Of course, it depends on the result of the planned third round of the bilateral talks between the United States and North Korea. What will happen if economic sanctions are imposed on North Korea? "It is a serious matter. If economic sanctions are adopted by the United Nations, North Korea will take it as a declaration of war as it has warned repeatedly. Since that country faithfully carries out what it says, we must expect the worst-case scenario if economic sanctions are imposed." (Satoshi Morimoto, senior researcher, Nomura Research Institute). Morimoto is a specialist who, as former chief of Security Policy Section in the Foreign Ministry's Information Analysis, Research and Planning Bureau, supervised "the second operation room" which specialized in gathering and analyzing military information at the time of the Gulf war. "If the worst happens, the effect will be far bigger than that of the Gulf war. A large number of displaced persons may come to Japan, and missiles may come flying at Japan. In that case, local self-governing bodies on the coast of the Sea of Japan should also prepare for an emergency. At any rate, the worst case has to be expected and every possible precaution has to be taken. Imposing economic sanctions on North Korea requires much preparedness," Morimoto said. A first-rate crisis management system is needed indeed. The imposition of sanctions on North Korea inevitably involves the danger of leading to war. However, what happens if Japan, fearing the possibility of war, objects to economic sanctions when the issue is referred to the Security Council? Japan will be criticized by the international community as the country that supports North Korea's development of nuclear weapons. Already, some in the United States are displeased with the large flow of people, goods, and money going from Japan to North Korea, and even say that "Japan's money and goods are enabling the North's development of nuclear arms". Conveying Information to the Prime Minister: A Secret Strife As a matter of fact, the United States unofficially asked Tokyo, "to discuss what kind of contribution is possible for Japan when economic sanctions are imposed" in the fall of 1992. But there is no sign that the Miyazawa administration took concrete actions afterward. Then early in 1993 the issue of "special inspection" of the nuclear waste and storage facilities near Yongbyon came to a deadlock, and in February the IAEA referred the matter to the Security Council. North Korea, in response, stiffened its attitude and threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). On 12 March, North Korea actually announced its pullout from the NPT. The withdrawal automatically takes effect three months after the announcement. Once North Korea leaves the NPT, legal grounds to demand that it accept nuclear inspections will be lost, and use of force will be the only means left to stop its development of nuclear arms. This means imposing economic sanctions, and if this does not work, then military action will be taken. On 29 May when the deadline for North Korea's withdrawal from the treaty was near, North Korea test-fired a missile toward Japan. Also, it restricted the entry of foreigners and Koreans living in Japan, and prepared troops for action, showing an attitude of not budging an inch. Since an emergency had occurred in the targeting of Japan, a crisis management system should have been announced immediately as a matter of course. However, the government offices concerned did not even hold a liaison conference, much less manage a crisis. Each ministry and agency did not try to do anything to cope with the situation and kept their information to themselves. Also, the Miyazawa administration, presiding over such bureaucrats, did nothing either. Even worse, they did not try to inform the public, while they knew what was going on. Needless to say, in a democracy, government cannot make any important decision without gaining a national consensus. To win a consensus among the people, the right information has to be provided first. If a crisis had arisen on the Korean peninsula in late May 1993 while the public had not been informed about it, the government would have been unable to come up with a single measure to handle the situation, and Japan would have fallen into great confusion. North Korea's test-launch of a missile was made public when Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishihara "leaked the news at his own discretion" on 11 June, two weeks after the incident. This was too late. A situation should not exist in which the people, as the sovereign, are informed of nothing while Japan's security is threatened by a crisis. If the bureaucrats had possessed such a common-sense recognition, each ministry should have brought in its information to the Cabinet Security Affairs Office, discussed measures, and informed the people that a crisis was approaching, even if Prime Minister Miyazawa did not make any decision, being too cautious. However it was not until late October, five months after the missile incident, that the "Joint Council for Information Liaison and Coordination" was formed, in which the director general level officials from each ministry brought in and discussed their information regarding the North Korean nuclear issue. Only after that did officials in charge from the MOF, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], the Ministry of Transportation [MOT], as others visit a specialist to learn about North Korean issues. Moreover, this "council" is not at all a place to discuss a scenario for managing a crisis. Legally, Japan's crisis management is to be handled by the Security Council of Japan in the cabinet. However, the Security Council did not meet during the Gulf war to discuss measures to deal with the situation, though it was onvened to discuss the mid-term defense program. The Security Council consists of the prime minister as chairman, the ministers of foreign affairs and of finance, the chief cabinet secretary, the chairman of the National Public Safety Commission, and the directors general of the Defense Agency and the EPA. Because the council has become a ritualistic conference to give authority to a conclusion reached in advance by ministries doing the groundwork, it cannot deal with an emergency situation. Under this Security Council is the Cabinet Security Affairs Office which is for coordinating the ministries' administrative work related to national defense. Under this system, this office is responsible for managing a crisis so the cabinet can cope with an emergency situation. Naturally, the previously mentioned "Joint Council for Information Liaison and Coordination" should also be chaired by the chief of the Cabinet Security Affairs Office to have ministries submit their top secrets, and evaluate and analyze them. Then, the results should be reported to the chief cabinet secretary. Nevertheless, the office is said to have no such ability nor the power to do so. "There are no uniformed personnel, who are military specialists, in the office. So a correct analysis of the situation cannot be expected. Moreover, all the members of the office including the chief and the councilors, are on loan from other ministries, so the views of the central government office cannot be coordinated." (Sachio Genkawa, former Ground Self-Defense Forces Eastern District Commanding General). Thus the "Joint Council for Information Liaison and Coordination," which should discuss a scenario for crisis management, has become a place for merely exchanging information. Since the evils of a vertically divided administration have clearly come to the surface, the council has become a place for learning about other ministries' information while protecting one's own ministry's top secrets. The ministries' guarding of information to protect their own interests is quite astonishing. The biggest trouble for the nation's security is that there are secret strifes in the stages of conveying information to the prime minister. When the ministries want to tell the prime minister something, it has to be relayed through the prime minister's private secretaries. The judgment of those secretaries is very important because they manage the prime minister's heavy schedule, and decide the priority of the information to be conveyed. Among the five private secretaries, one of them is the longtime secretary of a politician who became the prime minister, and the remaining four are career officials sent from the Foreign Ministry [MOFA], the MOF, the MITI, and the Police Agency, respectively. Those who are appointed private secretaries are all considered to be future vice ministers. These four secretaries are responsible for communicating with the prime minister for other ministries besides their own. For example, a private secretary sent from the Police Agency will also cover the Ministries of Home Affairs, Health and Welfare, and the Defense Agency. All ministries and agencies are covered by the four secretaries. So, it is relatively easier for the MOFA, the Police Agency, the MOF, and the MITI to keep their secrets since they can convey information through their own secretaries. In contrast, a secret of the Defense Agency, even if it is a real top secret, will be known by the Police Agency before it is conveyed to the prime minister. It is all right when the source of information to be conveyed is clearly identifiable as the Defense Agency, but if it is not so, then the Defense Agency will try to relay the information to the prime minister without going through the secretary from the Police Agency. For example, the Defense Agency will use a director general transferred to its Agency from the MOF to influence the secretary from the MOF. Then the secretary from the Police Agency, out of suspicion and fear, will try to obstruct the Defense Agency's communications with the prime minister.... Although this is about what could happen -- and it does not mean that it is always the case -- it is problematic because the above situation is more likely to occur as the importance of the information increases. In the Defense Agency, there are also career officials on loan from the MOFA, the MOF, and the Police Agency. Yet the true top secrets are said to be conveyed to the prime minister through an official from the Defense Agency in the Cabinet Information Research Office which is directly connected to the chief cabinet secretary so that the secrets will never be known by officials from other ministries. The situation is far from discussing a crisis management measure by bureaucrats bringing in information. To avoid such secret strifes, the function of the cabinet in integrating the ministries has to be strengthened. In fact, there was an attempt to strengthen the cabinet so that a fair crisis management system could be implemented. In July 1984, the Nakasone cabinet, in response to the second provisional committee on administrative reform's report, integrated the Administrative Management Agency with parts of the Prime Minister's Office to form the Management and Coordination Agency. At that time, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masaharu Gotoda decided to strengthen the cabinet's comprehensive coordination function, since they were worried that crisis management was impossible under the vertically divided administrative organization. The late Ichiro Nakanishi, a member of the House of Councilors, was appointed as minister without portfolio in charge of crisis management, and the Crisis Management Measures Office was established under him in which a bold plan to strengthen the functions of the Cabinet Information Research Office was drafted. "Information from all ministries will be coordinated by the Cabinet Information Research Office..." Nevertheless, the plan was crushed in an instant by opposition from all ministries, which were alarmed over the expanding power of the Cabinet Secretariat. What can be said when the crisis management system needed for protecting the nation was killed due to the ministries' own interests? Regarding the imposition of economic sanctions on North Korea, the MOFA said, "Saying something about it will stir up the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, so we cannot even say whether we are discussing a measure or not." The Police Agency also said, "Nothing can be said. If I say something, that disqualifies me as the person in charge of crisis management." Although both ministries seem to have some kind of measures, the MOFA, the MOF, the Police Agency, the Defense Agency, the MITI, and the MOT are not cooperating, and they do not seem to be capable of implementing a comprehensive crisis management system at this point. Crisis management is for protecting the nation. It is not something for ministries to fight over based on their own interests.
