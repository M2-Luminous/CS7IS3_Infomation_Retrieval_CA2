Zhirinovkisy, State Duma deputy and leader of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], who was to go to Yugoslavia, held a news conference in Moscow today. [Correspondent Anna Prokhorova] Journalists were interested most of all in Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's attitude to the fact that the procurator general has instituted criminal proceedings according to clause 71 of the Russian criminal code, that is, war propaganda. [Zhirinovskiy] I have been telling you for an hour -- no violence, not a single shot, and the same is true for all my speeches. I have already said that if there are people with sick minds who claim that my speeches or books contain some kind of call for war, they should be examined by a psychiatrist. [Prokhorova] Asked whether the LDPR was set up with money received from the Communist Party or the KGB, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said that greedy communists did not give him money and.... [Zhirinovskiy] If the State Security Committee had helped me, I would not be sitting here now but in the Kremlin. This was their downfall precisely -- they did not admit people like myself while they themselves withered away, went into decay, and the country and the economy collapsed together with them. [Prokhorova] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said that his party favors stopping aid to any regions outside Russia, immediately stopping conversion, and hitting at crime. The LDP is prepared to take part in forming the government but.... [Zhirinovskiy] I would like very much if Kozyrev, Chubays, Shokhin, and Fedorov would leave the government. They are in the process of leaving it. I think, they all will have left by May. But those who will replace them will not be able to extricate Russia from the crisis, either. We ourselves will form the government in autumn and normal positive development in the country will start. [Prokhorova] On 28 January Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will fly to Belgrade. He is visiting Serbia in order to try and help his blood brothers.
