Industrial output hit 17.3 per cent in May the State Statistics Bureau announced yesterday. The growth in production is due to the easing of credit controls by the government, which in turn has led to a rise in capital investment, said the bureau's economists. And, Xinhua News Agency quoted an official from the State Economic and Trade Commission as saying that the GDP is expected to grow by about 12 per cent in the first half of this year, making it easier for the country to achieve the 9-10 GDP per cent growth in 1994. [sentence as published] The fixed assets invested by work units hit 67.6 billion yuan ($7.8 billion) in May, up nearly 28 per cent from the same month last year, the statistics bureau reported. During the first five months of this year, State units invested 204.4 billion yuan ($23.5 billion) in the country's fixed assets sector, representing a rise of 34.2 percent over the same period a year ago the bureau said. Of this, money used for construction accounted for 114.1 billion yuan ($13.1 billion), up 35.1 percent over the same period last year. Inflation also continued its double-digit growth this year, the bureau said. In May, the cost of living index in the country was 21.3 per cent, higher than the same time of last year. But this was 0.4 per cent lower than the growth of 21.7 per cent reported a month earlier. The bureau's economists said living costs have been persistently high in the country's big cities, partly because of random price hikes of food and catering services. The inflation in the country's 35 large and medium cities saw a growth of 23.2 per cent in April. And in May, the prices continued to grow at the same level. Government departments should maintain strict control over the prices in a bid to meet this year's inflation target of 10 per cent nationwide and 15 percent in major cities, as designated by the central government, said the economists. They noted that efforts to increase bank savings and issuing treasury bonds are helping to curb inflation. Banks and credit companies saw their individual and institutional savings increase by 113.4 billion yuan ($13 billion) last month. The figure was 79.4 billion yuan ($9.1 billion) higher than the same period last year, the bureau said. And by the end of May, the State had sold more than 68.1 billion yuan ($7.8billion) worth of treasury bonds. It included the sale of two-year bonds valued at 24.8 billion yuan ($2.8 billion), more than meeting the planned target, the bureau said. A growth of bank savings and the brisk sale of State treasury bonds lead to a 33.7 percent growth in State revenue in May. The success of financial reforms also helped to stimulate industrial growth in the already buoyant domestic market. In May, the country's retail sales totalled 121.4 billion yuan ($14 billion), up 6.1 percent over the same period of last year.
