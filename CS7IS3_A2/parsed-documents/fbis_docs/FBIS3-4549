The officials said Hosokawa told a high-level meeting of the government and ruling coalition parties it is too late for Japan to work out such measures by the end of March. Hosokawa told the session U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo March 9 while Washington will decide on March 17 whether to impose sanctions against Japan over a mobile telephone issue, the officials said. Hosokawa predicted that U.S. President Bill Clinton will almost certainly reinstate Super 301, which allows Washington to impose sanctions against countries with unfair trade practices, ahead of off-year elections in November, they said. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said Japan will bring the case to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if the United States invokes Super 301.
