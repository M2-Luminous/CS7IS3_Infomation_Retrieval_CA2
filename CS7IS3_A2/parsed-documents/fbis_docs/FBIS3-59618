The sewers spill out onto the land, the water is full of heavy metals and hydrocarbons, etc. Heavy rainfall can multiply by up to 10 times the rate of pollution recorded during periods of dry weather. Water treatment stations are not capable of handling pollution exceeding three or four times that for dry weather conditions and do not perform their regulating role. The MUST project, launched by the Corporation for the Treatment and Economic Development of Water [OTV], a subsidiary of the Compagnie Generale des Eaux [CGE], proposes checking the overflow of waste water after periods of heavy rainfall. The European scientific research program, EUREKA [European Research Coordination Agency], found the scheme attractive enough to award it its European label last June. The Must technology will be implemented progressively over the next four years. Of the 96.6 million French francs [Fr] it will cost, France will contribute Fr32 million, Fr10 million of which will come from the Ministries of Industry, Post and Telecommunications, and Foreign Trade. The project, which replies to a European directive of May 1991, combines 10 industrial partners from four Community countries. In addition to OTV from France, project leaders include the Danish pollution removal systems engineers I. Kruger, the Finnish chemical reagent producers Kemira Kemwater, and the British modeling researcher Wallingford Software. OTV, the European leader in the design and production of water treatment plants, is the prime contractor, assisted in France by other CGE subsidiaries: the Anjou Research economic interest grouping -- which centralizes the group's research work -- and Cochery-Bourdin-Chausse, specializing in road infrastructures. Precise Statistics The project corresponds to a market with local communities estimated to be worth several hundreds of billions of francs over the next 20 years, a large share of which should return to the Compagnie Generale des Eaux. On the practical side of things, the project will propose "reservoir highways" underneath roads to collect rain water, new physical-chemical settling techniques for treatment plants, a system for storing the most polluted water before treatment, treatment plant biofilters that are better suited to respond to large fluctuations in flow, sensors to inform the plant of the level of pollution in the water that will be arriving, etc. Computerized Rain The project also envisages carrying out a whole series of statistical studies that will simplify the adaptation of water treatment equipment. Patrick Binot, OTV's deputy technical director and head of development, explains: "For a given period, a rainfall curve is run through a computer model to determine the amount of polluting substances released in an average year by a given network and treatment plant, which can thus be minimized." This gives a whole armory with which to face up to any rain shower.
