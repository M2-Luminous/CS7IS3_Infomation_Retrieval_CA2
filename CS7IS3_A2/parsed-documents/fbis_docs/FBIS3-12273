[passage omitted] A member of the PLO Executive Committee, Jamal al-Surani called for the PLO to break off negotiations with Israel and for Arabs to unite against Israeli violence, the Egyptian news agency MENA reported. The United Arab Emirates said the mosque killings demonstrated the "complicity" of the Israeli government. "This savage killing, carried out under the eyes of the Israeli occupation forces, demonstrates the complicity of the Israeli government," the UAE news agency WAM quoted an official spokesman as saying. The spokesman called on the UN and states sponsoring the peace process to take "firm and concrete measures to protect the Palestinians". He called for the "settlers to be disarmed, Jewish settlements in the occupied territories to be dismantled so as to avoid a repeat of such killings". Qatar called on Israel to carry out an official and "public" investigation into the massacre. In London, Israeli deputy foreign minister Yosi Beilin said the mosque shooting was "the most terrible thing that has happened to us in many years, but we hope it will not be a reason or pretext to put an end to the (peace) process." He added: "What we have to do is to accelerate the process.... We hope the Palestinians will share with us this view despite this horrible event." In Amman, the Jordanian branch of the Moslem Brotherhood fundamentalist organisation urged the Arabs to "pull out of the peace negotiations" with Israel. The Moslem Brotherhood called on the "PLO leadership, the Arab countries, and in particular Jordan to withdraw from the negotiations," and appealed to the PLO "to return to the armed struggle." Jordan has called for three days of national mourning starting on Saturday for those killed in Hebron. Leaders of Christian communities in Jordan, quoted by PETRA NEWS AGENCY, also "firmly condemned" the killing and called for UN protection for the Palestinians. The leader of Egypt's Coptic Christians Patriarch Shanudah III likewise condemned the killing and urged Christians to consult the Moslems before making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to show solidarity with the Palestinians. The Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS has put all its fighters "on a maximum state of alert" and called on them "to retaliate as hard as possible to avenge the slaughter in Hebron." [passage omitted] Iran, which opposes the peace talks and backs Islamic militant groups, declared three days of mourning. A group formed to oppose the autonomy accord, Black September 13, vowed to "commit a series of attacks against Jewish institutions inside and outside the occupied territories" until the collapse of the self-rule deal.
