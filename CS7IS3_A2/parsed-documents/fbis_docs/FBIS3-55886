The compromise set the figure at 35. The opposition proposed 50, while reformers insisted on 20. Lawmaker Anatoliy Lukyanov, former Soviet parliament speaker, explained that the State Duma will consist of groups and factions which will enjoy equal rights. The minimum number of members for factions will be 14. This is the number of seats enjoyed by the Democratic Party of Russia which was the last among eight election blocs to overcome the five per cent hurdle in the December elections. Another compromise was reached on the issue of the interim chairman. Several lawmakers called to replace Georgiy Lukava from the party of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who they said is inexperienced in the job. Now the session will be chaired by three oldest deputies in turn for two hours each -- Vladimir Bokov, Sergey Kovalev and Georgiy Lukava. The Duma also elected Sergey Stankevich, the sacked presidential aide, to head the interim secretariat consisting of 20 people. Igor Bratishchev was elected head of the vote-counting commission while Grigoriy Bondarev became the chairman of the interim commission for procedural rules. The interim secretariat will include five commissions -- for registration of deputies' associations, for organisation of the Duma sessions, for registration of deputies' proposals, for public relations, for work with proposals on Duma's schedule.
