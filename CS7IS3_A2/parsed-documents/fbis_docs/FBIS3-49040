Good evening. [Silajdzic] Good evening. [Oberhauser] Mr. Silajdzic, there is probably no sensible person who understands this war in your country, which has, as we have heard, claimed 140,000 lives and has brought incredible suffering, above all to the civilian population. Do you understand it? [Silajdzic] Yes, absolutely. It is the result of the expansionist policy by the Belgrade government and the passivity of the international community. You have just seen [in a previous report] the scenes in Sarajevo. This has been going on for two years in Sarajevo, but also in other towns, such as Vukovar, where it started. The international community has not only done nothing, but has prohibited our defending ourselves. With that the international community has condemned Bosnia to death. I think this has to come to an end. There are only two solutions: Either the international community intervenes -- this time on our side and not on the side of the aggressor, because we have an embargo on military equipment -- or it will permit us to defend ourselves. [Oberhauser] Mr. Prime Minister, I do not want to -- and I cannot do it, anyway -- play arbiter here, but do you not make things a bit too easy for yourself? Even though this embargo exists, your soldiers are advancing and are involved in the fighting pretty heavily. [Silajdzic] We have light military equipment and the things that we have assembled ourselves. It is a shame for Europe that we are forced to fight against hundreds of tanks with weapons that we have made ourselves. We are advancing because we are defending our very lives. This is a question of life or death for us. [Oberhauser] This intervention from outside that you have just mentioned -- is this the only possibility to put an end to the war? [Silajdzic] The international community must respect its own resolutions and the basic principles of the civilized world. According to these, it must either intervene or permit us to defend ourselves. Our hands are tied. If no diplomatic solution can be found, only these two solutions are left. [Oberhauser] If this is true, Mr. Prime Minister, what is then the point of negotiations, such as the ones that are currently being held in Vienna? I do not even know how many have already been held. [Silajdzic] These are talks between Bosnia and Croatia, between the Bosnians and the Croats. They are currently in conflict, but they are in conflict because the international community has not stopped the aggression against Bosnia. This is one result of the aggression. [Oberhauser] What do you expect of the Vienna talks? What can the results be? [Silajdzic] Today we talked about humanitarian issues; we have already made some progress in this field. Today we also discussed the status of the town of Mostar, and I can tell you with joy that we have come to an agreement, that the Croatian side is also supporting the project of giving Mostar to the inhabitants of Mostar. This means that all those who have been driven away from Mostar may return to Mostar. This means that this is a victory of civilization over barbarism. Those who destroyed the Old Bridge do not belong there. Unfortunately, many will not return because they are dead. The least we can do as a debt to our civilization is to bring the people in this town back to their houses. [Oberhauser] No matter how much we discuss tactical issues here, I do not assume that we would make any progress in this respect. Let us talk a bit about the people in your country. You have talked about humanitarian aid. In the West, we have heard that hundreds of thousands are threatened with death this winter, because they will starve or freeze. Is there a possibility to help these people? What is the situation? [Silajdzic] There are possibilities. In Geneva we have agreed that humanitarian goods may pass. The UN forces have also been given the mandate to fight against those who stop these convoys. This mandate is not being exercised. Therefore, the convoys do not get through or they arrive too late. The entire problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina is the attempt to stop the aggression with words. [Oberhauser] Does that mean that the UN soldiers in your country do not fulfill their task? Do you mean that? [Silajdzic] I think they have not been given any orders at all. [Oberhauser] Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for being our guest. I hope that, despite the hopelessness that is conveyed by your words, at some time in the future it will be possible to put an end to this madness. Shortly before we started our talk, I received a press agency report saying that French Defense Minister Leotard today came out in favor of U.S. intervention in the Balkans. He wants to present this wish at the NATO summit in Brussels next week. Would you welcome that? [Silajdzic] It means that Europe's conscience is not completely dead. [Oberhauser] Once again, thank you and I hope that your people will soon have the situation that they desire. Thank you.
