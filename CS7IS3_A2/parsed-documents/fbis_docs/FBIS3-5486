In a meeting with officials of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), representatives of the Japan Trade Union Confederation (Rengo) suggested that the proposed agency should not include retired bureaucrats, so as to remain independent from the government. The idea was put forward by the advisory group for economic structural reform, headed by Keidanren Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa, when the government advisory body unveiled a package of measures to ease state regulations and boost the Japanese economy late last year. The Keidanren officials supported the Rengo suggestion and said the federation will convey the request to Koshiro Ishida, director general of the Management and Coordination Agency, in late March. The bilateral meeting also dealt with tensions in the trade ties between Japan and the United States, and the domestic economy.
