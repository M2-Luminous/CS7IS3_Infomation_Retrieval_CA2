Yi used to belong to the Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau within the Korean People's Armed Forces General Staff (defense ministry). Explaining recent military and social affairs in North Korea, he said: "Money has begun to rule society." Yi is an unmarried "middle-class officer," which is equivalent to a noncommissioned officer. While he was posted to the "Antinuclear and Antiatom Analysis Institute" [name as published] in Pyongyang, he crossed the PRC-North Korean border and entered South Korea via the PRC in March this year. The following are questions and answers from the interview. [Kuroda] Are there any recent changes in North Korean society? [Yi] The people have begun to think money is everything. In the past, party members and university graduates were considered as ideal partners for marriage. Now people care whether or not he has money. If you have money, you can do everything. You can get promoted and obtain a job. The people have begun to have a keen interest in money. Everybody, including senior party and government officials as well as farmers, hopes to conduct black-marketeering. Black-marketeering is called "yami" in North Korea. It has been rumored that former Prime Minister Yon Hyong-muk was dismissed from his post because his wife committed irregularities when she exchanged old currencies for new. [Kuroda] How is the food and energy situation? [Yi] Rice had been rationed in Pyongyang until 1990. Since 1991, there has been no rice rationing during the May-June off-season. Another event shows the North's poverty. After inspecting a front-line unit in October 1992, Vice Premier Kim Pok-sin told President Kim Il-song that the guards in the unit wore shoes made of tree bark; he appealed to the president with tears in his eyes that the unit was in need of food. Immediately after this, military shoes and rice were sent to the unit. Last July, Pyongyang celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Korean war armistice, but without the usual large parade of military vehicles such as tanks. This was due to the oil shortage. [Kuroda] Do you know anything about the DPRK's nuclear development? [Yi] Judging from the atmosphere within the military, I firmly believe nuclear weapons have already been developed. Encouraged by the fact that Iraq secretly promoted the development of nuclear weapons while accepting nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, high-ranking officers in my unit said: "We can also deceive the international community." I also heard that, after a U.S. satellite spotted a nuclear facility in Yongbyon around the autumn of 1992, the facility was covered with trees. [Kuroda] What about the "combat readiness" assumed by North Korea after it declared its withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last March? [Yi] At that time, the military held a large rally with President Kim (supreme commander of the Korean People's Army) attending. During the rally they sang "There Will Be No Homeland Without You" and "The People Will Continue To Believe in General Kim Chong-il Even If the World Changes 100 Times" while shedding tears. They said they could believe neither Russia nor China. The general opinion is that "waging a war may not be a bad idea" to pull the nation out of poverty. But I often heard military officers questioning "if we really can win a war." Nobody believes the government's propaganda about South Korea, which Pyongyang says is prepared to wage an aggressive war against the North. [Kuroda] It is said the Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau was engaged in research on chemical (poison-gas) weapons. [Yi] The bureau is engaged in research and production of almost all kinds of poison gas, including yperite. It can load poison gas on shells, bombs, and missiles. [Kuroda] Do you know anything about these missiles? [Yi] We call them "SKUD's (he meant SCUD's)." Those SKUD's exported during the Iran-Iraq war caused trouble because of the missile's low probability of hitting targets. There are missile bases at Hamchun and Hwadae in North Hamgyong Province on the east coast, and at Chongchu in North Pyongan Province on the west coast. It is said the missiles from these bases can reach Okinawa and even Guam. I heard the missiles at a base in Chagang Province, which is located along the China-North Korea border, are targeted on China. [Kuroda] Is there a possibility the structure of the DPRK will change? [Yi] North Koreans know China has become affluent. Thus, many have voiced their strong hope that Pyongyang will adopt an open-door policy like China. Nevertheless, President Kim and his son will not open up the country because they give priority to maintaining the current structure. In view of the close and constant watch system in the North, I believe the current structure will be maintained for at least another three years.
