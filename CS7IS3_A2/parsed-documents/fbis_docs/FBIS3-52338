Under the headline "The Vatican and Israel," TISHRIN says: The agreement has flagrantly overlooked the sufferings of the Palestinian people living under occupation, as well as their right to self-determination. It has also disregarded the issue of Jerusalem. Thus, the Vatican has acted against its declared stands since 1948 with regard to freedom for the Palestinian people and Jerusalem, particularly since Israel has repeatedly said that it will never return Jerusalem to its rightful owners, and that Jerusalem will remain Israel's eternal capital. TISHRIN adds: It is striking that the Vatican which, like many world states, is watching the hateful and racist operations taking place in the occupied territories, should nullify, by this agreement, all the sympathy it demonstrated toward the Palestinian people's cause, and Palestinian children, who are being killed by Israeli bullets. The paper goes on to say: The Vatican has forgotten or chosen to forget the ordeal of the Palestinian people, who were displaced by Israel and whose lands were confiscated by Israel. In Article 4 of the normalization agreement, there is a pledge to respect the existing situation; namely, Israeli occupation. Even more dangerous is the normalization agreement that is meant to pave the way for a visit to occupied Jerusalem by the Holy See. Then, new developments in the interest of Israel and Zionism will surface. This will promote their hostile schemes in the region. Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: The agreement has failed to note in any way whatsoever the future of the holy city, and overlooked the fate of an entire population; namely, the Palestinian people.
