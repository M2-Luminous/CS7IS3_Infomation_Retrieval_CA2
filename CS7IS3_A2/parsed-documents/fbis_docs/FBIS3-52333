The agreement gives the CBJ full responsibility for supervising the work and competence of these banks. He said that Jordan is currently considering another draft memorandum of understanding concerning opening branches of Jordanian banks in the Gaza Strip. In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, al-Nabulsi said that the Jordanian-Israeli agreement includes a memorandum of understanding and seven technical annexes. It is now awaiting the approval of the Council of Ministers, which has the right to amend, approve, or cancel the agreement. He asserted that Jordan's aim is to establish a basis for durable and strong Jordanian-Palestinian relations to serve the interests of both sides, confront Israel's measures to permanently link the Palestinian economy with the Israeli economy, and prevent marginalizing Jordan's role both in the economic arrangements for the occupied territories and in the regional arrangements. Al-Nabulsi pointed out that the agreement will help toward using the Jordanian dinar and Jordanian banking system in the occupied territory to facilitate various economic operations concerning trade movement and the transfer of capital for investment. This will serve Jordanian interests both in exporting to the occupied territories and in reaping the earnings accrued from these investments. The agreement will give the Jordanian banks a new opportunity to give loans and invest their surplus cash, something which will reflect positively on the size of these banks operations and profits. It is expected that the financial and currency markets in Jordan will expand, utilizing the occupied territory's financial deals. This will expand the base of banking and increase the flexibility and efficacy of the Jordanian financial and currency policy. Al-Nabulsi said that the framework within which work is being done is expected to generate an influx of real revenues and foreign currencies into the kingdom because of the circulation of the Jordanian dinar and the opening of Jordanian Banks in the West Bank. Al-Nabulsi noted that Jordan had been in constant contact with the Palestinian side concerning the reopening of banks and that they were informed of the negotiations procedure and they urged Jordan to quickly reach an agreement with the Israeli side. He said the agreement on banks realized great progress even before the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles and was in harmony with Jordan's banking and currency role approved in the draft Palestinian-Jordanian draft agreement. Moreover, Jordan responded to the Palestinian side's demands to incorporate in the Jordanian-Israeli agreement a provision invalidating the memorandum of understanding at the end of the Palestinian transitional phase as enunciated in the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles or when the banking and currency powers and responsibilities have been transferred to the Palestinians. Dr. al-Nabulsi said the most important points in the memorandum of understanding signed by Jordan and Israel are the following: 1. Opening branches of Jordanian banks in the West Bank will take place in two stages. In the first stage, all branches of Jordanian banks closed in June 1967 will be reopened. In the second stage, branches of other Jordanian banks will be opened. 2. Any Jordanian bank wishing to open a branch should obtain CBJ approval before receiving the approval of the specialized quarter in the occupation authority. 3. Supervision of the branches will be organized on the basis of the Basel international agreement on banking, which says that the head office has full responsibility for the branches' credit status and liquidity (in Jordanian dinars). 4. The CBJ will carry out inspection of branches periodically, or whenever there is a need. 5. Dismissing the memorandum of understanding signed by the two parties on 20 August 1986 and implementing the new memorandum of understanding on the branches of Cairo-Amman Bank. Implementation of this memorandum will expire when an agreement is concluded by the two sides, which should take place before the end of the transitional stage as set in the declaration of principles signed by the Israeli Government and the PLO on 13 September 1993, or when the authority and the banking and monetary responsibilities are transferred to the Palestinians. He said that it is worth noting that the meaning of the area mentioned in the memorandum of understanding is the West Bank. Jordan is studying a draft of a similar memorandum of understanding on opening branches of Jordanian banks in the Gaza Strip. On coordination with the Palestinian side, Dr. al-Nabulsi emphasized that Jordan has been in constant contact with the Palestinian side on the reopening of branches of Jordanian banks. He said the Palestinians were aware of the progress in the negotiations, and they urged Jordan to expedite reaching an agreement with Israel. It is also worth noting that progress was made in the negotiations on the banks before the announcement of the Palestinian-Israeli declaration of principles. These negotiations have been in harmony with Jordan's monetary and banking role as agreed on in the Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement. Furthermore, Jordan responded to the Palestinian request for adding an article in the Jordanian-Israeli agreement that ends the memorandum of understanding immediately with the end of the transitional stage in accordance with the PLO-Israeli Declaration of Principles, or when the authority and financial and monetary responsibilities are transferred to the Palestinians.
