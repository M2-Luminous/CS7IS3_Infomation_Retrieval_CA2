Engelgardt, Moscow; UDC 577.21] [Abstract] The high volume of asparagine family amino acid production in the biotechnology industry--estimated in billions of dollars--and the lack of a vector-host system for molecular gene cloning in corynebacteria which held back the use of genetic engineering methods for developing corynebacterial producing strains prompted attempts to clone the lysC gene from Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 1302, a gene which encodes aspartokinase--a key enzyme in the lysin biosynthesis in corynebacteria--due to the higher activity of this wild type of enzyme compared to the enzyme encoded by the mutant gene which had been cloned earlier. In so doing, a novel version of a bireplicon vector for corynebacteria and E. coli was engineered in order to ensure a higher lysC gene expression level in the corynebacterial cells. This bireplicon vector was constructed on the basis of the pUC19 plasmid and the pBO1 corynebacterial cryptic plasmid. Encloned gene amplification on the new vector increase the aspartokinase activity by sixfold compared to the enzyme activity in the nonplasmid wild type strain cells. The novel engineered bireplicon vector is capable of not only replicating in corynebacterial cells but is also of maintaining effective expression of the gene cloned on it.
