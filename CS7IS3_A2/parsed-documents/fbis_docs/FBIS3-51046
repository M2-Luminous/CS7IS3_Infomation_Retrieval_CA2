The Brazilian Foreign Ministry considered that, taking into account the political pressure he is enduring, the Argentine minister's remarks were intended for "domestic consumption." Thus, in order not to make things worse, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry chose to only summon the Argentine ambassador in Brasilia to verbally convey its displeasure to him. For his part, Brazilian Ambassador to Argentina Marcos Azambuja contacted the acting economy and foreign ministers in Buenos Aires (Cavallo and Di Tella were on leave) and diplomatically lodged with them his protest over Cavallo's comments. According to the data supplied by Varig [Rio Grande do Sul Airline] available at Itamaraty, Argentina is today the leading foreign market for this airline. From January to December 1993 Varig took 527,000 passengers to and from Argentina. Varig also carried 11,000 metric tons of cargo during the same period. These figures are showing why Argentine businessmen, who are concerned about the Brazilian trade "drive," are now exerting so much pressure on Cavallo. In 1993 (up until October), Brazilian exports to Argentina totaled nearly $3 billion. Brazilian imports from Argentina have, however, markedly increased as well. By October Brazilian imports from Argentina totaled $2 billion, compared to only $1.3 billion imported during the same period in 1992. This is why it has been difficult for Brazilian Government officials to understand Cavallo, whose reaction has been described by some diplomats as being overblown.
