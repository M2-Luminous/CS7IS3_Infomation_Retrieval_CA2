"As far as I am concerned, I see no reason why Scalfaro should not complete his term of office, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution." Therefore, Scalfaro should stay on the Hill [president's palace] until 1999, the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] said. [Coppola] So, in your opinion, Scalfaro is untouchable? However, your allies, [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi and Gianfranco Fini [leader of the Italian Social Movement, MSI] are saying, instead, that... [Berlusconi] Please do not put words in my mouth. I never said "untouchable." I could never be so arrogant as to state or pronounce my opinion in those terms. I am only saying that the issue of the president of the republic has never been presented by the allies. [Coppola] This may be so, but Bossi is saying the opposite, he is saying that Scalfaro should pack his bags. [Berlusconi] By now Bossi is making it his profession to make statements against everything and everybody. [Coppola] However, Fini is also saying that the president will have to step down. [Berlusconi] I believe this is not the right moment to address this issue. I have expressed my opinion. We will see what happens later. They have never taken up this issue with me. I believe it ought to be discussed at the right moment. We must first see how Italians vote, see the actual figures. [Coppola] Some people are suggesting that a change is taking place in the "institutional" political scene -- namely, that you are undermining the agreement between the PDS [Democratic Part of the Left] and Scalfaro. [Berlusconi] I do not believe you can speak of alliances as far as the president of the republic is concerned, because the head of state must be above the opposing sides. I believe that Scalfaro is very much aware of this rule, and that he is fully observing it. [passage omitted]
