The report referred to a news story in the British newspaper, THE SUNDAY TIMES, about Kuwait's effort to liquidate part of its foreign assets ($3.6 billion a year) so that it can meet its debt obligations. The report indicated that "the news story was prompted by the fact that the first payment on the $5.5-billion loan to the international financial markets had become due." The report stressed that Kuwait could resort to liquidating some of its foreign assets every now and then. The text of the report follows: The Discount Rate The Central Bank of Kuwait announced for the fourth time this year, 1993, that it was lowering the discount rate by half a percentage point: from 6.25 to 5.75 percent. The Central Bank of Kuwait had lowered the discount rate last April from 7.5 to 5.7 percent, and it had lowered it in July from 7 to 6.75 percent, and again in September, to 6.25 percent. We still believe that the bank's conduct has been proper and consistent with the trend in the advanced world of lowering discount rates to stimulate growth rates while inflation rates are still under control. The full benefit of lowering the discount rate could be achieved if the Central Bank were to forgo its intervention to set limits on interest-rate ceilings on deposits and loans. Market forces can thus be permitted to interact, and banks would be able to discriminate among their clients so they can realize a higher profit margin. This is possible because the low cost of borrowing as an incentive to borrowers and a stimulant for growth is not one of the primary considerations in making a lower discount rate in Kuwait beneficial. On the other hand, lowering the discount rate could reduce the reliance of banks on public financing. It is known that in 1992 the Kuwaiti Government paid more than 300 million Kuwaiti dinars [KD] to local banks in interest on hard currency bonds, and it may have paid another KD140 million Kuwaiti approximately for treasury bonds and certificates. The government's domestic debt amounts to KD7.4 billion Kuwaiti ($25 billion). It is believed that the debt figure was reduced by about KD1 billion Kuwaiti as a result of the fact that KD1 billion Kuwaiti from hard currency bonds were paid to extinguish the debt. The fact that the discount rate fell by about 1.75 percent during the current year and the reduction in the magnitude of the debt in Kuwaiti dinars will reduce obligations from public funds arising from interest payments made on the debt. That could result in a slight reduction in current and anticipated public budget deficits. Foreign Investments The London newspaper, THE SUNDAY TIMES, published a news story about Kuwait's efforts to liquidate some of its foreign assets so that it could have $3.6 billion a year to meet its needs and its foreign currency debt obligations. The determination of that amount seems to have been the result of the fact that the due date for the first payment of the $5.5 billion loan was approaching. Kuwait had borrowed that amount from money markets worldwide after the liberation. Although we believe that Kuwait may have to liquidate some its assets every now and then unless it deals with the problem of the budget deficit by controlling spending and laying the foundations for increasing the volume of nonoil revenues and reducing the government's role in economic activity, there is no policy, to our knowledge, for the gradual liquidation of foreign assets. There may be some resistance to these piecemeal liquidation procedures, but the reorganization of the Foreign Investments Department actually guarantees the survival of the London office. That reorganization makes the office dedicated to its specialization in liquid investments. The need for some liquidity or for having some investments moved from one market to another may have been behind the news story in the British newspaper. Kuwait's Council of Ministers may conclude this week its review of the government's report on progress in confronting investment problems and the uncertainty about infringement on the effort that is being made to confront those problems. There is a general feeling that the measures which should be taken about investments are not being taken because investments involve the inviolability of public funds during the time of occupation, and an infringement on public funds has political, social, and moral consequences. We believe, however, that this is an extremely complicated and sensitive issue for anyone dealing with it for the first time. We believe that we have to wait for the government's report on this issue. The movement of the entire case may lie in having the embezzlement case in the Oil Tankers Company presented in court soon.
