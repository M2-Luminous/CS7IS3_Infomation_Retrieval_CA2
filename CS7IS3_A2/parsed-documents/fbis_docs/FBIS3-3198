German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe and his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev also told a joint press conference that a small-scale joint military exercise will be held in Russia in 1995 and another in Germany in 1996, to be followed by a larger event involving ground troops. Grachev, who arrived in Bonn earlier today for a three-day visit, announced that Russia would withdraw all of its remaining weapons and ammunition from the former East Germany by the end of May this year. The two ministers said they would make efforts to cooperate in a regular, planned and long-term manner. Grachev stressed that Russia viewed the proposal "Partnership for Peace" agreed between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and East European countries, as a transitional plan. Although Russia would act positively to the NATO proposal it was not going to make a hasty political decision on it.
