FR941212-1-00019 FR941212-1-00011 Paragraph (e)(2) of this proposed rulemaking will substantially duplicate those regulations currently enumerated in 33 CFR 162.205(a). Upon the effective date of this regulation, 33 CFR 162.205(a) will be removed, the section heading will be revised, and the remaining paragraphs of 33 CFR 162.205 will be redesignated as paragraphs (a) through (c). Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures is unnecessary. At this time, covered vessels voluntarily comply with the procedures and restrictions contained in these regulations, and rarely if ever experience delays due to the high degree of coordination provided by the VTS. Formally mandating that mariners follow these previously voluntary requirements will not have more than a minimal impact on any party. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal would have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of the proposal to be minimal on all entities since it makes mandatory the existing voluntary practices. Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact on this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket. A Consistency Determination under the Coastal Zone Management Act (14 U.S.C. 1451, et seq. ), has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.
