Speaking first, Lithuanian president A. Brazauskas specified what he believes are the three highest priority directions for foreign policy: closer cooperation with the Baltic nations and the countries of Northern Europe, further integration of Lithuania into Europe's economic, political, cultural and security systems, as well as the improvement of relations with neighboring countries. Developing the idea of closer cooperation with the Baltic countries, the president talked broadly about the problem concerning the construction of an oil terminal. He thought it entirely natural-- in the wake of the Latvian government proposal to do so--that the possibilities of constructing a terminal in Liepaja were being considered. "It is regrettable that some perceive this as politically motivated", Brazauskas said. On the subject of relations with Russia, and specifically regarding military transport to the Kaliningrad region, the president noted that there will be consultations with foreign experts on this issue. The president also spoke out in favor of the demilitarization of the Kaliningrad region and of having it become a free economic zone. The president of Lithuania specified the signing of a free trade agreement with the European Union as one of the most important tasks on the road into Europe. He said that heretofore, insufficient attention had been paid to economic relations with western countries, because greater attention had been paid to the normalization of relations with the East, which, in the opinion of the president, Lithuania has basically succeeded in achieving. According to Brazauskas, there needs to be a greater focus on the economic aspect of foreign policy and he encouraged the government to be more active in this area. Continuing on the topic of Lithuania's journey into Europe, Brazauskas expressed regret that the Lithuanian constitution does not allow for the establishment of the position of a minister for Western European affairs, which Brazauskas believes would greatly facilitate Lithuania's integration into the West. He proposed that the Seimas consider the possibility of establishing such a ministerial position, and in the meantime assign these duties to the deputy foreign minister. Having pointed out that of late there has been an increase in Lithuania of discussions and statements regarding the necessity of joining NATO, the president stated that "there is sufficient desire and determination." Furthermore, according to Brazauskas, Lithuania has more arguments for drawing closer to this organization than do its neighbors Latvia and Estonia. He also asserted that in the aforementioned countries, the discussions about joining NATO are not as emotional as in Lithuania. According to the president, a serious discussion of this issue has not even started yet in Estonia. Brazauskas rejected accusations regarding the secrecy of foreign policy. "There is no secret or two-faced foreign policy, everything is open and straightforward," the president said. In his opinion, the current foreign policy is calm and appropriate; perhaps what was still needed was to provide information on it to a wider audience. According to Brazauskas, relations with Russia are not tense; however, it is difficult to guess what they will be in the future. The president maintained that as Russian policy changed, Lithuanian policy would also be reviewed, but in either case, the issue of compensation for damages would continue to remain one of the most important topics of negotiation. "We ought to be courageous, intelligent, and moderate," Brazauskas said in concluding his address. Speaking next, foreign minister P. Gylys first listed many treaties that had been signed and the dates of many visits that had taken place. He acknowledged that "the lack of conceptual efforts was noticeable," but went on to remark that the government's program as well as the President's conceptual addresses served as a substitute for a conceptual framework for foreign policy. The minister emphasized the geopolitical aspect of foreign policy and maintained that Lithuania could regard itself as a Central European country. This was the reason, in his opinion, that Lithuania should move into Europe subject to the same conditions that are applicable to the Visegrad countries. Gylys believes that Lithuania is rapidly pursuing these countries and will draw even with them in the near future. In response to questions by Seimas members, Gylys asserted that there is no one directly responsible for the construction of the oil terminal, because a final decision on this issue has not yet been made. Gylys also indicated that NATO should not be turned into an idol before which Lithuania should be made to kneel. Commenting on the free trade agreements with the CIS countries, the minister said that the treaties exist, but that because of the situations in these countries they are not being well implemented. Free trade is going on with the Kaliningrad region, according to the minister, it just has to be made official. When asked by G. Vagnorius to answer straight out whether Lithuania intends to join NATO, Gylys said, "We aren't going anywhere, we are where we are, however, we are going towards NATO." In the discussion that took place after the intermission, V. Pleckaitis proposed that the Seimas recommend that the President make an official application for relations with NATO, and, having drawn attention to the fact that Germany and Russia were drawing closer together, he asserted that Lithuania's political leaders sometimes participate in scenarios set up by Bonn and Moscow. Stating that Gylys should comprehend that the pro-Russian policy which Gylys and J. Paleckis were implementing was a fiasco, V. Landsbergis urged that a more persistent effort be made to seek membership in NATO. He suggested that new elements be brought into the treaty discussions with Poland, namely, to talk of mutual interests, as well as of security issues relating to the Kaliningrad region. A. Saudargas, who spoke on behalf of the christian-democratic faction, maintained that recently, the government had begun to proclaim what was, in effect, a new foreign policy. What supported such a conclusion was that the Lithuanian leadership had, in his opinion, "clearly and categorically forbidden Lithuania to join NATO by itself," (such a determination was expressed at the meeting Tuesday with diplomats accredited abroad), and "had expressed the intention to build an oil terminal in a neighboring country, which is in substantially greater direct danger than Lithuania." The statement made by LDDP representative A. Tauras stood out from those made by most of the speakers. In his opinion, Lithuania should be a neutral, peaceful, and demilitarized country, and he again cited the seeking of neutrality and the guarantee of economic development as the fundamental purposes of foreign policy. Seimas members L. Andrikiene and R. Ozolas found the statements they heard lacking in conceptual terms, in terms of foreign policy goals, and in terms of strategy. Ozolas blamed all members of Seimas for the lack of a conceptual framework, because in his opinion, there can be no foreign policy concept if there is no conceptual framework for the country. Ozolas also proposed creation by Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia of a plan for comprehensive defense against a possible threat. Characterizing in general terms the discussion that had taken place, the foreign minister asserted that it had been useful. He proposed to the opposition that it formulate a conceptual framework for foreign policy and guaranteed that no one will need to go underground in the wake of this discussion. In concluding, the minister said, "Let the people discharge the responsibility that they are assuming."
