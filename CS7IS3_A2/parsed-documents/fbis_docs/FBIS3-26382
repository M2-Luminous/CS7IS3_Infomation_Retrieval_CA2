On behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee, paid Spring Festival calls to all figures participating in the party and expressed heartfelt thanks and deep respects for the hard work done in the past year by various democratic parties, industrial and commercial federations, nonparty figures, and the friends on various circles of society. He said: Over the past year, the vast numbers of cadres and the masses in the province made great efforts to study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, went all out to help implement the 12 major events defined by the provincial party committee, around the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, and made great efforts to overcome the difficulties in systems, structures, funds, and transportation, thus promoting economic development, political stability, national unity, and social progress of the province. Sun Weiben said: In 1994, China's economic reform will step on a new stage that is as extensive and profound as never before. For the province's economy that has been seriously bound up by the traditional planned economic structure, it will be a new opportunity of development. It requires the people throughout the province and the figures on all circles to enhance morale and surmount difficulties with one heart and one mind in an effort to make Heilongjiang vigorous and strong. Sun Weiben expressed hope that all democratic parties, industrial and commercial federations, and nonparty personages would utilize their wide contacts with domestic and overseas areas and their advantages in talents and knowledge to make new contributions to invigorating Heilongjiang's economy and bring benefits to Heilongjiang's people.
