FR940921-0-00149 FR940921-0-00016 111. Section 86.1337&hyph;96 of subpart N is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(7), (a)(8), (a)(13), (a)(20) and (a)(26) to read as follows: §86.1337&hyph;96 Engine dynamometer test run. (a) *␣*␣* (7) For diesel engines tested for particulate emissions, carefully install a clean particulate sample filter into each of the filter holders and install the assembled filter holders in the sample flow line (filter holders may be preassembled). (8) Follow the manufacturer's choke and throttle instructions for cold starting. Simultaneously start the engine and begin exhaust and dilution air sampling. For petroleum-fueled diesel engines (and natural gas-fueled, liquified petroleum gas-fueled or methanol-fueled diesels, if used) turn on the hydrocarbon and NO X (and CO and CO 2 , if continuous) analyzer system integrators (if used), and turn on the particulate sample pumps and indicate the start of the test on the data collection medium. * * * * * (13) Immediately after the engine is turned off, turn off the engine cooling fan(s) if used, and the CVS blower (or disconnect the exhaust system from the CVS). As soon as possible, transfer the ``cold start cycle'' exhaust and dilution air bag samples according to §86.1340. A stabilized reading of the exhaust sample on all analyzers shall be obtained within 20 minutes of the end of the sample collection phase of the test. Analysis of the methanol and formaldehyde samples shall be obtained within 24 hours of the end of the sample collection period. For diesel engines tested for particulate, carefully remove the filter holder from the sample flow apparatus, remove each particulate sample filter from its holder and place each in a petri dish and cover. * * * * * (20) For diesel engines tested for particulate, carefully install a clean particulate filter in each of the filter holders and install assembled filter holders in the sample flow line (filter holders may be preassembled). * * * * * (26) As soon as possible, transfer the ``hot start cycle'' exhaust and dilution air bag samples to the analytical system and process the samples according to §86.1340. A stabilized reading of the exhaust sample on all analyzers shall be obtained within 20 minutes of the end of the sample collection phase of the test. Analyze the methanol and formaldehyde samples within 24 hours. (If it is not possible to perform analysis within 24 hours, the samples should be stored in a cold (approximately 0 ○C) dark environment until analysis can be performed). For diesel engines tested for particulate, carefully remove the assembled filter holder from the sample flow lines, remove each particulate sample filter from its holder, place in a clean petri dish and cover as soon as possible. Within one hour after the end of the hot start phase of the test, transfer the four particulate filters to the weighing chamber for post-test conditioning. * * * * * 112. A new section 86.1340&hyph;94 is added to subpart N to read as follows: §86.1340&hyph;94 Exhaust sample analysis. Section 86.1340&hyph;94 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §86.1340&hyph;90. Where a paragraph in §86.1340&hyph;90 is identical and applicable to §86.1340&hyph;94, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.1340&hyph;90.'' (a) through (d)(6) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.1340&hyph;90. (d)(7) Measure HC (except diesels), CH 4 (natural gas-fueled engines only), CO, CO 2 , and NO X sample bag(s) with approximately the same flow rates and pressures used in §86.1340&hyph;90(d)(3). (Constituents measured continuously do not require bag analysis.) (d)(8) through (h)(2) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.1340&hyph;90.
