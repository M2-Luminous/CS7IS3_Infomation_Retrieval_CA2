However, neither did they address the congress, nor did they make any statements on the president's behalf. "I'm not a bit surprised that Russia's Democratic Choice Party has received no congratulations on its creation. Our relations with him (the president) are good and constructive enough so as to do without such curtsies," the party's leader, Yegor Gaydar, told a briefing today. "Such congratulation messages are usually prepared by those being congratulated," Sergey Filatov told a RIA correspondent, adding that it's not worth paying that much attention to the absence of such a message.
