ACTION: Notice of Intent. SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed project in Henry, Johnson and Lafayette Counties, Missouri. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Donald Neumann, Federal Highway Administration, P.O.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department (MHTD) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve a portion of Missouri Route 13 in Henry, Johnson and Lafayette Counties, Missouri. Improvements would involve the reconstruction of existing Route 13 from Lexington to south of Clinton, a total distance of approximately 154.7 kilometers (70 miles). 1. The proposed improvement is considered necessary to meet anticipated traffic demand and to improve roadway safety. The project would serve as an alternative access to Whiteman Air Force Base. 2. In Missouri, alternatives under consideration include (1) a ``no build'' option, (2) improvement of the existing alignment, and (3) alternatives on new alignments. Authorization pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act will be required. Concurrent with preparation of the EIS, the Corps of Engineers will evaluate the alternatives and associated impacts that would result from the project. Comments received during the EIS process will be considered by the Corps of Engineers in the evaluation. 3. To date, preliminary information has been issued to local officials and other interested parties. The scoping process has been initiated with Federal, State, and local agencies. A formal scoping meeting is scheduled for August 10, 1994, in Warrensburg, Missouri. In addition, public hearings will be held. Public notice will be given in advance of the date and time of each meeting. The draft EIS will be available prior to the public hearing for public review and comment. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Any comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department at the addresses provided above. Issued on: July 28, 1994. Gerald J. Reihsen, P.E., Division Administrator, Jefferson City. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19052 Filed 8&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;22&hyph;M
