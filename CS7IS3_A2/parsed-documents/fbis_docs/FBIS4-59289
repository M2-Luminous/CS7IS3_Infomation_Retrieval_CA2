During the interview, Mr. Va'ezi gave a detailed description of the spying equipment installed at the Iranian Embassy in London and how it was discovered, He also described the Foreign Ministry's actions on the matter. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Va'ezi, if possible please give our dear listeners more details on the discovery of the British Government eavesdropping device at the Iranian Embassy in London. [Va'ezi] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. About two weeks ago, when tearing down a wall in the new Iranian Embassy building in London, we discovered a bug installed and realized that a bug had been placed there. With the discovery of the bug, because of intelligence and operational considerations, and in order to conduct further investigation, we did not disclose the matter and continued our investigations until it was made public yesterday. The bug weighs about half a kilogram. A battery has been fitted inside it. It has a number of parts and in effect acts as a transmitter. In any case, this is the latest thing we can announce in connection with the bug. [Correspondent] Please tell us what measures the Iranian Foreign Ministry has so far taken in response to this action of the British Government? [Va'ezi] After our investigation at the embassy was concluded the British Embassy's charge d'affaires in Tehran was summoned today by the director general for Western Europe. A strong protest was made against this action of the British Government. We asked them to give us more explanations as quickly as possible. In any case, future explanations by the British Government will determine the next steps. Basically, we consider this and the British Government's behavior toward us as a weak point in our relations and in line with Britain's overall policy on Iran. [Correspondent] Thank you very much. [Va'ezi] Thank you. [end recording]
