[Gembicky] Minister Kanis, did any specific opportunities for the development of bilateral relations between the Slovak Army and the Israeli Army arise from your talks? [Kanis] I exchanged information with Prime Minister and Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin about the international political position of our countries, the nature of our military doctrines, and our present security policies. We familiarized ourselves with the structures of the Israeli security system and the potential of their arms industry and exchanged views on the possibilities of cooperation. Minister of Foreign Affairs Shim'on Peres briefed us about Israeli-Palestinian talks and Israel's relations with Syria. The visit, which followed up on the January visit to Israel by Jozef Moravcik, then chief of our diplomacy, has enabled closer contacts between our ministries of defense. Given the fact that Jozef Moravcik is now prime minister, one can speak about a certain continuity. [Gembicky] The Israeli defense system and the Israeli defense industry are among the best in the world. Your entourage included experts from the military industry. In what areas can we effectively cooperate with the Israeli military and strategic branches? [Kanis] We apply two criteria in building the Army of the Slovak Republic: cost-efficiency, which must be commensurate with our economic potential, and our Army's adequate military and strategic effectiveness, which must correspond to the principles of defense sufficiency and the need for rational deterrence. While visiting several arms firms, our military experts had an opportunity to assess the standard of the production of arms and arms systems in Israel. We exchanged ideas and offers regarding cooperation and possible trade and will decide on further steps in coordination with military experts and entrepreneurs. The possibility of cooperation in and the purchase of the technology of electronic systems for the Air Force looks promising. [Gembicky] Minister Kanis, were the possibilities of exporting Slovak weapons to Israel discussed as well? [Kanis] Even this possibility is opening up in specific offers [sentence as published]. [Gembicky] How would you assess the results of your three-day visit? [Kanis] I was honored to be able to bestow Milan Rastislav Stefanik medals, first grade, upon several Israeli citizens of Slovak origin for their participation in antifascist resistance and in the Slovak National Uprising. I communicated to leading Israeli politicians an invitation to the 50th anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising, to which our president has also invited U.S. President Bill Clinton. [Gembicky] The Hebron massacre has led to the suspension by the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] of Israeli-Palestinian talks on the creation of Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. How did your partners assess the chances of a speedy resumption of these talks? [Kanis] Minister Shim'on Peres told me yesterday morning that it would take a month or a month and a half before the treaty with the PLO is signed.
