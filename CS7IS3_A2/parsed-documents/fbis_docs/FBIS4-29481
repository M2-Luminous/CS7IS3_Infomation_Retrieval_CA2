Mr Surin, who was in Paris last week, said France held that the European Union should be represented by a so-called troika of former, current and pending presidents at the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) which Thailand will host on July 25. Mr Surin met permanent secretary for foreign affairs Bertrand Dufoureq in what was the highest level Thai-French exchange in recent years. The EU Commission on Asian Affairs, however, favoured representation by Germany and an official of the EU Commission, Mr Surin said. Germany, which would by then have taken up the rotating presidency of the EU, wanted to be the community's representative, with backing by senior officials from Germany and Greece, he said. "There is no conclusion on the issue. They can discuss this and inform us later," Mr Surin said, shortly after returning from a fleeting visit to Malaysia. Senior officials preparing for the forum let it be known last month that Germany, which takes up the six-month presidency of the EU on July 1, was a likely candidate for EU representative. France would be represented at the forum if ASEAN accepts the Troika formula which normally has been the case for the annual post-ministerial conference featuring ASEAN foreign ministers and their dialogue partners. The presidency of the EU turns in alphabetical order. France precedes Germany and Greece would follow. France was interested in having a role in Southeast Asia and Indochina -- in terms of culture as well as business -- and knew cooperation with ASEAN was necessary to achieve this, Mr Surin said. "All European countries, in fact, have their own policy on this region," he said. The EU Union will be one of a total of 18 entities participating in the forum. The EU will do so as one of ASEAN's seven dialogue partners. Six other dialogue partners also to attend are Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States. Eleven other entities participating in the informal meeting at foreign minister level are the six ASEAN member states, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand; their consultative partners China and Russia; and three "observer" states, Laos, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam.
