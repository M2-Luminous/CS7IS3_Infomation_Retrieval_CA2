Currently construction has reached a zero cycle, though the Russian Law on Environmental Protection forbids "to locate, design, or construct nuclear power stations near major bodies of water of republic importance." The station is being built on a tectonic fault which has a high-level strata of ground water, and the soil is geologically unstable, resulting in washing away, sinkholes, and landslides. The KAES pond is to be located on the bank of the Kostroma river, which flows into the Volga. If radioactive waste seeps into the water, the whole Volga area will be contaminated. Not a single Russian reactor, including the KAES, passed through state ecological experts; not a single one of them was mass produced--each one was built as an experimental one because neither technology was able to prove itself. No insurance company in the world would take on the responsibility of insuring Russian nuclear power stations. In early 1993 the ecological movement "In the Name of Life" attempted, for the first time, to conduct a referendum against the construction of the KAES. Fifty thousand signatures were collected in support of it from oblast residents. The idea of the referendum was also supported by the Kostroma city council. Similar referenda were conducted in Mordvinia and Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. In Nizhny Novgorod it was decided to reorient the construction to a different production line, in spite of the fact that the reactor shop had already been completed. Mordvinia decided not to build any stations at all. The construction of the majority of new nuclear power stations [AES's] in the Soviet Union was allowed by government decrees of the 1970's. At that time no evaluation as to whether it was economically feasible to construct such stations in their intended locations was carried out. Chernobyl put a stop to all construction. In 1991 the Russian Law on environmental protection set forth a new decisionmaking procedure allowing construction to begin and the criteria for choosing future station locations. Certain conditions are necessary for the construction and operation of any nuclear station: adherence to the existing legislation and sanitary norms in the design and construction as well as a mandatory ecological analysis. The construction of many Russian AES's was resumed after the 1992 decree of the Russian Government. It describes the construction of the KAES quite clearly: Accept the ministries' proposals "on completing the work on engineering lines for the social infrastructure on the KAES site in 1993." In October 1993 state ecological experts rejected the draft "Comprehensive Program for the Development of Russian Federation Nuclear Power Facilities Through 2010." The construction of nuclear stations is continuing, however. Some construction it is, too! The housing of the second reactor of the Balakovskaya AES was dropped during its installation, but only a superficial examination was done after the incident. When laying the foundation, pads of local limestone were used instead of marble ones, and ground water started to react with them and erode them. The units are settling unevenly and faster than expected by design, which creates stresses in the structure. Thirty years ago the idea was to replace crude oil and coal with inexhaustible, cheap, and harmless nuclear energy. But the idea proved to be unsound, from both the ecological and economic points of view. Previously the cost of nuclear power failed to include the cost of procuring and transporting raw materials, and the expenses caused by accidents. The cost of burying a used-up unit is approximately the same as that of its construction. Nuclear energy is being nudged out of the energy-producing market. The Future of the Dalnevostochnaya AES Will Be Decided by the People The feasibility report on the Dalnevostochnaya [Far East] nuclear power station which was prepared by the St. Petersburg institute Atomenergoproyekt was handed over to the administration of Khabarovsk Kray and Solnechnyy Rayon, the intended location of the station. According to Yuriy Komov, head of the Far East Center for Energy Problems, no decision has been made yet on construction of the Dalnevostochnaya AES. It is no secret that the eliminated kray soviet decided to build or accommodate nuclear power facilities on its territory only after the issue was presented to a kray referendum. Local organizations of the Democratic Forces of Russia movement and the "Greens" held several rallies demanding that the feasibility report be submitted for public discussion. But currently, Yuriy Komov thinks, it is unclear from the legal point of view who ought to make the decision about building a nuclear power station with four 440-megawatt units. At present time a public commission is being set up under the kray administration that will examine every aspect of the AES construction proposal.
