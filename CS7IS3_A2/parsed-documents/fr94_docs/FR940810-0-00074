FR940810-0-00074 FR940810-0-00021 Brake and Clutch Repair OSHA is adding a mandatory appendix to its asbestos standard for general industry and to the shipyard employment standard. This appendix specifies the engineering controls and work practices to be followed during brake and clutch work. Two methods of control are ``preferred,'' the enclosure/HEPA vacuum method and the low pressure/recycle method. In operations in which such work is infrequent (i.e., establishments performing fewer than 5 brake jobs per week), simple wet methods are included among the ``preferred'' controls. Also, use of ``equivalent'' methods of control is permitted. In the July 20, 1990 proposed revision of the general industry asbestos standard, OSHA proposed that the employer comply with the standard by implementing one of three specified methods of engineering controls and work practices to control asbestos exposure during automotive brake and clutch repair and assembly operations. These methods were the enclosed cylinder/HEPA vacuum system, the spray can/solvent system, and the wet brush-recycle method. Detailed requirements for these three methods were set out in proposed Appendix F. Once having properly used one of these methods, the employer would have been exempt from other requirements of the standard. OSHA preliminarily found that the use of these methods would routinely result in exposure levels below the PEL. The proposal also would have allowed the employer to comply with the standard by using an ``equivalent'' method, which follows written procedures, which the employer demonstrates can achieve results equivalent to Method A, [the enclosed cylinder/HEPA vacuum system, Proposed 1910.1001 (f)(x)]. This proposed revision differed from the 1986 standard in two ways. The earlier standard set out two methods of reducing exposure in a non-mandatory appendix. Secondly, the controls themselves are somewhat different; one method, the wet brush-recycle method, was added; the enclosed cylinder/HEPA vacuum system was revised, and the spray can/solvent system is retained. OSHA endorsed these three methods based primarily on the results of a NIOSH study completed after the 1986 standard which found that all three methods effectively reduced exposure levels during brake drum servicing operations to below the proposed PEL of 0.1 f/cc (Ex. 1&hyph;112). In the final standard OSHA lists two ``preferred methods,'' the wet-brush recycle methods and the enclosure/HEPA vacuum system. OSHA is deleting the solvent/spray method from the list of preferred methods. OSHA still is listing the above two methods as ``preferred,'' but the description of these methods is more generic than in the proposal, so as not to preclude use of methods which differ from those described in the proposal in minor ways which are unlikely to affect their efficiency. In addition, specific training provisions are added to ensure that work practices are effectively followed. Like the proposal, ``equivalent'' methods are allowed so long as required training is held. The employer must show that the ``equivalent'' method can reliably achieve exposures below the PEL in the workplace conditions where the method is sought to be used. In addition employers using such ``equivalent'' methods must demonstrate by exposure data from their workplaces using the equivalent method, or by reference to exposure data representing conditions similar to their workplace that the anticipated exposure reduction in fact, has been achieved. OSHA believes that these changes will allow employers to choose among various proven approaches and encourage the development of new devices and practices which effectively reduce exposures in brake and clutch repair facilities. Considerable comment and testimony were submitted to the record by the public concerning OSHA's proposed revisions on protection for automotive repair workers. Information concerning additional methods to achieve asbestos control during brake repair was submitted. These additional methods include HEPA vacuum systems without an enclosed cylinder (Ex. 7&hyph;104), using water spray instead of solvent spray (Ex. 7&hyph;104, 7&hyph;04), enclosures shaped other than cylindrically (Ex. 7&hyph;127), and collecting the drips of sprays from the solvent spray method (Ex. 1&hyph;84).
