So was the news conference. He was about to leave for Corfu when he was presented with our questions, which he wanted to see in writing first. Let us be frank: [Prime Minister] Berlusconi was in no mood for smiles. I think he felt like running away into the garden, into the forest, to beat his chest and shout barbarically: To hell with everyone -- [passage omitted] to hell with them. And to hell the ministers too, who are undoing rather than doing, saying the things they should not rather than the things they should. He must just have finished scolding his ministers -- not all of them, but the "ancien regime" ones. For the present he has told them to keep silent, though in one case particular he would gladly be rid of him too. We found him in this angry state, though it was also a fortunate moment, because he seemed like someone who has just begun cleaning up. This, because he is convinced that the problem lies within the "Rome bureaucracy." And although there are enemies there who are obstructing him, there are also the desires of the band that he dragged behind him, that not only flatter him but also envy him (though he never admits it, and always defends his supporters). In order to breathe freely, Mr. Berlusconi had to look outside, out of the window, because he is absolutely confident of being loved by everyone on the other side of that wall. And how can we deny it? He had government spokesman Giuliano Ferrara with him, and they made a strange couple. By saying so I may risk being strangled by one of them. But they are like Beauty and the Beast. Do not ask which is which. You decide: In modern soccer, strategy is important, but so is imagination. Eventually the spokesman left the voice on his own, and he replied precisely and determinedly. As Mr. Berlusconi knew, the occasion of the interview was IL GIORNALE's 20th birthday. [Farina] How are you, Prime Minister? I ask you that because sometimes you seem to me more anxious than you were to start with. Have you discovered a hgher debt than you expected? Are you disappointed in your allies? What is wrong? [Berlusconi] No. I am happy. Because I am confident that I have done my country a great service by saving it from a future without freedom and without prosperity that seemed to be ordained. As for the government's activity and the state budget, I will be happier -- or I hope so, at least -- when I have detailed figures on privatization. In a few hours' time we will know better how much the state will bring in this year. I have always thought that the state should be managed like a family, like a business. So, much of my satisfaction will depend on people's tax returns and how they are completed. [Farina] Someone like you must of course have a good business consultant. [Berlusconi] This is no joking matter. I am talking about the Italian people's tax returns. It is on them that the government's budget and therefore action depend. [Farina] Yes, the government's action. Is the alliance working? [Berlusconi] In coalitions, sometimes it rains, sometimes it hails. I have a patient nature, and am only alarmed by natural disasters. Apart from that, I am proceeding, and trying to keep my promises to the voters, which is something that should not displease any of my allies. [Farina] You mentioned pledges to the voters. I must tell, you that, despite the extraordinary popularity that all your opinion polls attribute to you, you do not seem to be making much use of this favorable situation to honor these pledges. In other words, you are not making many decisions. Or am I mistaken? [Berlusconi] I try to reach thought-out decisions. When I think that more time is needed, I do not allow myself to be seized by anxiety and to act hastily. Haste has created monsters that cannot even be imagined. It was enough for me to take a look at the political apparatus in Rome, its budgets and its crazy spending, to realize this. Be that as it may, in these first 40 days of work we have pondered sufficiently, and now we will make plenty of decisions. [Farina] Yes, but hitherto.... [Berlusconi] Let it be clear that we have worked hard and made plenty of decisions. Shall I give you a list? 1) We have privatized the INA [National Insurance Institute], which is the biggest insurance company. 2) We have set back in motion procedures for contracts with the public sector. 3) We have also devised a new fiscal policy, which will stimulate instead of punish tax payers, and create new jobs. That is not all, but it is not inconsiderable. [Farina] Is it or is it not true that you are prepared to hold an early election? [Berlusconi] No. I consider the work of the government and the majority my exclusive task. [Farina] Can you guarantee a government that will last the duration of the legislative term, as [League Secretary] Bossi is demanding? [Berlusconi] I will answer you this way: In mature democracies politicians -- at least those with a clean conscience who do their duty -- are always ready to leave. And they can ask the voters to express their preferences at any time. [Farina] Perhaps so that they can run again with new allies. Sometimes -- I remember [passage omitted] your dismay at Bossi's "double-crossing" -- you have seemed to regret your failure to forge an alliance with the Popular Party [PPI]. Its leaders, however, ask themselves why they should consign themselves to your embrace and thus condemn themselves to death. [Berlusconi] Anyone who thinks that in a country such as ours the Christian tradition can die in anyone's embrace is mistaken. There are certain things that remain, and one of these is the Catholic presence in politics. But this presence no longer has only the characteristics of the past! It can no longer stand as the Catholics' sole party! Moreover, the PPI is, or should be, the agent of a great return to Sturzo. And Sturzo embodied much of the liberal attitude that inspires me and the movement that I have founded. [Farina] So Forza Italia will consume the PPI in the name of Sturzo, father of all. [Berlusconi] Not at all. I do not want to absorb or take over anyone. I want my interlocutors to not be in their death throes, but merely friendly allies willing to implement common objectives, within the framework of common values and principles. [Farina] Although you are so magnanimous toward the PPI, do you not feel some sense of guilt toward the League? The League, in particular, brought down the old system, and then you arrived on horseback like Napoleon at Jena. Is this just? [Berlusconi] I have always been generous in the acknowledgements that I think are due to the Northern League and the northern movement. I, too, am a northerner. I was pleased to see their establishment at a time when many people attacked them with all kinds of insults. If I might be so bold, I would say that the first television stations to present a less familiar and steroetypic image of the League were mine. Mr. Bossi has acknowledged this publicly. But permit me to say this: Yes, it is true, they attack the old system with an exceptional democratic vigor. But when a system no longer functions, the task is not to turn it into a pile of rubble. It is necessary to transcend that system, to reform it, to replace it with something different. And this is precisely what I am trying to do. [Farina] Federalism is part of the League's social policy: Will you, as prime minister, pledge yourself to this? And the National Alliance is in favor of a presidential system. Do you favor such a system, Prime Minister? [Berlusconi] I think that the direct election of the head of government would be a good thing. But this is still a political opinion and not yet a policy of the government or the majority. Such a reform would be all the more useful in a country that were to decide, as I think ours should, to grant powers of a federal nature to its regional organizations. [Farina] You have placed much emphasis on a new electoral law that will "make it possible to govern." What time scale do you envision? And with which allies? [Berlusconi] Spring, next spring. This is the time set by the referendum, which should take place then, if approved by the Constitutional Court. As for allies, I of course depend on the government majority for any policy, including the electoral laws. But as you are well aware, this is an area in which the frankest possible dialogue with the opposition is always useful and some times even indispensable. [Farina] Let us talk about opinion polls. Do you not think that things are going rather too far? This, because people will think: So, in order to be in charge it is enough to have a mechanism that will summarize the Italian people's thinking at any particular time. Do you remember Pontius Pilate? He acted in accordance with the result of the opinion poll, and he saved Barabbas and crucified Jesus. Often common sense does not make good sense. Mr. Berlusconi, will you have the courage to make unpopular decisions? [Berlusconi] I see that you, too, make jokes about the opinion polls or about my credulity or excessive attention to their results. That is so easy to do. Some say I pay too much heed to what people think. But they forget that I am perfectly able to decide against the trend. Few people predicted my success when I decided to enter politics. It would be grotesque and also a mistake to do always and only what you assume people think; but to ignore the opinion of the majority is a sign of arrogance and contempt for the ordinary life of the most advanced democracies. [Farina] The life of democracies, you say. What is it composed of? In one interview you surprised everyone by speaking out against unprincipled consumerism. What kind of society do you have in mind? The Utopia of Thomas More? Could you describe it, as you would to a child? [Berlusconi] Believe me, unprincipled consumerism is a moral nightmare for me. I see an anonymous mass of people who buy, spend, and increase their assets without any idea of why they do so, without a feeling of real joy in living. In fact, in a prosperous and calm country consumption signifies the free exercise of a human right, to do so within a community or family context, with a sense of belonging to a society and common values. I do not know whether what I am saying is utopian, but I hope that I have been clear. [Farina] Please make a further effort. [Berlusconi] Well, I will tell you that the society that I have in mind, and that I dream of, is not an artificial society of purchasers and performers. If I may say so, this is a caricature of Berlusconism, an "ism" defined by my tireless ideological adversaries but not by me. [Farina] Everyone will expect a question, and an answer from you, about the near future of Fininvest's television channels. Has any progress been made? Can you say anything more than you did a week ago? [Berlusconi] There is nothing new in this regard. The only news would be if everyone were to recognize the fact that we are, and will remain, a free country, with a free press and free television, with a monitoring system that prevents any abuses. The Italian people are convinced of this, and vote accordingly. [Farina] Are you not afraid of excessive flattery on the part of those who are "too" friendly? And on the part of last-minute converts? Or do you consider this a minimum repayment for the injustices of the past? [Berlusconi] Flattery is always unpleasant, but in any case I demand neither compliments nor repayments, because basically, amid the storms of criticisms, I have received a great deal from public and private life. Politeness does not displease me: I always try to be polite to other people, and I expect the same, though I know that I am bound to suffer some disappointments in this regard. But never mind. [Farina] What pleasant surprises have there been for you as prime minister? [Berlusconi] A government team composed of competent people who are enthusiastic about what they do. [Farina] What about Forza Italia? It is not clear whether you want to keep it as a diffuse movement or to develop it into a party. Or do you have in mind, rather, a giant party that will absorb the whole of the center-right? Do you want to move on from a two-alignment to a two-party system? [Berlusconi] There are non so blind as those who will not see. [Farina] There are also some stubborn people, as well as dishonest people. In any case, there are differing ideas circulating within your grouping. [Berlusconi] Look, I did not want to be discourteous. But as far as Forza Italia is concerned, I have said repeatedly that the last thing we need is a new professional political apparatus. I am in favor of a party modeled on clearly-defined and strong institutions; I am in favor of the primacy of elected representatives and of the movement's representatives within the public administration. Then there is the aspect of a system of associations, which is important. It is not merely a matter of having electoral committees: Forza Italia is something more than that; it is also a community of shared principles and attitudes, but it is not, and must not become, a party in the traditional sense. It is not true at all that I am -- as Galli della Loggia wrongly wrote --a monarch surrounded by unimportant courtiers. I am the leader of a newly-born movement, and this grants particular strength to the leadership, as is natural. A good political scientist should know these things. [Farina] As you know, this interview was organized to mark the 20th anniversary of IL GIORNALE. Would you please give a description of each of the figures -- either from IL GIORNALE or other journalists -- that I will name? [Berlusconi] I will try. [Farina] Indro Montanelli. [Berlusconi] An old friend, who has treated me very badly, but whom I miss. [Farina] Vittorio Feltri. [Berlusconi] A new friend, who knows how to do his job in a modern and honest manner.' [Farina] Enzo Biagi. [Berlusconi] A professional expert. [Farina] Giorgio Bocca. [Berlusconi] Talented but bigoted. [Farina] Last, Eugenio Scalfari. [Berlusconi] The editor of LA REPUBBLICA. [Farina] Is that all? [Berlusconi] You asked me for a definition, not for a book, did you not? [Farina] What has IL GIORNALE meant for you, and what does it mean for you now? [Berlusconi] In the seventies, when that ugly beast, conformism, roamed wild, IL GIORNALE provided an example. My family and I had the honor to raise the flag which others allowed to fall. No management costs are too high for an enterprise that embodied such important values. I no longer have any kind of connection with IL GIORNALE. I have nothing to do with it from any viewpoint --either with regard to editorial management or with regard to its interpretation and reporting of events. But I do read it, and will continue to do so. Indeed, I am what is called a faithful reader. [Farina] Well, I do not know whether that is the right term, but thanks!
