Relating to the Listing and Trading of Indexed Term Notes Based on a Portfolio of Banking Industry Securities September 27, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on September 22, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Amex. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Exchange proposes to approve for listing and trading under Section 107A of the Amex Company Guide (``Guide''), Indexed Term Notes (``Notes''), the return on which is based in whole or in part on changes in the value of a static portfolio of twenty banking industry securities (``Index''). 1 The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission. 1 The components of the Index are: Bancorp Hawaii, Inc.; Barnett Banks, Inc.; Baybanks, Inc.; City National Corp.; Corestates Financial; Crestar Financial Corp.; First American Corp.; First Chicago Corp.; Hibernia Corp.; Mercantile Bancorp.; Michigan National; Midlantic Corp.; North Fork Bancorp; Provident Bankshares; Summit Bancorp; U.S. Bancorp; UJB Financial Corp.; Union Planters Corp.; UST Corp.; and Vermont Financial Services. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change Under Section 107 of the Guide, the Exchange may approve for listing and trading securities which cannot be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures, or warrants. 2 The Amex now proposes to list for trading, under Section 107A of the Guide, Notes whose value is based in whole or in part on the Index. 2 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27753 (March 1, 1990), 55 FR 8626 (March 8, 1990). The Notes will be non-convertible debt securities and will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 107A of the Guide. 3 Although the specific maturity date will not be established until immediately prior to the time of the offering, the Notes will provide for maturity within a period of not less than one nor more than seven years from the date of issue. The Notes may provide for periodic payments and/or payments at maturity based in whole or in part on changes in the value of the Index. 4 In addition, the Notes may feature a ``cap'' on the maximum amount and/or a ``floor'' on the minimum amount to be paid periodically. Additionally, the Notes shall provide that at maturity, holders will receive not less than 90% of the initial issue price of the Notes. Prior to the commencement of listing and trading of the Notes, the Exchange shall distribute a circular to its membership providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities, including appropriate suitability criteria and/or guidelines. 3 Specifically, the Notes must have: (1) A minimum public distribution of one million trading units; (2) a minimum of 400 holders; (3) an aggregate market value of at least $20 million; and (4) a term of at least one year. Additionally, the issuer of the Nortes, Lehman Brothers, Inc., must have assets of at least $100 million, stockholders' equity of at least $10 million, and pre-tax income of at least $750,000 in the last fiscal year or in two of the three prior fiscal years. As an alternative to these financial criteria, the issuer may have either: (1) Assets in excess of $200 million and stockholders' equity in excess of $10 million; or (2) assets in excess of $100 million and stockholders' equity in excess of $20 million. The Exchange has filed a proposed rule change that would, among other things, reduce securities under Section 107A of the Guide from $20 million to $4 million. See File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;36. 4 The Commission notes that the value of the Index at maturity shall not be adjusted to account for ordinary cash dividends paid on the component securities during the term of the Notes.
