Speaking about foiling the agreement is no more than talk meant to justify avoiding the battle waged by the Palestinian people now to establish their national entity, lay the foundations of an independent Palestinian state, and open all practical, objective doors toward achieving all Palestinian rights. We hope that our brothers in the Palestinian opposition factions would end their escape, based on the following facts: First, the room for maneuver of these factions is getting smaller, despite their recent statement in which they said that the Palestine question is an Islamic and pan-Arab affair. All Arab and Islamic countries, in line with their interests and strategies, deal with this question, at best, through a national and regional perspective. Perhaps, we are now at the threshold of a stage in which these factions will not find a place for their own security except in a Palestinian safe haven. Second, it is the policy of these factions to adhere to form rather than substance, and this cannot last long. We have noticed that, during the recent meetings of these factions, they avoided discussing any issues of substance. They only agreed on formalities that do not give an accurate reflection of reality, such as the illusion that collective leadership and democratic action lie only in equal representation and periodic leadership. To stress that this question has to do with formalities and is not in line with reality, we say that the alliance between the Democratic Front [for the Liberation of Palestine] and the Popular Front [for the Liberation of Palestine] on the one hand and Hamas on the other, which was implemented during the Bi'r Zayt University elections, was not observed in the elections of the Islamic University in Gaza. This is a natural thing. The Hamas Movement, for example, would not play the game of an alliance in form only all the time. This is in light of its size. This means that hard realities shall always conquer weak alliances. Third, Palestinian public opinion wants the Palestinian factions to gear their national resistance capabilities toward development by adopting a practical approach for action, and not by escape. This is especially true since the banner of Palestinian national dialogue is held high by the legitimate leadership of the Palestinian people, the PLO leadership, and by a major, broad current of our people, particularly in the main arena of the homeland itself. Based on the above, we wish the Palestinian opposition factions would end their state of national loss, which they brought on themselves as a result of adhering to the language and conduct of the past and as a result of their dependence on realities which they thought are fixed and would not change. The truth is these realities are changeable and complex. Whatever they do, the opposition factions are part of our national struggle and entity, and we care for this part. We do not want to see those factions blown away by the winds outside time and space. We do not want the Palestinian opposition to establish their existence on an illusory island which is, in reality, the back of a sleeping crocodile that will awake and drown the illusory island. Yes, the banner of dialogue and participation is held high. For the first time in history, we, Palestinians, are going to a homeland of our own that carries our name to start our life. Perhaps reality does not match one's expectations. However, participation in building the homeland, no matter how modest, is a thousand times better than illusory heroism in alliances in exile, which will not last long.
