FBIS3-5136 "dreas043_d_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-043 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Mar 1994 South Korea Dailies Assess Working Contact With DRPK SK0403074694 SK0403074694 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of reports, articles, and editorials from the ROK's vernacular press published on 4 March regarding the 3 March North-South working-level contact held at Panmunjom to discuss the exchange of special envoy issue. The conservative daily CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,300-word editorial under the headline "North Korea's Endless Demands." The paper notes that during the 3 March working contact, North Korea demanded that Patriot missiles not be brought into South Korea and that President Kim Yong-sam remarks' saying that "we will not shake hands with people with nuclear arms" be "canceled officially," in addition to its previous demand for the suspension of Team Spirit and the abandonment of the international cooperative system. Stressing that "pending North-South problems" can be discussed through the exchange of special envoys and that "more difficult problems" can be handled by holding a North-South summit, the editorial points out that the North Korean demand illustrates that "it is not interested in the envoy exchange," and urges Kim Il-song to "apologize" for having triggered the 25 June "southward war of aggression" before North Korea demands the "cancellation" of President Kim's remarks. Denouncing the North Korean "haughty attitude," the editorial asks: "For what weak points should we always be dragged and ridiculed by the North Korean authorities?" Predicting that North Korea will show only the "least false sincerity" in an attempt to realize a third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks slated for 21 March, the paper condemns the North for always putting forward "difficult conditions" after reaching an agreement in principle, referring to our "experience" in the past North-South dialogue. Pointing to "many more difficulties and obstacles" laid on the road toward the settlement of North-South problems, the editorial calls for an "essential reform" in our attitude toward the North-South dialogue and for refraining from "making public" our targets for the dialogue and other plans pertaining to North-South relations, including public references to a North-South summit. The editorial urges our side to come to the contact with the North with "a fair and square attitude" and to employ even "the strategy of boycott" if the situation does not turns out as we wish. The moderate daily TONG-A ILBO publishes on page a 1,300-word editorial entitled "Preposterous North Korea." Noting that North Korea uses "negotiation strategy" intended to "disregard" the South Korean allegation, the paper points out that North Korea has not changed this strategy in the recent contact for envoy exchange, and that its demand for the cancellation of President Kim's remarks and for the abandonment of the plan to deploy Patriot missiles is "preposterous" and "embarrassing." The editorial says that since the U.S. delegate to the negotiations talked about the "abolition" of the South Korean National Security Law, North Korea will not remain "silent" on this issue. North Korea will further attempt to "gain more concessions" while repeatedly putting forward its previous conditions. Warning that we are apt to regard North Korea as "easy negotiation partner," the editorial points out various the "misjudgment" made by our government in the past in dealing with North Korea, and urges the government and people "not to be insulted" by the North Korean attitude any longer. The government-supported daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 1,300-word editorial under the headline "North Korea Should Keenly Realize the South Side's Intention To Suspend Team Spirit." The paper says that as the result of the beginning of the nuclear inspection of North Korea by International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], a North-South working contact was held for envoy exchange and that the South side announced the "suspension" of the Team Spirit exercise with a view to urging the North to accept the inspection and come to North-South dialogue with "sincerity." Stressing that now is the time for North Korea to work for ensuring "nuclear transparency" and for "improving North-South relations," the editorial calls on North Korea to accept a "special inspection" of the two undeclared sites on which "suspicion of nuclear development" has been concentrated and to accept "mutual inspections" between the North and the South. Recalling the North Korean "stereo-typical strategy" and "preposterous demands" during North-South negotiations, the paper warns that if North Korea "stubbornly adheres to such strategy," the Team Spirit exercise will be "immediately" resumed. The editorial calls on the North Korean authorities to be "keenly aware of the significance" of our government's announcement on the suspension of Team Spirit. The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 5 a 2,000-word article by Chon Chong, deputy editor-in-chief of CHUNGANG ILBO, under the headline, "`Experimentation' by Scholar-turned Diplomatic and Security Affairs Team." Pointing to the "negative view" of the people toward North Korea- U.S. negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue and toward our government's countermeasures, the article points out that from the outset, people were concerned with the "scholar-turned diplomatic and security affairs team" of the civilian government and that the people are now aware that "Kim Il-song is waging a wild game with the United States using the nuclear issue as his bargaining card." The article stresses that North Korea's final goal is to establish diplomatic relations with the United States, because North Korea believes it must improve these relations if it is to avoid "international isolation" and "economic crisis," and maintain its political system. The article notes, however, that while the United States is aware of North Korea's delaying tactics, it has been unable to circumvent North Korean "stubbornness." Commenting on our government's sandwiched position between the U.S. and North Korea, the article says that high-ranking diplomats and government officials are showing increased skepticism on our "stick and carrot" foreign policy on North Korea and on Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's "optimism" on North Korea-U.S. talks and other North-South issues. Thus, the people "undisguisedly" indicate that there are "problems" in the "strategic concept" of our scholar-turned security team, including Minister Han, in diplomatic negotiations. Referring to remarks of a high-ranking U.S. delegate leading dialogue with North Korea that, "I can never understand the North Korean intention. North Korea is, indeed, a shuddering partner," the article warns that adherence to an "appeasement policy" creates "strategic problems," and calls for "cool observation" of public opinion. The moderate MUNHWA ILBO publishes on page 2 a 1,500-word editorial under the headline, "We Should Look at the Future." Explaining the process in the past North-South working contact, the paper says that the stalemate in talks can be attributed to the South's "passive attitude" and the "insincerity" of the North Korean authorities' in evading the talks. Pointing out the significance in the resumption of contacts, the editorial urges the government to address North-South relations "in an independent, more positive manner."
