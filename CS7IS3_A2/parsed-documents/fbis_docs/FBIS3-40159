Entities and units set up and operated by the party are unable to cut their ties; there is no differentiation between government and enterprise, or between official and commercial; and it is hard to tell the defendants from the plaintiffs. To provide support to entities being run by party and governmental organs, the great majority of local party committees and governments have explicit regulations: Concerning entities which temporarily do not have the wherewithal to cut ties, they are permitted a transitional period, and after conditions are ripe then all relations are to be severed. Undoubtedly this sort of regulation has a certain positive effect in the initial phase when the entity is being created. However, because the entity's structure and its personnel and even its property have not yet been cut loose from the party or government organ, the interests of the entity are still closely linked with the interests of the cadre, thus it is hardly avoidable that some units make use of these functional advantages to get someone's initials on something, uncover resources of materials, make hot merchandise scarce. The party and government organs in Tianjin city set up some 124 entities, of which only seven cut their ties. According to an investigation, despite the fact that when these entities were set up they were duly registered with the industrial and commercial control departments and attained the status of legal persons, looking at them at the present time from the angle of their actual control structures, they fall into only two types. In one type the party or government organ used the "washed hands" method and contracted it out to an individual, and while the parent organ provides some facilitating for it, it also rakes in a certain amount of management fees; the other type is that in which the parent organ sets up a "big contract and tight connections" and everything is centrally controlled and operated. Because the entity and the parent organ are unable to cut their ties, there remains a huge spider-web of relationships between the two, and no matter which of the above two types of operation was chosen, it has to result in the situation wherein there is no differentiation between government and enterprise, between official and commercial. But this is exactly the reverse of the goal of the reforms, and this is especially true in the cases where official and commercial are not separated and authority is used to make the commerce operate: Exactly what the masses of people most detest. In the same manner, when government is tied to business, it presents some new problems to the People's Courts in their judicial work. At present the most prominent problems occur when an organ's entity has a dispute with an individual: What position in the litigation does the party or governmental organ take? When asked this, judicial officers commonly hold one of three opinions. 1) The party/governmental organ cannot become a party in the litigation, the reason being that, in theory, the entity is an independent legal person and should independently shoulder its legal responsibilities. 2) The party/governmental organ has the position of plaintiff or defendant in the litigation, the reason being that in reality, the entity's status as a legal person is nominal not actual, the organ is really the person running the operation. 3) The party/governmental organ is a third party without independent rights of appeal, the reason being that the entity is an independent legal person, but the outcome of the decision on the case has relevance to the entity's interests under the law. We believe that all three of the above views suffer from bias, and cannot categorically address the question of the position of party and governmental organs in litigation cases; we should do a synthesis of cases and seek a firm understanding from the actual situations. 2. When economic management departments and governmental and judicial organs engage in commercial businesses, it causes problems among the masses and judicial work becomes difficult. The majority of the entities established by party and government organs are established utilizing the organ's own functional advantages, and thus the interests of the entity and those of the organ and its cadres are intimately connected. Some units unavoidably make use of their own official authority to market their power or monopolize a sector. This is especially true of some economic control departments with real power and governmental and judicial organs which engage in commercial businesses. Even though nominally the entities they establish are market principals equal with other companies and enterprises, because of the effects of the functions and official power of their parent organs, they seem to be most able to control the markets and master all situations. This is a matter of concern with the populace, who consider this a type of "upside down officialdom" and "official businessmen," and universally complain that "the powerful make lots of money, the not so powerful make a little money, the powerless don't make any money at all." In the same manner, the involvement of these organs has had a rather great effect upon litigation work in the judiciary. Considering present conditions, the establishment of commercial entities by such units and organs has had the following effects upon the judiciary. 1) Economic control departments which in their own right have state apportioned management authority can, in some areas, directly influence and exert pressure upon the judicial organs. The result is that when the judicial organs are handling cases which directly affect the entities established by the these units or departments, it has no choice but to act with extreme caution. 2) When handling cases involving the entities set up by other governmental or judicial departments, the judiciary often is subjected to the influence of personal intercessions and relationships. 3) In cases where the odd judicial organ has established its own economic entity, some judiciary personnel have become involved in "running the business," the image of the judiciary and the judicial official is greatly effected, especially when handling cases of litigation involving the very entity it has established. 3. Registered capital is falsified, real entities become "ghost entities," judicial decisions and rulings are difficult to enforce. Even though according to the materials provided by the industrial and commercial departments the 124 entities of organs have registered capital of over 18 million yuan, according to actual figures which we have, the majority of the units' registered capital is exaggerated. Some of the figures are totally fabricated out of nothing, others reflect borrowing from someone in order to register and then immediately repaying them; some exaggerate by increasing the value of mortgaged goods. Our investigation shows that majority of the capital in the organs' entities comes from three areas. First are bank loans and loans from friends and relatives. Second are public funds invested by the organ establishing the entity, and third are from personal savings. However, these funds are always limited, short term, and unstable. In Tianjin personal savings amount to 1.2 million yuan, and the average for each entity is less than 10,000 yuan. Many of the bank loans taken out by the entities have fallen due; public funds invested by the establishing organ cannot be subjected to any risks and can be recalled at any time, so many of the organs' entities only have their license and their personnel but have no "wherewithal" to run a business, thus becoming "ghost entities." Thus, in the administration of justice, after a case is settled, we often encounter the situation where these units have no capacity for continued operation; the judicial decision or ruling is nothing more than "empty words" and "useless sentences."
