The State of Qatar, however, has voiced reservations over two paragraphs of the statement issued yesterday, 5 June 1994, at the end of the session of the Ministerial Council of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] on the situation in Yemen, because these two paragraphs do not refer to the legitimate name of the fraternal country, the Yemeni Republic, as mentioned in the Security Council resolution. In addition, the two paragraphs do not note the importance of preserving Yemen's unity that was set up by consent and public referendum.
