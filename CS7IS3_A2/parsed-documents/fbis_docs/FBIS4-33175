A Cuban Revolutionary Navy [MGR] exercise was successfully held in this Matanzas Province municipality with the participation of tourism marina workers, who were grouped into special navy units. In peacetime, these units work to detect oil spills, illegal departures and landings, and drug trafficing, among other tasks. In wartime, they undertake specific tasks in support of regular MGR units and Border Guard troops, in close cooperation with ground and air troops. The workers of the Aqua, Chapelin, and Gaviota marinas demonstrated the adroitness and readiness attained during different times of the exercise, which included a tactical scouting demonstration, the use of the Navy's firing range, and intercepting a target. Resources built with scarce materials and a lot of initiative were also presented. These resources help to increase the protection of Cuban shores against a possible enemy attack. Specialists from the five provinces comprising the Central Army were in attendance. Varadero hopes to become the first municipality in Matanzas Province to attain the status of ready for defense in the second phase.
