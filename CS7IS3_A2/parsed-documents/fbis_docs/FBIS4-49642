Zheng Guoxiong, XINHUA Hong Kong Branch deputy director, presided over the discussion meeting. Groups taking part in the discussion meeting included the Hong Kong Educational Workers' Association, the New Territory Social Groups Association, the Housing Occupants Association, the Hong Kong Friends of Study Society, and the Hong Kong Association of Chinese for Reform. At the discussion meeting, participants fully expressed their opinions. Members of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions and the Hong Kong Housing Occupants Association expressed their opinions and put forward a lot of constructive suggestions on social securities for retired workers and the "three highs" situation, namely "high land prices, high apartment prices, and high rent." The Hong Kong Educational Workers' Association suggested holding a joint meeting with the participation of Hong Kong's educational workers to strengthen contacts and relations with the cultural group of the Preliminary Working Committee and reflect the views and wishes of the educational circles on Hong Kong affairs during the transitional period. They also suggested further popularizing Hong Kong Basic Law at middle and primary schools in Hong Kong and strengthening relations between educational circles in Hong Kong and Mainland China. The New Territory Social Groups Association put forward suggestions on speeding up the harnessing of the Shenzhen River, making an overall plan for transportation between Hong Kong and Guangdong, and simplifying customs inspection procedures and ensuring the smooth passage of people and vehicles through Shenzhen. The Hong Kong Friends of Study Society also put forward some suggestions on youth work in Hong Kong. Lu Ping, vice chairman and concurrently secretary general of the Preliminary Working Committee seriously heard their remarks and said: The masses at the grassroots level in Hong Kong are the rudiments of Hong Kong's foundation and are Hong Kong's roots. The so-called "governing Hong Kong by people in Hong Kong" [gang ren zhi gang 3263 0086 3112 3263] must not be narrowly interpreted as governing Hong Kong by the small number of people from government departments. The connotation of "governing Hong Kong by people in Hong Kong" is quite extensive. First, we should let the broad masses of residents at the grassroots level govern Hong Kong. We will realize Hong Kong's stability and prosperity in the future through "governing Hong Kong by people in Hong Kong." Lu Ping said: He hope that you will give full play to the power of Hong Kong residents and everyone should join efforts to realize "governing Hong Kong by people in Hong Kong." Lu Ping said: I earlier said that Hong Kong is an economic city and we hope that it will not be changed into a political city. I said this with Hong Kong's special characteristics in mind [wo zhe mo jiang shi you zhen dui xing di 2053 6638 8010 6199 2508 2589 6859 1417 1840 4104]. He hoped that everyone would show solicitude to the transitional work in Hong Kong and care for political affairs and the future of Hong Kong. Lu Ping reiterated that the Chinese side is willing to cooperate with the British side in other fields. He said: However, cooperation is a two-way thing. The key to whether the cooperation can be successful or not lies in whether the British side has sincerity or not. We have not seen any such signs at present. Zhang Junsheng, XINHUA Hong Kong Branch deputy director, also attended today's discussion meeting.
