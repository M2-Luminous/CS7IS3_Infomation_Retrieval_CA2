Saito said: "The IAEA's report says 'North Korea's overall cooperation is necessary to satisfactory inspections.' This means that the possibility of conducting inspections by other means has not been eliminated." He cited special inspections of two nuclear-related facilities which have not been filed for inspection as potential "other ways" in which inspections might be carried out.
