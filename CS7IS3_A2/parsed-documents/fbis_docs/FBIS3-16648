This conclusion was drawn by the participants of the parliamentary hearings on the Partnership for Peace program held in the State Duma on Wednesday, Chairman of the Defense Committee of the parliament's lower chamber Sergey Yushenkov (Russia's Choice bloc) reported in his interview with Interfax. In his words, at the hearings it was recommended to join the program and to consider NATO's program "as the beginning of the path towards the creation of a common security system." The State Duma was recommended to hear information by Russian Foreign Minister's spokesmen, Defense Minister, and secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council at one of the nearest "governmental hours." During the discussions in the State Duma on Thursday, Major General Pavel Zolotaryov, representative of the Russian Defense Ministry, expressed his support to the idea to join NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Zolotaryov underlined that the Defense Ministry understands that this program "is one of the concrete trends in NATO's strategy" aimed at detention by means of cooperation rather than using deterrents. According to his estimate, if Russia refuses to join this program it will occupy "a self-isolating position of an alien supervisor over processes going on in Europe" and it "will be less listened to." Zolotaryov pointed out that Russia should demonstrate its political will and resoluteness to actively participate in the new system of collective security and creation of an efficient military mechanism to deter wars and conflicts. It is also necessary to push for the development of common approaches by Russia and NATO to the problems of military security and strategic stability; and for the recognition by NATO of Russia's special role in supporting stability on the CIS territory.
