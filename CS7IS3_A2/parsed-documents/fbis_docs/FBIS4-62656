Following its announcement of the competition, the nuclear station was visited by representatives of enterprises from Vilnius, Jonava, and Panevezys. Several German and Norwegian firms also expressed interest in this venture. Foreigners immediately refused the structure of the third block, because, in their opinion, its dismantlement would require additional government assignations. From among the Lithuanian enterprises, the station chose the trade stock company "Lina." The latter has already concluded agreements with construction and transportation organizations in Visaginas. "Lina" was not daunted by the most difficult condition of the competition -- to dismantle the block at its own cost. The Ignalina nuclear power station has passed on information concerning the results of the competition to the government, which will have to decide whether or not to allow "Lina" to dismantle the third block.
