On 30 march 1994, the communist Vietnamese summoned puppets Tie Banh and Tea Chamrat to Hanoi to receive orders for the puppets and lackeys and the two-headed government to allow communist Vietnamese and all kinds of weapons, particularly tanks, armored vehicles, multiple rockets batteries, and artillery pieces to flow into Cambodia. This is for continued offensives against the people and the Cambodian national resistance forces through the strategic policy of the Communist Party of Vietnam and the alliance and to continue fueling the war against peace, national reconciliation, and the king. It is still remembered that in early March, the communist Vietnamese already summoned puppet Chea Sim to Hanoi. At that time puppet Chea Sim was ordered to use his titles of so-called acting head of state and assembly chairman to sign documents legitimizing Vietnam's continued occupation of Cambodia. This is done through, first, a demographic war by opening up Cambodia's eastern border to more Vietnamese nationals; second, through the annexation of large chunks of Cambodia's land and maritime borders; and third, through a military war by allowing the communist Vietnamese to bring various weapons into Cambodia under the label of military cooperation with Cambodia to join the mischievous alliance and continue to fuel the war. This is done to enable the comnmunist Vietnamese to continue annexing and exterminating the Cambodian race through the Indochinese federation strategy, which Vietnam calls special friendship among the three brother countries like teeth and tongue of the late Ho Chi Minh. Now the Vietnamese have summoned puppets Tie Banh and Tea Chamrat, who are the so-called co-ministers of national defense of the two-headed government, to Hanoi to concretely implement what they have ordered puppet Chea Sim to sign. II. The communist Vietnamese, their puppets and lackeys, the alliance, and the two-headed government are panicking, now that their invading forces are being disgracefully attacked, defeated, and inflicted serious damage in terms of troops, command posts, and weapons on the Anlung Veng battlefield. They are being pushed toward more serious defeats on the Pailin battlefield. This is why their puppets, the communist Vietnamese, and the mischievous alliance are running about frantically and are carrying out all kinds of military, political, economic, and diplomatic, and psychological propaganda activities to get out of their successive setbacks against the fighting and opposition by the Cambodian nation and people and the Democratic Kampuchean national resistance forces. They are trying to extricate themselves so that they can continue to fuel the war with one hand pushing puppet Cambodians to attack nationalist Cambodians, and the other allowing Vietnamese nationals up to four, five, six millions and more to flow into Cambodia at will. One day after another, the entire Cambodian nation and people in the countryside, in Phnom Penh, and abroad more clearly realize the face of the Vietnamese and their allies as the ones who oppose peace, national reconciliation, and Cambodia's independence. They have been trying to hide all this under the elections organized by UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] and the two-headed government. In this situation the PDK appeals to the entire Cambodian nation and people to continue carrying out all kinds of activities everywhere and through every means to oppose the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys, the alliance and its puppets, to prevent the communist Vietnamese from achieving their Indochinese federation strategy through any form to annex and exterminate our Cambodian race. Furthermore, the PDK appeals to peace-and justice-loving countries and people the world over to take concrete measures in every form to prevent the communist Vietnamese and their allies from fueling the war of aggression in Cambodia to kill people and the resistance forces. This not only destroys Cambodia's sovereignty and independence and exterminates the Cambodian race, a nation and a country that is a member of the United Nations, it also threatens the security and stability in the entire Southeast Asian and Pacific region now and in the future.
