He noted that being in a very important geo-strategic zone at the intersection of numerous interests, by the help of the program the Republic of Moldova will strive for consolidation of peace and good will and for the solution of the various and complicated problems it presently faces, based on international principles and rights. "We are also ready to elaborate as soon as possible the document of attendance for the signing of the bilateral agreement of partnership that will define the character and degree of Moldova's cooperation with corresponding NATO structures," said Snegur. He declared that Moldova is interested in an effective participation in the program, "with the certainty that it will offer us favorable opportunities for the creation of a professional army, in accordance with requirements, democratic principles and international standards." Mircea Snegur stressed that the Republic of Moldova pays special attention to the consultations on security stipulated by the program, especially in the case when a member state deems its territorial integrity, political independence or national security threatened. According to President Snegur, "today these principles are violated by the presence of foreign troops on Moldovan territory. This fact is in our opinion the biggest obstacle for the final political solution of the conflict in Moldova's Eastern regions."
