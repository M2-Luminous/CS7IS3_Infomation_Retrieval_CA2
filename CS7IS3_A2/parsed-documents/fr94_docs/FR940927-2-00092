FR940927-2-00092 FR940927-2-00066 Federal Aviation Administration Child Restraint Systems AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is announcing the availability of a study entitled ``The Performance of Child Restraint Devices in Transport Airplane Passenger Seats'' (the study). Because of the FAA's concern that some child restraint systems that work well in automobiles may not provide the level of protection desirable in airplanes, the FAA conducted a study to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of child restraint devices on airplanes. The FAA is continuing to study child restraint systems and when further studies are completed, they will be made available to the public. ADDRESSES: Copies of the study may be obtained by contacting: Mr. Jeffrey H. Marcus, AAM&hyph;630, Protection and Survival Laboratory, Civil Aeromedical Institute, 6500 South MacArthur, Oklahoma City, OK 73125, (405) 954&hyph;5555, fax (405) 954&hyph;4813. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jeffrey H. Marcus, AAM&hyph;630, Protection and Survival Laboratory, Civil Aeromedical Institute, 6500 South MacArthur, Oklahoma City, OK 73125, (405) 954&hyph;5555, fax (405) 954&hyph;4813. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In 1992, the FAA set forth in §§91.107(a), 121.311(b), 125.211(b), and 135.128(a) the child restraint systems acceptable for use in aircraft by listing labeling requirements and certain use requirements. The FAA's 1992 determination as to which child restraint systems would be approved for use aboard aircraft was based on many years of work by both the FAA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). In the mid 1980's, the FAA and NHTSA undertook an effort to develop a common approach to the approval of child restraints. NHTSA Standard 213 was amended to provide criteria for the certification of child restraints that were appropriate for both aircraft and automobiles. NHTSA Standard 213, as revised, is the current U.S. standard, and has allowed hundreds of models of seats to be approved. The current FAA child restraint rules do not specifically refer to NHTSA Standard 213. However, NHTSA Standard 213 is the basis for the labels required under the FAA rules. Because of the FAA's concern that some child restraint systems that work well in automobiles may not provide the level of protection desirable in airplanes, the FAA conducted a study to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of child restraint devices on airplanes, to respond to questions from the Air Transport Association concerning which child restraint systems were approved for aircraft, and to respond to comments received from child restraint manufacturers, private testing organizations, the National Transportation Safety Board, foreign regulatory organizations, and consumer activists. The FAA is continuing to study child restraint systems and when further studies are completed, they will be made available to the public. Issued in Washington, DC on September 20, 1994. Jon L. Jordan, Federal Air Surgeon. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23880 Filed 9&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
