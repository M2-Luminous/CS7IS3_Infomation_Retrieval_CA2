Fazlo Dervisbegovic reports on the details. [Begin Dervisbegovic recording] It is obvious that the responsible civilian and military bodies of the Prozor commune are either incapable or unwilling to implement the agreement negotiated and signed by the highest representatives of the Bosniak-Muslim and Croatian peoples. The Jablanica SDA Executive Council is appealing to the citizens of the Jablanica commune and the surrounding area to refrain from going for supplies to the area of the Prozor commune. Second, we demand -- the statement of the SDA Executive Council reads -- that all the state bodies in the Jablanica commune -- the civilian authorities, military structures, and police stations -- put their maximum effort into preventing and eliminating all forms of black marketeering and other criminal activities in the area of the Jablanica commune. Third, we suggest that the appropriate civilian authorities and other structures indefinitely suspend the issuing of permits for trips to the area of the Jablanica commune, and fourth, we condemn the UN Protection Force's very passive attitude to the events in Prozor on 2 May 1994, when our fellow citizens sought their protection. With the aim of shedding light on these events and their background, the Jablanica SDA Executive Council wishes to inform the general public, the appropriate republican institutions, and the [word indistinct] of the SDA of Bosnia-Herzegovina, reads the statement of the Jablanica SDA Executive Council.
