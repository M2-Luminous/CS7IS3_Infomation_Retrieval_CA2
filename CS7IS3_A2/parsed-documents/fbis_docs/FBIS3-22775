This can result in India taking a lead over Pakistan not only in the nuclear program but also in the field of conventional weapons, thereby causing difficulties for Pakistan's defense. The discriminatory treatment meted out by the United States to Pakistan does not beggar description. In spite of the fact that Pakistan has been tied up with the United States through a defense agreement since 1959, Washington never felt it necessary to maintain its friendship with Islamabad, except for a brief period during the Afghan war when the U.S. realized the danger that the advancement of the former Soviet Union toward the hot waters would have jeopardized the global power equilibrium. However, Washington turned its eyes away from Pakistan after the withdrawal of the Soviet Union from Afghanistan and its subsequent disintegration, and the same Pakistan, which was said to be a cornerstone of the U.S. foreign policy during the Afghan war, discovers itself being called a "fundamentalist," "terrorist" state and the standard bearer of the "Islamic bomb." The United States then not only stopped its own aid to Pakistan but also began efforts to persuade the entire world to follow suit. Japan, which has been the largest aid donor to Pakistan, also stopped providing assistance under the influence of the U.S. propaganda and pressure, and categorically stated to the then prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, in December 1992 that it would be difficult for Islamabad to receive any Japanese aid if it did not forgo its nuclear program, reduce military expenditure, and create a favorable atmosphere for the purpose. Two days ago, Japan once again reiterated its conditions and showed a red signal to the new Pakistani Government as well. It is ironical that India has also openly declared itself to be a nuclear power in the Indian Subcontinent, but neither the United States nor Europe nor Japan has objected to India about this. New Delhi, actually, enjoys complete freedom in stockpiling enriched uranium, making advances in the development of delivery systems, and in amassing conventional weapons. Thus, deliberate attempts are being made to weaken Pakistan's defense, which is apparently aimed at leaving us on the mercy of New Delhi and forcing us to accept India's supremacy. Pakistan's nuclear scientists Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan has said that weakness in any country's defense is tantamount to inviting enemy's aggression. He has suggested that we should manufacture our own weapons, so that we can become a nuclear power by achieving self- reliance in defense equipment and defend our sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. The Pakistan Government should also urge the United States to forsake its discriminatory and biased attitude toward Pakistan and tell Washington that if it desires to help end the nuclear arms race in the Indian Subcontinent, then it should adopt a realistic and equitable policy and also pressure India, along with Pakistan, to roll back or freeze its nuclear program. It is the moral duty of the valiant United States to ensure the supply of F-16's and other equipment for which it has already received payments, so that Pakistan can be able to defend itself from India at least in the field of conventional weapons. Trade ethics also demand that we must get the items for which we have already made payments. We have been emphasizing in these columns that the country's real strength lies in its internal unity and national solidarity. We will have to turn ourselves into an impregnable (?wall) to defeat the enemy. Our leadership should therefore pay attention to this issue as well.
