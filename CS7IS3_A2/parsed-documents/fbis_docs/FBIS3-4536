President Seguin first acclaimed the French-Chinese joint communique announced by the governments of the two countries not long ago on restoring traditional friendship and cooperation. Seguin pointed out: Friendship between France and China is built on a solid political, historical, and cultural base. In the past when there was a bipolar contention in the world, both France and China opposed hegemonism. The governments of the two countries have similar or close viewpoints toward the current major international issues. Seguin said: Both France and China are important countries in the world and their cooperation at the UN Security Council plays an important role in protecting world peace. Seguin praised the rapid economic development in China. He said that the economies of the two countries are complementary to each other, and hoped that the two countries would further strengthen cooperation in economic development and trade. Seguin noted that the French National Assembly has attached particular importance to developing relations with the Chinese NPC, and so it has set up a France-China Friendship Group which is responsible for developing friendly contacts with the Chinese NPC. During their meeting, Zhu Qizhen pointed out: Through joint efforts, Sino-French relationship has passed a difficult period and opened an important new page. He said: China and France have traditional friendship and the development of friendship and cooperation between the two countries are in accord with the common wishes of people of the two countries.
