Asked about his position on remarks made Sunday by a senior South Korean Foreign Ministry official that Seoul was considering separating the nuclear problem from an envoy exchange, Minister Han said, "it seems to be his personal opinion." While meeting reporters at the South Korean Embassy here, Han stressed that "Pyongyang must expose its nuclear sites to additional inspections by the International Atomic energy agency (IAEA) and allow an exchange of special envoys between South and North Korea if it wants to hold talks with the United States." He said that "it is up to the IAEA" to make a decision on further checks of North Korea's suspect nuclear sites. However, "it will be between one month and six weeks after the United Nations Security Council adopted the chairman's declaration on March 31." Han will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Moscow on April 14 to discuss the nuclear problem.
