The operation will be carried out by units of the Engineering Command, and within the same time span that had been announced for the operation with U.S. troops. Monjagata could not explain where the funds would come from. "The commander in chief on 23 March ordered that this operation be carried out on the same date and in the same region by units of the Army's Engineering Command jointly with other military units," Monjagata said. The officer stated that the operation that was planned by the Americans will be carried out, "but with units of our Armed Forces." In this respect we must recall that the Paraguayan Government did not grant permission to the U.S. Armed Forces to carry out the operation, and denied entry to 600 soldiers and technicians that were going to build eight schools, the same number of water tanks, and a health center, and improve the roads in San Pedro Department. The government's argument for not letting in the U.S. troops was based on the fact that some of the conditions that had been requested by the Americans were out of order. When asked, Monjagata could not say where the Armed Forces would get the funds and resources to carry out this operation, which will be called "Strong Roads '94 South." "Presumably the commander in chief will know where to get these funds," Monjagata said, and added that he did not have that information. He indicated that in his opinion the funds will be provided from the budget of the Armed Forces. It is strange that Wasmosy has ordered that the Armed Forces participate in an operation that deals with construction work, which should be in the hands of private companies, and it is also strange that the origin of the funds to be used has not been specified.
