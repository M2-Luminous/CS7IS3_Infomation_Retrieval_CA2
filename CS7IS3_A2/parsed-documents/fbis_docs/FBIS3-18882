However, Turkey has rejected the protest and drew the attention of the Brussels Government to the preparations made for the Kurdistan Conference in that city on 12-13 March. The venue of the conference is in an area where many Turks live. Belgium's protest was conveyed by the director of the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Political Department to Yildirim Kesin, Turkey's ambassador in Brussels. Keskin recalled that the decision to lift the immunity of the Democracy Party deputies was made by the Turkish Grand National Assembly and stressed that the Turkish Government does not have the right to interfere in the decisions of the legislative organ, as is the case in all countries ruled in accordance with the principles of democracy. According to officials affiliated with the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Keskin also recalled a similar situation in that country and rejected Brussels' protest note. Keskin also drew the Brussels Government's attention to the preparations that are being made to hold the "International Conference on Northwestern Kurdistan" in that city on 12-13 March. He said: "The conference, which will be held in a hotel some 200 meters from the Turkish quarter of the city, can only be described as a provocation. Considering the fact that the Brussels Government has approved the conference, it will be held responsible for this provocative activity." Meanwhile, the HURRIYET office in Ankara has reported that Ingela Martensan, a deputy of the Liberal Party in Sweden, has arrived in Turkey to follow the preparations being made for the local elections. Although Martensan does not have any official capacity, she has criticized the election law and visited the Democracy Party General Headquarters, which was damaged by explosives some time ago.
