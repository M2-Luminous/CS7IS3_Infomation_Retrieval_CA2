FBIS3-50226 "dreeu017__a94037" FBIS-EEU-94-017-A Document Type:Daily Report 26 January 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Statistics on Trade With Poland Reported AU2501090794 Prague CTK in English 2012 GMT 24 Jan 94 AU2501090794 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava, Jan 24 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal Kovac hopes to give a boost to flagging Slovak-Polish trade on his forthcoming three-day visit to Poland. Although Poland is in the top ten of Slovakia's trading partners, the country's share in total Slovak turnover last year was only 2.5 percent. The figure has plummeted since 1990, but experts believe the level will be maintained next year. Therefore, on his visit from January 25-27, Kovac will be accompanied by a trade delegation consisting of Chairman of the Slovak Trade and Industry Chamber Petr Mihok and representatives of companies which have most contact with Polish companies. Slovak Economics Ministry figures show that Slovak-Polish trade was worth 11.7 billion Czechoslovak crowns [Sk] in 1991, about $390 million, but over the next two years sank to Sk7.7 billion, $255 million, then Sk7.1 billion, $235 million. Slovakia throughout this has retained a surplus -- the year before last Sk856 million around, $28.5 million, and in ten months of last year over a billion crowns, $33 million. Among the biggest commodities are Polish coal and Slovak consumer goods and machinery. We want to revitalize trade with Poland, which has the biggest market of all the countries in the Central European Free Trade Area (CEFTA) but which we have the smallest trade turnover with of all CEFTA countries, Peter Kovac, director of the transition economy department of the economics ministry, told CTK today. Peter Kovac, who will also be a member of President Kovac's trade delegation to Poland, said he did not anticipate the signing of any trade agreements but did expect new contacts to be established. Tariff barriers, one of the greatest obstacles to mutual trade, will be done away with within the framework of CEFTA in the next few years. However, trade is also impeded by under-funding and, in Peter Kovac's view, inadequate contacts and a mutual underestimation of the partner's products. Kovac nevertheless considers Poland a promising country, especially as it is the first post-communist country to achieve an increase in gross domestic product in spite of high inflation and other economic woes.
