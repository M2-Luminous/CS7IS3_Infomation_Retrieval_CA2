However, Northeastern Asia presents a different picture from that of Europe, and military expansion continues. The question is, what sort of measures should Japan take for its national defense in view of such circumstances? This series of articles examines the situation on the forward defense perimeter in search of a departure from an unwarranted sense of "peaceful well-being." Launching of Missile Without Advance Warning "It appears your country launched a missile into the Sea of Japan. It is regrettable that the launching took place without any prior notification." When it became clear in mid-June that North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) had launched the Nodong-1 medium-range missile towards central Japan, unpublished activities took place at the Japanese Embassy in Beijing. The above quote is from a telephone call made by then-Minister Kunihiko Makita (currently secretary to the prime minister) to Counselor Pak Tok-kyun of the North Korean Embassy. Routine procedures called for contacts with North Korea through the Beijing embassies in the absence of formal diplomatic relations with the latter. When missiles are launched in open seas around Japan, the general assembly resolutions of the International Maritime Organization of which North Korea is a member require advance notifications to the Japanese Government in order to provide for safe navigation of ships. Based on the advance notification, the Maritime Safety Board issues navigation warning advisories indicating the maritime zones at risk. Even the former USSR gave the Maritime Safety Agency five days advance notice of launchings. The reason for such measures is that no ship desires to become the target of missiles without advance warning. However, in the recent launching, North Korea took no advance notification actions whatsoever. Counselor Pak interrupted just as Mr. Makita continued, "We are concerned with your country's development and export of missiles," and arbitrarily cut off the telephone call as he said, "Japan is forever making remarks of that nature." A country that is completely lacking in the will to observe international rules possesses a 1,000-kilometer ballistic missile that is able to reach all regions of western Japan. The question is, what measure should be taken in response to this situation. Officials of the Japan Defense Agency clarify Japan's air defense system as follows: Once Nodong-1 is launched, it reaches its destination in about seven minutes. During that flight time, air defense centers of the Air Self-Defense Force [ASDF] located in four places such as Sayama city, Saitama Prefecture, must detect the missile and direct and execute interception. However, the 28 radar sites of the ASDF located throughout Japan are not capable of detecting missiles launched from the Korean peninsula or the flight patterns of objects in outer space. The reason is that they were designed to track such targets as aircraft and missiles in the inner atmosphere. They have no choice but to respond to attacks from outer space by using radar to barely capture objects as they reenter inner space at the tremendous speed of about Mach 10. In the event that North Korea develops a missile capable of reaching the Japanese capital of Tokyo and targets it, the mission of initial interception will be assigned to the ASDF air defense missile squadron at Takeyama in Yokosuka. The reason for this assignment is that the nationwide six-location, 24-unit air defense missile system is so roughly structured that it will allow enemy missiles to slip through the network. The surface-to-air missiles (SAM) known as Patriots assigned to air defense missile squadrons at Takeyama will be able to intercept missiles above Shinagawa 10 seconds before they reach their targets. Even if the Patriots succeed in intercepting their incoming targets, the situation will pose a frightening one in which debris will fall into the heart of the Tokyo metropolitan area. Moreover, Patriots currently assigned are designed to deal with aircraft and "are not designed to cope with incoming missiles approaching from a very high, almost vertical angle," according to Shigeru Hatakeyama, administrative vice minister of defense. Patriot II improved missiles used by the U.S. Forces during the Gulf war are capable of intercepting, to a degree, such high-angle missiles, according to Administrative Vice Minister Hatakeyama, but actual deployment is not expected until 1996. Situation Exceeds Limits of Self-Defense Although Colonel Sumio Hirai of the ASDF First Air Defense Missile Group points out that, "The current version of the Patriot could be used, if incoming targets could be intercepted by radar systems. However, we must rely on the United States for initial detection capabilities. The ultimate question is, how much intelligence would the United States be willing to supply the SDF units?" A key strategy for intercepting Nodong-1 is the theater missile defense (TMD) system proposed as a joint development project to Vice Minister Hatakeyama by U.S. Under Secretary of Defense Deutsch in the latter part of September. This strategy calls for reconnaissance satellites to detect launchings of enemy missiles and to relay the intelligence to earth where intercepting missiles would be launched from such facilities as Patriot missile launchers, Aegis naval ships, and tactical ultra-high-altitude air defense systems. TMD poses such bottlenecks as 1) exercise of collective defense rights which is not sanctioned by the Constitution; 2) inconsistency with Diet resolutions calling for the peaceful use of space; and 3) price tag of 1 trillion yen. However, the situation is such that it exceeds the limits of case-by-case defense rights. Moreover, Japan has, in reality, forfeited its option to develop a full-scale intelligence capability. In passing the "resolution for peaceful use of space," it decided not to possess spy satellites. Japan has entrusted the United States with its national defense through intelligence supplied by U.S. military satellites. The question is whether Japan will join in a regional defense system or develop an independent satellite system. Nodong-1 will force Japan to conduct a fundamental review of its defense policy. Proposals by 200 Individuals To Change Japan A Proposal for a Crisis Management and Early Warning System Comments by Satoshi Morimoto, Senior Researcher, Nomura General Research Center North Korea's objective for launching its medium-range ballistic missile Nodong-1 has not surpassed the realm of speculation, but it is conceivable that they merely wished to demonstrate the vulnerability of Japanese security and diplomacy. Accordingly, there is the possibility that North Korea will use Nodong-1 as a lever in conducting future diplomacy. In the middle of June, the then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Kono announced the missile launching. I believe that the government made that announcement to signal to the general public a warning that there is a need to take a more serious stance concerning threats from North Korea, but if Japan should react in a more serious way, it would be playing into the hands of North Korean strategy. Japan must take military threats seriously, but it must not be intimidated into falling prey to its threats. TMD research should probably be carried on as a Japan-U.S. joint project. However, the question remains as to whether the government has the determination to overcome problems concerning the system, such as 1) legal issues, 2) huge costs, and 3) military effectiveness and costs versus the end product. However, if one were to ask if TMD alone could save the nation from threats, the answer is no. I believe the more serious issue facing the nation is the lack of a crisis management system. As for the question of what Japan should do if a threat arises before the deployment of TMD, it has no answer. The government would be highly irresponsible if it were to inform the general public of a threat without the answers to such questions. Threats such as those posed by Nodong-1 cannot be handled by Japan alone. We must structure a regional early warning intelligence system operating not only for the sake of Japan, but northeastern Asia as a whole. The prohibition concerning the exercise of collective self-defense rights is a mere legal formality. National security in the true sense cannot be attained unless we surpass and overcome the limitations of collective self-defense rights in a military sense in responding to the threat of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons of a sophisticated nature. It is probably important that we visualize the unexpected and develop a substantial system and enhanced capabilities to respond expeditiously to situations as a nation. Warranting special attention is the potential for emergency situations in the post-cold war era of a scale less than war such as massive movements of refugees and a threat to maritime navigation owing to territorial disputes in the South China Sea. There is a need to conduct preparatory training on a national scale and to make advance preparations for interministry procedures. We must not shun such tasks as undesirable governmental missions.

Ever since South Korea established offshore territorial boundaries extending 12 nautical miles or 22 kilometers offshore in 1953, South Korea has posted a patrol ship inside the 12-nautical-mile line, while Japan has posted a similar ship just outside the line, creating a tense confrontation at times. Confrontation of Tensions Captain Yoshiro Kanetomo, 51, of the patrol ship "Wakasa," which had patrolled the waters around Takeshima for two and a half years and was reassigned to duty at the Tamano Maritime Safety Region since October 1993 cannot forget what happened one day in May 1993. It was just past 2000 hours, when the Wakasa reached waters just beyon the 12-nautical-mile line near Takeshima. Suddenly, the crew noticed a ship in the dark approaching at a very high speed. The lights on the ship differed from those found on a freighter or fishing vessel. Captain Kanetomo sensed an inexplicable fear from the rapidly approaching ship. When the approaching ship was one kilometer away, the wireless radio received an inquiry asking "Unknown ship [identify yourself]." The Wakasa replied, "This is the Wakasa, a Japanese patrol ship. What are you?" The approaching ship then responded in a stern voice, "Korean Navy. What are you doing here?" The Wakasa replied, "We are patrolling Takeshima, Japanese territory." The South Korean naval ship responded, "This is not Takeshima. It is Tok Do. Do not approach; it is a South Korean island." After completing this tense exchange of words, the two ships confronted each other with floodlights at a distance of 500 meters. The purpose was to mutually confirm the nationality and name of the vessels. The tense confrontation lasted for a few moments and then the South Korean naval ship made a U-turn into its 12-nautical-mile territorial waters. "Since darkness of night makes identification of the opposing ships difficult, we tend to become tense. In any event, we make a special effort not to create trouble in and around Takeshima." As indicated by this statement by Captain Kanetomo, the Japanese Government's basic stance on the Takeshima issue is that 1) it will seek a peaceful solution, and 2) it will not take any controversial actions. The Takeshima issue finds its origin in the establishment of the Rhee Line and the inclusion of Takeshima in 1952 by President Rhee during a vacuum created by the suspension of Japanese rule under the provisions of the Occupation Memorandum of 1946. After a series of incidents including the removal of Japanese territorial signs and shootings at patrol ships, South Korea used military force to occupy Takeshima in 1954. Later, in connection with the signing of the Japan-South Korea Basic Treaty in 1965, foreign ministers of both nations left the issue open for resolution through peaceful means by stating in the official documents exchanged concerning settlement of disputes, "Disputes between the two nations shall be resolved through diplomatic channels. In the event such efforts fail to produce resolutions, the matters shall be subjected to mediation." South Korea Permanently Stations Security Forces However, despite the foregoing agreement, South Korea permanently stations about 14 guards and has built lookouts, barracks, concrete pillboxes and steel guard towers on Takeshima. During an October 1992 session of the South Korean National Assembly, Naval Chief of Staff Kim Chol-u revealed that a study is underway to install a radar base to cope with patrol ships of the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency. The South Korean Government is dedicating itself to establishing a record of effective control over Takeshima by granting a fishing boat to a fisherman family which relocated to the island and implementing a forestation project. In the meanwhile, Japan has no choice but to table issues concerning Takeshima before the South Korean Government. During the June session of the regular meeting of the Japan-South Korean conference, then-Foreign Minister Kabun Muto stated, "Takeshima is a territory of Japan from both historical and international law perspectives. It is very regrettable that it is occupied by South Korea." In response, South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu asserted, "Tok Do is inherently South Korean territory." According to sources at the Northeast Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese Government cannot allow itself to alter its assertion for territorial rights and it will continue to repeat its position no matter how much it offends the South Korean Government, thus causing the Japanese Government to refer to the Takeshima issue at each annual session of the regularly scheduled foreign ministers conference, but one cannot deny that the exchange is akin to a ceremony in which one side makes an assertion and the other side disregards what is said. Possibilities for Peaceful Resolution Are Nil Relative to a peaceful resolution, Japan is unable to approach Takeshima which is its inherent territory and the continuing militarization of the island by South Korea demonstrates that it has no intention of becoming a party to peaceful settlement. Even Foreign Ministry officials admit, "Frankly, there is no prospect of a peaceful resolution." According to government sources, it is probably true that, in reality, "territorial issues can be settled only through brute force. But, Japan does not possess that option nor do such measures have any significance." However, the question arises, should Japan totally neglect an issue over which it has no meaningful countermeasure? Military sources point out, "The issue of the Senkaku Islands which China asserts is part of its territory could have a delicate effect on the Takeshima issue. The reason is that, if China should move to exercise effective control, Takeshima has demonstrated that Japan is unable to take any countermeasure." The same military source adds, "As long as Japan is unable to take countermeasures in response to the exercise of effective control, it must think in terms of how it can prevent the exercise of such control." Captain Kanetomo points out, "The problem is that the Japanese people have very little awareness of land and sea- based territorial rights. One wonders how many people are aware that a Japanese island is being occupied." Takeshima which is about to be consigned to oblivion symbolizes the fragility of the national defense system. Chronology of Takeshima - February 1905--Japanese Government declares its intention to exercise territorial rights by issuing the Shimane Prefecture Notice To Incorporate Takeshima Into Shimane Prefecture (Oki-gun Gokamura Oaza Hisami Aza Takeshima). - January 1952--South Korea established the Syngman Rhee Line and made Takeshima (Tok Do) a part of South Korean territory. - June 1954--Internal Affairs Department of the South Korean Government announces that the Maritime Police Forces will be stationed in Takeshima. - September 1954--Japan makes a cabinet decision on a plan to submit the question of title to Takeshima to the International Court of Justice and proposes to the South Korean Government by note that the matter be presented to the court. - October 1954--South Korea rejects the Japanese proposal. - June 1965--Japan-South Korea Basic Treaty is signed. A document is exchanged proposing the peaceful settlement of the Takeshima issue. - July 1977--Japan implements 12-nautical-mile territorial waters law (exclusive of waters surrounding South Korea and China). - October 1977--South Korean domestic newspapers report that Choi Chong-duk, a fishing family, relocates to Takeshima. - April 1978--South Korea announces "12-nautical-mile territorial water rights". - May 1978--South Korean naval ship orders Japanese fishing vessels to evacuate.

Footnote on Takeshima Takeshima is located 157 kilometers northwest of Shimane Prefecture's Okishima and consists of two small islands called Higashijima and Nishijima and surrounding reefs. Total area is 0.23 square kilometers, about the size of Hibiya Park. It is known as a treasure trove of seafoods such as abalone and turbo. In ancient Japanese history, Takeshima was known as Matsushima and was managed by the Otani and Kawamura families of the Hoki clan (Tottori) which had been granted the islands from Japan's feudal government during the initial stages of the Edo era. On the other hand, South Korean Government documents of the Rhee era in 1696 assert that a historical fact exists wherein An Yong-bok forced Japanese to evacuate from Takeshima. Proposals by 200 Individuals To Change Japan Present to the General Public Options for Defense Capabilities Comments by Toshiyuki Shikata, Visiting Researcher, World Peace Research Center Now that we have entered the post-cold war era, even nations which once relied on military force are attempting to abandon their reliance on physical force for pursuit of their national interests. These moves illustrate that other nations are following the example set by Japan. However, the quantitative levels maintained by Japan for its defense capabilities are unparalleled in the world in terms of their ultra-pacifist characteristics. It is not feasible to make any quick reductions. I believe an appropriate defense capability would call for the elevation of current defense capabilities and efficiency and the attainment of a small-scale elite military force. Military capabilities are maintained to cope with the unexpected and it is most ideal that they are never committed to actual use. The Self-Defense Forces [SDF] are dedicated to training. As an example, gunnery technicians serving on combat tanks spend their time working to shorten the time required to launch a projectile when a target is detected. However, SDF personnel face their severest professional test in observing the theory that non-use of defense capabilities is the ideal military situation. In other words, there is a need to give them the opportunity to show that their professions serve a meaningful purpose. Such opportunities are probably offered in connection with major natural disaster relief projects and UN peacekeeping operations (PKO). However, I would like the general public to be aware that SDF personnel can serve effectively in emergencies only because they have been committed to routinely serve with honor and respect. They would be useless if they were treated without respect and as so much extraneous freight. On the other hand, it seems that individuals among SDF personnel complain of their low ranking in society. But SDF personnel can enhance their societal standing only through their own efforts. SDF personnel are strong collectively, but are very fragile when performing as individuals. It appears they suffer from the misconception that they lose their identity as individuals as part of a collective organization. SDF personnel rarely take courses at evening extension courses at universities even when given the opportunity. Officers are given the opportunity to work for master's degrees at the graduate level. The ideal situation provides for the integration of capabilities as a group based on individual strengths. As long as intelligence is made available at an early stage and reserves can be mobilized during emergencies, it would probably be acceptable to minimize peacetime military forces. However, if intelligence resources are available only on a minimal, delayed basis and emergencies must be encountered suddenly, we probably need to maintain a certain level of military capability even during peacetime. We should probably ask the general public which option it wishes to choose. The government should explain the available defense formats and levels and allow the general public to select the appropriate option. [Toshiyuki Shikata] Born in 1936 in Shizuoka Prefecture.

[15 Oct 93 p 6] [Text] South Korean Fishing Vessels Operate Illegally--Japanese Government Unable To Enforce Law Fisheries cooperatives in Tsushima and Ikishima in Nagasaki Prefecture operate "protective patrol ships." The fisheries cooperatives operate independent patrols in self-defense because of the unending illegal operations of South Korean fishing vessels. Situation Finally Produces Casualties "At the present time we are not operating protective patrol ships. South Korean fishing vessel operators know this and come to poach in our waters in droves. They took all of 300,000 abalone that we had planted in the waters." Shigeyoshi Inuzuka, age 48, chief of general affairs at the Nagasaki Prefecture Tsushima Fishing Cooperative located at the northern end of Tsushima, an island located near the international boundary, drooped his shoulders in dismay. South Korean fishing vessels violate the 12-nautical-mile (22 kilometer) limit under cover of darkness and poach frequently in Japanese waters. Yoshio Sawamura, chief of the Fisheries Policy Department of the Federation of Fishermen's Cooperatives comments, "The situation continues to worsen as over 90 percent of South Korean vessels take such actions as deliberately concealing their true identity." According to figures confirmed by the Fisheries Agency, South Korean fishing vessels committed 1,181 violations as of the end of August this year, exceeding prior-year comparable-period figures by 170. Illegal operations include 1) violation of territorial waters, 2) violation of Japan-South Korean fisheries agreement, and 3) violation of Japan-South Korean Fisheries Independent Control Measures; 220 of the violations took place at Tsushima. The Maritime Safety Agency has assigned two patrol ships and the Fisheries Agency has assigned one surveillance ship, but it is difficult to cover all of the coastline at Tsushima, which is about twice the size of Biwa Lake. The Kamitsushima-cho Fisheries Cooperative initiated protective policies in 1985. However, on 25 July 1992, a much-feared casualty was recorded. Before daybreak on that day, radar operated by the fisheries cooperative detected what appeared to be illegally operating South Korean fishing vessels four kilometers off Tsushima. Sixty-year-old Captain Takeyoshi Ogi of the six-ton protective patrol vessel Hayate operated by the fisheries cooperative moved immediately to the scene of the illegal operations. The mission of the protective patrol ships is to quickly detect illegal operations of South Korean and Chinese fishing vessels and to report such violations to the Maritime Safety Agency. At 0300 hours, Ogi informed the fisheries cooperative, "I am currently pursuing a large South Korean trawl-net fishing boat. The waves are beginning to grow higher." That was to be his last message. The Izuhara Maritime Safety Agency station at the southern tip of Tsushima dispatched the patrol ship Tatsugumo in response to information from the fisheries cooperative. However, the Hayate had already disappeared from the scene of the violations. The Hayate was a small plastic boat and there was no way it could deal with a 150-ton trawl-net fishing boat. Concerned individuals gathered at the fisheries cooperative worried about Ogi's fate. At 0530 hours, a South Korean fishing vessel discovered the capsized, unmanned Hayate. When towed to port by the South Korean vessel, the Hayate's propeller was so damaged that it retain none of its original shape. Captain Ogi is still unaccounted for. According to the Maritime Safety Agency, "There is a strong possibility that the propeller of the Hayate became entangled in the steel wiring released from South Korean fishing vessels during their high-seas operations." According to the Nagasaki Prefecture Fisheries Department, protective vessels total six for Tsushima and Ikishima as a whole. In December 1993, the Kamitsushima-cho fisheries cooperative will replace the Hayate with a new eight-ton protective patrol vessel. Living Together With Danger Department chief Inuzuka appeals for increased law enforcement, saying, "If we exercise vigilance through the use of protective patrol vessels, there is an undeniable decrease in poaching incidents. However, protective patrol vessels handle a dangerous mission." "We have appealed to the South Korean Consulate in Fukuoka for corrective action, but we see no signs of improvement. We would like to see the South Korean Government appear at the scene of the violations to enforce the law." The foregoing statement was made by the Japanese Government at the conference of director general of the Japan-South Korea Fisheries Ministries held at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries at the end of August 1993. However, the South Korean Government simply replied, "We understand. However, the violations are limited in number." The Maritime Safety Agency has the authority to apprehend fishing vessels that violate territorial waters. However, the agency, in reality, has pretty much thrown in the towel when it comes to fishing vessels violating the Japan-South Korea Fisheries Agreement. This agreement provides that, in extraterritorial waters, only law-enforcing ships of the violating ship's nation can enforce the law relative to such ships (principle of the ship's flag). According to the Maritime Safety Agency, the Japanese Government can only "take pictures of the violations and report them to South Korea." All we can do is wait for South Korean law-enforcement vessels to arrive on the scene. In view of these circumstances, the Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives is holding a rally in Tokyo on 26 October to adopt a resolution seeking across-the-board enforcement of a 200-nautical-mile territorial demarcation line. Cautious About Establishing a Framework Currently, Japan has established a 200-nautical-mile fisheries zone, but has not applied this principle to waters around South Korea and China. When the 200-nautical-mile law was implemented in 1977, similar demarcations for the two countries were withheld because both nations had not established 200-nautical-mile territorial rights and disputes were pending concerning territorial rights over Takeshima and Senkaku Islands. The Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives seeks establishment of a new framework, saying, "Internationally, the 200-nautical-mile system has become a routine matter and coastal nations control the situation based on their fisheries jurisdictional rights, but jurisdictional and law-enforcement rights relative to South Korea and China are limited to the respective territorial waters." Already, in the North Pacific region, Japan, the United States, Canada, and Russia have approved fisheries treaties and agreements in which mutual action is taken to inspect and capture vessels that engage in illegal operations. However, according to the Fisheries Agency, "South Korea is cautious about forming a new framework." No effective countermeasure is available to Japan. Department chief Inuzuka appeals, "The government should consider why it is necessary to operate protective patrol vessels." The existence of protective patrol vessels exposes the reality that the government is incapable of protecting the livelihood and safety of coastal fishermen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Violations by South Korean Fishing Vessels | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year |Hokkaido |Sanin/Hokuriku|Kyushu |Total | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1988 |61 |237 |1,880 |2,178 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1989 |24 |507 |1,629 |2,160 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1990 |20 |256 |1,174 |1,450 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 |33 |111 |825 |969 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |25 |228 |827 |1,080 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1993 |7 |465 |709 |1,181 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1.

Current independent regulatory measures are to be implemented between 1992 and December 1994. They include such measures as shortening the time allowed for operation of South Korean trawling vessels in waters off Hokkaido and establishment of zones off western Japan where South Korean trawl-net vessel operations will not be allowed and subjected to guidance and enforcement of the prohibition. Even the Japan-China Fisheries Agreement and measures to be taken in waters covered by the agreement as approved in 1975 are based on the principle of the ship's flag. There are no agreements that cover waters surrounding Japan. Proposals by 200 Individuals To Change Japan It Is Only Logical To Protect One's Territorial Waters Comments by Shigeo Hiramatsu, Professor, Social Science Department, Kyorin University Relative to China's efforts to increase its naval forces in recent years, there is the viewpoint in Japan that, "as a military force, they are still limited and do not pose a threat." For sure, much of China's naval weaponry is outdated and lags in terms of technology, but the problem is that its naval forces are large enough to wage war on their own. In terms of antisubmarine patrol capabilities, the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force [MSDF] is top level, but cannot wage war because it lacks attack capabilities. The Chinese Navy possesses attack weapons such as bombers, land combat units, and nuclear submarines. It poses a substantial threat to surrounding nations with limited military capabilities. China asserts that all seas surrounding its continental regions are "Chinese seas." In the territorial waters law which it implemented in 1991, it declared that the Japanese territory known as the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea is Chinese territory. China is using its naval power as a backdrop in making advances in the South China Sea. The South China Sea is part of Japanese sea lanes, where its tankers navigate on a daily basis. However, the Japanese Government persists in assuming a passive stance. When China claimed the Senkaku Islands as part of its national territory, Japan merely lodged an oral protest. Ever since 1991, repeated incidents have taken place in which Japanese fishing vessels have been attacked by unidentified ships which are believed to be of Chinese origin, but Japan has failed to take any effective countermeasure. Such unidentified ships have also victimized merchant ships of Russian registry, but Russia has dispatched naval ships and have demonstrated that it will not hesitate to exercise military action if additional attempts are made at obstruction of safe navigation. The result of such Russian actions was that China apologized by admitting, "China was responsible for two of the four incidents." If an appropriate protest is lodged, even China responds. It is very improper to take a weak position because, "We might offend the other party." There is a need to say that which is proper and demonstrate one's presence as a nation. However, the Maritime Safety Agency is limited in its capabilities by the attitude that any deployment of the MSDF would violate the Constitution. As a result, no Japanese Government agency has the authority to control unidentified ships. Japan must first come to grips with this problem. Seas encompassed by the 200-nautical-mile economic water zones cover 3.86 million square kilometers or close to 10 times Japanese national lands. The expanse equals an area which ranks seventh behind Russia. It would be logical for Japan to protect those national seas in its role as a nation.

[16 Oct 93 p 6] [Text] Meiji Era Structures Remain--No Progress Made Because of Restraints on Defense Spending This article pursues the situation at the SDF installation level. Defense expenditures are subject to an annual yearend debate on budget cuts, but the situation at the SDF installation level is a truly sad picture--one gets the impression that relevant officials have engaged in defense budget debates based on impractical theories in disregard of the real situation. Over 30 Percent of Facilities Have Existed Since the Old Japanese Military Days Pre-World War II facilities still exist in the SDF. More than 30 percent of the maintenance facilities and warehouses used by the GSDF were built by the former Japanese military forces. In the evening of 5 January 1993, the GSDF 5th Division garrisoned at Obihiro-shi in northern Hokkaido was hit by major tremors of the 5.0 magnitude as part of the 7.8 magnitude tremors which centered around Kushiro Island. The earthquake was similar in intensity to the 7.9 magnitude tremor which hit during the Kanto plains quake of 1924. Colonel Shuichi Ishii, 52, commander of the Obihiro Garrison Operations Unit, worried about whether the maintenance facilities and wooden buildings built 50 years ago could withstand the intensity of the tremors. Those facilities were converted from the former hangars and mess halls that were built in 1940 to house Japanese Air Force units. Fortunately, no damage was suffered, but Colonel Ishii wore a complex expression as he confessed, "The old Japanese military structures were durable. If they had been destroyed, we would have had the opportunity to replace them." SDF policy calls for demolition and replacement when wooden structures are 30 years old, and the age limit for concrete structures is 50 years, but, in reality, the situation reflects very little progress. Even in the area of living quarters, which enjoys the highest of priorities, nearly 60 percent or 2.11 million square meters should be demolished and replaced, but only 36 percent will have been replaced by fiscal year 1993. Maintenance facilities which are used to service the newest of equipment are comparatively new and have heating systems, but all others are scheduled for future replacement. Six percent of the facilities consist of buildings built during the Meiji era. The vehicle maintenance facility that was an old Air Force hanger concerning which Colonel Ishii was worried in connection with the earthquake is used to inspect and maintain 150 pieces of self-propelled howitzers and trucks of the Fifth Artillery Regiment of the Fifth Division. It covers 3,600 square meters of floor space and is the largest such facility at that particular garrison. Akira Takai, chief of the custodial branch of the Garrison Operations Unit sighs as he admits, "The only repair to the building was the replacement of the metal roofing in 1971. November during winter months in Obihiro brings -20� Centigrade temperatures in the evening and mornings. But we don't have a heating system." That situation forces the 70 or so maintenance personnel who work in the building to warm themselves at the single jet burner in the middle of the plant as they go about performing their maintenance tasks. Maintenance personnel confess, "We wear gloves for warmth, but when we handle tiny precision parts we are forced to use our bare hands. In 30 minutes, our hands begin to freeze. We alternate between the jet heater and the work station. That means reduced efficiency and a higher exposure to the potential for accidents." Another factor which exacerbates the battle with poor working conditions are the 10 pigeons that cohabit the building. The maintenance personnel work hard to polish and shine the equipment, but once they suffer a hit by "pigeon droppings" from the rafters, they have no choice but to repeat their polish and shine details. Maintenance personnel explain, "We have mounted netting at the entrances to prevent the pigeon invasion, but we cannot avoid opening the doors during the day to bring sunlight and fresh air into the building." The 5th Division has developed a plan to completely rebuild two-thirds of the maintenance facility and to install a heating system, but the cost would be 870 million yen. According to an officer of the unit, "We've pleaded for budget approval in fiscal year 1994, but there's no telling what will happen in the face of the defense spending restraints." Growth in defense spending was limited to 3.8 percent in fiscal year 1992, the lowest level since fiscal year 1960, and it was cut further in fiscal year 1993 to 1.95 percent. In December 1992, the Mid-Term Defense Program [MTDP] for fiscal years 1991-1995 totaling 22.75 trillion yen was reduced by about 580 billion yen to 22.17 trillion yen. The MTDP had placed greater emphasis on the construction of rear-area support systems such as living quarters for SDF personnel over frontline equipment such as combat tanks and destroyers. Failure To Act May Lead to Personnel Shortages Estimated budget requests for defense spending approved in August 1993 for fiscal year 1994 reflect a 1.95 percent increase, the lowest level since the ceiling system was installed in 1961. Moreover, since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa issued a decision saying, "I ask that the growth in defense spending be restrained within the level approved for the initial fiscal year 1993 budget," the JDA and SDF personnel were demoralized by a sense of frustration. The prime minister in the middle of August, stated in connection with the MTDP review by JDA key staff officials that, "I believe appropriate action is being taken in terms of the general public's viewpoint," and clearly enunciated his posture whereby defense spending cuts are a matter of basic policy. Joint Staff Council Chairman Tetsuya Nishimoto at a luncheon with Prime Minister Hosokawa at the Prime Minister's Residence in the middle of September made a strong appeal for the manner in which SDF personnel of an invisible nature were quietly and assiduously engaged in training and the performance of duties, but there is no telling how well the prime minister appreciated his dissertation. Midlevel officers of the 5th Division reveal, "There is the opinion that one must endure all situations as long as he is a member of the SDF, but such an attitude poses obstacles to personnel recruiting goals. There are plenty of jobs available." One wonders how Prime Minister Hosokawa as the supreme commander of the SDF will reconcile defense budget restraints and national defense objectives. Breakdown of Defense Spending Defense spending in fiscal year 1993 will total 4.6406 trillion yen, representing 6.4 percent of the total general account fiscal spending budget. The breakdown includes 1) 42 percent for personnel and subsistence, including personal pay and subsistence allowances; 2) 23 percent for equipment purchases such as combat tanks and destroyers; 3) 16 percent for maintenance expenses such as education and training; 4) 10 percent for base countermeasures expenses such as support for U.S. Forces in Japan; 5) 4 percent for maintenance of facilities; and 6) 3 percent for research and development. The estimated budget for the next fiscal year will be 4.7311 trillion yen, reflecting a cut of 17.9 billion yen to 900 billion yen for frontline equipment such as combat tanks and a 45.8 billion yen increase to 1.8290 trillion yen for rear-area equipment. Proposals by 200 Individuals To Change Japan A Japan-U.S. Framework for Security Is Indispensable Comments by Mr. Ryohei Oga, Former Chief of Staff, MSDF Trends in Southeast Asia are of foremost concern in greeting the post-cold war period. Nations such as China and India can now easily obtain military equipment and are in the process of reinforcing their navies and air units. However, Japan must coexist with the Southern nations in an amicable manner. How Japan does this is a matter of politics. Ten years ago, a civilian symposium was held and an Indonesian researcher listed "threats from Southeast Asia." He mentioned domestic communism as the number-one concern; next was China which lurked in the background of domestic communism; third was the then-USSR; and fourth was rearmament by Japan. When I asked, "What do you mean by rearmament?" he replied, "A case in which Japan abandons the Japan-U.S. security arrangement and enters into rearmament after revising the Constitution." In response, a scholar from Thailand retorted, "We are now conducting a debate premised on the Japan-U.S. security arrangement. You are completely off track relative to your comments." At that moment I became keenly aware of the fact that the Japan-U.S. security system served as a basic framework for actions by Japan. When one considers security for Southeast Asia, it is important that Japan continue to act within the framework of the Japan-U.S. system and that Japan confine itself to that framework. What I wish to appeal here is that we give consideration to the very founding of our nation. The question arises, can we do without defense capabilities? No nation in the world can survive without such capabilities. All nations have a mobilization capability. If one were to question the mobilization capabilities of Japanese reserve SDF personnel, the matter would be problematic. Our nation has never given serious thought to this question. Ever since the Yoshida cabinet days, the nation has given birth to the basic concept that we have a "military unit without combat capabilities" and "an SDF that is not a military unit." The Legislation Bureau of the cabinet stubbornly refuses to change these concepts. Even though the JDA assumed a flexible posture in considering UN PKO activities, all efforts to coordinate with the Legislation Bureau ended in an argument of principles. It was even concluded about the use of weapons that they could be used only for self-defense and during emergency evacuation operations. The opinions of the Legislation Bureau were binding in all cases. Although we should settle the argument about naval ships by merely saying, "SDF vessels are recognized as naval ships under international law," we end up with the interpellations saying that "SDF vessels are not naval ships." I believe the coalition government should engage in a thorough internal discussion concerning this situation. However, I hope the Hosokawa government will not do that which is unnecessary. We will have problems even in connection with the review of the MTDP if a cabinet which partially refuses to recognize the SDF engages itself in the task.

[22 Oct 93 p 6] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Proposals by 200 Individuals To Change Japan We Are Speaking of a Situation That Differs From Defense Budget Cuts in Europe and the United States Comments by Shigeru Hatakeyama, Administrative Vice Minister for Defense Although we should not target a specific nation in formulating "basic defense capabilities," it is probably true that the former USSR served as the backdrop for developing the Defense Program Outline in 1976. If one were to think that Japan no longer needs a defense system because of the collapse of the USSR, that is wrong. Rather, there is a proliferation of situations such as the modernization of the Far Eastern Russian Forces, development of nuclear capabilities and extension of missile ranges by North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), and modernization of military forces in China, making a distinction among principal problem areas very difficult. A situation whereby one is forced to develop capabilities to be responsive to a variety of situations makes for a rather difficult position. For a nation such as ours which was dedicated to a defensive posture, focusing on a single target was an easy matter. In the future, individual problem areas may be of a lesser magnitude, but we must concern ourselves with a greater number of problem areas. We have already initiated a review of the Defense Outline, but I believe once the review is completed, we must next make a series of quantitative decisions. We are now in the process of formulating a new philosophy. The United States, Great Britain, and Russia are in the process of reducing defense expenditures, but they are in the process of withdrawing from global roles and discarding that which has become extraneous, while Japan was never a part of the global pattern. It is a matter of considering the defense issue from a totally different perspective. The situation in Asia is such that there is no collective security arrangement and, exclusive of the Philippines, various nations are increasing their defense budgets by two-digit percentages. Japan should probably continue into the future its policies relative to dedicated defensive systems, the three principles of nuclear weapons, and three principles on export of weapons as national policies, but defense of these pacifist principles will entail costs. We must establish an intelligence system because production of weapons solely for domestic consumption is costly and because we are not permitted to initiate attacks. I believe those who need to be concerned are not aware of this fact. The Gulf war served as one vehicle for deepening awareness of the SDF. We cannot overlook the fact that the debate surrounding the failed UN PKO bill had the effect of enhancing the general public's appreciation of the SDF. The SDF gained recognition both domestically and internationally for its role in executing the minesweeping operation and the UN PKO activities in Cambodia. Great reliance is placed on the SDF for operations in support of domestic disaster situations. I believe the SDF will gain recognition for its efforts by gathering a record of executing such projects. [Shigeru Hatakeyama] Born in Tokyo in 1937.
