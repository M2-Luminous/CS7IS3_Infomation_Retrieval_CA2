A statement released by the Association asks the State Census Commission to ban DPTM activists from pressuring Islamized Macedonians "into falsifying their Macedonian nationality and native Macedonian language" in order to fully "become assimilated" and turn Turk. The Macedonian authorities expect the census, which began on Tuesday, to show an incomparably smaller number of members of various nationalities, than leaders of national parties claim. According to the 1991 census, F.Y.R.O.M. had 2.3 million inhabitants, including 21 percent ethnic Albanians (427,000), while Albanian leaders claim that there are between 800,000 and one million members of that minority. Also, according to the same census, there are only 50,000 Serbs in that former Yugoslav republic. Serbs do not recognize the results of that census and a representative of Serbs and Montenegrins in the F.Y.R.O.M. says there are about 250,000 Serbs there.
