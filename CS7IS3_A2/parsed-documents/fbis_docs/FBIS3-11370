The language of Camdessus' message is even surprising taking into account that the IMF was upset -- and rightly so -- because several Brazilian administrations failed to honor the terms of the agreements signed with this international organization. It was, therefore, only natural that the IMF receive with skepticism any promises coming from Brasilia to stabilize the country's economy. Quite the opposite happened. The IMF, through its managing director, accepted promises that are easiest to measure, such as the promise that the operational deficit (including the interest on domestic and foreign debts) will be zero in 1994 and that there will be a primary surplus (without interest) of around 4 percent of the GDP. The IMF also accepted the economic team's argument that the implementation of the URV [Real Value Unit] will do away with the "backward-looking" [preceding two words in English] indexation, that is, that takes past inflation into account. Consequently, the IMF promises to work closely with Brazilian authorities to help the economic program launched on 28 February be successful "soon." But Camdessus has promised to extend this cooperation to the immediate future by promising a stand-by agreement or another way of close cooperation, for a start, when the new currency, the real, is put into circulation. The IMF's green light paves the road for Brazil to reach an agreement with the private creditor banks that, in turn, will again make Brazil more attractive to investors. The terms of Camdessus' message are so categorical and even unusual that they sound almost as an invitation to invest in Brazil, which, as is obvious, will only contribute to the program's success. Although, in its capacity as a technical organization, the IMF will not interfere in domestic political affairs, it is hard to ignore the political message contained in the note. The note undoubtedly represents a strong backing by the international financial community for the finance minister either for what is left of his mandate or, namely, a presidential candidacy.
