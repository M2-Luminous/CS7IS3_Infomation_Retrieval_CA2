He graduated from Leningrad Military Transport Communications Command School and the Military Academy of Rear Services and Transportation. He passed through all of the levels in the railroad troops from platoon commander to rail corps deputy commander. From 1988 -- he was deputy chief of the Central Road Construction Directorate and then its first deputy. He has been chief of the Federal Road Construction Directorate under the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense since December 1992. He is married. His son is an officer. In 1988, a state road construction and reconstruction program in the RSFSR Non-Chernozem Zone was adopted. The Central Road Construction Directorate was created at that time. On 8 December 1992, a Russian Federation Presidential Edict reorganized it into the Federal Road Construction Directorate under the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense. And, finally, the Statute that regulates its activities, legal bases, and the obligations of officials was approved by a Russian government decree on 10 August 1993. The editorial staff asked Lieutenant-General Ivan Marchuk, chief of the Federal Road Construction Directorate under the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, to discuss the new structure's affairs and plans. [Marchuk] Based upon the big picture, you can't call our road structure new. The general-wagon master service that consisted of subunits to prepare and maintain the roads needed by the troops had already been created in the era of Peter I. Later, staging troops subordinate to the military communications organs existed for the operation of military roads. And the road service worked along the entire front from the Barents to the Black Seas in the Great Patriotic War. The song "Ekh, dorogi..." [Ah, the roads] was certainly about it. As in the infantry, they experienced cold, alerts, and bombing each day. According to a State Committee for Defense decision, dozens of road troops formations were formed at that time and their mission consisted of the restoration of highway lines of communications. After the war, the military road builders turned over to the national economy 5,500 kilometers of restored, very important roads and hundreds of high-water bridges that had been built. Today many people, when they drive along the Moscow-Simferopol, Moscow-Leningrad, and Irkutsk-Ulan-Ude main highways and around Moscow's ring road, do not even suspect that the military road builders made a decisive contribution to their construction. [Altunin] 1988 was, of course, an event for military road builders? [Marchuk] Yes, as a matter of fact, a qualitatively new military organization appeared that was directed toward the fulfillment of a purely civilian task. And I think that it was then and is now an extremely important task. There are still no roads in the depth of Russia. After the rain, there is impassable mud and motor vehicles have to ford small rivers. A third of the harvest is lost and agricultural equipment is ruined because of this. [Altunin] And what have you managed to do in five years? [Marchuk] Quite a bit. We have built 3,320 kilometers of highways (2,555 under the plan) and also 115 military garrisons, 75 asphalt-concrete plants, 19 rail dead-end sidings and open-pits, and more than 500 cultural and consumer-services facilities. During the first ten months of this year alone, 1,584 million rubles worth of construction-erection work has been completed. I need to say that a kray is transformed after a road is laid. Residents return to previously abandoned villages from the cities and refugees from the CIS countries arrive to bring the earth "back to life". [Altunin] Ivan Dmitriyevich, how would you sort out your current status? You are not part of the Armed Forces but at the same time you are "under the Ministry of Defense"? [Marchuk] Yes, we are not part of the army's strength. The Presidential Edict and the Russian Federation Council of Ministers decree state that the Federal Road Building Directorate (FDSU) functions as a state institution. The Ministry of the Economy allocates a separate line of investment to us that is financed at the expense of the Russian Federation budget. And at the same time the Ministry of Defense has been tasked to supply the Federal Road Building Directorate with all types of allowances and services in accordance with and based upon the standards that are in effect in the Russian Federation Armed Forces but for payment. We are guided by presidential edicts, military regulations and minister of defense orders. Units and subunits have both daily routines, details, reveille, taps and liberty. Indeed, weapons are used only to guard facilities. [Altunin] Right now, what is the geography of the work being conducted by you? [Marchuk] Previously, we were concentrated in the Non-Chernozem Zone. In Nizhniy Novgorod, Ryazan, Vologda, Kirov, Orel, Perm and other oblasts and in Udmurtiya. We have had "our own people" in these areas for a long time now. Many former 10th-form girls have long ago become the wives of our officers and warrant officers and they have given birth to children... After the formation of the Federal Road Building Directorate, new oblasts -- Tula, Tambov, Chita, and Amur oblasts and Khabarovsk Kray -- are summoning us to them. Right now we are going there not only according to orders as we did before but while concluding economic contracts beforehand where both the time periods, salaries and the quality of the subcontracted work are stipulated. Cost-accounting and cost recovery are penetrating into all of our activities. By way of illustration, we are building housing for ourselves, we are selling real estate ourselves during moves, and our salary depends on output. [Altunin] Incidentally, how much are your road builders paid? [Marchuk] Everything depends on the fulfillment of standards, on the quality of work and even on initiative. For example, in current money, a private road builder receives a minimum of R30,000. But such specialists as excavator and crane operators receive R100,000 each or more. There are also bonuses. Officers receive them when a facility is turned over. During the time of their service at training combines, soldiers obtain and later reinforce in practice "hard" specialties: Bulldozer operators, electro-gas welders, asphalt layers and others that are highly valued in the civilian sector today. We also have quite a few civilian personnel. We have 4,500 women -- skilled specialists. Among them are kindergarten workers, general education and music school teachers, doctors and nurses. [Altunin] Ivan Dmitriyevich, today officers certainly go unwillingly to their duty locations at the other end of the earth? [Marchuk] Imagine, the situation is poor with officer cadre manning. It seems to me that even the romantic appeal has not disappeared. Of course, there are difficulties. Approximately 60% of the officers have been provided apartments and the rest are in hotels, in the private sector and, like we in our youth, in trailers... But at the same time there is a change in those areas where it is appropriate and there is a bonus and years served coefficient in the salary. Pensions are the same as for all servicemen. Compulsory service personnel manning is worse. We receive augmentation according to the what's left principle. We hope that the law on alternative service will be adopted. We are also beginning to conclude contracts. But for the time being -- we are looking for manpower. Here are the latest examples. Several months ago, we began construction of the uncompleted 1,200 kilometer sector of the Chita-Khabarovsk-Nakhodka super highway. According to another agreement, Federal Road Building Directorate subunits will participate in the program to conquer Tyumen Oblast's gas-oil producing regions. This is a large mission of state importance and we have a backbone of specialists to resolve it. But we will hire workers locally in those regions. There are civilian personnel and extended service military personnel there. [Altunin] But what can you say about the military road building equipment that you need? Has it been adapted for construction of "civilian" roads? Is anything being imported? [Marchuk] We are utilizing our own, domestically-produced, military road building equipment in our formations and units. Of course, it is reliable but, since it was obtained from the military districts after prolonged storage or after major overhaul, it requires large expenditures for maintenance and repair. As for imported equipment, simply speaking, we don't have any yet. The primary reason is the absence of hard currency to acquire it. And the need is increasing to equip them with imported equipment with the withdrawal of our formations to the Far East, to the Transbaykal Region and to Tyumen Oblast. The work there is in rocky and frozen ground and at low temperatures. I think that we need to resolve this problem immediately. The end result of our work in these regions is many times more valuable than the expenditures on equipment.
