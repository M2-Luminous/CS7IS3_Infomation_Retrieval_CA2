FR941205-0-00013 FR941205-0-00002 Response and Disposition: The final rule retains the current mandate that all asylum applicants who appear as scheduled will receive an interview with an asylum officer. Accordingly, incomplete applications will not be denied or referred to an immigration judge without an interview. These sections of the proposed rule are therefore adopted with appropriate amendments in the final rule. The final rule provides that an incomplete application shall be returned by mailing it to an applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application by the INS; and that if an application has not been returned within this 30-day period, the application shall be deemed complete. Under section 208.7 of the final rule, if the application is incomplete, the 150-day period will not begin until the applicant submits a complete application. For clarity, the last sentence of ยง208.3(c)(6) of the proposed rule, defining an incomplete application, is moved to paragraph ยง208.3(c)(5) of the final rule. This definition also has been clarified to state that an application that is not returned to an applicant within 30 days of having been received by the INS shall be deemed complete. 7. Employment Authorization (Section 208.7) Proposed Rule: The proposed rule would have amended the regulations governing eligibility of asylum applicants for employment authorization in the following manner: An application for employment authorization (Form I&hyph;765) could be submitted to the INS no earlier than 150 days after the date on which a complete application for asylum was filed. If the asylum application was denied by an immigration judge or an asylum officer within the 150-day period, the applicant would not be eligible to apply for employment authorization. After 150 days, the INS would have 30 days from the date of the filing of the application for employment authorization to adjudicate the application for employment authorization. If the INS failed to adjudicate the application for employment authorization within the 30-day period, the applicant would be eligible for interim employment authorization. If the application for asylum was denied by an immigration judge or an asylum officer within this 30-day period, the application for employment authorization would be denied. The 150- and 180-day periods would be extended by any delay sought or caused by the applicant. The proposed rule also would have prohibited an applicant for asylum who has been convicted of an aggravated felony from applying for or being granted employment authorization. If an applicant who has been convicted of an aggravated felony has previously been granted employment authorization, the employment authorization would be revoked. Finally, an applicant who inexcusably failed to appear for a scheduled interview before an asylum officer or a hearing before the immigration judge would not be granted employment authorization. The proposed rule also would have amended the current rule by requiring a fee for the filing of an initial application for employment authorization. Comments: A few comments supported these proposals as an appropriate balance between meeting the needs of asylum applicants while discouraging frivolous claims. A greater number of comments criticized these provisions for imposing economic hardship on asylum applicants. The comments stated that many applicants arrive in the United States with few belongings, no money, and no network of family or friends to provide them assistance. Furthermore, the United States does not provide public assistance benefits to most people who apply for asylum. As a result, asylum applicants would be forced to work illegally in jobs where they would be underpaid and treated poorly, but would have no means of redress because of the fear of reprisals. Other comments claimed that the rule would violate the right to work of asylum applicants and is inconsistent with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, 189 U.N.T.S. 150, 19 U.S.T. 6260, T.I.A.S. 6577, and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, 606 U.N.T.S. 267, 19 U.S.T. 6223, T.I.A.S. 6577, because it creates an obstacle to the filing of an asylum application. Comments also stated that the rule would deny due process to asylum applicants because they would be unable to afford attorneys to represent them. Numerous other comments claimed that the rule would impose new burdens on social service organizations and state and local governments because asylum applicants unable to work will turn to these sources for assistance. One comment specifically observed that a greater number of Cubans and Haitians will apply for cash and medical benefits under the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980, 8 U.S.C. 1522 note, and suggested that Cubans and Haitians be exempt from the employment authorization limitations under 8 CFR 208.7(a). Another comment contended that applicants paroled into the United States to file asylum claims will lose their work authorization under the proposed rule, which would be unjust because many such parolees have been recognized by the INS to have credible asylum claims. Some comments indicated that the proposed rule is confusing because it does not specify that persons granted asylum are immediately eligible for work authorization and does not provide sufficient detail on how the 150-day waiting period will be measured. Other comments expressed doubt that asylum applicants would actually receive work authorization 180 days after the filing of their applications because of difficulty and confusion in applying the 150-day waiting period. Many comments advocated eliminating the waiting period and maintaining the current rule, which allows immediate applications for employment authorization and issuance within 90 days. Some comments suggested a decrease in the waiting period with one specifically stating that employment authorization valid for 3 to 6 months should be granted at the time of the interview or within 90 days, except for cases deemed ``frivolous'' or ``manifestly unfounded.'' Another comment advised providing exceptions to the waiting period by granting employment authorization immediately or within 90 days to applicants who demonstrate hardship or economic need (such as those with no relatives in the United States or who have small children). Another comment advocated issuing employment authorization at the time of the interview or hearing because it would ensure that applicants appear for their interview or hearing and allow the applicant to receive employment authorization sooner. A number of comments suggested clarification of the 150-day waiting period. One comment noted that the 150-day period should begin when the application is received by the INS, rather than when the application is actually processed. Some comments argued that the INS should notify the applicant in writing of the date of receipt and whether the application is complete. Other comments criticized the provision for an extension of the 150-day period in the case of delays caused by the applicant, and one comment recommended that this aspect be eliminated. Another comment suggested, however, that the applicant be notified when additional information is required and the waiting period be extended only if the additional information is not provided. Other comments asked for clarification as to what actions serve to extend the waiting period, and one comment requested that a mechanism to contest the extension be provided.
