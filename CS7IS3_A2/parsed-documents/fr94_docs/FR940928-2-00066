FR940928-2-00066 FR940928-2-00049 3. Administer physical securities as necessary. B. For each multiclass securities transaction the Trustee shall provide all necessary ongoing Trustee services to the trust for the life of the trust, including: 1. Calculate distributions of principal and interest to multiclass security holders; ensure that amounts owed to the trust are collected by it, that the correct amounts are paid out timely by the trust to the proper security holders, and that accurate records and reports are prepared and furnished to security holders, auditors, and IRS, GNMA and its agents. 2. Properly maintain, report on and, if necessary, access the variance account, which is a separate holding account used to maintain overages/shortages of funds in the Multiclass Securities program. Variance issues arise when cash received from MBS issuers differs from cash payable to Multiclass Security holders, usually because of missing or incorrect information on the factor tape used to calculate multiclass payment factors (the R&hyph;7 tape). To the extent that cash actually received from the issuers is greater than the multiclass distribution amount, that amount will be held in the variance account for payment in the following month and a ``prepayment interest shortfall'' (the Multiclass Security rate less the reinvestment rate) difference will likely be created. The variance account must be established by the Trustee. Losses caused by the prepayment interest shortfall will be paid by GNMA as part of its guarantee obligation. To illustrate the variance process, assume the Trustee receives MBS payments of $100 more than is required to be distributed on the Multiclass Securities for that month. This $100 must be deposited in the variance account by the Trustee until the next month before it is distributed to the investor. Meanwhile, the $100 is earning interest at the reinvestment rate while the Trust owes the investors the multiclass coupon rate, creating negative arbitrage. The Trustee must calculate the prepayment interest shortfall and notify GNMA, which will make the funds available to the Trustee, and/or PTC, prior to payment to the investors. Subsequent to the monthly distributions to the investors, PTC will reconcile the MBS payments received from issuers with distributions made to the trust. This may result in PTC distributing additional cash to the trust or the trust being required to refund overpayments to PTC. Should insufficient funds be available to pay such ``refunds'' from the trust's accounts, then the Trustee will be required to advance such refund until the next distribution date when the Trustee will be reimbursed from funds available in the accounts or from GNMA. The Trustee will establish all accounts needed for each Trust. These currently include the Depository Account at PTC, the Certificated Securities Account for payment of non-book entry distributions, if applicable, and the Variance Account. The variance process will consider all three accounts and therefore, all three accounts will be included in the monthly reconciliation and reporting process. Reporting for the variance process will involve determining any shortfalls prior to the distribution date and notifying GNMA and its agent thereof, as well as subsequent detail reconciliations of payment differences in accordance with procedures and forms prescribed by GNMA. Differences between MBS payments received and amounts distributable to multiclass security holders (MBS factor errors) may also arise because of errors in the computation of tranche factors by the Trustee. In that case, the Trustee is responsible for funding the difference. 3. Indemnify and hold harmless GNMA (including each official, officer and agent of GNMA) from and against any and all losses, claims, demands, liabilities, or expenses (including, without limitation, all attorneys' fees and related charges and expenses) resulting, directly or indirectly, from any Trustee default or other failure to perform under their agreements with or for the benefit of GNMA. Without limiting the foregoing, GNMA's right to indemnification shall include the right to reimbursement of any and all amounts paid by GNMA to any holder of any certificate, security, or pass-through interest as a result of any failure of the Trustee to properly calculate the amount of any required distribution to any such holder or to cause the proper distributions to be made to any such holder, together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the yield on three month treasury securities. 4. All initial and ongoing tax administration with respect to the trusts and, in the case of REMIC transactions, the REMICs. The Trustee may subcontract its tax administration duties, but, if it does so, (i) it must retain the subcontractor for the duration of the Trustee's engagement (unless the subcontractor fails to perform its duties in a satisfactory manner), (ii) the Trustee will retain liability for the proper performance of all tax administration duties and (iii) GNMA must approve the successor tax administrator. Various of the documents in the GNMA multiclass securities program Guide set forth duties of a ``Tax Administrator'' with respect to each Series of securities. The Trustee will be responsible for all of the duties assigned to the Tax Administrator in the GNMA Multiclass Program Guide, as that Guide may be in effect from time to time. Those duties include, but are not limited to the following: a. Startup. Computing the yields, amounts of original issue discount (``OID'') and other information required to be set forth in the OID legends on the securities. The Tax Administrator shall confirm that information with the results of the sponsor, which independently is responsible for producing the same information. The Tax Administrator shall be responsible for supplying such information to trust counsel, which will be responsible for the preparation of the text of the legends. b. Ongoing Accounting. Preparing the federal, state, and local tax returns of the trust and any related REMICs (including the computation of all necessary underlying information), computing the information concerning OID, market discount, premium, interest, and other reportable items on the securities, and forwarding that information to (or otherwise making that information available to) security holders and the IRS. Income tax accounting and reporting shall be done in accordance with the law, tax administration guidelines for accounting set forth in the GNMA Multiclass program Guide or other instructions distributed by GNMA (as those may be in effect from time to time), and accepted industry practice, in that order of priority. The Tax Administrator shall consult with GNMA on any significant tax accounting issues that arise. c. Controversy. The Tax Administrator shall represent the trust and any related REMIC in any inquiry or assessment of liability by the IRS or state or local tax authorities. The Tax Administrator shall keep GNMA and the LA informed of the initiation of any inquiry or assessment of liability and of any significant related development. 5. Rebate_Transfer in a timely manner to GNMA any amounts from PTC as a result of investment earnings on funds received by PTC on the MBS from the date these funds are received to the date the funds are distributed on the Multiclass Securities. These amounts are commonly called the PTC rebate and are distributed quarterly by PTC at this time.
