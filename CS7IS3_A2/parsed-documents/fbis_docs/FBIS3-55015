At the moment, a total of 1,720,000 citizens have been registered in the republic. Meanwhile, the country's population amounts to 2,648,000 people, according to the data of 1991. Vidzups said the foreign passports of the former Soviet Union will be granted to republican citizens in 1994. Only non-citizens residing in the republic will be able to obtain them. Therefore, Latvian citizens intending to travel abroad will have to obtain a passport of the Latvian republic. The work of the visas and passports department is hampered by the fact that the Latvian parliament has not decided yet on the status of foreigners and aliens residing in the republic, Vidzups said. As known, until now Latvian citizens acquiring the republican citizenship for the first time at the age of 16 years old are given a passport of the non-existing Soviet Union.
