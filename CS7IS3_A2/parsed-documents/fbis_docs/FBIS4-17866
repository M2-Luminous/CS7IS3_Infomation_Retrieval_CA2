Pavel Grachev also told journalists that he would immediately inform the Armenian side of this decision and counted on mutual understanding. According to the Russian defense minister, during the talks both sides also discussed some issues concerning putting under Russian control of the Gabelin radar station which has great importance for all Commonwealth countries. These issues will be resolved at the inter-governmental level, the minister stressed. It was almost impossible to foresee such an outcome of the talks between the Russian defense minister and the head of the Azeri Parliament. After all, the talks began from Pavel Grachev's statement that the February 18 agreement on cease-fire in the zone of the Armenian-Azeri conflict, reached between defense minister of these two republics through the mediation of the Russian minister was, to put it mildly, ignored, and did not bring expected results. At the same time, the minister said, Russia continues intermediary efforts offering its version of cessation of the armed conflict and transition to the elimination of its consequences. According to Pavel Grachev, this version was considered at the expert level at the end of March during a meeting in Moscow with the participation of representatives of the conflicting sides and, for the first time, the Minsk group of Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). The Russian defense minister also believes that this project corresponds to the current situation, takes into account the interests of both sides, and it is desirable that they consider it. "We think that this would allow to essentially advance in the settlement of the conflict," Pavel Grachev noted. As for the problems of functioning of the mechanism for control over the implementation of the Russian initiatives, the minister said, both sides should establish joint headquarters. Before the cease-fire in the zone of the conflict the minister proposes to check up controllability of all armed units, first of all stationed on the line of contact. Uncontrolled military units should be moved to the rear, forcibly disarmed and disbanded. After the cessation of fire, combat operations and disengagement of forces, Pavel Grachev believes, it is necessary to create a mutual security zone. Joint headquarters, if they are set up, should establish control over both sides' actions and set up observation posts. Control over the withdrawal of forces will be carried out by observers from the Commonwealth countries and the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). According to Pavel Grachev, he proposed to the Azeri side to bring Russian troops to the line of contact and agreed that these must be military units not stationed in Armenia. The disengagement will be carried out stage-by-stage. In accordance with the russian plan of the settlement of the conflict, Armenian armed units must liberate all earlier seized Azeri territories and return to Nagorno-Karabakh. If both sides agree this region of Azerbaijan will be controlled by Russian troops and international observers. Pavel Grachev made great efforts to convince Rasul Guliyev and parliamentarians accompanying him that the Russian plan of the settlement of the problem is realistic, dispel their doubts about the appearance of a new wave of refugees after the withdrawal of the Azeri Army from the present positions, a confidential source told ITAR-TASS.
