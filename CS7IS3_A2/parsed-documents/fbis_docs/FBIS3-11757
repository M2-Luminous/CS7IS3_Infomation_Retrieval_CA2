[Begin Plancher recording, in Creole] In 1991, Aristide's Commerce and Industry Minister Jean-Francois Chamblain gave his theoretical consent to the project. This clearly means the first works should have normally begun, should have been in process. The communal commission gave its support to the project. On 9 July, there was an authorization regarding the first step. This means the project could have started. But we can say, despite all those expenses made in this area by Port Tortuga S.A., there is not yet any legal document authorizing Port Tortuga to function properly in this area. So far, I am telling you, there is no agreement. The Haitian state has not given its authorization in a definitive manner for the start of the project. [end recording] It should be noted that the Port Tortuga S.A. matter was an oustanding issue during the departure of [Commerce and Industry Minister] Saidel Laine in August 1993. In his memorandum on the occasion of his departure, Dr. Laine pointed out that his successor should contact several officials, such as those of the National Office [of Tourism], the management of juridical affairs, and the consultants to the minister's office. We learned from a source close to the former commerce minister that no decision was made before Laine's departure. Furthermore, we learned that the Port Tortuga S.A. issue was discussed in the Council of Ministers on several occasions and was rejected each time.
