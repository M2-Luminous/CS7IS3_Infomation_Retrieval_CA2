Press reporting has tried to unravel the complicated business operations which led to the arrest and has supported the view that the penal code which went into effect in March will require much more accountability from company directors than before. An article in the Paris financial daily LES ECHOS criticized Belgium for the "unjustifiable" jailing of such a respected figure over what in the past would have been deemed minor events easily resolved in court. An article in the Paris daily LIBERATION questioned Belgium's motives, noting there had been a long history of Belgian resentment against French business aggressiveness in that country. The Event An article in the 8 June issue of the Paris daily LIBERATION was typical of media attempts at explaining Pinau-Valencienne's arrest. It claimed that the events that led to the arrest began in 1992 when Schneider decided to reorganize one of its Belgian subsidiaries, the Cofibel group. Backed by France's Elf oil company, Schneider offered to buy controlling interest in two of the group's companies, the Cofibel holding company and Cofimines. Several Belgian minority shareholders objected to the price offered by Schneider for the shares and accused Schneider of having juggled its accounts and hidden some operations. These shareholders lodged a complaint, which was settled in 1993. However, the Belgian courts decided to pursue their own investigation and at the end of May called Pineau- Valencienne to Brussels and-- "surprising everyone"--arrested him. They also arrested Italian businessman Valentino Foti, founder of the Sirix Intervitrum glassworks company. The two were charged with conducting "financial operations which significantly reduced the assets of Belgian companies" to the detriment of minority shareholders. According to the charges, the Schneider group benefitted, "under suspect conditions, from important liquid assets to the prejudice of Belgian subsidiaries" on the order of some 3 billion Belgian francs (BFr). Moreover, the investigation also involves "offshore affiliates" belonging to the Cofibel and Cofimines companies which according to the Belgian court "remain hidden, as much from shareholders as from regulatory authorities." The dividends from these affiliates, domiciled in tax havens, have evaporated," the court claimed, "to the tune of BFr1.8 billion." Support and Motives In the 30 May issue of LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, an article notes the widespread support Pinau-Valencienne has received from the business community. While this support comes from a wide variety of top French businesses, according to a 2 June article in the same daily, it also includes backing from Schneider's U.S. subsidiary, the Square D company, and from U.S. companies on which Pinau-Valencienne is a board member: Bankers Trust, Equitable Insurance Company, and Whirlpool. The article also claims that the scandal in part is the result of often strained business relationships between Belgium and France. It observes that Belgians often sees the French as "arrogant," especially when they want to buy Belgian companies, such as when the Accor group bought Belgium's Wagon-Lits and Suez bought Societe Generale de Belgique. Belgians fear they are losing their industries' "crown jewels" to the French and have been particularly "attentive" recently to French initiatives in their country, according to the article. With the Schneider affair, old wounds have opened, according to the article's "Belgian sources." They claim that Belgium has not forgotten that Schneider was originally a Belgian company, the remnants of the Empain business empire which made its name in the Belgian Congo before it became independent. These sources add that the intervention of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur--according to Italian Television broadcasts, Balladur contacted Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene about the affair--exacerbated Belgian irritation with France, so much so that Belgian Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet found it necessary to announce that in Belgium's system politics did not intervene, no matter what the case before it. Swiss Connection An article in the 10 June LE FIGARO reports remarks by Luc Jacquier, head of Cofibel and Cofimines's Swiss company Finamines, who confirmed to Swiss and French journalists that Finamines was indeed a "caisse noire" or secret holding." Finamines, the article notes, was created during the 1960's to manage the Empain group's mineral resources after the Congo became independent. According to Jaquier, Finamines's Panamanian holdings, Mitraco and Tramico, had been hidden from tax authorities as well as from shareholders of Cofibel and Cofimines. He pointed out that Pinau-Valencienne may not have been aware of these two companies and that in any case had not personally profited from them. Jaquier claimed these companies were the responsibility of the late Jean Verdoot, former head of Schneider's Belgian companies, and that it was he who signed the payment orders and he who organized the companies. Released from jail on his own recognizance on 7 June, Pinau- Valencienne responded to Jacquier's statements in the 11, 12 June issue of LIBERATION. He explained that the company in Switzerland had been established for the sole purpose of protecting Belgian expatriots. He also declared that Schneider had never received, either directly or indirectly, any money from offshore affiliates, "other than through the Belgian companies Cofibel and Cofimines." The article points out, however, that in the first instance, Pinau- Valencienne did not explain why the Swiss company still existed 30 years after the Congo became independent and, in the second, his affirmation of innocence in receiving offshore money was "curious" since it is precisely the point of the court case against Schneider that fraudulent capital movements were processed through Cofimines and Cofibel. Media Explanations Most Paris financial dailies tried to unravel the complicated facts behind the arrest of Pinau-Valencienne, a clear example of which appeared in an article in the 8 June issue of LIBERATION. The article noted that the charge of defrauding Belgian shareholders revolves around the "common" practice of group affiliates buying shares of other companies in the group to provide fresh capital to the parent company. The parent company is required to buy back the shares at a later date at the same price. However, in December 1990, during one of these operations, Schneider sold its Belgian affiliates 4 percent of it Arbed subsidiary, which Schneider should have then rebought later for the same price, or BFr3,900 per share. In the meantime, the shares had dropped in value to BFr2,000 per share but depreciation was never accounted for in Cofimines's balance sheet. When minority shareholders asked for explanations about the lack of accounting for depreciation, they discovered that not only had the depreciation not been allocated to Cofimines's accounts but that Schneider did not adhere to the requirement to buy Arbed back from Cofimines for the original BFr3,900 per share. Schneider instead undervalued the Arbed shares by BFr580 million at the time of the repurchase. The article also confirms the Belgian courts statement about Schneider owning offshore companies. Schneider's organizational chart currently shows several offshore companies based in Bermuda or Panama, such as Mitraco, Tramico, Itrec, and SHL. The most "mysterious" of these companies, according to the article, is Tramico, based in Panama. Appearing for the first time in Schneider's charts in the mid-1980's, it is officially only 49 percent owned by Schneider, which has never revealed the ownership of the remaining 51 percent. As a minority owner, Schneider does not have to publish, nor consolidate, Tramico's accounts. The article claims that Tramico was the "black hole" in the Cofibel- Schneider galaxy: it bought shares in other companies, resold them some years later, loaned money, and received money. Schneider sold Tramico in October 1992, just before offering to buy a majority share in Cofibel and Cofimines. Other companies may also have been "hidden," the article points out, noting the Belgian court's Swiss investigation. Rumors surrounding the scandal that Schneider is involved in money laundering, according to the article, stem from the fact that one of Cofibel's affiliates was Valentino Foti's Italian-Swiss company Fimo, which in 1991 Italy and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency discovered was laundering money for the Sicilian mafia. Foti is still being held in Belgium and the Italian courts are investigating his part in the scandal. Commentary on Director Responsibility, New Penal Code Articles and editorials in the Paris financial dailies have also focused on the repercussions the arrest has made in the business community, especially the "alarm" it has evoked over the criminal responsibility of the directors of large conglomerates for what occurs on their watch. Assistant director of editing, Didier Pourquery, writing in the 31 May issue of LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, claims the scandal will pose "in clear and worrisome terms" the question of director responsibility. Usually, this responsibility is that of a director to his board or to his shareholders. But today, such responsibility has another sense, a legal responsibility for the activities of the companies over which he presides. In France, a director is responsible before the courts for business, social, stock exchange, and other regulations affecting the normal life of a company. Additionally, he is also criminally responsible under common law for everything that happens in his group, Pourquery continues. It is this last responsibility which must now be giving the heads of numerous groups a "fit of dizziness." On 9 June, deputy director of editing, Francois Roche, writes in the same daily that the scandal will also open debate on how companies are organized and managed. He contends that Schneider is not atypical of those groups composed of multiple companies, some all over the world, which were put together in the 1980's when maximum leveraging was sought for financing purposes. The utility of such organizational structures has been questioned during the last few years and many companies have started to simplify their financial and legal structures to better concentrate financial resources. According to Roche, this is exactly what Pinau- Valencienne was trying to do. However, the debate is also over control, Roche contends. He points out other examples where control procedures over important financial decisions have not worked, such as in cases involving Paribas, Ciments Francais, or with Pechiney in its aluminum operations. At a time when "each pencil and eraser" must be accounted for in a budget, these capital movements often involve hundreds of millions of francs. The problem is thorny, Roche states, because it calls for the head of a company to control the acts of subordinates and partners sometimes near but often far away. Roche concludes that this scandal is of such a magnitude that it certainly justifies new regulations being imposed on large groups. Deputy director of editing of LES ECHOS, Nicolas Beytout, contends that jailing the director of a holding company for the adventures or misadventures of one of its subsidiaries is unjustifiable. He observes that the image of French companies will suffer because of the scandal and that they will have to adopt a new code of conduct, unfortunately similar to what U.S. companies have followed for years. The United States, Beytout claims, is a paradise for lawyers and lawsuits, for a "nitpicking" judiciary, and "obsessional exploitation" of a whole slew of legalities which little by little have been imposed on the business community. He adds that this U.S.-style "drift" is dangerous. It obligates companies to pay inordinate attention to the weakest and most dispersed consumer or minority shareholder. Pineau-Valencienne, who was one of the symbols in the beginning of the 1980's of a divorce between business and politics, and at the beginning of the 1990's a symbol of the new international dimensions of French business, could well be the symbol today of an "eruption" of judges in the daily life of companies, Beytout concludes. An article by Nathalie Hamou in LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES on 31 May states that the new Penal Code, which replaced the Napoleonic Code of 1810, introduced a major innovation into French law--that of the criminal responsibility of legal entities. Companies can in the future, like individuals, be charged by the judicial system for their actions. This new obligation on the part of companies has not gone unnoticed by company directors. Hamou reports that the Confederation of French Employers (CNPF) drew attention to the uncertainties in the new Penal Code a few weeks ago. The CNPF fears that it will reverse the "recent" trend of decriminalizing business- related issues and lead to "repression." The motives of the legislators who wrote the Penal Code were to share the criminal charges between the company and its directors. However, the system is flawed, the CNPF pointed out, since only the criminal responsibility of the directors could be engaged in cases of violations because it was "impossible" to "get at" individual companies. (Dian I. 733-6286) Spain: Key Economic Figures Take a Fall During the last two months the Spanish press has followed closely a series of corruption scandals involving key figures--some of whom are major economic decisionmakers--in Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist government. Among them: -- Former Civil Guard director general Luis Roldan was accused of embezzling millions of dollars and has been a fugitive since April 29. -- Former Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion accepted full responsibility for allowing Roldan to escape and resigned. -- Former governor of the Bank of Spain Mariano Rubio was arrested and sent to jail for tax evasion and insider trading. -- Rubio's financial adviser and former chairman of the Madrid stock exchange Manuel de la Concha was also arrested and jailed on tax fraud charges. -- Former Agriculture Minister Vicente Albero presented his resignation over tax irregularities and connections with the office of Manuel de la Concha. -- Former Finance Minister and parliamentary spokesman leader Carlos Solchaga and former Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera were forced to relinquish their parliamentary seats because of their connections with the Rubio and Roldan cases respectively. Economic Implications According to recent press accounts the corruption scandals will not have long-lasting effects on the economy. Although there is speculation in the media that Gonzalez may not finish out his term as prime minister (ABC 5 May) and reporting that People's Party (PP) Chairman Jose Maria Aznar has repeatedly called for his resignation (El PAIS 6-7 May), a recent article in the 15 May issue of LA VANGUARDIA by Juan Tapia and Enric Tintore disputes this. Tapia and Tintore cite Finance Minister Pedro Solbes as noting, "the danger of political instability has been completely surmounted, and the financial markets are behaving well again." Asked if foreign investment into Spain would be curtailed due to the political uncertainty in Spain, Solbes replied that investments by large companies are planned well in advance and therefore would not be altered by the crisis. He believed that investments by small and medium-sized companies might be delayed but remarked that the government had "accepted its political responsibilities" regarding the corruption cases and he hoped that "no further problems" would arise. IMF Director General Michel Camdessus echoed Solbes's views in an earlier report published in an 11 May article in LA VANGUARDIA by Manuel Estape. In this article, Camdessus stated his belief that the atmosphere of corruption would not affect Spain's economic recovery. He noted that this atmosphere "cannot delay investment decisions amply justified by the macroeconomic prospects and the growth potential" of the Spanish economy.

EU ECO-FIN AGREES ON RULES FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES--An article in LES ECHOS reports that the EU's Eco-Fin Council, which met on 7 June, has found a joint Community position on reinforcing the capacity of EU authorities to regulate financial service companies. A result of the International Bank of Commerce and Credit (BCCI) scandal which caused the EU to review its regulatory practices, the directive Eco- Fin will submit to the EU Parliament is called the "Post-BCCI" directive and will complete the systems already put in place by other EU directives aimed at financial services. The new directive will add a supplemental condition to the others in order for a financial company to be approved in other member countries. The directive stipulates that when a financial company belongs to a group, the group's structure should be sufficiently transparent to allow adequate oversight of the company on an individual basis. The directive also stipulates that credit and insurance companies have their headquarters in the same member state in which they are legally incorporated. Additionally, the directive fleshes out the list of organizations with which the authorities can exchange confidential information and expands auditors' obligations to notify authorities when they come across any irregularities in monitoring financial companies.

According to an article in the Paris daily LE MONDE, the group has agreed on a common research program worth about 12 billion francs (Fr); 40 percent of the financing will be requested from the European Commission within the framework of the Fourth Common Research and Development Program. The article states that this organization is the European response to the American USCar group which receives large government subsidies. EUCARD will focus on research on environmentally clean cars, improved safety devices, and manufacturing methods. (Ruth H. 733-6284) (Paris LE MONDE in French 1 Jun 94 p 21) FRANCE EDITORIAL ON CLINTON, BENTSEN, KANTOR--Deputy director of editing for the Paris business daily LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, Pascal Aubert, writes that President Bill Clinton's visit to Paris on 7 June held no important messages and typified an administration which was "deficient in diplomatic action." Aubert characterized Clinton's speech before the National Assembly as a "warm account" but basically "banal" and U.S. diplomatic discourse as "singularly impoverished and unclear." However, Aubert points out that where Clinton may appear "fluctuating and indecisive" in foreign affairs, his activism on the economic and trade front is not. Clinton excels in this arena, according to Aubert, and the strong U.S. presence in Paris during his visit coincided with a familiar U.S. double offensive against the high interest rate levels in Europe and Japan's deficiency in contributing to world economic recovery. "Through persistence," Treasury Secretary LLoyd Bentsen and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor have acquired a reputation of effectiveness that Clinton should envy, Aubert continues, adding that this is so despite the fact that Germany's Bundesbank "does what it wants when it can" and the Japanese Government "does what it can when it wants." (Dian I. 733-6286) (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 8 Jun 94 P 40) SAPIN SUPPORTS DEFICIT REDUCTION FIRST--Dominique Seux reports that Bank of France Monetary Policy Committee member, Michel Sapin, wants France's deficit reduced before proceeding with efforts to reduce the cost of labor or reduce income taxes. Although Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has announced that he intends to reduce the deficit to around Fr275 billion next year, Sapin apparently wants him to reduce it even further. In making his views public following the government's announcement it would take in about Fr12 billion more this year than initially expected, Sapin has added his voice to the debate over how these supplemental funds should be used. Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy has already suggested that these surplus funds be used to reduce labor costs rather than lower income taxes, and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has indicated that he wanted to do both at the same time. Sapin's position, however, is in line with that of Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet who has sounded the alarm over the French budget deficit--Fr315.6 billion in 1993, Fr301.4 billion expected for 1994. Seux claims Sapin also was reacting to the increase in long term interest rates, which reflect the financial markets' concern over the deficit. However, the French Government for now is thinking of using the extra revenue to finance some Fr20 billion in new expenses not initially forecast, to privatize a state-owned company in the fall, and to cover capital increases for Air France and Bull. To reassure the financial markets, the government has for several weeks repeated that there will not be an increase in the deficit this year and defends part of the new expenses, which will be used to stimulate jobs, as the cost to fight unemployment. Nonetheless, the government cannot avoid the debate over how to use funds which are expected as economic growth continues. Despite Balladur's assurance that the deficit will not increase, the debt service will, Seux contends, and will limit what can be accomplished in other areas. This is all the more true since long-term interest rates have increased. (Dian I. 733-6286) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 7 Jun 94 p 2) COB JUSTIFIES SANCTION POWER--The Stock Exchange Commission (COB), which has recently been criticized for its selective use of sanctions against companies' stock operations, has issued a report defending its powers, claiming they have been proven effective, reports an article in LES ECHOS. In its last monthly bulletin, the COB stated that four years after direct sanction powers were given to the organization, there have been 15 cases where sanctions have been applied. The COB noted that when the market was deregulated and opened to competition, the COB filled a void in policing market operations. At the time, the COB did not have the authority to do so nor did professional organizations. Although there was a penal code for such matters, litigation was very rare and courts were slow to decide on the often media-hyped affairs which needed fast decisions. In any event, the report argued, the legitimacy of COB sanctions exists in legal precedence, such as those practiced by the Competition Council and the High Council on Audiovisual. Although the COB is satisfied with its new sanction power, it admits that it must use it cautiously. In one of the cases annuled by the courts, the textile company VEV affair, the terms of the communique which announced the opening of a sanction procedure had been judged as having influenced the presumption of innocence. The COB report questions, however, how such announcements can be done at all in a society more and more under the influence of the media. Answering such a question is all the more urgent for the COB, which has a mission to protect savings and investment information, according to COB head Pierre Fleuriot. (Dian I. 733-8286) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 8 Jun 94 p 21) GERMANY EXPERT EXPLAINS LAGGING GERMAN INVESTMENTS IN ASIA--In an interview with the DEUTSCHES ALLGEMEINES SONNTAGSBLATT, Oskar Weggel, the head of the Hamburg Institute for Asian Studies, asserts that Germany has "slept through" recent economic developments in Asia. According to Weggel, Germany frequently lags behind such countries as the Netherlands in investments in the region. As an example, he cites the country's failure to take advantage of Vietnam's ties to the former East Germany to get in on the ground floor of Vietnam's rapid development. Weggel attributes Germany's disinterest in Asia to the country's "macabre Eurocentrism," noting that the entire German economy is oriented toward Europe and North America, and to German arrogance, or the notion that everything must be done according to German tradition. Weggel says German firms often ask where the treaties are for the extensive Chinese trading network, because they expect there to be an equivalent of the EU treaties of Rome and Maastricht. In fact, Weggel asserts, informal contacts are much more important in Asia: "Capital means personal trust, the main work is personal relations." Building up a relationship takes time, and German firms are often very short-sighted and unwilling to invest in something that will not pay off immediately. In addition, Weggel argues, medium-sized German companies cannot break into the Asian market because they are afraid of competition and reluctant to band together. He cites the example of a meeting of the Eastern Committee of the German Economy, where firms are requested to ask questions before the lecture begins but everyone waits to do it privately afterward because they are afraid the competition will hear. While acknowledging that German companies receive less help from their government than their French or Austrian counterparts do, Weggel asserts that the government cannot be relied upon as a "cure." (Wendy S. 733-6506) (Hamburg DEUTSCHES ALLGEMEINES SONNTAGSBLATT in German 27 May 94 p 4) ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY FLOURISHING--The German environmental technology industry is flourishing, according to an article in the 18 May FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU. The National Association of the German Waste Disposal Industry (BDE) estimates that the industry's total sales increased last year by 10 percent to about 75-80 billion German marks (DM), with an additional 10-percent growth in sales and employment expected this year. Some 680,000 workers are currently employed in the industry, a number the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) estimates will increase to 1.1 million by the year 2000. The BDE believes the industry would grow even faster if the German Government would pursue a "more rigid" environmental policy. The industry expects, for example, that a further boost to growth would result from a proposed manufacturing recycling law which would require manufacturers to take back and recycle their products. Large companies from outside the environmental technology sector have discovered this growth and moved to acquire small and medium- sized companies in the industry, creating a problematic concentration of business power. The IFO economic research institute has already warned of "cartel-like structures" in the field. Large, well-funded electrical utility companies have been especially active investors and about half of all industry sales now benefit these "energy giants," with around 1,000 small and medium- sized companies dividing up the rest. Environmental industry experts expect the degree of consolidation in the sector to increase even further.

Founded on the initiative of Finance Minister Theo Waigel, the foundation promotes the creativity of small and medium-sized companies in finding practical solutions to environmental problems, provides an impetus for ecological innovation, and reduces the initial risks for companies adopting ecologically friendly production technologies. In addition, the foundation lends support in the areas of environmental technology, research, and education through its provision of ecological information and consulting services. About 70 percent of the projects the foundation has funded are in the new laender. Among them is the Dresden Ecology Center, where environmental experts from business and government meet to exchange experiences and explore new avenues of transferring know-how. In Magdeburg, the foundation is supporting a project which, for the first time, will produce teflon fibers by means of a fluidized solids technique, without the use of heavy metals. The fibers are a versatile asbestos substitute. (Joel S. 733-6503) (Hamburg DIE WELT in German 18 May 94 p WR4) ITALY BANK OF ITALY GOVERNOR ON ECONOMY--At an annual board meeting on 31 May, Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio issued the following observations and warnings: Tax rates: Reducing tax rates would only increase the deficit and the national debt. At 44 percent of GDP, the Italian tax rate is not out of line with those of other EU countries and is in fact lower than in some. Other than for interest rates and pensions, social spending is not out of line when compared internationally. Social welfare: The total projected present value of future social welfare obligations for the present population is 2.4 times GDP. Unless corrective measures are instituted, the yearly cost of social welfare will soon grow more rapidly than national income. Privatizing national insurance is not feasible and would require setting aside capital "equal to half of the national assets" for current obligations alone. Instead, benefits should be gradually limited and a partial private system should be introduced. Doing so would require adequate tax revenues. Pension funds should be encouraged because they will make available massive amounts of capital and will redistribute family assets towards long-term financial investments. Domestic consumption: Encouraging economic recovery by stimulating domestic consumption would require changes in budget policy. At the same time, interest rates would have to increase to keep prices down. Increased investments: Economic recovery should be the result of increased investments. Currently investment seems to be increasing but not enough to make up for the 11-percent drop in 1993. Government procurement contracts: Suspending the Merloni law, which instituted tight controls on government contracts that brought public works to a standstill, was necessary to get public works moving again after a 16-percent drop in employment and investment in 1993. However, government contracting should be carried out in total "transparency and correctness." Tax evasion: Fighting tax evasion is an indirect way of favoring investments and employment. It would lower the tax burden on those who do pay their taxes. To fight tax evasion, controls and collection should be made more efficient. Bank losses: Bank losses primarily due to uncollectible loans are destined to grow. To help address the problem, the banking oversight committee has examined four projects for the partial conversion of loans into stocks. However, banks can vaunt the 60 trillion lire which they have loaned to companies being restructured. Undervalued lira: The lira is still undervalued, although not as much as in the second half of 1993, when in real terms the lira was depreciated even compared to 1987." (Anilla B. 733-6283) (Rome LA REPUBBLICA in Italian 1 Jun 94 p 3) TREASURY MINISTER ON ECONOMIC PLANS--In an interview given to INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE correspondent Alan Friedman, newly appointed Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini discussed the new government's plan for economic recovery. Below is the description of the plan and further details provided by Dini: Employment: Reduce the cost of workers' benefits for employers who hire. Extend this benefit to three years. Establish tax incentives to help companies create new jobs and investments. Simplify the tax system and reduce the kinds of taxes imposed, which now number 200. The government is currently examining three additional initiatives to stimulate employment: accelerate depreciation of new plants and equipment, reimburse taxes tied to investments, and exempt from income tax any profits reinvested by companies. Dini stated that new revenues could be generated to pay for such stimulative measures by raising the value-added tax (VAT) on certain consumer products and by a general pardon for real estate tax evaders. Most importantly, he added, creating new jobs will increase revenue through the taxes paid by the newly employed. Privatizations: "Privatize almost everything" to reduce the government's excessive presence in the economy. Dini stated that he would like to speed up privatization and believed the government could earn 80 trillion lire from the sales. The first state companies to be sold off will be the National Electric Power Board (ENEL) and the Telephone Finance Company (STET). Many companies belonging to the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction (IRI) will also be privatized, among which Finmeccanica and Ilva. Dini said the government's objective is to get out of companies such as IRI altogether and also give up companies belonging to the National Hydrocarbons Company (ENI), such as Agip, Snam, and Snamprogetti. Asked what he thought about the debate over public companies, Dini replied that in the case of STET and ENEL, which provide public services, the government will try to keep a "golden share" to maintain some control. For other companies, the type of privatization will be decided on a case by case basis. For some, the British public company model will be used; for others, a hard core of institutional investors will be created; others will be sold outright to both foreign and national investors. "There is no one absolute model," Dini said, however, efforts must be made to prevent a public monopoly from becoming a private one. Public debt: Dini confirmed that in 1994 the national debt will reach the expected amount of 159 trillion lire. Since Italy intends to go ahead with full integration into the EU, the national debt will have to be reduced. Dini expects the deficit will begin to "stabilize" by 1995 and the trend reversed by approximately 9 percent of GDP. Lira and the EMS: Dini believes the lira is undervalued but that this is helpful for international trade. He would not give a date for the lira's reentry into the European Monetary System (EMS) but doubted it would be this year. EU economy, interest rates: Dini stated he believed Europe was in the middle of a slow economic recovery and could stand lower interest rates without risking inflation. However, he said, Italian interest rate policies must be "very prudent" to avoid high long- term interest rates that would hinder investments. Dini noted, however, that in a global economy, EU rates also depend on U.S. rates.

Some 35 percent of the Swedish firms surveyed said they would probably hire new workers this year, while only 15 percent thought they would reduce their staffs. The difference, 20 percent, tops the corresponding figures for the EU countries. In fact, in most EU countries, more firms planned to lay off workers than hire them. Swedish companies are also more optimistic than EU firms in their expectations for profits, exports, sales, and advertising and marketing. In addition, only 14 percent of Swedish firms thought they would have long-term financing problems while, for example, 31 percent of German companies predicted such difficulties. Anders Meyer of Lindebergs attributes the Swedish optimism to the fact that Swedish firms are starting out at a lower point after the recession. Meyer believes that the initial optimism will have worn off by next year.

OYAK was founded after the 1960 military coup as an officers' treasury that would provide its members with loans at favorable rates, pay contributions to the state pension plan, aid injured veterans, and run vacation homes. Today the organization has 80,000 members, with 10 percent of all officers' and noncommissioned officers' pay going to OYAK. The association owns 25 companies, among which are a French Renault production facility in Turkey, three Turkish automobile manufacturers, six cement factories, several construction firms and food companies, and the Sigorta insurance company. It is currently cooperating with the French company Elf Aquitaine on building a network of some 45 gas stations. OYAK, whose sales have been estimated at DM8.5 billion per year, was one of the few Turkish conglomerates to earn a profit last year; it is exempt from most state taxes and fees. Although Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has promised extensive privatizations of state-owned companies, no politician would dare touch OYAK's "empire." OYAK also shields its members from daily Turkish life: officers live in OYAK subsidized apartments, shop at OYAK discount stores, and vacation at OYAK vacation villages.

Listed in the report are the following suggestions: -- The state should decrease its involvement in the economy. -- The underground economy must be absorbed into the legitimate economy. -- Tax revenues have to be increased by decreasing the tax rate and broadening the tax base. -- The government should support investment activity on a par with foreign competition. -- Foreign trade and investment must be fostered. -- Consensus and stability in the work-force market must be achieved. -- Interest rates must be brought down to the EU median. -- The cost of energy has to be brought down to the EU median. -- Greater importance has to be given to education. -- Economic laws and regulations must be coordinated with those of the EU. -- An economic and social council has to be established. (Ender C. 733-6285) (Istanbul NOKTA in Turkish 3-9 Apr 94 p 32) PRIVATE SECTOR REACTS TO AUSTERITY--According to an article in DUNYA which discusses the government's austerity program, the private sector is "leaning" toward production cuts and layoffs as a way to survive the current economic crisis with minimal losses. The article indicates that private companies have to do so because of decreased sales and higher interest rates. Beyond production cutbacks and layoffs, companies have taken the following measures: -- Scrutinized what they import because of the instability in the foreign exchange markets. -- Begun to pursue new export markets. -- Large companies are closing down their unproductive subsidiaries. -- Minimized inventories and offered incentives for cash purchases. -- Ended long-term payment plans, asking that daily payments be made. In addition, another article on the same page listed specific austerity measures taken by some of Turkey's leading corporations: -- KOC Holding: The company will avoid excessive debt, pursue export markets, withdraw from activity outside its main business. -- Mavi Kablo: It cut back its production by 20 percent, lowered its inventory to a minimum, payed off bank loans to avoid nondaily expenses, stopped investing, adopted a three month budget, and expedited payments. -- Kavala: The company will downsize, cut expenses, and pursue exports. -- Kale Porselen: It has cut all its credit ties with banks, sold TL12 billion of its capital to the public, laid off 50 employees, closed down two of its electroporcelain ovens, and is pursuing exports. -- Alarko Holding: It is waiting to see how effective the government's economic package will be. It is considering stopping investment if there is a snag in its implementation.
