PRD spokesman Julio Ulloa said the campaign of the late Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, was characterized by its inclination to address social problems such as poverty. "This new candidate totally changes the focus of the electoral campaign. Colosio had focused on social issues as has the PRD government program," he pointed out. The spokesman added that because of the post he held in the government, Zedillo's campaign will apparently focus on economic issues and their social repercussions. Since November 1993, Zedillo had been a coordinator for PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio's campaign, who was assassinated on 23 March in Tijuana on the U.S. border. Colosio had realized that addressing poverty was a priority of the times, but this will most probably be placed in the middle level of importance by the new candidate although he will continue the programs of the current government. Ulloa added that the new candidate will make the differences between the campaigns of the PRI and PRD, the country's third electoral force, more evident.
