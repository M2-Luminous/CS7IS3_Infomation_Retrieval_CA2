The studio announcer says that "after bringing in fresh forces from Serbia and Montenegro and mercenaries from Russia, Romania, and other places, the chetniks continued their fierce attacks on Gorazde." Gorazde correspondent Fahrudin Becic reports that "many of them [enemy troops] today remained in the woods in front of the defense lines on Lastan and Popovaca. The warmongers and chetnik commanders simply replaced them with new criminals. The defenders are paying no attention to this, and are readily responding to infantry attacks which follow after every savage shelling. They have repelled 10 such attacks. On the other part of the front, on the route towards Rogatica [words indistinct]. The defenders on the free parts of the Rogatica municipality have repelled several extremely fierce infantry attacks, supported by tanks, howitzers, and multiple rocket launchers. The aggressor also attacked the areas between Mecic and Ustipraca and the area of the 1,207 m high Mt. Gostunj. He suffered losses in all of these attacks. This is confirmed by the fact that 200 blood donors arrived in Cajnice today from Jagodina. As nightfall approaches, the chetnik attacks are intensifying. No one has the time to count all the shells, but according to a rough estimate, over 10,000 shells have landed by 1700." The studio announcer reads a report from the 7-South Operative Group, and says that "chetnik shells killed [stradati] 12 people as they were unloading a humanitarian aid truck in the operational zone of the Croatian Defense Council Usora Brigade. There were small arms' provocations and sniper fire in the operational zone of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade. The aggressor also attacked with antiaircraft weapons in the area of Maglaj. A regrouping of the aggressor forces was sighted in this area." Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko and says that "the Serbian aggressor is still [word indistinct] on artillery attacks. Today, recoilless guns, mortars, portable rocket launchers from Cadjavac and from the direction of Omerbegovaca pounded the defense in the region of Vranovaca. Chetnik antiaircraft guns fiercely shelled Djukici." An unidentified correspondent from the Srebrenica Press Center reports that "the aggressor, using antiaircraft guns and antiaircraft machine guns from Kopresko and Visica Brdo, is relentlessly shelling the border areas of Sutjeska. He is using 60-mm mortars to sporadically shell the region [name indistinct]. [Words indistinct] the aggressor's antiaircraft guns and antiaircraft machine guns are shelling the outskirts of the town. A concentration of manpower and equipment has been sighted in the region of Jasenova, where the aggressor has captured two demilitarized zones."
