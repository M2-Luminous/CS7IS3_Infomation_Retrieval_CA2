In the face of so much misery befalling my motherland and to an increasing number of Cambodians in our provinces, I cannot give up my work to restore peace with national reconciliation. As the cease-fire that I have proposed is not realizable for the time being, I have the honor now of announcing roundtable talks without a preliminary cease-fire at my Chhanghsu-on residence near Pyongyang, the DPRK, within 10 days -- that is, on Friday 27 May 1994. This roundtable, if nececssary, can be extended until Tuesday 31 May 1994. I most respectfully invite to this roundtable His Excellency Samdech Chea Sim, His Royal Highness Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, His Excellency Samdech Hun Sen, and His Excellency Mr. Khieu Samphan, as well as their respective entourages.
