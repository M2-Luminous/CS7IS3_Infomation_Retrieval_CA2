But the process has been suspended. Temporarily, according to the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry. The representatives of Armenia and Karabakh accepted the Russian plan, but the Azerbaijan defense minister needed additional information and left for Baku without signing the document or taking leave of his colleagues. Special envoy Vladimir Kazimirov, leader of the Russian delegation at the talks, then went to the Transcaucasus. On Tuesday and Wednesday he discussed the prevailing situation with local political leaders on the spot. It transpired that the protocol had not been signed "because it contained certain defects." And in particular because a session of parliament had been fixed for Tuesday, at which deputies were demanding a report on the Azerbaijan leadership's actions in connection with the situation in Karabakh. In the conflict zone itself calm is being maintained at the moment. On the whole the sides are fulfilling the cease-fire accords reached in Moscow. Is there a hope that the lull which has set in will end in a peace agreement? Well-informed Azerbaijani sources are accusing Yerevan of disrupting the detailed peace settlement plan, while the Armenian permanent mission blames Baku for the breakdown of the talks. Nevertheless, no one is rejecting the idea of direct contacts between the defense ministers and the commander in chief of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic through the mediation of Army General Pavel Grachev. At the Russian Foreign Ministry they also believe that the chance of peace has not been lost and that 24 May could mark the start of a new life for the two neighboring peoples. Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy defense minister, who is responsible for the peacemaking forces' activity, has even expressed confidence that Azerbaijan will sign the protocol in the near future. And Pavel Grachev himself tends to view the military's actions as an effort to achieve peace. Even though, in his words, certain forces still exist which "are getting rich out of the Karabakh war." In addition, "the people who give the order to wage war never go to the front line; they always command from the rear," Pavel Grachev added. Time will tell whether these hopes are well founded.
