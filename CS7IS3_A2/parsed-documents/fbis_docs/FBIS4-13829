However, we are still the most ancient state in Arab Asia, according to the modern concept of the state. In a few years from now, Jordan's political age will be three-quarters of a century. Archaeologists, moreover, have found in 'Ayn Ghazal a fine agricultural settlement established around the Amman waters more than 6,000 years ago. They used to say Jordan was targeted. We knew our country was targeted. However, they told us this to instill fear in our hearts and make us silent. This is because it is natural for us, when the homeland is in danger, to mobilize the sons of the homeland to defend its security, stability, and political entity, rather than be afraid and remain silent. For years now, the U.S. blockade has been eating away our country. Before Tawfiq Qa'war [president of the Jordanian Shipping Agents Association] raised his voice, a colleague of ours at AL-RA'Y came to us with photos taken by the captain of a ship that was bound for al-'Aqabah with metal pipes on board. The photos show clearly how the U.S. Navy was throwing the pipes into the sea because the "telephone number of the Jordanian importer on the shipping papers was nor legible." The captain of the ship, who is a foreigner, gave the pictures to the press because he was angry and wanted to enrage the public and show the world the vileness of U.S. force. However, our government remained silent. When Tariq Masarwah wrote in AL-RA'Y and when Tawfiq Qa'war gave a statement to AL-RA'Y on everything that was happening in the Gulf of Aqaba, we heard many officials say: "Brothers, our country is targeted, so please let us wisely handle this question with Washington." Voices of protest got louder and the "wise handling" of the affair continued. Christopher then came twice to our country and he promised that "the subject will be reviewed." At an Amman hotel, Christopher gave us glad tidings about future prosperity and affluence once peace is established. When one of those who attended the dinner -- during which Christopher gave the glad tidings -- raised the question of the al-'Aqabah blockade, the eloquent boy said "his government will look at this issue with compassion". The problem exacerbated and the measures of the blockade doubled after each promise. His majesty the king, known for his legendary patience, discussed the question of the blockade with the U.S. President. His royal highness the crown prince also raised the question of the blockade when he visited the United States. They told us: Let him shake hands with a criminal like Shim'on Peres and we will ease the burden of Jordan's debts on the economy and we will lift the blockade of al-'Aqabah. And so we accepted the image of our decent, respectable prince extend his hand to a killer for the good of our country. However, nothing happened and the blockade was tightened and words of caution also increased, such as: Brothers, there is no need for harsh talk in the press because our country is targeted. When things came to a head, his majesty the king summoned the ambassadors of the five permanent Security Council member states. He delivered an unequivocal message: We cannot continue to participate effectively in the peace process while pressure and the blockade are continuing against us. Quickly, those who are "concerned" about Jordan more than King Husayn started to explain the king's words and once again gave us their magical sentence: Brothers, our country is targeted, so let us work quietly. Do you want us to clash with the United States? What strange words. The blockade has been in place for more than two and one-half years and losses have amounted to a billion dollars. How much longer will the people accept the seriousness of this quiet, wise approach? The people do not want to fight America. However, they are asked to defend their country's interests in the face of the tyrant. Washington is using pressure to force us to be the next meal, so as to devour us after the Palestinians. The embargo against Iraq is a lie. It is no secret that we are with Iraq and with the Iraqis who are being starved by the embargo, and with the Iraqis who give us oil, while they are in a situation which we know very well. Are we exporting to Iraq Jordanian-made tanks, missiles, and nuclear reactors? We said to ourselves that the multilateral negotiations on water issues will be held in Muscat on 17 April, so why don't we show up, especially since these negotiations, in the absence of Syria and Lebanon, are no more than an distasteful symposium used by Israeli media to show Israelis tell lies in an Arab capital, while killing the Arabs of Palestine on the streets and in the mosques. Once again, we heard the handy sentence: Brothers, our country is targeted. We will send a very low-level observer, not a negotiator, maybe a third secretary at the embassy. Washington and Tel Aviv do not want a Jordanian negotiator, because there are no negotiations. So why don't we declare our boycott of the multilaterals and deliver a clear threat to boycott the bilaterals? Following his majesty's meeting with the five ambassadors in Amman, Washington expedited the meetings of its subcommittee that is in charge of the al-'Aqabah blockade. But following the clever statement that "interpreted the king's words" and "declared the government's support for it" Washington postponed the meetings of the subcommittee. It was clear that it would drag this question to the Muscat meetings to break his majesty's position. This week, we have seen viler U.S. and Israeli behavior. The blockade was tightened. Rabin and Peres have warned our country because a Hamas statement about the Hadera operation came from Amman, just as it was issued from London and from every place where there is a fax machine. U.S. newspapers and news magazines have started to talk about the smuggling of U.S. military technology via Jordan and Jordan's import of sophisticated U.S. monitoring equipment that can pick up U.S. military contacts in the region. This indecent, off-color talk is full of ill-concocted lies that are strangely in harmony with the statements made by those "concerned" about Jordan in Amman when they say: Brothers, our country is targeted. Brothers, give us a chance to work out things quietly, etc. But how are you going to resolve these problems? Has the al-'Aqabah blockade been lifted? Do you believe that Hamas is in Amman when you see with your own eyes that it is in 'Afula, Gaza, and Hadera? Do we have monitoring equipment that can pick up the contacts of U.S. fleets and aircraft? If a U.S. firm is smuggling technology to Iraq, then do you want to keep it from smuggling in Amman? Why don't the Americans themselves prevent it? The problem is that U.S. and Israeli pressures have a serious parallel trend on the local scene. This parallel trend attracts groups in banks, markets, and Amman's velvet salons. Those people are "concerned" about Jordan, while all of them despise Jordan's interests, dignity, and Arabism. The measure they adopt is: The financial market has come to a standstill; real estate prices are falling; capital is worried, and all such off-color, vile talk that turns the concept of a homeland into one of a tourist and a hotel. We say: When the homeland is targeted, what is required is to sharpen the people's national will to defend their homeland; and when Jordan's stability is targeted, then courage, not cowardice, is the shield of the homeland and the citizen. When Washington and Tel Aviv threaten our interests and destiny, then our reaction should be: No. We should not submit and give in. They are threatening us with the blockade because they will ask us for more tomorrow. If we do not resist now, we will not resist tomorrow. Those who show "concern" laugh when we say: Our people. They also laugh when we say: Our national will and the dignity of our country. And if they condescend and reply to us, they will say without any shame: Brothers, where do you live? Have you not seen what happens to those who say no? But when we ask them: Can you tell us what happens to those who say yes, they turn their faces away. We say: Our country is not an eggshell. It is a true homeland that deserves our fighting any party for its good.
