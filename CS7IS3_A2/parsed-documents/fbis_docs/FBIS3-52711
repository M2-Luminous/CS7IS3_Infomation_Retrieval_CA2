"After several attempt to discuss with the leadership the absence of democracy and consultation within Fatah, we had no choice but to resign," said 33-year-old Jibril al-Bakri. "The leadership has appointed to positions of responsibility people who have nothing to do with Fatah", al-Bakri said, but refused to explain. Husayn al-Nazir, 30, and Diyab al-Sharabati, 35, resigned from Fatah's High Committee in Hebron along with al-Bakri. Their move follows a walkout at the end of December by three leaders of the Fatah youth movement in Gaza after 'Arafat gave top jobs to aging Palestinians who played little part in the uprising or intifadah. The Fatah chief for the north of the West Bank also stood down. "These resignations reflect a crisis as Fatah changes into a political party, said Jamal al-Shubaqi, another senior Fatah figure in Hebron. The Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee met in Tunis this week to discuss democratization after a petition from 120 leading Palestinian figures.
