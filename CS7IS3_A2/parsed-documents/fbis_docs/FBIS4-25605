Latest figures show that the seeded area this spring in Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces increased by nearly one million hectares, including 400,000 hectares of beans and wheat, and more high-yielding crops such as corn and rice were sown. This will increase the grain output in the region by an estimated 7.2 billion kg this year, said a local grain production planning official. By mid-may, Heilongjiang Province had injected more than 5.73 billion yuan to boost its agricultural production. The major part of the funds -- 65.3 percent -- was raised by the farmers. In Liaoning and Jilin, more money has been used to buy fertilizers. In addition, over 250 million cu m of manure has been applied in Liaoning and Heilongjiang. Northeast China's total of cultivated land is 16 million hectares, and its rural population numbers 57 million. It is one of the country's biggest grain producers, with advanced mechanized farm machinery. The region's overall grain output last year reached a record 60 billion kg, accounting for 13 percent of the country's total.
