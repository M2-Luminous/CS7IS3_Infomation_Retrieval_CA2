As a result of diplomatic contacts between Washington and Jerusalem and following a telephone conversation between Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the secretary agreed to modify the Egyptian demand and support a multinational discussion of issues relating only to regional legislation on handling nuclear waste. Christopher accepted Israel's position that Egypt's charges that Israel is mishandling nuclear waste should be broached by the two countries on a bilateral level and not at the multinational talks. The Egyptian demand is part of the very energetic campaign regarding Israel's nuclear ability which Egypt is waging at the multinational talks on armament issues as well. Two days ago, before The Hague talks started, the Egyptians warned they would boycott the talks if their demand to discuss nuclear waste is not accepted. They changed their mind only after the United States intervened. Last night, Israeli sources expressed concern over the U.S. support -- partial though it may be -- for the Egyptian stand. The sources said that ever since the new U.S. Administration came into power, there has been a constant threat of conflict between it and Israel in view of Washington's determined policy on nuclear nonproliferation. Because of the close U.S.-Israeli contacts, the issue has not come up yet.
