In Lieu of a Confession of a `Typical Businessman Engaged in the Shadow Economy'"] [Text] "He who observes the wind will not sow; and he who regards the clouds will not reap." (Ecclesiastes 11:4) The Hromada All-Ukrainian Association was created only two months ago, yet the press has already carried numerous articles, whose authors have focused their attention on one small element of our economic program -- i.e., the need to legalize Ukraine's shadow economy. In the process, some journalists are also reporting the "sensational" discovery that Hromada is striving to win power as the representative of the interests of those engaged in unauthorized economic activity. In an attempt to meet all such "penetrating" authors halfway, let me try to elucidate some of our economic views through the prism of the legalization of the shadow economy. There is no need to elaborate painstakingly on the economic situation in Ukraine. We are all quite familiar with the reigning atmosphere of bureacratic anarchy and administrative chaos, the fuel and energy crisis, the burden of direct and indirect taxes on enterprises that is beyond their ability to carry, and the various deductions from wages that have long since passed the 50-percent level. Add to this the hyperinflation that no one anticipated, the across-the-board drop in production, the legal jumble, the confiscation from exporters of 50 percent of their hard currency earnings in accordance with a fixed exchange rate made up by officials, and then put yourself in the place of an entrepreneur or enterprise director. The novice entrepreneur's actions adhere to approximately the following pattern: he borrows capital at an exorbitant rate of interest, gives the bank his privatized apartment as security, pays a bribe to lease a shop, buys raw materials, hires employees, produces and sells finished production, and pays all his taxes and deductions to the state. Despite all of the state's efforts, he accomplishes the impossible -- he makes a profit. Wanting to make an official salary, the subject of our study must not orget to deduct from it the tax on profits. Beginning with the amount in excess of 50 official minimum wage rates, the profits tax rate is a mere 90 percent. Translated into real purchasing power, this "salary" then amounts to no more than the average Soviet engineer earned in the seventies. Thus, the state as personified by the government, the National Bank, and the Supreme Council is destroying any economic rationale for the existence and growth of enterprise regardless of forms of ownership, and proposes to the entrepreneur that he accomplish a titanic, often very risky task in order to give back to the state 90 percent of his honestly earned and declared income. Even assuming that owing of some mental aberration such an entrepreneur is found, he will be able to perform this trick only once or at most twice. That is because what the state does not take away officially, it will take away through hyperinflation as it tries to fill the bottomless holes in the budget through seigniorage -- namely, revenues obtained through monetary emission. Working capital is devalued, and there is no money to replace capital stock. This cycle can only be repeated in a decremental mode. Adding to the prospect of inevitable collapse are the general decrease in production and the sharp drop in the people's purchasing power, which is causing a rapid shrinking of the raw materials market and product sales. Are the state and those whom it has an obligation to support (the nonproduction sphere, pensioners, invalids, etc.) growing richer by stripping hired workers, entrepreneurs, and enterprises in general of everything? Definitely not! A state that has adopted a policy of openly robbing its own citizens has reached the point of economic absurdity: the more it takes, the less it gets. The reason for this is simple. When resistance to robbery is not possible, there are only two alternatives left. The first is to give away all that one has and go begging. The second is to try and hide what one owns -- if not everything, then at least some portion of it. In their struggle to survive, most enterprises and entrepreneurs choose the second way. They choose to conceal their economic activity from the state by engaging in what has been known since the days of developed socialism as the "shadow economy." But whereas those who set up shop in the seventies were driven into the shadows by the Criminal Code, our contemporaries have been driven into the shadows by economic expediency. It is important to distinguish between the "national" shadow economy and the traditional business of organized crime--trafficking in drugs, arms, people, prostitution, racketeering. These forms of activity are illegal in all civilized countries, and they have no direct link to the level of economic development attained by these countries. Our state, on the other hand, with its inept tax, foreign trade, credit and finance, and investment policies is driving the overwhelming majority of enterprises into the shadows or forcing them to close. How does the shadow economy work? Mainly, this entails hiding capital from the state's fiscal services and exporting it from the country. Countless variations have been worked out. These include unaccounted for cash transactions, disguising profits as production costs, deliberately withholding income from the sale of goods in "undeclared" accounts (for the most part located abroad), transferring the difference between the real and undervalued contractual price into private accounts, etc. There are hundreds of highly perfected financial schemes for concealing and exporting capital, specifically adapted to the way that banks, industrial enterprises, or agricultural concerns operate. But it is not only traditional economic structures and the individuals who run their operations that are part of the shadow economy. Increasingly more private citizens, beginning with the children who wash cars in the street and ending with the veterans who sell their war medals, are easing to report their earnings to the state. At legal and illegal markets and "barakholky," millions of citizens sell a variety of goods -- ranging from contraband consumer goods to ficus plants grown on the balcony. For others, cottage industries and "moonlighting" have become a source of survival -- from knitting socks to building garages and summer dachas. But none of them -- from individuals with doctoral degrees who hold second jobs as night watchmen to professional beggars -- are in any hurry to stand in line to declare additional earnings to the tax inspectors. Thus, concealing from the state the kopecks they earn, they join the nationwide shadow economy in their struggle to survive. One can now state with confidence that almost the entire economic infrastructure of the young independent state is bound up in a single shadow conglomerate. This shadow has now covered the whole of Ukraine! One would think that it matters not what you call a chicken, as long as it lays eggs. Let our whole economy become a shadow economy, just so long as it works. But as all of us discover every day, the shadow economy is much too inefficient. Capital cannot be kept in a cage that is convenient for officials. It is very active and will always move to where it can be most effectively used. It is especially apt to leave any space that is not suited to its existence. That is why capital is fleeing Ukraine, and where flight is impossible, it is being hidden in dark corners where the fiscal services cannot reach it. Huge amounts of illegally exported capital from Ukraine are now working to increase the prosperity of other countries, creating new jobs there and filling their markets with new products and services. This loss to Ukraine cannot be compensated by foreign credits, or by humanitarian aid, or by the sale of the Black Sea Fleet and nuclear missiles. Another problem is that capital that circulates in the shadow economy cannot be used for large-scale investment in the means of production because this would immediately "bring it into the light." Saving profits that have been hidden from the state in the form of the national currency also makes no sense. Hence these funds are converted into convertible currencies and exported out of the country. Consequently, economic structures that rely on the shadow turnover of capital lack the opportunity for extensive capital renewal and generally show a tendency to fail. Moreover, unauthorized (cash) turnover is easiest for trade enterprises and small enterprises, while large industrial enterprises are forced to combine operating within the legal economy with illegal activities. In the case of large industries, the shadow component consists mostly of manipulating the difference between the sale price and the demand price, in "working" receipts (usually in hard currency) by retaining them on deposit accounts or by channeling them through more complex financial schemes. But the shadow portion of such a mixed economy most often serves only the interests of the directors of large state enterprises and cannot compensate an enterprise's costs in the legal sector of the economy, where it has to officially pay its employees, service production, buy raw materials, and so on. That is why the majority of large enterprises have now been brought to a state of collapse by the state's economic policy. They are simply too large to be able to hide in the shadows (recall the fate of the dinosaurs when the climate deteriorated sharply). The shadow economy engenders yet another very dangerous problem. It promotes the rapid growth and rising power of organized crime. The ordinary, law-abiding citizen in our country, who has worked his entire life for the state, is helpless when faced by a criminal. However, he can draw attention to himself and turn to the state for protection. The citizen engaged in unauthorized economic activity does not have even this option available to him. Criminals know this, and as a result, instead of the tax inspectorate, those working in the shadows have to deal with racketeers. Criminal gangs are better versed in the laws of the market than their "colleagues" in the state apparatus. Consequently, only very rarely do they impose a 90-percent tax rate; they usually settle for 10 to 30 percent. But we should not idealize the common sense of the shadow economy "inspectors." Sooner or later, the criminal world attempts to take over the whole "business." The alternative to this is very often the lethal end of the "shadow businessman." As a result, an active process of criminalizing the shadow economy is under way, a process of criminal "statization." This, in turn, sharply reduces the effectiveness of the shadow economy and raises the prices of finished products because of "additional" costs and the incompetence of the new owners. Ultimately, all of this makes the employees of such enterprises and the "free" entrepreneurs hostage to the plans of criminals. Let us ask ourselves the traditional question: "Who gains from the economy being driven into the shadows?" First, organized crime is interested in having the state push the legal economy into the shadows, because the shadows are crime's traditional patrimony. Second, today the interests of organized crime coincide objectively with a whole bouquet of interests of officialdom's ruling leadership, above all, because the harsh government regulation that is devastating the economy gives officials the power to dole out the beneficia they control: credit resources, currency, licenses, quotas, etc. Furthermore, large-scale illegal export of capital is impossible without the "cover" provided by highly placed state officials, who "deservedly" become the partners of exporters. The issuance of permits for temporary legal survival (namely, temporary exemptions from taxes or payment of customs duties) is also a profitable business. Nor does organized crime skimp on rewarding its "benefactors." A merging of the interests of the state's and organized crime's upper echelons is taking place. I have deliberately avoided using the term "mafia" in this article, because it has become so all-encompassing here that it is applied to everybody -- ranging from high officials knee-deep in corruption to small-time pickpockets. In listing all the parties interested in the "shadowization" of the economy, we cannot ignore the real advantages obtained by Western countries, their banking and industrial structures, from the infusion into their economic systems of our financial, raw material, and professional potential. Lastly, the political gains from the economic ruin being wreaked by the ex-Bolsheviks are being shared by our neo-Bolsheviks (Communists, Socialists and Co.). Inasmuch as, in addition to the complete discreditation of market reforms and the collapse of the economy, their "comrades" (former, to be sure) have also put business outside the law, creating a basis for widespread "revolutionary" dissatisfaction among the masses as well as the prospect of future legalized expropriations. Therefore, if we are to talk of who is not interested in the "shadowization" of the economy, we need to point out that this group consists of all those entrepreneurs and enterprise directors for whom working in the shadows means constantly risking their lives, large additional expenses (protection, the cost of establishing accounts abroad, levies by officials and criminals, etc.), being excluded from the Ukrainian market, and having to constantly face the prospect of losing everything they have. Apart from them, of course, the shadow economy brings hunger, poverty, lawlessness, and coercion to the overwhelming majority of Ukraine's people. That is why those working in the shadows want to emerge "into the light" -- an outcome that would benefit everybody. The left and right of various hues are bruiting around recipes for resolutely combatting the shadow economy. But inasmuch as today the term "shadow" has to be applied to practically every element of the conomic space of Ukraine, the slogan that results is "Fight the economy!". And this is something that the country's government has already been vigorously engaged in for the last few years. Thus, the substitution of one set of "warriors" with another will result in no more than an insignificant reassignment of official feeding troughs. In my opinion, if we are truly serious about saving the economy, there is only one solution -- creating conditions to legalize it. Conditions, in which it would be profitable to invest capital in Ukrainian enterprises, profitable and safe to hold money on deposit in Ukrainian banks, conditions in which under a reasonable tax law it would be more expedient not to conceal income because the state would protect it rather than rob one of it. The recipe for legalization is simple and easily understood -- it is necessary to create better conditions for business in Ukraine than outside it, lower taxes, create a more conducive investment regime, remove restrictions on exports of finished products, put an end to the forced confiscation of earned foreign currency, etc. The public can learn more details about the ways to heal (legalize) the national economy by reading the program documents of Hromada, which holds one of its principal tasks to be to unite the healthy economic and political forces in our society in order to lead our economy out of the shadows and to check criminal-bureaucratic anarchy. That is why we want to "legalize shadow capital." We are convinced that the creation of conditions for legalizing the economy is the only way to save Ukraine from the stifling shadow that has covered the country and is transforming every living thing in it into mouldy rot.
