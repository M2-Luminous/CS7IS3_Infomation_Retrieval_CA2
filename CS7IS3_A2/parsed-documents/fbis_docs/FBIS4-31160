"We have not yet fixed a location and date for further negotiations between Knin and Zagreb. I am not sure how some news organizations have come up with reports that this is going to take place in Athens," Mikelic told Obrenovac Radio. "Our attitude is known anyway; anywhere except in Germany or within Croatia's borders," Mikelic added. He stressed that he was waiting for the next meeting with cochairmen Owen and Stoltenberg which will probably take place next week in Geneva. "Only when we have presented our arguments and heard their opinion will we decide where to hold further negotiations," Mikelic said. The RSK prime minister said that the dispute over where to hold talks "increasingly resembles a match that is under way." [as received] He accuses the three EU ambassadors who released a six-point statement in Knin in early May, thereby prejudicing a political solution, of stalling the negotiations. Asked by the Obrenovac Radio presenter about a possible alliance between Italy and the RSK, Mikelic said that he would soon meet Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi and that he saw no reason why Krajina should not cooperate with one of Europe's economic powers. "At the moment Croatia should pay more attention to Dalmatia and Istria than to us. First, we are another country. Second, they should save whatever can be saved. Certainly, the Kuna will not save them but let Europe witness where Croatia has ended up under the leadership of the Croatian Democratic Union," Mikelic told Obrenovac Radio.
