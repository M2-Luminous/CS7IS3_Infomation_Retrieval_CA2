FR940124-0-00010 FR940124-0-00001 Neither NRDC nor Utah International, supra, supports awards of costs and expenses in connection with predecisional nonadjudicatory administrative proceedings. Therefore, by restricting awards to contested case proceedings, the Wyoming amendments do not inappropriately limit the scope of proceedings in which participants may be eligible for an award of costs and expenses. Additionally, as discussed in finding 2, the Secretary's approval is predicated upon Wyoming's interpretation of the term ``contested case'' to include all classes of actions in which participants would be eligible for an award of costs and expenses under 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295. 2. WOC, PRBRC, and NWF stated that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(i), which provides that, to receive an award of costs and expenses from the State, the issues resolved in the proceeding must be those raised in the original complaint within certain statutory timeframes or within an enforcement action, is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43 CFR 4.1294(b) in that it would improperly narrow the type of proceedings for which an award could be made. As discussed in finding 3, the Secretary agrees, and is not approving this provision. 3. WOC, PRBRC, and NWF stated that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(ii), which provides that, to receive an award of costs and expenses from the State, the contribution of a person who did not initiate a proceeding must be separate and distinct from the contribution of the person initiating the proceeding, is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43 CFR 4.1294(b), which do not contain this provision. For the reasons set forth in detail in finding 4, the Secretary does not agree. NWF also objected to the lack of a definition for ``initiate.'' However, the commenter provided no explanation of why such a definition is necessary. Since the Secretary is unaware of any confusion as to the meaning of this term, which appears to be clear on its face, the Secretary is not requiring that Wyoming provide the definition requested by the commenter. NWF further stated that this Wyoming statutory provision is in conflict with the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure, which do not contain equivalent language. In response, the Secretary notes that, like the Federal rules at 43 CFR 4.1294(b), Section 2.a.(3) of chapter V of the Wyoming rules requires that a person make a substantial contribution to a full and fair determination of the issues to be eligible for an award of costs and expenses from the regulatory authority. The preamble to 43 CFR 4.1294 contains the following discussion: One comment suggested that the initiator should be required to make a contribution separate and distinct from OSM in order to be eligible to recover an award of costs. The final regulation was not revised to accommodate this comment. However, the requirement that a contribution be ``substantial'' precludes an award if a contribution simply duplicates that of OSM. 50 FR 47223, November 15, 1985. Therefore, as explained in finding 4, the Secretary finds that the ``separate and distinct'' requirement is an implicit component of the ``substantial contribution'' requirement, and that there is no conflict between the statute and the regulations on this matter. 4. WOC, PRBRC, and NWF stated that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(iii), which provides that, to receive an award of costs and expenses from the State, a person must establish the existence of a specific violation of applicable statute or rule, is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43 CFR 4.1294(b). As discussed in detail in finding 5, the Secretary agrees, and is not approving this provision. 5. PRBRC stated that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) is inconsistent with 43 CFR 4.1294(d) because it gives the court or the Director the discretion to assess awards against any person as deemed proper, without reference to whether the person participated in bad faith for the purpose of harassing or embarrassing the permittee. In response, the Secretary notes that the provision to which the commenter refers is included in Chapter V of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure (see paragraphs (2)(a), (4), and (5) of Section 2.a.). 6. PRBRC noted that Chapter V, Section 1 of DEQ's Rules of Practice and Procedure does not clearly indicate whether a petition for an award of costs and expenses is to be filed with the EQC or the Director of the DEQ. While this statement is correct, Sections 2 and 3 of the DEQ Rules clearly assign responsibility for processing these petitions to the EQC. As discussed in finding 1, the Secretary agrees that language to the contrary in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) is confusing and inconsistent with 43 CFR 4.1291, and is not approving the conflicting language. 7. PRBRC noted that DEQ's Rules of Practice and Procedure do not contain a counterpart to 43 CFR 4.1296. As discussed in finding 1, no State counterpart is needed since, unlike the two-tiered Federal administrative review system, Wyoming has only one administrative review entity, the EQC. Hence, administrative review of EQC decisions is not possible. Likewise, the Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1296 do not provide for administrative review of a petition originally decided by the Interior Board of Land Appeals, the higher-level administrative review body under the Federal system. 8. WOC objected to the lack of a State counterpart to 43 CFR 4.1294(a)(2). As discussed in detail in finding 1, no State counterpart is needed since affected parties have the right to file petitions directly with OSM; there is no requirement to first exhaust any available State remedies.
