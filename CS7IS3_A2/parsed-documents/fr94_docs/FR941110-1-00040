FR941110-1-00040 FR941110-1-00010 Record evidence shows that any handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions in fresh market channels, including intrastate shipments, exerts an influence on all other handling of such onions and vice versa. Therefore, because such shipments directly burden, obstruct, or affect such commerce, all handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in the proposed production area should be covered by the order, and an order for Walla Walla Sweet Onions is supported by the evidence in the record of hearing. 2. The record indicates that onions are grown in each of the 50 States, but commercial production is concentrated in a few. There are three major seasonal groups of U.S. dry onions. They include spring onions produced mainly in Georgia, Texas, and California; summer non-storage onions grown in New Mexico, Texas, and Washington; and summer storage onions produced mostly in Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Utah, Minnesota, Washington, and Wisconsin. The record also indicates that during its season, the Walla Walla Sweet Onion industry faces strong competition from other summer non-storage onion suppliers. Two major competitors are New Mexico, which, in 1992 accounted for 74 percent of the summer non-storage crop, and the High Plains and Trans-Pecos areas of Texas, with 17 percent of the crop. The shipping season for Walla Walla Sweet Onions runs from late June through early August each year. About 23 percent of the volume moves in June, about 40 percent in July, and the remaining 37 percent is shipped in August. As is true with other commodities, sellers of onions conduct their businesses to obtain maximum returns for the product they have for sale. Handlers and other sellers therefore continually survey all accessible markets so that they may take advantage of the best possible prices available. Further, they constantly attempt to develop demand and seek new markets for their product. Likewise, onion buyers consider prices and availability of onions from all sources in making their purchasing decisions. Frequent market news reports of onion prices are available in shipping areas, and means of rapid communication are readily available. For these reasons, onion supplies and prices in any one location are promptly known elsewhere and have a direct effect on onion supplies and prices in other locations. Summer storage onions normally account for over half the U.S. dry onion crop. About 55 percent of the 1993 dry onion crop was summer storage compared to 59 percent in 1992. The two principal types of onions grown for the summer storage crop are globe and sweet Spanish type onions. Globe onions are the dominant type grown in the midwest and east and are not generally adaptable to production in the southern States. They tend to have a strong flavor, are firm to hard to the touch, and keep well under proper storage conditions. Spanish type onions are particularly well adapted to production in the western States. They are noted for their milder, sweeter flavor, but have a more limited storage life than globes. Onions grown in the northern States are harvested primarily in July and August, and the bulk of the crop is placed in storage. Marketing of the late-summer onion crop begins shortly after harvest and continues through the fall and winter and into the spring months. Spring non-storage onions rank second in seasonal importance. Production totaled eight million hundredweight in 1993, 14 percent of the U.S. total. Spring crop onions are grown primarily in the southern States and are principally of the Grano and Granex types. These types of onions are typically sweeter and milder than the globe type. Additionally, they are more tender and perishable than either the globe or Spanish type onion. Unlike the summer storage onion crop, the spring crop is marketed relatively soon after harvest. Major producers of the spring onion crop are California, Texas, Arizona, and Georgia. Summer non-storage production reached only 4.8 million hundredweight in 1993, but this was a record crop for summer non-storage production; the 1992 crop was 4.3 million hundredweight. Testimony indicated that onions were first planted commercially in Walla Walla County, Washington, located in what is now known as the Walla Walla Valley around the year 1900. According to testimony, it was discovered that the unique growing conditions in this area of southeastern Washington and northeastern Oregon, particularly the low sulfur content of the soil, yielded a sweeter, milder onion than those grown elsewhere. In 1915, 500 carlots consisting of 300 100-pound sacks each were grown and shipped from the outskirts of Walla Walla. The record indicates that the majority of current commercial non-storage onion production in Washington is in the Walla Walla Valley. Testimony shows that separate acreage, price, and production statistics are not available for the Walla Walla Valley alone, but also include other areas in Washington, such as the Tri-cities area, the Yakima Valley, and the Columbia River Basin. The record indicates that neither the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) nor State reporting services for Washington and Oregon report separate statistics for Walla Walla Sweet Onions. Such statistics are grouped together as summer-non storage onions. Witnesses testified that Walla Walla Sweet Onion acreage is included in the total for Washington non-storage onions, so that any figure representing Walla Walla Sweet Onions is necessarily an estimate. Moreover, no statistical data are available for Umatilla County, Oregon, although one witness testified that perhaps 150 to 200 acres of Walla Walla Sweet Onions may be grown. As reported by NASS, summer non-storage onions grown in Washington in 1980 totaled 780 acres, increasing until 1988 when 1,600 acres were harvested. Since then, acreage has declined to 1,000 acres in 1992. Testimony was offered that Walla Walla Sweet Onion acreage has been declining at the rate of about 100 acres per year. Moreover, although harvested acreage in Washington for 1991 was reported as 900 acres, the record indicates that the total number of acres of sweet onions harvested in the Walla Walla Valley was as little as half that, the remaining acreage being in other areas in the State. Washington summer non-storage acreage currently accounts for about .71 percent of the U.S. annual total, and an estimated 9 percent of the summer non-storage crop. Washington accounts for less than a tenth of summer non-storage onion production, however, because Washington's acreage is much less than that of competing growing areas in New Mexico and Texas. The record indicates that the average yield for the Washington summer non-storage onion crop in 1992 was about 390 hundredweight per acre. This compares with the average yield for all summer non-storage onions of 341 hundredweight per acre. Walla Walla Sweet Onion plantings begin about September 10 and end as late as October. The majority of growers attempt to have most of the crop planted by mid- to late-September. Since the growing season spans the winter months, freeze damage to Walla Walla Sweet Onions is a risk growers face each year. Harvest typically begins in the following June. Walla Walla Sweet Onions are shipped from June through August, with peak volume moving in July. Statistical data indicate that production of non-storage onions in Washington has risen in recent years, totaling 29.7 million pounds in 1991, 39.0 million pounds in 1992, and 36.0 million pounds in 1993. The record indicates that one weakness in current post harvest handling practices is storage life. Current produced varieties of Walla Walla Sweet Onions are highly perishable and cannot be stored for extended periods. Preliminary research has shown that the life of Walla Walla Sweet Onions can be extended by low temperature storage. Additionally, the identification of varieties with longer storage capability would benefit the industry. The record indicates that further extending the storage life of Walla Walla Sweet Onions has become a critical need of the industry, particularly in view of its competitive pressures. Witnesses testified that the relatively short life of Walla Walla Sweet Onions accentuates the industry's marketing risks by adding an urgency to move the produce quickly into wholesale and retail channels without regard to existing supplies and prices in those markets. The proposed order would authorize production research projects to address these problems.
