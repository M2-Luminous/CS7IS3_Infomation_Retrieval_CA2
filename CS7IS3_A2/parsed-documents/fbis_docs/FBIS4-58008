Herrera Cabral said the ban on the entry of Haitians to buy food "is excessive" and they should be allowed to buy food. He added that "Haiti cannot be turned into a prison or an immense concentration camp," seeking to justify his position of allowing Haitians to enter to buy food. Since last Friday, Dominican troops have been preventing Dominicans and Haitians from crossing the border to buy or sell products. Up to last Friday, Haitians had been allowed to enter for several hours on Mondays and Fridays to sell their products. They took advantage of the opportunity to buy dry goods which are scarce in Haiti. Increased border vigilance began after Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer committed with UN negotiator Dante Caputo and William Gray, U.S. Government delegate, to completely close the border with Haiti. Regarding UN observers who will arrive in the Dominican Republic to supervise fulfillment of the embargo, he explained they will not bring military equipment or troops. Herrera Cabral said: "Military equipment is not needed to control a disarmed and hungry people." Herrera Cabral added that the UN observers are coming with logistical equipment to support the border surveillance by Dominican military. Miguel Bermeo Estrella, UN delegate in Santo Domingo, told EFE that the observer mission will arrive in Santo Domingo after UN Secretary General Butros-Ghali studies the report prepared by the mission that assessed the situation two weeks ago at the border of the Caribbean island. Bermeo Estrella said the sending of the mission observers will depend on Butros-Ghali's decision. As for the scope of the total embargo, Bermeo Estrella explained that "humanitarian aid" programs are being conducted to prevent poverty and hunger from further destroying the Haitian people.
