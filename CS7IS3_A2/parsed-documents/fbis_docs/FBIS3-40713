Kumaramangalam, Union Minister of State for Science and Technology as well as Parliamentary Affairs, has been "ejected" from the Cabinet by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, on the eve of the winter session of Parliament, commencing tomorrow, apparently for criticising him (Mr. Rao) for the party's poll debacle in Uttar Pradesh. The formalities in this respect have not been completed, as the President, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, is away. But the acceptance of the resignation forwarded by the Prime Minister is a mere technicality. The President is expected back tomorrow. The recommendation to drop Mr. Kumaramangalam from office has been sent to him. The Minister himself was not available for comment, but sources close to him said that he had not written to the Prime Minister offering to quit. This tended to confirm the report that the Minister's resignation had been sought by Mr. Rao. Mr. Kumaramangalam is the third Minister from Tamil Nadu to go out of the Union Council of Ministers, the earlier two being Mr. K. Ramamurthy and Mr. P. Chidambaram. Interestingly, Mr. Kumaramangalam had offered to quit the Government when the Cauvery water issue hotted [as printed] up between his State and Karnataka. Clearly, Mr. Kumaramangalam's stinging letter to Mr. Rao on the party's election debacle in U.P. and Delhi, in which the Prime Minister was criticised for his handling of the party affairs, and the virtual dismissal of the entire Congress Working Committee (CWC) sought, has cost him his job. Mr. Rao moved against the Minister on the eve of a meeting of the CWC which is likely to go into the kind of issues highlighted by Mr. Kumaramangalam. It is to be seen if this has a sobering effect at the CWC. Mr. Kumaramangalam, in his letter, had also said that he would be obliged to take "further steps" if his suggestion for the resignation of the entire CWC was not accepted. This was widely interpreted as an offer of resignation. Subsequently, however, the Minister clarified that his was not a case of revolt, and that he was not criticising the Government, but the conduct of party affairs. During his tenure under the leadership of Mr. Rao, the outgoing Minister was engaged in some important Government activity, including the attempted resolution of the Ayodhya crisis before the demolition of the disputed structure. However, sources said that Mr. Kumaramangalam had developed differences with the thrust of the Government's economic policies and had lately been voicing his concern in official quarters.
