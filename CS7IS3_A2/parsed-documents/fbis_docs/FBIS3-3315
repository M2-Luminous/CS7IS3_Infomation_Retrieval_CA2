Russian UN Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov said today in a statement, Russia "noted that there had lately been certain positive elements in the actions of Bagdad." Addressing a regular 60-day review meeting of the Security Council over the sanctions against Iraq, the ambassador said that the position of Iraq should be encouraged. He added that if a thorough and comprehensive compliance of Iraq with its obligations is confirmed, Russia would be ready to consider lifting the oil embargo in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions. "In this connection, we pronounced ourselves in favors of the inclusion in the text of the statement by the Security Council president of a clause mentioning positive shifts in the Iraqi position," he said. China, France and Russia advocated a change in a routine presidential statement, so as to give Iraq some encouragement for its positive position in arms destruction. The United States and Britain opposed it, by arguing that many other issues should be linked to the lifting of the embargos.
