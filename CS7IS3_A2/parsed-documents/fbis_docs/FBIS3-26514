These outstanding achievements included: We continued to deepen reform and open up wider to the outside world; foreign trade, exports, and imports continued to grow rapidly; the utilization of foreign capital continued to develop; and we made new progress in foreign economic affairs. Last year, Zhejiang's total output value of exports and imports reached $6.111 billion, up 31.3 percent over last year. Exports reached $4.439 billion, surpassing the target set by the provincial planning commission and the provincial people's congress and 19.9 percent more than last year. We maintained stronger momentum for development in this area. Of these, exports of individually run enterprises increased 43.1 percent; exports of foreign-funded enterprises increased 64.5 percent; and, under a situation in which exports nationwide grew slowly, general exports of our province increased 14.2 percent over last year, making Zhejiang one of the top provinces in exports. Thus far, 34 counties (cities) in Zhejiang have been designated coastal open economic areas. We have two coastal open cities, eight national development zones and development projects of various types involving whole tracts of land, and 37 provincial development zones and agricultural development zones. An initial development structure for multilevel and all-round opening up has been established. By the end of last November, a total of 5,963 projects were introduced into our national and provincial development zones; among them, 953 are foreign-invested projects with contracted foreign capital totaling $2.564 billion, accounting for one-third of the entire province's contracted foreign capital. Development zones have become an important "window" for opening up and utilizing foreign funds. Our provincial economic and trade systems continue to regard the utilization of foreign capital as a focus of their work, strengthening overall guidance, delegating examination and approval authority to lower administrative levels, improving service quality, and enhancing administrative efficiency. Last year, Zhejiang approved 4,487 new foreign-funded enterprises, up 91.9 percent over the previous year; contracted foreign capital reached $3.746 billion, up 28.8 percent; and utilized foreign capital totaled $1.033 billion, up 251 percent. The number of newly established foreign-funded enterprises and their contracted foreign capital and utilized foreign capital exceeded the total amount accumulated in the past 14 years since reform and opening up, setting a record. According to statistics, last year Zhejiang signed contracts worth $91.62 million for construction projects and labor service in foreign countries, up 21.4 percent over the previous year. By the end of last year, Zhejiang had set up 175 overseas enterprises with investments of 158 million.
