So why is all this called an underground missile? [Vyacheslav Kuriolvich, section head of Soyuz scientific and production association, identified by screen caption] Because it moves through the ground like other missiles do through the air. [Correspondent] Underground missiles can travel deep underground, even in areas which are inaccessible for other equipment. There are three reasons why defense specialists have developed this underground apparatus. First, a critical mass of used missiles has built up in Defense Ministry stores. This fitting [ustanovka] gives them a second life. The people who developed it made it in such a way that once the missile has burrowed into the earth, it comes back up again, and can be used 10 more times. The second reason: Over the past 10 years, four explosions have taken place in military stores, as a result of which people were killed. So.... [Kurilovich] This is one of the best ways of getting rid of weapons. If they just lie around, somebody will use them. [Correspondent] And the third reason, also important: In the context of conversion, which has begun in Russia, and the related possibility of unemployment for defense industry workers. The (?Grab) underground missile promises new work. But the (?Grab) underground missile is not the first development of this kind. Even during his first visit to America, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev boasted to the Americans that Russia had developed an underground vessel which burrowed through the earth at a speed of 60 meters per hour. But all the tests were secret, because the military laid down secret communication lines with the aid of this apparatus. The basis of today's underground missile system is the Grad multiple launch rocket system [MLRS]. Grad is a weapon of mass destruction with a 20-square kilometer destruction zone. The service life of a Grad launcher is 15-20 years. The military think the underground Grad can be used for economic purposes, in particular for laying down electricity lines in inaccessible mountainous areas. [Vyacheslav Vlasov, section head at aviation systems testing ground -- identified by screen caption] It is not only the Grad rockets, but certain types of air-to-air missiles [AAM] that can also be used for these purposes. [Correspondent] Incidentally, it is not only the military that is developing uses for underground missile systems. The Moscow Aviation Institute has thought of an original (?Grab) system for burying radioactive fuel underground. The Soyuz scientific and production association [NPO] takes the missiles to the testing ground in the Moscow region in armored trucks under guard. The military parts are detached from the barrel of the missile and replaced by a steel drilling head at the testing ground. The head weighs five to seven kilos, and just as in a normal surface missile there are 20 kilos of powder [porokh] in the underground missile. So, the same safety rules as for testing surface missiles apply when testing underground missiles. Everybody on the testing ground during the explosion must be in a secure shelter. The shock wave throws huge lumps of earth many meters, and this is not safe. But an exception was made for NTV. [Kurilovich] It's your risk, it's your life. [Words indistinct] the real shell flies 30 kms. [Correspondent] The missile travels at 4 meters per second. The depth of the shaft can be up to 30 meters, with a diameter of up to 150 centimers. Isn't all this offensive for somebody who has worked a long time? [Vlasov] Well, in theory of course it's offensive. But it would be even worse if they were to use these things for their original purpose.
