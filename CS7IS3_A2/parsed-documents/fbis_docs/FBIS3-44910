This was an unjustifiable move which disregarded international and bilateral agreements, and trampled on the principles and regulations of the international textile agreement. As expressly provided in the Multi-Fiber Agreement, when a quota is imposed on any single item of clothing or textiles, the quota level must not be lower than that of real exports in the previous year and a guarantee must be made that the quota level will not be lower than 6 percent of the annual growth rate. The U.S. quotas imposed on China not only represent an almost zero growth rate, but also the United States unilaterally cut the quotas by 25 to 35 percent. This act openly trampled on the fundamental code of conduct of the Multi-Fiber Agreement signed by China and the United States, which can only indicate that the United States does not intend to implement international agreements it has signed, but merely asks for implementation by other countries. The Uruguay Round of Talks recently reached an agreement stipulating that, in the next decade, textile quotas would be gradually abolished and GATT rules would be enforced once again. The United States was not prepared to reduce restrictions but rather imposed many more restrictions on others and implemented protectionist measures which obviously ran counter to the agreement reached by the Uruguay Round of Talks. As stipulated in Article 8 of the Multi-Fiber Agreement on illegal transshipment, if the importer considers that illegal transshipment has taken place, it should consult with the exporter to seek a solution; and if consultation fails to bear fruit, the case should be submitted to the textile supervisory organization for settlement. The U.S. move obviously violated the procedure prescribed by this article. As a matter of fact, even the U.S. Trade Representative's Office had to admit: At present, the U.S. side does not have any evidence to prove that a large number of illegal transshipments are taking place. The U.S. side arbitrarily took unilateral action under these circumstances, showing that its aim was not to contain illegal transshipments but to implement trade protectionism. As everyone knows, the Chinese side keeps asking for U.S. cooperation in establishing an inspection system to jointly guard against illegal transshipment. However, the United States insisted on unilaterally reducing quotas under these circumstances, which shows that it does not have even the most rudimentary cooperative manner. The U.S. move severely infringed upon the basic rights enjoyed by China in the Multi-Fiber Agreement. If the U.S. side does not withdraw this decision and return to the negotiating table to jointly seek a solution with which both sides are satisfied, the concerned Chinese authorities will have ample grounds to submit this issue to the textile supervisory organization for adjudication and take corresponding retaliatory measures. It is regrettable that the U.S. side took this unilateral measure contrary to the spirit of the agreement reached so recently by the Uruguay Round of Talks striving to alter the content of the textile agreement about which developing countries are particularly concerned. The U.S. move runs counter to the trend of opposing trade protectionism and promoting free trade, which is obviously unjustifiable, incompatible with present needs, and irresponsible.
