In the total population, males accounted for 51.45 percent and females 48.55 percent, and there were over 36.8 million more males than females; in the 25- to 49-year-old age group, the number of single males was 15 times the number of single females, accounting for 7.78 percent of the total population of males in the same age group. In Jiangsu Province more than 720,000 males of marriageable age have not yet married, and for females the same figure is only 42,000; in Ningwu County, Shanxi Province, the male-female sex ratio in the rural population is 121:100, and in the 20-35 age group the ratio is 150:100. What is noteworthy is: The younger the age, the higher the proportion of males rises and the lower the proportion of females falls. In Hunan Province, there are 2.5 million more males than females, and among children aged one to nine there are 460,000 more males than females; in Jiangling County, Hebei Province, before 1984 the ratio of male and female births was 105:100, in 1989 this ratio rose to 127.45:100, and by 1991 males accounted for 75 percent of the total number of births in that year. The rapid increase in the proportion of newly born male children constitutes a new, serious threat to the balance between the two sexes in the mainland population. The results of the census and the surveys showed the mainland population's birth rate was 19.68 percent and the male-female birth ratio was 114:100; of the over 23 million persons born every year, over 3.6 million more males were born than females. Making calculations based on these figures, by the end of this century the mainland will have over 30 million more males, and, coupled with the present over 36 million, at that time there will be the large contingent of 70 million "bare sticks"! [passage omitted] However, who is tolling the alarm bell? China is a country that for several thousand years has had the idea of regarding men as superior to women, and many people, to this day, believe that "there are three major offenses against filial piety, among which not producing an heir is the gravest." Following the implementation of the basic national policy of family planning, the idea of "extensive cultivation" lost its market. Therefore, people found a new path and wrote a "composition" on the target of having only one baby. After the "secret recipes" and "tricky moves" of quacks and herb doctors, witches and sorcerors did not work, "B-Ultrasound," which sees clearly into the human body, has become the "secret weapon" for distinguishing the sex of a fetus. For a time the "B-Ultrasound" room became the most popular clinic in a hospital. Before daylight, outside a "B-Ultrasound" room a long line would form, a line in which one young pregnant married woman after another, accompanied by husband or family member, waited for the "verdict" given by the "B-Ultrasound." No matter whether you admit it or not, "B-Ultrasound" has already entered the mistaken area of interfering with the gradual increase in human births, and is now becoming, or has already become, one of the latent factors in throttling the life of female fetuses, ruining the health of pregnant women, and causing an imbalance in the male-female sex ratio. Perhaps more grevious is that science has succumbed to the lure of money. Certain "B-Ultrasound" operators whose medical ethics are on a slippery slope, at the least serious, do relatives and friends a favor by giving them, without authorization, the "answer" to a fetus' sex; at the most serious, under the offensive of money, they lose their principles and, with this as a condition, take bribes, break rules, and reveal the results of "B-Ultrasound" fluoroscopy. Isn't this a corruption of medical ethics and conscience? Drowning, abandoning, as well as maltreating to death girl babies are also important causes of the unbalanced male-female sex ratio. To give birth to a male child who whill "continue the family line" and also to not need to pay a large fine for exceeding the birth quota, some familes who have already given birth to a girl child have taken extremely cruel countermeasures. At depots, docks, as well as by the side and under the eaves of residences, one often sees abandoned baby girls crying. In Xinhuang Dong Autonomous county, from 1987 to 1989 a total of 103 abandoned babies were discovered, 98 percent of them girl babies; in the past year the Oujiangcha Agency of Suiyang County took in and cared for 110 abandoned babies, all of them female. [passage omitted] In certain poor and backward mountain areas, the problem of "bare sticks," caused by the serious imbalance in the sex ration, has already become quite serious. The effects caused by the unbalanced sex ratio--the loss and harm--are difficult to predict and impossible to remedy; they not only run counter to the principles of demographic biology, but are also a factor that increases social instability. In poor mountain areas, where there are many males and few females, there are many fantastic anecdotes that cause people to not know whether to laugh or cry; there are cases of losing morals and ethics, of going against laws and regulations, and even of causing inhuman tragedies. [passage omitted] On a mountain range where the borders of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces meet, there is a six-member family: an old man nearly 70 years old and five young and vigorous sons. It is an homogenous male world. The five brothers of the He [0149] family are "bare sticks" who had experiences to the fullest the bitterness of solitary life. One day Brother Five took a wife to share his bed. The remaining four brothers were both envious and jealous; physiological impules caused them to do some things in front of their sister-in-law that were very unseemly and that at time even made spectacles of them. The old man knew the reason for all this very well, and he did a "job" on Brother Five, saying: "A white steamed bun that one person has exclusive possession of is not savory; let everybody share in eating a little of it." Ignorant Brother Five unexpectedly agreed to this unreasonable request made by his father. [passage omitted] Hong Juan [4767 1227], a girl from west of the Huang He and Xiang Yun [4382 7189], a boy from east of the Huang He, were fellow students in a junior middle school. They studied and played together; they had a quite harmonious relationship. Three years after graduation Hong Juan gave her love to Xiang Yun. Hong Juan's love for a boy from another place and another clan was resolutely opposed by her family, clan members, and fellow villagers. There was every reason for their opposition: in this clan and village, the ratio of unmarried men to unmarried women was nearly 2:1, i.e., out of every two men one could not get a wife. To thoroughly block any opportunity for Hong Juan and Xiang Yun to meet, they put Hong Juan under house arrest and forced her to become betrothed to one Ren Lin [0088 2651] of this village. On a pitch-black night, Xiang Yun led some men to make a "suprise attack" on Hong Juan's house and snatch the girl away to east of the Huang He. Seeing that his "quasi-bride" had been snatched away, Ren Lin mustured a force of over 100 clansmen from this village to wage a hot pursuit. East of the Huang He a defense had early been prepared, and a force of close to 100 men had been mustered. On the embankments east and west of the Huang He the two sides engaged in a tense confrontation. Fortunately, leaders of villages and towns and comrades of the public security police substations rushed up in good time and restrained the two sides from engaging in a vicious fight.
