Ibaraki, Display Device Engineering Laboratory, Toshiba Corporation] [Text] Introduction Active matrix LCD displays (AM-LCD) that utilize amorphous silicon thin film transistors as switching elements have become the mainstream in flat panel color displays and are now used in a variety of products. They not only have replaced the traditional CRT, but have also found a home in many other products such as in portable instruments and games. The size of the market in personal computers and other office automation equipment is especially large, and because this equipment also requires displays with a high level of performance, we can say that the main technology in this field has been built around the AM-LCD. When we look at product trends, right now the main items are 8-10 inch diagonal VGA class displays like those in notebook computers, but it is clear that we are headed for the XGA and engineering workstations (EWS) in the future, and that means large (14-20 inch), displays with greater resolution. In making this kind of large, high-resolution display, the key point is how much we can increase the pixel numerical aperture. In the case of EWS, the area per pixel is small due to the high resolution, and obtaining sufficient numerical aperture has been an inherent problem. On the other hand, with products oriented toward light weight and lengthy battery use such as notebook computers, increasing the numerical aperture has the advantage of reducing power consumption of the backlight, which reduces the load on the battery. One of the main factors that determines the size of the numerical aperture is TFT performance, and improvement in TFT performance directly leads to improved picture quality in displays. In this article I will discuss the high mobility TFT and self-aligned TFT as two approaches to future technology.[.sup]1-3[/] Demand for High Performance with a-Si TFT When the a-Si TFT is used in an AM-LCD, two major items are required for TFT performance: (1) the field effect mobility (�[.sub]FE[/]) must be sufficiently large, and (2) the parasitic capacitance (C[.sub]gs[/]) from gate signal overlap must be sufficiently small. From the standpoint of physical properties, the electron mobility a-Si is not very large, so we cannot reasonably expect a large �[.sub]FE[/] when it is used as a TFT. Figure 1 shows the change in �[.sub]FE[/] values as reported up till now at SID-related conferences.[.sup]4[/] During the initial period of a-Si TFT development from 1982-1985, the �[.sub]FE[/] values were 0.15-0.3 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. After 1985 silicon nitride (SiN) came into use as the gate insulating film, and this greatly improved �[.sub]FE[/] to the point that values surpassing 1 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs were obtained in the laboratory. At about the same time, in 1986, the 3-inch diagonal mini-TV appeared on the market as the first TFT-LCD commercial product. Ten-inch displays for personal computers appeared on the market in 1991, and on the mass production level, the actual range for �[.sub]FE[/] values is now about 0.3-0.6 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs for VGA displays. Figure 1 Changes in a-Si TFT Field Effect Mobility However, these values are hardly sufficient for large, high-resolution displays. As shown in Fig. 1, even better values are required for XGA and EWS level displays. Figure 2 shows a block diagram of a pixel pattern and equivalent circuitry. Here, numerical aperture is defined as the ratio of the area of light that can be transmitted to the total area occupied by a single pixel. In actual practice, a color filter substrate is placed opposite the pixel pattern shown in Fig. 2, and the numerical aperture is ultimately determined by the openings in the black matrix on the color filter substrate. There are three ways to increase the numerical aperture, as clearly shown in the drawing: (1) make the gate wire or data wire thinner, (2) make the TFT smaller, or (3) make the storage capacity (C[.sub]s[/]) smaller. Because (1) involves the selection of low-resistance wiring material, I will discuss (2) and (3) in this article. Figure 2 Pixel Pattern Block Diagram and Electrically Equivalent Circuits In TFT-LCD design it is desirable to make the TFT dimensions as small as possible, but to obtain sufficient write current with a small �[.sub]FE[/] value, we must increase the TFT channel width (W). When we increase W, the TFT area also increases, and that increases C[.sub]gs[/] at the same time. This has a major impact. In other words, when the gate pulse (pulse peak V[.sub]g[/]) reaches its OFF-state potential, the punch through voltage (_D_V) becomes very large. Equation In this formula, C[.sub]LC[/] is the liquid crystal capacitance. _D_V is a factor in degradation of screen quality such as burning in and flicker, and we place it below the design value, which is compensated by C[.sub]s[/] capacitance. When we increase W, C[.sub]gs[/] increases, so we must make C[.sub]s[/] larger. In other words, the area of the C[.sub]s[/] member becomes larger, and this reduces the numerical aperture. For these reasons, a TFT with a large �[.sub]FE[/] or a sufficiently small C[.sub]gs[/], in other words a high performance TFT, is needed. Two approaches appear promising for resolving this problem. One is an attempt to increase �[.sub]FE[/] by improving the film quality of the a-Si or the gate insulation, and the other is an attempt to reduce C[.sub]gs[/] by structure with a self-aligned TFT. Increasing TFT Mobility The semiconductor active layer material a-Si and the gate insulating material SiN are manufactured by PE-CVD using SiH[.sub]4[/] or SiH[.sub]4[/] + NH[.sub]3[/] as raw material gases. Attempts have been made to improve TFT properties by increasing the quality if the a-Si and SiN layers, and by purifying the a-Si/SiN interface that forms the channel. Table 1 shows the main methods that have been used and the results. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1 Improvement of a-Si TFT Mobility | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Development Item |Method |Field Effect Mobi-|Endnote | | | |lity �[.sub]FE | | | | |[/] (cm[.sup]2 | | | | |[/]/Vs) | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Improve a-Si Qual-|Hot CVD |1.7 |5 | |ity | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Improve SiN Quali-|Hybrid-excitation |5.3 |6 | |ty |CVD, a-Si direct | | | | |nitrification | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Low-Temperature P-|Plasma CVD |10.1 |7 | |oly-Si (below 300&| | | | |deg;C) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Laser Annealing |Excimer pulse met-|329 |8 | | |hod | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Making the a-Si layer using hot CVD has been suggested as one way to improve the quality of a-Si. Hot CVD makes use of the thermal decomposition reaction of the raw material gases, so compared with PE-CVD it inherently avoids damage due to charged particles, etc., and we can expect an increase in mobility. The problem lies in the fact that the film-forming temperature exceeds 600�C, so this method is not suitable for the LCD process, which uses a glass substrate. Ahn and coworkers[.sup]5[/] attempted to reduce the film-forming temperature by using a high order silane (Si[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]) as the raw material gas. They manufactured a TFT with a substrate temperature of 500�C and obtained a �[.sub]FE[/] of 1.7 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. Next it is necessary to look at the method for forming the interface between the a-Si and the SiN gate insulating film. In monocrystalline Si MOSFETs, a distinct improvement in properties as well as stability and control were obtained by forming a clean Si/SiO interface by the thermal oxidation of Si in bulk silicon. With the a-Si TFTs, however, the a-Si is formed on the SiN gate insulating film by PE-CVD. Therefore the purity of the interface is determined by the degree of vacuum during film forming and the plasma conditions during a-Si growth. Following the example of monocrystalline silicon, if an interface can also be formed within bulk a-Si, a controlled, clean interface should result. Yamamoto and coworkers[.sup]6[/] made an attempt by direct nitrification of the a-Si surface with an ammonia (NH[.sub]3[/]) plasma and subsequent deposition with SiN. More specifically, by using both the direct photoexcitation of NH[.sub]3[/] and plasma-excited H[.sub]2[/] radicals, they avoided damage from charged particle collisions. In the subsequent SiN deposition, they formed a coplanar TFT by direct photoexcitation of Si[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/] and NH[.sub]3[/] plasma excitation. As a result, they obtained a large �[.sub]FE[/] value of 5.3 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. Recently poly-Si film-forming technology at low temperatures of 300�C or less has received particular notice. For example, there are �c-Si forming by plasma CVD and a CVD method that uses atomic hydrogen. Mori and coworkers[.sup]7[/] created a prototype TFT using poly-Si manufactured by PE-CVD with a SiF[.sub]4[/]/SiH[.sub]2[/]/H[.sub]2[/] gas mixture, and they obtained a �[.sub]FE[/] value of 10.1 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. There have also been active attempts to use poly-Si. Many manufacturing methods have been considered, but typical methods involve heat treatment for solid phase crystallization of reduced pressure CVD a-Si, recrystallization of a-Si by laser and so forth. In the case of reduced pressure and solid phase crystallization, high temperature film forming at 600�C or more or a lengthy heat treatment is required, and a high-priced quartz substrate must be used, so it is not suitable for the large TFT-LCD glass substrate process. On the other hand, recrystallization by laser has a wide range of applications, and because a huge �[.sub]FE[/] value of 329 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs has been reported[.sup]8[/], it appears to be the most promising technique for the future. Self-Aligned a-Si TFT Figure 3 compares three types of TFT structures that employ self-alignment methods to reduce C[.sub]gs[/]. Fig. 3(a) is a conventional TFT, with a channel length L and a gate source overlap length _D_L. The minimum value for _D_L is determined by the overlap precision of the mask during the photolithography process, and it is normally 3-4 �m. In Fig. 3(b), the pattern in the SiN protective layer on top of the a-Si is made self-aligned at the gate electrode by exposing the resist of the gate pattern through a mask from the underside of the glass substrate. This enables a precision of 0.5-1.0 �m for the gate source overlap _D_L[.sub]s[/], so C[.sub]gs[/] becomes smaller. Figure 3 Cross Sections of a-Si TFT Structures In the structures in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b) the source drain electrode overlaps above the SiN protective film, and the channel length L of the a-Si layer, which is the path for the current, cannot be made any smaller when we consider the margin in the photolithography process for this area. The value for L must be 10-12 �m. On the other hand, in the structure shown in Fig. 3(c), the n+ type a-Si layer, which is an ohmic contact layer, is made self-aligned by ion implantation through a mask of the SiN protective layer pattern instead of by PE-CVD as was done in the past. The SiN pattern is also made self-aligned by using low resistance metallic silicide for the source drain electrode.[.sup]9[/] The silicide layer, for example Cr or Mo silicide, is formed on top of the a-Si, and after a heat treatment at about 200�C, an unreacted metallic layer is easily formed by etching removal. With this (c) structure, the channel length (L[.sub]s[/]) can be made distinctly smaller because it can be determined by the minimum processing dimensions of the photolithography process. Naturally, with this design W is reduced, C[.sub]gs[/]becomes smaller, and as a result C[.sub]s[/] is reduced. Figure 4 shows the results of simulations of the dependence of field effect mobility on numerical aperture.[.sup]2[/] The model device here is a 13.8 inch diagonal EWS (1152 x 3 x 900 mm). For TFT dimensions we used L=12 �m, _D_L=4 �m, _D_L[.sub]s[/]=0.5 �m, and L[.sub]s[/]=9 �m. The numerical aperture is strongly dependent on the structure of the TFT, and the field effect mobility �[.sub]FE[/] is as well. In the case of the self-aligned TFT (c), a relatively large numerical aperture was obtained even when the �[.sub]FE[/] was small. Figure 4. Simulation of Dependence of Field Effect If we assume a practical level of, let us say, 35% for an EWS numerical aperture, with the conventional TFT we need a �[.sub]FE[/] of 1.25 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. As I have already shown in Fig. 1, this is almost impossible to realize with an a-Si TFT. With the self-aligned TFT (b), we need a �[.sub]FE[/] of 0.8 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs. On the other hand, with self-aligned TFT (c), the �[.sub]FE[/] is 0.5 cm[.sup]2[/]/Vs, which is sufficient for design, so its effect is quite outstanding. Therefore, we can say that the self-aligned TFT (c) makes maximum use of the qualities of the a-Si TFT, and it is a structure that shows great promise for the future. In the self-aligned TFT (c), the n+ a-Si layer of the source drain is formed by ion implantation. Normally, a mass separation type of ion implantation device is used to dope crystal semiconductors, but such a device is ill suited to perform implantation in a reasonably short period of time on a substrate as large as 360x465 mm, for example, for the TFT-LCD. Based on the simplicity of the structure of the apparatus, implantation will be more suitably performed by the large-caliber ion beam of a non-mass separation type of device that uses a plasma of dopant gas. However, when a gas source such as PH[.sub]3[/]is used, extraneous elements in addition to the phosphorous, such as the hydrogen, will be implanted at the same time. Research is continuing on problems such as what kind of effect the behavior of these extraneous elements will have on TFT properties, how to optimize the profile of the implanted phosphorus, and what is the best structure for the apparatus. Conclusion One trend in a-Si TFT technology is toward larger size and higher resolution for AM-LCDs. More specifically, from the standpoint of device performance, improvement of TFT properties will be the key technology. In this article I have described (1) new techniques for making a-Si and SiN materials and a-Si/SiN interface control techniques, and (2) self-aligned TFT structures and ion doping techniques as the essential techniques for improving the performance of TFT properties. Naturally, these apply to all TFT-LCDs and are not limited only to large, high resolution models. Of course, research in this area has only begun to scratch the surface, but we hope that our efforts will have a major impact on the field, and we have great expectations for TFT-LCDs as next-generation technology.
