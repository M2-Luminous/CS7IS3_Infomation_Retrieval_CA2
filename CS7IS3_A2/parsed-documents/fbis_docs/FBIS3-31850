Television viewers were surprised by one thing. In every respect, the arrival of the Russian contingent in that area is a routine matter. The UN troops are made up of contingents belonging to various nations. Thus, numerous national contingents have been replaced since the UN intervention. Some have come, others have gone. Local people were hardly disturbed by this. They continued to pursue their affairs, that is to fire their guns and let themselves be filmed in their tragedy by foreign television crews. This is why the arrival of the Russian contingent had to be welcomed as well. It could have been viewed as a mere replacement of a contingent under UN flag. It was, however, viewed differently. The Serbs in Pale welcomed the Russian troops like liberators. The television images from Pale were strikingly reminiscent of the atmosphere in which allied troops were welcomed in a Western city during the last year of World War II. The enthusiasm among the Serbs about the appearance of the Russian troops draws our attention to a fact whose real dimension is not yet perceived by Europe and the entire world. The Russian troops came to Bosnia under the UN flag. Following Moscow's diplomatic actions, the Serbs agreed to withdraw their heavy weaponry provided that the UN troops in the area also included Russian troops. So far, this had not been possible, because the West was, naturally, afraid that these troops might become partisans for the Serbs. The only thing is that, in reality, the arrival of the Russian contingent -- through all its implications -- turned into Russia's return to former Yugoslavia. Almost half a century ago, in 1948, the Serbs were emerging from the traditional influence of their Slav big brothers -- the Russians. After a few years of hesitation, Tito, however, opted for the West. For almost half a century, Yugoslavia was, if not hostile, then at least indifferent to Russia. The arrival of the Russian troops in Bosnia was the price that the United States had to pay to come unscathed out of the mess called the NATO ultimatum. Russia's initiative solved a crisis that worried the entire globe. The Serbs withdrew their heavy weaponry. Even though NATO declared that it was going to maintain the ultimatum, it is clear that the question of air strikes is no longer valid. At least for the time being. The price that the United States have to pay for this face-saving operation is the loss of new Yugoslavia. Is it too high? Is it too low? In my opinion, for the United States this price is not as high as some people may think. First, because the Serbs were lost anyway from the very moment that the United States chose to side with the opponents of the Serbs -- Slovenia, Croatia, and the Muslims in Bosnia. Second, as I have stated before, the United States is less and less interested in Europe. In the new U.S. world plans, Europe is increasingly being eclipsed by Asia. Within this context, the loss of the Serbs does not seem to count a great deal. In exchange for this loss, the United States could win over the Muslims throughout the world. Which means not only the most attractive part from an economic point of view, but also the most aggressive part from an ideological point of view. The great analysts of the U.S. Administration must have realized that communist ideology is being replaced, with every passing day, by Islamic fundamentalism, a sort of religious Bolshevism. Things are satisfactory for the United States. For Romania, however, things are a little different. For the Serbs to fall under Russia's sphere of influence is tantamount to the beginning of a Russian encirclement of Romania. Not so long ago, we used to meet with Russia only in the east. Now there it is waving to us from the west. Bearing in mind the increasingly closer relations between Hungary and Russia, we cannot rule out that soon we will see the Russians waving to us from the north. All that is left is the south. I do not believe, however, that there is any Romanian who, even for a moment, would have any doubts about the true relations between the Bulgarians and the Russians. Thus, one cannot rule out that, in a short time, we will really be an island of Latinity in a great sea of Slavs.
