This was stated today by Slovak President Michal Kovac in an exclusive interview for Slovak Television. He added that the National Council [parliament] made a clear-cut decision to continue strengthening the system of parliamentary power. Thus it has sent a very positive signal abroad, where doubts were sometimes cast as to whether we really try to strengthen democracy and constitutional rule, President Kovac said. At the same time, he emphasized that the parliament decided freely, democratically, and without pressure.
