Having handled the work of a minister in the times of Fedorov (who was preoccupied, in my view, more with ideology and political struggle than routine ministerial matters), Dubinin became a full minister, virtually. The protracted probationary period is, according to him, hampering his work, but not influencing the nature of the decisions he makes. Dubinin does not consider himself a politician. He is a government official. And he maintains that the sole reason why he agreed to the office of minister is that he will have an opportunity to do his work. As soon as this opportunity disappears or he is asked to leave the cabinet, Dubinin intends leaving the government. And I would not be inclined to doubt the sincerity of these words. But this is not what is most important. The greatest optimism in the acting finance minister is inspired by his arrangement of his work priorities. I would like as a significant contrast for those who recall the dramatic nature of the situation connected with Fedorov's speech in parliament to quote Dubinin's composed words on his "production" topics: "That lobbying for one's interests in the government and the State Duma goes on is normal, but only as long as we can discuss these demands at a professional level, as long as we can come to some arrangement. But as soon as the decisions are politicized, the budget discussions assume a different character, as a rule, becoming a catalyst of confrontational political processes." According to him, Dubinin has no intention of being a striking figure and is not about to "develop a fondness or not develop a fondness" for Chernomyrdin, Zaveryukha, Soskovets, or Gerashchenko. "I have a wife, whom I love very much, and all these others will remain working relationships, as will possible disagreements also." His following semi-culinary statement may be considered fundamental for Dubinin's position both in respect to the budget and in respect to economic policy: "Whenever the question of the distribution of expenditure arises, there is always with us the `zero-sum game' problem--we can give to some only by having taken away from others. But this game, inasmuch as it is played, should lead us to some end result in the form of economic growth. In this case the pie which we divide up would grow. Now, however, the pie is diminishing: In real terms we are observing not growth but shrinkage." Lobbyists who have called Dubinin--who is demonstrating a total absence of political ambitions--"Mr. No Money" will hardly, it would seem, be struck by the difference between Fedorov, who had made a political career out of "refusals," and Dubinin--the "man of compromise." The Budget as a Concentrated Expression of Economic Policy "There is, in fact, no budget message as yet. There is a report of the Ministry of Finance on the draft budget with calculations elaborated in the form of an international classification. "It is a very serious report and it was worked up over a long period in the Ministry of Finance, and we in the Ministry of Finance are absolutely convinced that we are offering the sole possible balanced path. Following the consideration of certain amendments and criticisms expressed at a meeting of the government and not affecting the most prominent calculations and important proportions, we were instructed to submit the draft for examination by the State Duma. "In drawing up the budget for 1994 we proceeded from the fact that our budget revenue really needed to be collected. The revenue figure contained in the draft, therefore--R120.7 trillion (16 percent of gross domestic product)--is realistic. And the main task of the Ministry of Finance this year will be organization of the collection of receipts totaling this amount. "I can already see the main points of the criticism of our draft message in the State Duma. One of them has been criticism as regards the practicability of the revenue for which we have allowed. That is why it should be added to what has been said that the collection of receipts will be impossible without elementary financial discipline having been instituted. We must ultimately know the money path and the number of enterprises' accounts and fight tax evasion. "The situation taking shape as regards expenditure is quite typical. When we began to work on the budget, applications for funding totaling about R600 trillion were received. This despite the fact that the forecast level of our GNP is R725 trillion. "After quite laborious work on the applications, we managed to knock their level down to R230 trillion. But this was still very high, it represented too serious a deficit against our revenue, which was less by a factor of two almost than the residual total. "We had to make an uneven reduction in expenditure in terms of items of the budget. Not in terms of all items, it is true (our foreign and domestic debt could not, for understandable reasons, be touched), but in terms of very many we `contracted funding' 5-10 percent. But individual items were cut far more significantly. I could, as an example, cite the Ministry of Defense, where we reduced expenditure from R87 trillion to R37 trillion. We cannot, in fact, have an army whose manning level is not supported by the birth rate and whose cost is equal to the sum total of taxes collected in the country. "In this way we gradually managed to reach the compromise level of expenditure of R183.1 trillion. The largest expenditure items within this framework were support for the sectors (R33 trillion), Ministry of Defense expenditure (R37 trillion), assistance to other levels of power (R18 trillion), and the funding of social and cultural programs (following insertion of the corresponding proposals, we increased the funding from R11.4 trillion to R12.5 trillion)." Commenting on Viktor Chernomyrdin's directive in respect to support for the agrarian sector, Sergey Dubinin declared that "this is a large amount of money, of course, for which we had to provide additionally in the budget--over and above our original proposals. All this was, it is true, accommodated in the draft message. But the additional demands have no real foundation, in my view. That is, we reached the level originally requested by the agrarians: They said that this was perfectly sufficient for them. And if voices are now being heard to the effect that this is still not enough for them, it is essential, in my opinion, that the government adopt the toughest position possible on this issue: This is all that we can give them." "The deficit constituted R62.4 trillion, which it is contemplated covering by Central Bank credit (R37.9 trillion), external sources (R19.4 trillion), and securities transactions (R3.5 trillion), and we hope to cover a further R1.5 trillion from other sources." According to Dubinin, the Ministry of Finance is planning this year, aside from work with state commercial associations, to begin floating medium-term bills. "From our viewpoint, the draft budget message contains the algorithms of a resolution of macroeconomic problems and takes account of the available possibilities for the pursuit of a structural policy, which is undoubtedly necessary," the acting finance minister said in the interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. Macroeconomic Reference Points "The macroeconomic aspects of the budget are that with the budget deficit that we have determined and provided that we display restraint in the allocation to the economy of Central Bank credit (R15 trillion, approximately, is the critical level here, in my view), we may confidently forecast a reduction in inflation to a level of 15 percent and, subsequently, to 10 percent a month and, perhaps, even lower on a quarterly average. "The draft budget we have submitted for government consideration is not `fundamentalist.' It is not even purely monetarist inasmuch as such measures as the suppression of inflation within one quarter are absent. Although this is not that intricate an undertaking, we possess the set of instruments and could within a quarter reduce inflation to nothing. Just as we could also, if necessary, drive it up to 1,000 percent a month--both could, from the professional viewpoint, be done in such a timeframe. But this is not the point. "The point is that our tasks, reference points, and range of activity imply the pursuit, more precisely, the continuation of our policy of last year. That is, there is no `shock therapy'--there is quite a strict monetary policy. "I would like to emphasize that the budget is a concentrated expression of economic policy. Aside from the priorities from the sphere of macroeconomic stabilization, the tasks of support of production and its structural reorganization have been added here this year. "Going further than we have gone to satisfy the need for money would be just as bad as a further reduction in spending. In the latter case we would have to abandon many fundamentally important items of expenditure, in the social sphere specifically." Structural Aspect "We believe that within the framework of the gradually declining level of inflation there is for industry, and the economy as a whole, a certain clearance, in which it should structurally reorganize. We are not putting it in a catastrophic position all at once--this, strictly speaking, is the `structural' aspect of our draft budget message. "Very little money is being provided from the budget for specific enterprises--we are giving almost nothing. The sectors of the economy will receive less, appreciably less, I would say, than they would like. "We understand full well an important feature of Russia's enterprises today. What would happen, say, were we to say to them: Here is your government support, reorganize as you please, and we will combat inflation later. They would do absolutely nothing--they would live as they did before." The creation of financial and industrial groups could, in Dubinin's opinion, be an element of selective support for industry. But the process of the allocation of financial support and tax privileges should be of a planned nature, Dubinin believes. "Such groups may enjoy support to some extent. But the main thing is that they be viable without a handout from the budget also." "The sectors are an unsuccessful (under present conditions) form of association and management. They represent a vertical association, which can do nothing but divide up a market between itself. If, however, we could combine these enterprises on the basis of production cooperation, we would get a normal industrial concern, which would operate in accordance with economically expedient principles." In Dubinin's opinion, work exclusively for the foreign market is not a compulsory condition of the efficiency of a financial and industrial group. "The Russian market is potentially so great that this is sufficient stimulus for economic growth for any structure. The sole condition is that there must be a struggle to cut costs. Lowering prices or not lowering them is, strictly speaking, secondary." A reduction in costs, according to Dubinin, is a most powerful "nonmonetary" method of combating inflation. Commenting on the propositions of the president and the prime minister concerning an increase in government investments, Sergey Dubinin declared that the budget of R33 trillion in support of the sectors makes provision for R15.7 trillion for government investments. A further R12.7 trillion will be invested along the lines of foreign economic activity, thanks to tied credit. The New Role of the Unions and the `Destructive Approach' "I have met recently with representatives of the unions and the strike committees--pragmatic and intelligent people are assembled there, according to my observations. And the question is: On what will their energy be expended? Were they to acquire an opportunity to really influence the situation at their own enterprises, an appreciable part of their energy would be geared to bringing order to bear there. They would also be very much helping both the government and the country as a whole, what is more, having put their own management under supervision." This, according to the acting minister, "does not mean that management should be denied any rights at the enterprise. But opponents in the shape of the unions, which know the whole situation at the enterprise `from within' and could demand an accounting, are necessary. This could only be to the good." "If, on the other hand, these people (I emphasize once again: very energetic and competent people, who have a pretty good grasp of all our economic problems, incidentally) opt for the line of opposition to the government and the shaking loose of privileges for their own interest group, this will be a destructive process." Dubinin is very much concerned that the strike movement "could assume a destructive nature both politically and for Russia's economy." The acting minister believes that not all the demands being made by the strikers are realistic and that, consequently, not all of them should be satisfied. "The government cannot endlessly give in to blackmail." But does the government today have any choice? "Yes. But, please understand, our strength lies not in some power methods of the resolution of disputes but, occupying a sensible and substantiated position, in conveying its content to those who participate, in this way or the other, in budget discussions. "For every `we-want'-from-the-government argument there should be a counterargument: Let us take at look at and consider what we are realistically capable of doing. It is for this reason that the budget should be relatively widely known: People must think and say where to cut, where to add," Sergey Dubinin believes. Parliament "In principle, work on the allocation of priorities and the careful weighing of society's needs is the function of parliament. Parliament must determine whether it will adopt the budget that we propose. It will thus act as an inspector on behalf of the people by whom it was elected." Commenting on his style of work with parliament during consideration there of the budget message, Sergey Dubinin said: "I state with all due responsibility that we are instructed by the prime minister to work with parliament with complete candor, respond to inquiries, and so on and so forth. When each deputy forwards his inquiry on an individual point and demands a full response, this is another matter--our ministry simply is not in a position to cope with this entire avalanche of information. "For this reason we request that parliament somehow organize work with the ministry to ensure that it be performed as productively as possible. We are prepared to provide any information, to the Budget Committee, say--and let it further distribute it to the deputies. We are prepared to create a special department--not to fence ourselves off from contacts but to ensure that work proceed in organized fashion. "Time is weighing on us, we submitted the budget late, this was our fault, it should have been submitted in this form in December. But we recomputed the budget for last year three times and made innumerable adjustments and revisions and we simply physically lacked the forces for 1994." The Expert Center in Staraya Ploshchad Commenting at the request of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the formation of the Finance and Budget Department under the Office of the President of the Russian Federation, Sergey Dubinin declared that he finds this fact logical and sees nothing surprising in it, to put it mildly. "The office of the president should necessarily have an expert center, which should make an independent evaluation of the state of the economy--based on all that is put at its disposal by the government, science, and so forth." Answering questions concerning the possible development of relations between the Ministry of Finance and the department, the acting minister said: "What we send the president will in the office obviously be readdressed quite often to this department. For the president's response to this economic situation or the other to be as well-founded as possible analysis is essential. This analysis will be made in this department. This is how I see it, in any event. "Because the president could give us an order, set the government an assignment--this is his function. And these instructions could be prepared with the participation of the Finance and Budget Department." Money for the Republic of Belarus "I was involved in these matters for quite some time, and this is quite a painful subject for me, therefore. I would like to hope that all will end normally and that the necessary documents will be signed." But the existence of the National Bank of Belarus is an insurmountable obstacle to the signing of the treaty, in his opinion. "Prior to the start of the process of the conclusive concordance of the agreement on the Republic of Belarus entering the ruble zone, its parliament adopted a decision on support for the agrarian sector in quite a large sum. Naturally, the National Bank is bound to comply with parliament's order. Let us assume that we allocate the Republic of Belarus a lending quota. What if parliament adopts a decision on above-quota lending?" In Dubinin's opinion, it can only be a question of a branch of the Bank of Russia on the territory of Belarus. But Dubinin hopes that the adoption of such a political decision is possible, for all that. "The politicians, who have doubts about sacrificing some sovereignty in exchange for the ruble, should, probably, somehow learn the people's opinion here. The adoption of a decision by parliament representing the people's interests or putting the issue to a referendum, as was done in the EEC, appear entirely legitimate, in my view." At the same time, on the other hand, Dubinin considers far from unequivocal the question of the likely price ratio of the "rabbit" to the ruble. "This is purely an economic question. We should not politicize it or attempt to give it an emotional coloration. The current rate has taken shape as the rate of the currency of an independent state against a stronger currency. And this rate is not one for one, of course, although for Belarus' enterprises exchange at a high rate would mean a loss of competitiveness. For this reason Belarusian industrialists do not aspire to such a rate, incidentally. As distinct from the populace, which is already attuned to this. "The rate remains a matter for separate consideration, and various options are possible here: higher for the public, for example, lower for industry. But not one `rabbit' for one ruble." The Tatarstan Compromise and Budget Federalism Responding to the question as to what compromises had to be made by the center for the sake of preserving the multichannel system of budget receipts with Tatarstan, Sergey Dubinin said: "Strictly speaking, abandonment of the single-channel system was itself a compromise. Because in the past Tatarstan had said that a single-channel system was the sole acceptable option. "We, in response, recognized two things. First, the fact that for the time in which Tatarstan had not paid money to the federal treasury it had maintained federal structures on its territory. We should compensate this somehow. "Second, as of this year Tatarstan will begin to pay many taxes on a general basis (in accordance with the presidential edict on transfer payments). We, in turn, for the funding of programs of a federal purpose in Tatarstan will leave on its territory the receipts from certain taxes." Specifically, according to the acting minister, this applies to receipts from taxes on natural resources. "We shall not settle this question identically for everyone, but it should be emphasized that the negotiating process with Tatarstan proceeded in a general channel. I am speaking in this case of the presidential edict on transfer payments, by which real federalist budget reform was undertaken." Tax Federalism "The essence of this reform (and the renunciation of budget unitarism) is that we are abandoning the policy of the harmonization of spending and switching to revenue-sharing. We are making arrangements such that there be federal taxes and taxes collected on a territory and paid into the local budget. "Some federal taxes, primarily the profits tax, will be shared. A maximum rate of the local profits tax (25 percent) and a strict federal rate (13 percent) will be established. Thus with the maximum profits tax at 38 percent the local authorities may vary its rate from 13 to 38 percent. "Value-added tax [VAT] will be shared. Twenty-five percent of VAT will remain on the territory. Land and property taxes should, most likely, simply be made local taxes because they will go to the territory in full. Individual income tax will be established as a federal tax, although only 1 percent will be paid into federal coffers." According to Dubinin, tax evasion remains a huge problem, and, specifically, it is altogether elementary to evade individual income tax. "You can pay in on deposit R10 and accrue R1 million in interest on it, and you pay nothing here. We must combat this. Certain taxes on interest, if only at a rate of 5 percent, have to be imposed. Although, with the change in the status of the Savings Bank to a state bank, provision for certain privileges for its depositors could be made here. But this is an open, albeit urgent, question." The Nonpayments Crisis In Dubinin's opinion, the arrears "are the result of the fact that demand limitations really did emerge. But the response in 1992--when this problem became particularly serious--was inadequate and nonmarket. The producers continued to drive up prices and wait for the government to finally untie this knot in some way. "Inasmuch as the entire economy was nonmarket at that time, the government had to intervene--and we established that `swollen' price level. We thereby involuntarily encouraged the antimarket policy of the producer, who, according to these rules, can drive up prices because he is sure that they will some day be accepted. "We are now in roughly the same situation. If we intervene, we cause a most powerful spiraling of inflation. And no one would any longer believe that we would not pay all costs once again the next time." The Ministry of Finance's proposals amount to the "complete exclusion" of the possibility of a reciprocal settlement thanks to special money issue. "But we support, in principle, the possibility of the use to this end of resources which within the framework of public funding are allocated for the defense contract, for example. We believe that in purchasing grain or meat products the Ministry of Agriculture and Food and other departments are required to build a chain in order that this money pass into the economy as deeply as possible. But only defense industry and the Ministry of Railways are prepared to undertake this as yet. The rest are so much not in possession of their sector that they could not propose anything practicable. "The second necessary set of measures is connected with the institution of strict financial discipline (about which I spoke earlier). The creditor must know for what he can bring suit--and if there is no money, he can take assets. It is obvious that it is essential to introduce bills of exchange as soon as possible also." In Dubinin's opinion, the time allotted for the solution of this question is already slipping away, although there are entirely objective grounds for procrastination also. According to him, for the introduction of the calendar sequence of payments it is necessary to revise the decision of the Supreme Soviet. Other legislative instruments need to be adopted also, in his opinion. "The proposals of the tax office, the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Bank of Russia have now been sent to the State Duma." According to Dubinin, the formation of a new problem in the style of the nonpayments--a recurrence of last year's problems with the failure to pay for supplies of finished products--is emerging. In this case the culprit is the Ministry of Defense, which placed at the enterprises a defense order of a size six or seven times in excess of the budget's ability to pay for these items. Negotiations with the IMF As a result of Fedorov's efforts to concentrate the functions of participation in international affairs in the Ministry of Finance, the role of the ministry in negotiations with the Seven, the EEC, and international economic organizations has grown considerably. "The Ministry of Finance is having to take an active part in the assurance of favorable foreign economic conditions for the activity of the Russian economy. Negotiations on debt rescheduling, formulation of the optimum formats of the receipt and repayment of foreign credit--this is one aspect. "The second consists of negotiations with the IMF, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and other financial organizations." In Dubinin's opinion, Russia has today found itself involved in quite an intricate interweave of problems, to which the departure of symbolic figures from the cabinet has been added also. In this connection Dubinin is quite sharply critical of those who advocate a dismissive attitude toward international financial organizations. "Without harmonization of positions with the IMF Russia could not obtain normal conditions for debt deferral. The debt burden, which has built up since the times of the Soviets, would be simply insupportable. We would be threatened constantly by a total embargo and, if not a blockade, a serious deterioration in the climate of foreign economic relations." At the same time Dubinin observes that negotiations should always be of a mutually respectful character. "Russia itself formulates its evaluation of economic policy and its basic directions within the framework of current possibilities. International experts only offer us their opinion on these matters." Dubinin described in the interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA the trip of a Russian delegation under his leadership to Frankfurt, to a get-together of finance ministers of the Seven. Present on the Russian side, aside from Dubinin, were Gerashchenko and Shokhin. According to Dubinin, Shokhin had been invited in order to "space out the format" of the Russian delegation and to emphasize its special status. "It seems to me that we accomplished our `three-man' mission--to explain the essence of the economic policy we are pursuing and its continuity at the level of figures and specific measures." Negotiations with IMF, in which the Ministry of Finance and other departments responsible for the pursuit of economic policy are participating, are being conducted in Moscow at this time, according to Dubinin. "Their successful completion in the very near future is possible," according to the minister.
