FR940603-2-00126 FR940603-2-00081 In administering the proposed rule change, the CBOE states that the Exchange will from time to time identify particular electronic media and formats acceptable for use under Exchange Rule 6.51 based on members' needs, and will inform members about acceptable media and formats through appropriate circulars. The CBOE expects to identify as acceptable only those electronic media that involve secure and tested technology. The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and with Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to facilitate cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions, consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. The Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with the requirements of section 6(b)(5) and section 17A(a)(1)(A) of the Act. 4 Specifically, the Commission believes that the CBOE's proposal will provide buyers and sellers on the CBOE with an efficient and accurate means of recording options transactions and submitting price reporting information to the CBOE with an efficient and accurate means of recording options transactions and submitting price reporting information to the CBOE while preserving the CBOE's ability to create necessary and reliable audit trail information. The Commission believes that the electronic submission of transaction data should help to ensure the accuracy of the CBOE's audit trails by reducing the possibility of human error. 5 In turn, the audit trail information should help the CBOE to enforce compliance by its members with the federal securities laws and the CBOE's rules, thereby increasing the CBOE's ability to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just and equitable principles of trade and protect investors and the public interest, consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act. Moreover, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with section 17A(a)(1)(A) of the Act because it is designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. 4 15 U.S.C 78f and 78q&hyph;1 (1982). 5 Telephone conversation between Barbara Casey, CBOE, and Yvonne Fraticelli, Staff Attorney, Options Branch, Division, Commission, on April 22, 1994. In addition, the CBOE has represented that it will approve only those electronic media that involve secure and tested technology for submitting options transaction data under CBOE Rule 6.51. The Commission expects the CBOE to notify the Commission of any changes in the technology approved by the Exchange for submitting options transaction data. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act 6 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;01) is approved. 6 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) 1982).
