It is equipment made by the U.S. firm of ``Metrum-97'' [name as transliterated] for reproducing telemetry data. More precisely, it is a magnetic tape player for decoding the flight parameters of strategic missiles developed and launched on test flights by the United States. It was supplied here last year under a bilateral agreement between the countries, when the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) was signed. Similar Russian-made equipment -- in six rather than two racks -- has been set up on U.S. soil near Washington by our officers. It was assumed that when the two states' parliaments ratified the treaty, the countries would, as a mark of the trust between them, exchange telemetry and other information on the performance of their new and old strategic missiles, their behavior in flight, and other important information which would allow the generals, politicians, and missile designers to take a calm and very respectful view of both sides' scientific and technical developments and to monitor them with greater confidence. They even exchanged as a goodwill gesture reels of magnetic tape recordings of previous test telemetry -- the Americans gave us information on their ground-launched missile, while we gave them information on our sea-launched missile. Once again, they sent us one spool, while we sent them several. This is not a question of excessive generosity. It is simply that the Americans take the information on their missiles' behavior in flight from a single satellite, while our testers have to take the information from nine measuring stations sited along the country's northern seaboard. From Mirnyy to Kamchatka. There are stations in Naryan-Mar, Taymyr, Yakutsk, and even on Novaya Zemlya. The information is sent back by military couriers. This is when aircraft are flying and reindeer are not roaming the tundra. [sentence as published] Because of this the countries set the timetable for the exchange of telemetry at 50 days. Less than that would be impossible. Otherwise there might be suspicions of dishonesty. It would then have to be proved that there was no way out from Novaya Zemlya. That would be no justification in military-diplomatic circles -- especially as delivery of magnetic tapes is subsequently provided for by diplomatic pouch. But, so far, there is nothing to deliver. Apart from the so-called demonstration reels, the high contracting parties have not exchanged anything else. Our parliament -- neither the old one nor the new one -- has not ratified START II. A whole telemetry exchange department has been set up at the Russian test range. Colonel Aleksandr Vasilyev, its deputy chief, agreed to be photographed alongside the U.S. equipment for this newspaper. He says that they are not wasting time but are preparing to do serious work on the transatlantic missile information. In principle they are already ready to do so. So the ball is now in the State Duma's court.
