The trip, to take part in a session of the Congress of American Polonia [KPA], is being organized by Franciszek Mleczko, Pawlak's adviser. The Polish Peasant Party is hoping to get the support of the KPA in the future presidential election. Chairman Edward Moskal has confirmed that he invited Prime Minister Pawlak to come to the United States. The invitation was tentatively accepted during Moskal's recent visit to Poland. Franciszek Mleczko, adviser to the prime minister, has gone to Chicago. He is supposed to make preparations for the prime minister's visit during a KPA anniversary session in October. In a conversation with ZYCIE WARSZAWY, Chairman Moskal did not rule out that Mleczko's visit and the subsequent visit by Pawlak during the congress in Buffalo will be used in electoral political games and that they could be interpreted as KPA support for the extreme left wing. "That is always possible," Moskal said, but he immediately added: "I have been called a communist before, and my advice to them is to watch what they say when they call people communist." During martial law [introduced in 1981] and the period of official boycott of agencies of the Polish People's Republic by Polonia, Chairman Moskal was accused of maintaining personal contacts with communist diplomats. Accusations even appeared in Polonia newspapers, regarding Moskal's trade ties to communists consuls in Chicago. Mleczko is to be the main speaker at KPA's board of directors session scheduled to begin today. When Moskal was asked by ZYCIE WARSZAWY how he managed to reconcile Mleczko's left-wing views and communist past with the traditionally anticommunist positions taken by KPA activists, he replied: "Our forum is open to people of many ideologies and with different pasts." Up to now, representatives from no other party have been invited to the congress or to the Chicago meeting of the board. Chairman Moskal says that this is explained by the fact that Mleczko is in Chicago as Prime Minister Pawlak's and the government's representative, not as a representative of "his party." Neither the embassy in Washington nor the MSZ in Warsaw has been officially notified about the prime minister's plans or Mleczko's visit. In a conversation with ZYCIE WARSZAWY, KPA activists and directors, who asked to remain anonymous, expressed their complete surprise and concern over the intentions of the KPA chairman.
