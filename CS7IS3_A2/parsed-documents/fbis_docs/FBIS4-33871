Army sources told the international press that the crossing of Haitians to purchase food and medicine was suspended on Friday after small groups were allowed to cross early in the day. The crossing of people carrying food and medicine into Haiti continues to be restricted on the border after a Dominican soldier, posted in Dajabon in northern Dominican Republic, had his rifles snatched away from him on Thursday, provincial governor Abilio Escoto explained. Local authorities said that in similar incidents, Haitians hurled stones at soldiers who patrol the common border. None of the attacks have been repelled up to now. The UN Security Council augmented the economic embargo against Haiti on 21 May to force the coupist military officers who overthrew Jean Bertrand Aristide in 1991 to abandon power. The Dominican Republic shares with Haiti the Caribbean island of Hispaniola and the common border is patrolled by approximately 15,000 Dominican soldiers under the observation of a U.S. mission that analyzes local Army needs to comply with the UN mandate. President Joaquin Balaguer was against sanctions on Haiti, but he promised to comply with them. On Thursday, the president announced that according to a list sent by the United Nations, the sale of food and medicine to Haitians is to be allowed.
