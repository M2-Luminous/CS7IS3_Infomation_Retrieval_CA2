Russia's high statesmen and politicians are taking a lively part in anti-Ukrainian activities. Special landing units of Russia's Armed Forces are being transferred to the Crimea. Crimea's population, as well as all the Ukrainian people are on the eve of a tragedy. This threat ensued as a consequence of the capitulative, indecisive, and incompetent policies of Ukrainian President Kravchuk who demonstrated his inability to carry out his oath -- which he swore on the Holy Scripture when assuming his high post -- to protect state sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. The irresponsibility of Ukraine's highest statesman in this fateful moment is striking -- instead of safeguarding national interests, peace, and stability in the Crimea, Mr. Kravchuk pays a visit to Donbass in his search for support for canceling presidential and local legislative elections. Today, history gives Mr. Kravchuk the last chance to restore people's trust in him: He must defend the law in the Crimea, prevent Ukraine's citizens from terrible consequences of political adventurism of Crimean Zhirinovskiy's, and stop the escalation of the anti-Ukrainian campaign which will inevitably lead to bloodshed, violence, and a breakdown of the state. [Signed] The Central Council of the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine
