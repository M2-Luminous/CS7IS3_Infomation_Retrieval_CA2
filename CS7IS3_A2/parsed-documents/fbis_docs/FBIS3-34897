The Knesset is due to debate the sending of dozens of Israeli soldiers to Congo on the invitation of President Lissouba's government but the idea has not gone down too well particularly because it is being put together by a private company. From Jerusalem, John David reports: [Begin recording] [David] Leftwing Israeli politicians were alerted to the affair when parents complained that their sons were being sent to Africa to a conflict they knew nothing about. A private Israeli company, Levdan, has been recruiting some 60 former Israeli servicemen to go to Congo. Their leader is said to be a retired brigadier general who was commander of the Israeli forces in Southern Lebanon. Twenty-five Israelis are already said to be in Congo with a further 40 due to join them later this week. Some Israeli weaponry may be included in the deal as well. When politicians investigated the matter they were assured that Levdan had been given all the correct permits by the Israeli Foreign and Defense Ministries. The permits are apparently only given if Israelis are working for the host government and won't be directly involved in combat. Naomi Hazan of the leftist center Meretz Party, which is in the ruling coalition, is not happy with the way the matter is being handled. Ms. Hazan said Israel should not become embroiled in the domestic affairs of other states, especially on the side of potentially unstable governments. If Israel wants to undertake military cooperation, she said, it should be done formally and not through a private company. Ms. Hazan believes that the permits were issued through what she described as the old boy network with the main incentives being economics. Other politicians belonging to the Meretz Party have objected that Israeli foreign policy should be driven by financial instead of political objectives. Even the critics are avoiding branding the former Israeli servicemen mercenaries. They seem to have accepted the government's assurances that they won't be involved in combat. Israel is particularly sensitive to accusations that it is supporting mercenaries. In the 1980's, so-called Israeli security companies were accused of supplying mercenaries to help train Colombian death squads on behalf of drug dealers. [end recording]
