The two departments have since the beginning of this year dispatched investigative teams to several areas to look into allegations relating to violations of the regulations on statistics mainly due to individual interest sought by some leading cadres and officials. It was found that such infringements were quite serious and covered a wide area. Some party and government leaders exaggerated their achievements and made false reports on industrial output value. Local statistical bureaus under pressures from their leading organs could not help but follow instructions from the local leadership in making false reports on industrial output value in breach of regulations on statistics. Some local party and government organs comparing themselves with other regions in terms of success achieved in industrial production were to blame for false reports on industrial output value made by some towns and enterprises. Some regions changed the unified statistical practice available nationwide causing false statistics on industrial output value. A circular issued by the two departments pointed out that infringement of the regulations on statistics and making false reports on statistical work ran counter to the spirit of seeking truth from facts required of the party. As a result the state loses reliable scientific data and information for macro-economic regulation. Wrong decisions mainly due to wrong information have caused the state serious economic damage.
