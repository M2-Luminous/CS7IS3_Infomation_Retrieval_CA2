This is the claim of some Finance Ministry officials who recently revealed the background to the "agreement on tax cuts and tax system reform" which was reached among representatives of the ruling parties on 8 February following a dispute within the coalition over the proposal by Prime Minister Hosokawa to introduce a national welfare tax. Trouble Settled as Planned At a meeting of representatives of the ruling parties which began 7 February, Hiroyuki Sonoda, who represents Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Japan New Party [JNP], after holding a meeting with the Finance Ministry, presented a tax system reform plan almost identical to the prime minister's. He said: "We propose to introduce a 7-percent national welfare tax from 1997. It is possible the tax rate will change." Although this proposal was scrapped because of opposition from the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], an agreement was eventually reached among the ruling parties to "discuss tax system issues--tax cuts and how to secure revenue sources, including the possible new taxes--and enact a tax system reform bill at the Diet by the end of this year." The final agreement gave the impression that the Hosokawa and Finance Ministry-sponsored proposal had been rejected by the ruling parties. However, the situation went according to the Finance Ministry's plan. Finance Ministry Tax Bureau Chief Tadashi Ogawa joined the meeting as it was about to conclude. He said: "We will carry out 20-percent tax cuts, but this will be limited to one fiscal year because there are no revenue sources to make up for a loss resulting from tax cuts." His comments stressed the ministry's position that it could not maintain tax cuts unless revenue sources were secured. Administrative Vice Minister of Finance Jiro Saito directed Tax Bureau Chief Ogawa and the Director of the Finance Ministry Secretariat Takeshi Komura to hold a behind-the-scenes meeting with Mr. Sonoda and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary-General Ichiro Ozawa to lay the groundwork for an agreement among the ruling parties. Mr. Komura said that in behind-the-scenes moves they held many meetings at a "certain place in Tokyo," at the offices of the finance minister and administrative vice minister, and eventually worked out a draft agreement. Finance Ministry bureaucrats feared that "unconditional tax cuts" might be carried out without revenue sources being secured. To prevent this happening, they stuck to the position that tax cuts should be carried only on condition that revenue sources are secured. Although it was a considerable concession for them to issue deficit-covering bonds to cover the loss resulting from tax cuts, they performed a spectacular feat in limiting tax cuts to one year and getting the "political security" of a future tax increase. Senior Finance Ministry officials said "we had no choice but to coordinate tax policy because politicians tend to take the easy way out." Such a remark reflects their self-conceit in thinking they have protected the national interest. Policymaking Process Faces Public Criticism The United States, however, which wanted to see the tax cuts implemented three years ahead of a tax increase, expressed disappointment at the agreement. On 17 February, following the failure in Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, U.S. President Clinton criticized the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] for "controlling Japan's policies for several decades." Although Prime Minister Hosokawa, speaking at the Budget Committee session of the House of Representatives, defended the ministries by saying that "officials in charge of tax policy did a good job in protecting the national interests," the "prominence held by bureaucrats in Japan" is becoming a major factor that is damaging "cooperation with foreign nations" which is, in turn, the foundation of efforts to protect the interests of the nation. In the wake of a political confusion over the idea of introducing the national welfare tax--which was proposed by the prime minister at a late night press conference but finally withdrawn, the public, too, began to have doubts about the bureaucrat-led policymaking process. Vice Minister Saito had no choice but to indicate a flexible attitude, saying: "I will give careful attention to criticism in a humble way." According to a U.S. diplomatic source, the question has arisen both at home and abroad "whether such policies really serve the purpose of protecting the national interest." Yukio Noguchi, former Finance Ministry official and currently a professor at Hitotsubashi University, points out that there is a harmful influence in Japanese financial policy that places too much emphasis on ensuring financial security. He says: "Promoting the national interest means to improve the people's living standard by drastically increasing public works projects in preparation for the aging of society. Solely relying on tax increases to raise the revenue is a questionable practice. The government should not grudge issuing more deficit-covering bonds." [passage omitted on Tokyo-based company's attempts to sell domestically made rice without a license, and the Food Agency's reaction] At a meeting of members of the Rice Price Council (an advisory body to the agriculture minister) at a branch office of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries [MAFF] on 25 March, one of the members stressed that the Food Control Act-based administrative system for rice supply had to be drastically overhauled. He said: "More than 50 percent of rice held by rice farmers flows to the black market. The Food Control Act, which is supposed to control rice supplies, is in ruins." Even within the MAFF, there is the view that "now that government-controlled rice is not available, there is no reason to maintain the Food Agency." More Emphasis Placed on Protecting Ministry Interests The Food Control Act was enacted in 1942 amid intensified government control of the economy as part of preparations for all-out war. More than 50 years have passed, and it now seems there is no need for the Food Control Act to protect the national interest. Nevertheless, bureaucrats stick to the view the act should be maintained. According to MAFF Administrative Vice Minister Toshihiko Tsuruoka: "If we had no Food Control Act, the rice supply situation would have been worse." Judging from his remark, one can see that the bureaucrats are trying harder to protect the interests of their ministries than the interests of the nation.
