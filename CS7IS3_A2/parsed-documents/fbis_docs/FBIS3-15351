At a press conference Wednesday [2 March], Vagnorius said industry production after the 1992 parliamentary elections dropped 2.5 times and continues to decrease by 10 percent each month. In his words, if the process is not stopped, the industry will be in a very deep crisis already this year. Vagnorius said the average salary has already dropped to a critical line. In his words, salaries have decreased two times since the fall of 1992. The lawmaker said the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party cannot be blamed only for lack of competence. In his opinion, the party in power is so deeply involved in corruption that it can not make a move without approval of its "sponsors." Vagnorius, who is one of the leaders of the Conservative Party, said there is no other way to overcome the crisis but to hold early parliamentary elections in early 1995. Some other rightist political forces suggest to elect a new parliament next fall.
