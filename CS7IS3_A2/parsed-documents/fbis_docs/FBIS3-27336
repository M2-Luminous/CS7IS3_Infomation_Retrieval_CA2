The transactions center will be composed of 30 financial institutions and major enterprise groups on the mainland, including the China Economic Development, Trust, and Investment Corporation, the Hangzhou Bund Construction Joint-Stock Company Limited, the China Everbright International Trust and Investment Corporation, and the Shenzhen Baoan (Group) Corporation. Prior to this, there were already 25 property rights transaction markets set up in various parts of the country, including the regional markets in Henan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shandong, Chengdu, Shenzhen, and Zhejiang. To promote the rational flow and realignment of enterprise property rights so as to attain the best formation of resources and scale, the center will activate stock assets, improve the pattern of assets operation, make up for the shortfall in construction fund, and ensure that the value of state-owned assets can be preserved and increased. Since the early 1980's, transactions markets focusing on property rights have emerged on the Chinese mainland. After several years of development, property rights transactions brought notable results to China's national economy and increasingly became an important method of optimizing the allocation of state-owned assets under the socialist market economic conditions. According to statistics, in the whole of the 1980's, over 6,900 enterprises were merged across China, with over 8 billion yuan of stock assets transferred, and 4,090 enterprises reduced their losses by 522 million yuan. In the 1990's property rights transactions have further developed. To date, over 10,000 enterprises have been merged. With the emergence and ever-growing expansion of property rights transactions, a series of relevant laws and regulations have been established and perfected. So far, the Chinese mainland has promulgated and implemented the "Bankruptcy Law," "Company Law," "Interim Regulations on Merger of Enterprises," "Interim Regulations on Selling the Property Rights of Small State-Owned Enterprises," "Regulations on Managing the Evaluation of State-Owned Assets," "Regulations on Changing the Operational Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Under Ownership by the Whole People," and other laws and regulations. Other laws and regulations, such as the "Securities Law," "Banking Law," and "Provisions on Unemployment Insurance for Workers and Staff Members of State-Owned Enterprises" are still being drafted.
