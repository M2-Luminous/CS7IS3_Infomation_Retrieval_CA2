FR941212-0-00089 FR941212-0-00019 (f) Statute of limitations. (1) General. Each statute available to the DA for the administrative settlement of claims, except the Maritime Claims Settlement Act (10 U.S.C. 4802), specifies the time during which the right to file a claim must be exercised. These statutes of limitations, which are jurisdictional in nature, are not subject to waiver unless the statute expressly provides for waiver. Specific information concerning the period for filing under each statute is contained in the appropriate implementing subpart of this part. (2) When a claim accrues. A claim accrues on the date on which the alleged wrongful act or omission results in an actionable injury or damage to the claimant or his or her decedent. Exceptions to this general rule may exist where the claimant does not know of the injury or damage, or does not know the cause of injury or damage. In those cases, the claim accrues when the injured party, or someone acting on his or her behalf, knows or should know about both the existence and cause of the injury. However, this exception does not apply when, at a later time, he or she discovers that the acts inflicting the injury may constitute medical malpractice. (See United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 100 S. Ct. 352 (1979). ) The discovery rule is not limited to medical malpractice claims; it has been applied to diverse situations involving violent death, chemical and atomic testing, and erosion and hazardous work environment. In claims for indemnity or contribution against the United States, the accrual date is the time of payment for which indemnity is sought or on which contribution is based. (3) Effect of infancy, incompetency, or the filing of suit. The statute of limitations for administrative claims is not tolled by infancy or incompetency. Likewise, the statute of limitations is not tolled for purposes of filing an administrative claim by filing of a suit based upon the same incident in a Federal, State, or local court against the United States or other parties. (For the effect of filing an administrative claim with an agency other than the Army, see ยง536.53(b), ยง536.77(b) and (c) and 536.102) (4) Amendment of claims. A claim may be amended by the claimant at any time prior to final agency action or prior to the exercise of the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). A claim may be amended by changing the amount, the bases of liability, or elements of damages concerning the same incident. Parties may be added only if the additional party could have filed a joint claim initially in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the additional party had a separate cause of action, his or her claim may not be treated as an amendment but only as a separate claim and is thus barred if the statute of limitations has run. For example, if a claim is timely filed on behalf of a minor for personal injuries, a subsequent claim by a parent for loss of services is considered a separate claim and is barred if it is not filed prior to the running of the statute of limitations. Another example is where a separate claim is filed for loss of services or consortium by a spouse arising out of injuries to the husband or wife of the claimant. On the other hand, if a claim is timely filed by an insured for the deductible portion of his or her property damage, a subsequent claim by the insurer based on payment of property damage to its insured may be filed as an amendment even though the statute of limitations has run, unless final action has been taken on the insured's claim. (5) Date of receipt stops the running of the statute. In computing the time to determine whether the period of limitation has expired, exclude the first day and include the last day, except when it falls on a nonworkday such as Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which case it is to be extended to the next workday. ยง536.21 Disposition of claims. (a) General. When a claim is received, the date and the designation of the receiving command or office will be stamped or otherwise noted on all copies. If the receiving command or office is not responsible for the investigation, the claim will be transmitted to the claims office of the command or installation concerned. (b) By the command concerned. Following completion of the claims investigation, the command claims service or claims office responsible for the claim may take the following actions on all claims other than those for which USARCS has exclusive jurisdiction (see ยง536.21(c)). (1) If the claim is of a type and amount within the jurisdiction of the claims office of the command concerned and the claim in meritorious in the amount claimed, it will be approved and paid. (2) If a claim in an amount in excess of the monetary jurisdiction of the claims office is meritorious in a lesser amount within its jurisdiction, the claim may be approved for payment provided the amount offered is accepted by the claimant in settlement of the claim. (3) If the claim is not of a type within the jurisdiction of the claims office, or if the claimant will not accept an amount within its jurisdiction, the claim with supporting papers and a recommendation for appropriate action will be forwarded to the next higher claims authority. Any personnel claim forwarded to a higher authority for settlement will be accompanied by a memorandum of opinion. Prior to forwarding any tort claim, the USARCS AAO must be consulted and a joint decision reached on whether a memorandum of opinion must be submitted. (4) If the claim is determined to be not meritorious, it will be disapproved provided the claims office has settlement authority for claims of the type and amount involved. If the type and amount of the claim requires denial by higher authority, the claim will be forwarded through claims channels to the appropriate authority accompanied by a claims memorandum of opinion recommending denial. Prior to the disapproval of a claim under a particular statute, a careful review should be made to ensure that the claim is not properly payable under a different statute or on another basis. (c) Claims within the exclusive jurisdiction of USARCS. Authority to settle the type of claims listed below has not been delegated below USARCS. Command claim services or area claims offices receiving these types of claims will investigate them in accordance with this regulation and guidance from USARCS. Regardless of the amount claimed, a mirror copy of the claims will be sent to Tort Claims Division, USARCS immediately on receipt. Once the investigation is complete, the files on these claims should be forwarded directly to USARCS and a memorandum of opinion recommending disposition. (1) Claims arising in the United States out of the actions of members of the force or civilian component of a NATO nation or headquarters (subpart G, statutory authority). (2) Maritime claims for or against the Army other than those arising overseas within the jurisdiction of a command claims service or those within the jurisdiction of Corps of Engineers and other specially designated claims offices (See subpart H). (3) Claims based on the denial of a security clearance by the government to civilian employee of defense contractors (DODD 5220.6, section 10, paragraph C). (4) Claims by the U.S. Postal Service against the Military Postal Service Agency. (5) In areas where the FTCA is applicable, any claim except those under subpart K, arising out of an accident involving a POV driven by a member of the Army, or by ARNG personnel defined in subpart F, based on an allegation that the POV travel was within the scope of employment. On these claims the memorandum of opinion will include a specific discussion on the issue of scope of employment under applicable law (See chapters 4 and 5, AR 27&hyph;40). (d) Mirror file requirement. In addition to the claims listed in 536.21, USARCS is responsible for monitoring the investigation and settling the following claims. A copy of these claims and of any claims listed in paragraph (c) of this section, will be forwarded immediately on receipt to the Commander, USARCS, ATTN: JACS&hyph;TCD. (1) A case that must be brought to the attention of the Department of Justice in accordance with The Attorney General's Regulations (DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix H). (2) Any FTCA, MCA, or other tort claim in which the amount claimed exceeds $25,000.
