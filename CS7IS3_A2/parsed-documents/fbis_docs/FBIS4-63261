[passage omitted] A UNIAN correspondent asked people's deputies to comment on the result of the ballot: Volodymyr Lanovyy of the "Reforms" group: "This is just the first stage. Let us wait for the election of 112 people's deputies. It is also possible that parliamentary activity will be paralyzed by the formation of a government from the body of people's deputies. Apart from that, Oleksandr Moroz only won by a few votes. I hope the final stage of the parliamentary election will change the situation, because everything will be decided today by the communist majority rather than by Oleksandr Moroz." Mykhaylo Pavlovskyy from the "Statehood" group, who once put himself forward for the post of Supreme Council chairman but withdrew his candidacy: "I am an optimist. That is why I think one should search for the way out of any situation. There is no tragedy, although the result is not what we had hoped. One should work constructively." Vyacheslav Chornovil of the People's Movement of Ukraine group: "Had I known earlier than today about behind-the-scenes games by [President] Leonid Kravchuk, who could get rid of his competitor in the presidential election, the forecasts made could have been different. I consider the result of the election to be a national tragicomedy. Yuriy Buzduhan, a leader of the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine, who on principle did not join any of the groups: "Compared with the former Supreme Council, this is a step forward. Why? Because the majority in parliament came to power legitimately and, naturally, will take responsibility for its actions. The future will show to what extent the people of Ukraine were sensible in electing this deputy and this Supreme Council chairman. I believe Oleksandr Moroz will be a consolidating force, and this will be his most difficult task. I do not rule out the possibility of him asking Vyacheslav Chornovil to be his deputy." Stepan Khmara, chairman of the Ukrainian Conservative [Republican] Party, who is not a member of any group: "One has once again to admit that the national democrats made a mistake, were defeated, pushed aside, lost their moral prestige, and let the old cadre stay in power."
