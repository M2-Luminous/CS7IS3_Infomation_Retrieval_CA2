[Buwayz] First, we should state what happened. On Tuesday [word indistinct], when Talib Suhayl, holder of a Jordanian passport but of Iraqi origin, was at home, two people entered masquerading as clothes merchants, fired from guns fitted with silencers, and escaped. The Internal Security Forces were informed and set up checkpoints. Based on a description of the cars [used by the attackers], the Internal Security Forces arrested people intending to enter the Iraqi Embassy on Wednesday morning. They were carrying guns equipped with silencers, the guns that were used in the shooting. The two men were identified as Khalid 'Alwan Khalaf, a trade attache in the Iraqi Embassy, and Muhammad Kamil Kazim, a cultural attache in the same embassy. It seems that Hadi Hasan, who has no official status, gained entry to the Iraqi Embassy. These are the facts. The Lebanese authorities have taken measures to guard these people and to obtain the information necessary to conduct an investigation into this criminal case. As for the political and diplomatic aspects, the Foreign Ministry will soon request that the Iraqi charge d'affaires in Lebanon lift the diplomatic immunity of the two attaches and hand over Hadi Hasan to the Lebanese judicial authorities to investigate him. Lebanon cannot be exploited, under diplomatic cover or the cover of diplomatic immunity, as a stage for settling scores and carrying out crimes. Based on that, the Lebanese Government insists on conducting investigations and uncovering every circumstance of this crime. [Correspondent] If Iraq does not respond, will Lebanon break off relations with it? [Buwayz] I believe it is premature to speculate on how things will develop. Today we will officially ask the Iraqi Embassy to inform the Iraqi Government of the Lebanese Government's request that the diplomatic immunity of the two be lifted and that the third suspect be handed over. [Correspondent] Did the Iraqi foreign minister try to telephone you again today after failing to reach you yesterday? [Buwayz] No direct contact has been held yet. The Iraqi Embassy gave us a memorandum asking that the two people be released on the basis of their immunity and international norms. We are saying that they are under guard for their own security first and in line with the requirements of public order second. We think the interrogations dictate such handling. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the Lebanese charge d'affaires in Iraq? [Buwayz] We recalled the Iraqi charge d'affaires at the Lebanese Embassy in Baghdad yesterday morning. In the evening he joined our embassy in Jordan and this morning he was at the Foreign Ministry for contacts and consultations. [Correspondent] Is this the first step toward closing the Lebanese Embassy in Baghdad? [Buwayz] I think it is useless to make predictions. All this depends on the extent of the Iraqi Embassy's cooperation with the Lebanese authorities. [Correspondent] Was the atmosphere of the meeting with the Iraqi charge d'affaires positive? [words indistinct] [Buwayz] The Iraqi charge d'affaires said he had no knowledge of what happened. Today he was summoned by the Foreign Ministry's secretary general, who will inform him of the Lebanese Government's decision in this regard. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Buwayz] No. The victim is an Iraqi national holding Jordanian and Saudi passports. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] in Amman? [Buwayz] No. We are not aware of this. Thank you.
