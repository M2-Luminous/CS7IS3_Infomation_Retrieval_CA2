The first segment in italics is a source-supplied introduction.] [Text] They were born in the mid-1970's, at a time when Chairman Mao Zedong and his comrades-in-arms were passing away one by one and the republic was going through a most difficult period. They grew up in a brand new era. All of the bygone glories, emotions, absurdities, and pains were but far away fairy tales. Today, they have grown up; they are going to college. They no doubt are a generation that straddles two centuries, destined to be the masters of the republic in the next century. For the moment, we shall call them the "new collegians." Mao Zedong's passing and the birth of the "new collegians" seemed to coincide, like two wheels on the same track, two consecutive pages on the calendar. There was no overlap, no repetition. Thus, the issue of how much the "new collegians" know about Mao Zedong has become especially meaningful and valuable, and perhaps interesting. With the forthcoming 100th anniversary of the Chairman's birth, DAXUESHENG has handed out 1,500 copies of questionnaires to students in 15 colleges in the capital and in Hunan. Most of those polled were college students born after 1976; the oldest among them were born in 1974. Once a Household Name, But No Longer Common Knowledge Today Thirty-four percent do not know his place of birth, 65 percent do not know the date of his birth or death, and 35 percent have never read Mao Zedong's books. An earth-tone peasant cottage located south of the Chang Jiang River, surrounded by green hills, and behind the hills, the red sun is slowly rising: This was a very familiar picture for every Chinese in the old days. It once appeared in many newspapers, magazines, and text books. Everybody could tell by sight that it was the great leader Chairman Mao's home in Shaoshan [7300 1472], the holy land of the revolution, the place of the rising sun. This was a widely-known, ever so simple, common knowledge, just like everybody knows that our homeland is China and our capital is Beijing, not to mention that countless hot-blooded youths had at one time come from all directions just to look at this place for themselves. Our survey clearly showed, however, that 34 percent of the "new collegians" did not know Mao Zedong's place of birth. Some did not have the faintest idea; Some could barely recall reading or hearing about it, but their answers could not be more wrong: For example, they put down "Hunan Shaoguan," "Zhaoshan," "Shaoshan [4801 1472]," "Hunan Shaoxing," "Hunan Xiangtan Maojiaping," and so on. One knows not whether to laugh or cry. Another equally common knowledge is Mao Zedong's dates of birth and death--26 December 1893 and 9 September 1976, respectively. Most older people remember those dates, especially the latter; it was a day engraved on their bones and hearts. Those who lived through the period say that those days still leap up vividly before their eyes. Yet, 65 percent of the "new collegians" cannot recall those two special dates. Quotations From Mao Zedong, a product of a specific historic era, was at one time intimately tied to the lives of every Chinese. It was not long ago that even the very old and the very young could recite passages from the Quotations From Mao Zedong. But among the "new collegians," 8 percent have never heard of it, 49 percent have never seen it, and 58 percent cannot write down a passage attributed to Mao. Some are confused and mistake the following for Quotations From Mao Zedong: "Sailors of the great seas are dependent on the helmsman"; "fear not ten thousand, but guard against the unexpected"; and "one statement can refute ten thousand." Another notable phenomenon is that among those who could quote Mao, 43 percent put down such famous revolutionary sayings as "seize the revolution; promote production"; "dig in; stock grain"; "never forget the class struggle"; "resort to verbal struggle, not armed struggle"; "Chen Yi is a good comrade." While we admire the power of the era of compressed words, we cannot help but worry: Mao Zedong thoughts are a spiritual wealth; they should not be simplified, distorted, and even forgotten so soon. Perhaps they do not really prove anything. Ignorance of general knowledge may not hinder deeper understanding of other concepts. So in our questionnaire, we asked two questions about the books people read. Similarly, the result leaves us no room for optimism: thirty-two percent of the students have never read books about Mao Zedong. Among the books they have read, most have been published in recent years, including Mao Zedong Who Stepped Down From the Shrine; Two Sides of the Red Wall; The Mystery of Mao Zedong and other historical anecdote-type popular literature, while literary works by experts and scholars have much been ignored. When answering the question "Which Mao Zedong essay or poem have your read?", most students cited works reprinted in text books, such as "Qinyuan Spring--Snow," "Oppose Party Stereotyping," and "Changing the Way We Study." Outside of the textbook essays, few have read such well-known philosophical writings as "On Contradictions" and "On Practice." Counting those who have studied and those who have just skimmed through the book, only 141, less than 10 percent, said they have read Selected Works of Mao Zedong. Relatively speaking, college students in Hunan know a little bit more about Mao Zedong than those in Beijing. This naturally has to do with Hunan being the Chairman's hometown and people there have a special relationship with him. It is also because of the geographical location. Reportedly, Xiangtan University still organizes student field trips to Shaoshan every year, and there are quite a few "Mao Zedong fans" among the students. But there is no denying the fact that, overall, this generation's college students are slowly forgetting Mao Zedong. Only three years ago, this journal reported on a fad among the college students--"looking for Mao Zedong." In the post-strike campuses back then, the students had just emerged from their perplexed and exhausted state and were beginning to re-evaluate and to look for their own spiritual support, and a phenomenon of studying Mao Zedong's works and biographies began to appear. But college campuses have always been a mobile, changeable "camp ground"; every year's students have their own characteristics. Three years have gone by, when these so called "new collegians" entered college, things have changed. We cannot help but worry: What will happen to the questionnaires in another three years, 10 years, or 30 years? In the Minds of the "New Collegians" There Is No God Man is man. Why even ask the question? He had performed meritorious services, but he should never have criticized Ma Yinchu. He uprooted China's economic tree, just to see if there were little worms. Those who lived through the Mao Zedong era inevitably coat their criticism of Mao with an emotional overtone. The workers and the peasants, the intellectuals, the "three old graduating classes" [laosanjie], the red guards, and the "five black classes"--landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists-- people of different professions, from different classes, of different ages, with different experiences, and from different family backgrounds have different emotions about Mao. Except in strict academic studies or under very formal circumstances, when people talk about Mao Zedong, they inevitably mix in their personal feelings. They may worship him or hate him; they may be very critical or lenient; they may be obedient or rebellious. In short, it seems nobody can be truly fair or objective. On the other hand, during the Cultural Revolution, people once worshipped Mao zealously and almost religiously and took part in large-scale movements to turn him into a god. This movement lasted a decade. Its marks cannot be easily erased. It deeply affected the psyche of every Chinese man and woman, and even today, in the hearts of many, Mao Zedong is still a mysterious figure, a "god" that appeared only once every 500 years. This is clearly shown in the way the older citizens put up, and worship Mao Zedong's picture. Furthermore, catering to the masses, some tasteless publications have played up idealist things like The Mystery of 9 September and The Mystery of 8341, adding to the people's misconceptions. On one occasion, people cried out in horror that "social opinion has returned Mao Zedong to the shrine!" These do not seem to have an effect on the "new collegians." They are able to assess Mao Zedong more objectively and calmly. The survey showed that 94 percent of the students thought of Mao Zedong as a man; some even said they did not comprehend the question. They said that a man is a man; pure and simple. Why ask questions? Some put down in the questionnaire: In our generation, there is no "god"! They fully accept the magnificent, indestructible things Mao Zedong had accomplished as the founder of the republic, but they are not afraid to recount what they think are Mao Zedong's mistakes. Although some viewpoints may be naive and biased, they are not blindly following others nor echoing someone else's viewpoints; they are not quoting the same old cliches. "Mao Zedong indeed accomplished a lot, but he should never have criticized Ma Yanchu, there are a lot of people like that now." "His mistake was that he did not cleanly walk away from it all when he should." "He liberated China, saving 400 million people. He mobilized the Cultural Revolution, ruining 800 million citizens." "He forgot that one can conquer the world but one cannot rule the world on horseback." "He uprooted China's economic tree, just to see if it has little worms." "Stemming from the romantic and idealistic disposition of a poet, he treated the construction of China as a great poem. But this is not a poem after all." These strange and novel ideas of the "new collegians" will never appear in any official document or history textbook. This Is a Free-Thinking Bunch; We Have Eyes of Our Own I most admire his leadership style that embodied the characteristics of a politician, strategist, philosopher, and poet. I admire his ability to swim across the Changjiang River at age 76. I do not admire him. The "new collegians" have no historical burden, no bondage of outmoded conventions and bad customs, and at the same time, they have fine qualities and a good education, and therefore they have a vivid mind, sharp eyes, unique thinkings, and unconventional ideas. We became keenly aware of these in the course of analyzing the questionnaires and during the informal discussions. On the question "For what do you most admire Mao Zedong?", we received many different answers which fully reflected the students' vivid minds and their diverse choices. They cited his military talents--his ability to devise strategies on the spot and execute commands with ease, his political talents--his farsightedness and ability to make important decisions, his personal charisma--his openheartedness and selflessness, and his powerful, natural literary style and poetic talents. Some wrote, "I most admire Mao Zedong's leadership style that embodies the characteristics of a statesman, strategist, philosopher, and poet"; "I most admire his sacrificing eight of his relatives for the sake of the revolution"; "I most admire his will in resisting outside pressure"; "I most admire his ability to swim across the Changjiang River at age 76"; "I most admire his embodiment of the romanticism of a poet and the strong and sensible spirit of the sons and daughters of the peasantry." "I most admire his unusual lifestyle." We separated the answers into general categories, and data showed that personal charisma, political talent, military ability, and literary ability and knowledge each accounted for about 20 percent; there was no special concentration in any one category. Meanwhile, some people frankly said, I do not admire him! This is not an isolated answer. A decade or so ago, this would have amounted to treason and heresy. Those who uttered those words could have been branded "active counterrevolutionaries." Times have changed. We have said goodbye to the Don Quixote era of making "class struggle the key link." Although the question of whether Mao Zedong was admirable should be explored and debated, we must first be willing to accept different viewpoints. A society that respects choice is a civilized and progressive society. A coed at the Hunan Normal University said with self-confidence, "I have eyes of my own. I use my own eyes to judge all things, including Mao Zedong." This is the "new collegian," a rising new generation. We Are Concerned About the Present; We Are the Generation Holding the Relay Baton Mao Zedong made the Chinese people stand up; Deng Xiaoping made the Chinese people rich. "Mao Zedong craze" was a reflection of the people's spiritual needs in a changing society. Are economic development and deteriorating social standards two extremes without compromise? A Beijing Aeronautical Engineering Institute student asked us in all sincerity, "Why are we always quibbling over the rights and wrongs of our predecessors? Should we not make better use of the time to get things accomplished instead?" True, if history is like a relay race, then regardless of whether those who ran before us were a success or a failure, the relay baton has been passed into our hands, and the important thing now is to run our own leg and hand the baton to those who come after us with a clear conscience. We discuss and ponder over the successes and failures of our predecessors just to find out what we can and to learn what can be learned. Our focus is still on the present. When talking about the first generation leader, Mao Zedong, people cannot help but think of the second generation leader, Deng Xiaoping. In our questionnaire, we asked, "Do you find anything in common between the two great men, Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping?" On this, the "new collegians" have their own opinions on the two leaders' politics, strategies, and personalities: "They were farsighted and brilliant; they refused to be confined by old conventions and dared to speak what other people dared not speak"; "they understood China and the Chinese people very well"; "they were concerned about the people's pains"; "they each created an era of their own in China. Mao Zedong made the Chinese people stand up, and Deng Xiaoping made the Chinese people rich." On the "Mao Zedong craze" in recent years, the "new collegians" have different opinions. A majority viewpoint is that it is a reflection of the people's spiritual need in a changing society. People are dissatisfied with the adverse phenomena that accompany reform and open up: corruption, unfair distribution, poor social morals, the tendency to put money above everything else, and the erosion of human relationship. Some people are at a loss spiritually; they know not what to do. They miss the clean, honest, and simple life of the Mao Zedong era. Eighty percent of the "new collegians" expressed satisfaction with today's living standards, but they also understand the above-mentioned adverse phenomena. Although they did not experience the Mao Zedong era first hand, they too yearn for that kind of rich, uplifted spirit. In the survey and during the informal discussions, they expressed their own dilemma and thoughts. In fact, they are the same dilemma and thoughts of all contemporary Chinese men and women. Of course we cannot return to the poverty, backwardness, and closed society of the past, but is there no compromise between the two extremes of economic development and deteriorating social standards? How do we uphold the mainstream of reform and open up while effectively eliminating its undesirable by-products? Perhaps this is where we must "continue to work hard" in our leg of the race. When we first put the concepts of "Mao Zedong" and the "new collegians" together, we felt a sense of professional excitement. Yet at this point, the pen in our hands has become heavy. Our thoughts have transcended "Mao Zedong" and the "new collegians" to travel back to the last century and the century before and to race ahead into the next century and the century after that. Isn't this how the Chinese nationality goes from history to the future?
