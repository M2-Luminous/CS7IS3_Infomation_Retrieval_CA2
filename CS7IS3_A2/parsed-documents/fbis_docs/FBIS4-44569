It has been learned that while Zhejiang and Guangdong are preparing to build their second nuclear power plants, Fujian, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, Hainan, and some other provinces also are making preliminary preparations for building their own nuclear power plants. Moreover, provinces like Jilin, Sichuan, and Heilongjiang are already conducting feasibility studies for nuclear energy development. As the country has only limited construction funds, the departments concerned are expected to invite overseas investment and foreign funds to help with the country's nuclear development. Slow energy development and a 20-plus percent shortage of electrical energy supply in the country has impeded the nationwide economic growth to some extent. In order to meet the growing demand for electrical energy and to guarantee a sufficient electrical energy supply across the country, apart from building more thermal power and hydropower stations, the authorities also are determined to speed up the country's nuclear energy development, as this causes less pollution. It has been learned that since the two 900MW units installed at Daya Bay went into operation, Guangdong has decided to build its second nuclear power station in Lingao, north of Daya Bay, and a third one in Yangjiang. Construction of the Lingao and Yangjiang nuclear power plants is scheduled to be completed around the year 2002. The two nuclear power plants are to have four and six generating sets, respectively. By the year 2002, Guangdong's three nuclear power plants are expected to have a combined installed capacity of 10 million kWh, thus basically meeting the province's demand for electrical energy. In Zhejiang, a 300MW generator installed at Qinshan during the first-phase construction has gone into operation. Now, two other 600MW generating sets are being installed as well as second-phase construction at the Qinshan nuclear power plant has begun. The two new generating sets are scheduled to go into operation in 1996. Zhejiang also has decided to build two 2000MW nuclear power plants along its coast, in Sanmen Bay and Leqing, respectively. They are scheduled to go into operation by the turn of the century. Moreover, a number of provinces with conditions for nuclear energy development are also preparing to build nuclear plants. Fujian is planning to build a nuclear plant in Shanqian township, Huian County, at the mouth of Quanzhou Bay. The plant will have six 900MW generating sets, with a combined installed capacity of 5.4 million kWh when its three-phase construction is completed. The plant will have generating sets when its first-phase construction is completed early in the next century. Jiangxi also has decided to build a 3600MW nuclear plant at Maoziding Mountain in Guze County, Jiujiang City. Hainan Province is seeking a site on which to build a nuclear power plant, and is conducting feasibility studies regarding the first-phase construction of a 300MW generating set. Liaoning Province has decided to build a 1000MW nuclear plant in Wentuozi. Jiangsu, Shandong, and other provinces are conducting feasibility studies for building nuclear power plants. It has been learned that apart from inviting urgently needed funds for its nuclear development from some foreign countries and regions, the country still will try to raise most of the funds it needs for this purpose in cooperation with the local departments concerned. This is why the Beijing authorities have decided to set up a rotating fund mechanism for nuclear development to guarantee a continued supply of funds for the country's nuclear power development. Minister of Power Industry Shi Dazhen pointed out that under the proposed rotation mechanism for nuclear development, after a nuclear power plant is built and goes into operation, the State will not try to collect its profits. Instead, the plant's profits will be used to build other nuclear power plants so that more such plants can be built across the country. The nuclear power plant is allowed to divert as much as 2.3 billion yuan of profits to other nuclear plants under construction so that more provinces will be able to build nuclear power plants. Guangdong's Daya Bay nuclear power plant has been installed with French advanced pressurized-water reactors. In the future, the country is likely to continue purchasing French equipment for its nuclear plants, but as the Shanghai-made nuclear reactors installed at Qinshan have proven to be perfectly reliable and efficient, the country is more likely to use more domestically manufactured equipment. As a result, Shanghai certainly will become the country's nuclear equipment supply base.
