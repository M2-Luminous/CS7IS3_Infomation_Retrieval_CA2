[Pidchenko] The participants in this meeting have been partners for quite some time. For more than 30 years they have worked in close contact, creating the country's strategic missile shield. Now, there is a state frontier between them, the enterprises, design bureaux, and institutes of the former Glavkosmos [USSR Main Administration for the Development and Use of Space Technology for the National Economy and Scientific Research]. Representatives of them arrived in Kharkov to discuss the future joint program. In particular, it is proposed that CIS nuclear power stations, as well as a number of main oil and gas pipelines, should be fitted with super-reliable systems of electronic control. Within the framework of another program ordered by the Russian Central Bank, it is planned to create a global system of communications, putting three earth satellites into orbit. This will allow Russia and Ukraine, to begin with, and then other countries, to carry out interbank operations almost instantaneously.
