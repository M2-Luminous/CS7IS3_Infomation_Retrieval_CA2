However, in his speech at the NATO Cooperation Council, Grachev presented his vision. Russia would like to expand the CSCE to the supreme political body. In this roundabout way, the big power would again get a greater say in important decisions. This is categorically rejected by NATO. [Begin Defense Minister Volker Ruehe recording] We see the CSCE as a roof, but what NATO is doing for stability in Europe cannot be replaced by the CSCE. I do not advocate that Russia become a NATO member, but I advocate that the Central and East European states can become NATO members. Regarding Russia, I advocate a broad dialogue, for instance also about issues that go beyond the Partnership for Peace. [end recording] [passage omitted] [Vienna ORF Television Network in German at 1730 GMT carries a similar report about the NATO meeting in Brussels, where Ruehe is shown as saying: "I think that Russia's position is justified. Who could be more interested than we are in talking with the Russians, for instance about nonproliferation and about the safety of nuclear weapons?"]
