In Singer's opinion, the meeting between Rabin and 'Arafat and the signing of the agreement between Israel and the PLO could take place before 13 April 1994. Nevertheless, in a special interview with DAVAR, Singer noted that Israel says that the mass release of prisoners is conditional on a general amnesty of collaborators. According to him, the PLO made a strategic decision to advance rapidly in all tracks of the talks. The talks in Cairo in the last two weeks have been very businesslike and good, Singer said. Issues which were previously settled only after arguments that lasted for days have recently been settled within half an hour, he said. [passage omitted]
