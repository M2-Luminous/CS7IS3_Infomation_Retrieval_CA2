FBIS3-47042 "dreas006__a94020" FBIS-EAS-94-006-A Document Type:Daily Report 10 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Administrative Reform Oversight Organ Planned OW0901105294 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0901105294 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The government has decided to establish a third-party "Committee on Promotion of Administrative Reform" (tentative name) as a nucleus to promote administrative reform, mainly through deregulation. The committee will be authorized to give advice to the prime minister and ministries and agencies. At the strong request of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the Management and Coordination Agency [MCA] and other government offices have been preparing for the committee's establishment. The government will include the decision in an administrative reform action plan (administrative reform outlines) for fiscal 1994, which is expected to be approved at a cabinet meeting before the end of January. At the same time, it will submit a bill to establish the committee to the next ordinary Diet session. Besides monitoring the progress of deregulation, the committee will carry out the major task of studying enactment of an information disclosure law. The government will also include a plan to work out by the end of the year guidelines for decentralization of political power -- a basic policy to promote decentralization -- in the action plan. As an organ to promote administrative reform, the government earlier decided to inaugurate the "Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters" by mid-January. Prime Minister Hosokawa will serve as head, and the chief cabinet secretary and MCA director general as deputy heads in the headquarters, which will be composed of cabinet members and the Fair Trade Commission chairman. The aforementioned committee will work as an advisory organ to the headquarters and as a watchdog, as proposed by the Provisional Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform [Provisional Council] and the Economic Reform Research Council (chaired by Gaishi Hiraiwa). The committee's major tasks will be devising an action program to promote deregulation, monitoring the progress of deregulation, and drawing up a bill on the disclosure of information. The committee will be established in accordance with Article 8 of the National Administrative Formation Law [name as published], and will fall under direct control of the prime minister. It will comprise intellectuals from the private sector. The Provisional Council is authorized only to submit reports and opinions when asked by the prime minister. Because of its limited power, the Provisional Council is helpless against bureaucrats. Therefore, the government plans to give more power to the administrative reform promotion committee. It will clearly state in the bill on establishment of the committee: "The committee is authorized to give advice to the prime minister and to each cabinet minister." It will also give the committee the right to investigate ministries and agencies, local governments, and corporations with special status so it will be able to promote active investigation and discussion. The government hopes the committee will be a body similar to the Japan National Railway Reconstruction Committee and the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission. To enable the committee to make decisions quickly, the government intends to form it with three to seven members. The choice of committee members will be decided with approval of the Diet. So far, the government has not decided on how many members it should select from what sectors. The outlines of decentralization will be worked out by the end of the year based on the administrative reform report released last October. However, it is uncertain whether the government will be able to include a plan, proposed in the report, to enact a "basic decentralization law" in the outlines in defiance of strong opposition from ministries and agencies.
