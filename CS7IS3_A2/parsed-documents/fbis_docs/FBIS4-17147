"We reject the use of air strikes by UN-operated aircraft, regarding it as extremely dangerous," the Russian minister stressed today after signing a Russian-Turkish agreement on cooperation in the military-technical sphere. He feels that this path will not yield any positive results whatsoever. On the contrary, Pavel Grachev pointed out, these "often inaccurate strikes humiliate the military." He said that the Russian Defense Ministry does not have a clear view of the situation around the Bosnian town of Gorazde. "We do not believe in whitewashing the Bosnian Serbs. Both warring parties are to blame in this situation," Pavel Grachev noted. The minister disclosed that on Sunday he had spoken to General Mladic, the commander of the Serb Army in Bosnia, and had asked him not to attack Gorazde. As a result, the defense minister added, the Serbs held their fire for two days, but the immediate response of the other side was to go on the offensive. Replying to a question on the possibilities of sending additional Russian peacekeeping forces to the former Yugoslavia, Pavel Grachev stressed that 200-300 men would not improve the situation. In his opinion, in order to solve the Bosnian problem by military means it would be necessary to enlist 60-70,000 servicemen of the UN peacekeeping forces. "But this is unrealistic," he noted. "This would mean the beginning of large-scale combat operations, war." In Pavel Grachev's opinion, the Russian president's initiative, which was expressed on 19 April during his telephone conversation with German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is worthy of attention. It essentially means that the presidents of Russia and the United States, the leaders of the countries of the European Community, and the political and military leaders of the former Yugoslavia should meet in any European country to discuss the prospects for a way out of the crisis.
