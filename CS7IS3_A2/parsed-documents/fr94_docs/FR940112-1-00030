FR940112-1-00030 FR940112-1-00013 §1.936&hyph;6 Intangible property income when an election out is made; cost sharing and profit split options; covered intangibles. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* Q. 10: If the possessions corporation is entitled to use the profit split method in the situation described in Q. 9 (leasing units of the possession product or use of such units in the taxpayer's own trade or business), how should it compute combined taxable income with respect to such units? A. 10: In the case of an integrated product, combined taxable income shall be computed as if the U.S. affiliate had sold the units to an unrelated person (or to a foreign affiliate) at the time the units were first leased or otherwise placed in service by the U.S. affiliate. The sales price shall be equal to the sales price from comparable uncontrolled transactions determined in accordance with §1.482&hyph;2(e)(2). If a sales price from comparable uncontrolled transactions cannot be determined in accordance with §1.482&hyph;2(e)(2), then the taxpayer shall not be treated as having possession sales with respect to such leasing transaction. If the possession product is a component product or an end-product form, and there is a comparable uncontrolled price for the integrated product which includes the possession product, the combined taxable income with respect to the possession product shall be determined under Q & A. 12 of this paragraph (b)(1). For purposes of determining the basis of a component product or an end-product form, the deemed sales price of such product must be determined. The deemed sales price of the component product shall be determined by multiplying the deemed sales price of the integrated product by a ratio, the numerator of which is the production costs of the component product and the denominator of which is the production costs of the integrated product. The deemed sales price of an end-product form shall be determined by multiplying the deemed sales price of the integrated product by a ratio, the numerator of which is the production costs of the end-product form and the denominator of which is the production costs of the integrated product. The definition of production costs with respect to the component product or end-product form shall be determined under the rules of Q & A. 12 of this paragraph (b)(1). The full amount of income received under the lease shall be treated as income of (and taxed to) the U.S. affiliate and not the possessions corporation. * * * * * A. 11: (i) The U.S. affiliate shall be treated, for purposes of computing its basis in such units, as if it had repurchased such units immediately following the deemed sale and at the deemed sales price as provided in Q & A. 10 of this paragraph (b)(1).
