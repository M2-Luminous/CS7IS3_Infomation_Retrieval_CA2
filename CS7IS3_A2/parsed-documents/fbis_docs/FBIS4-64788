According to an official statement, he held talks in Bonn "in a friendly atmosphere" and discussed with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl relations between the two countries and international affairs. As a routine of such talks, the Western side urges better access to the Japanese market, and Japan promptly promises to make huge efforts to reform the economic structures and open the markets. This also happened in Bonn. Under the headline "Preparation of the World Economic Summit," which will take place in Naples in July, Kohl urged his Japanese visitor to increase support for Russia. While Germany has, in the past, borne the main burden, Japan has only shown a cold shoulder in this respect. This will hardly change in Naples. Nor will the chancellor's wish for increased commitment of Japanese companies in eastern Germany be considered as long as they cannot expect to get a good return on their investment. Both governments see themselves in one boat on their way to a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Even though the arguments exchanged are not new, it is sensible for the chiefs of governments from friendly nations to meet personally at regular intervals. Cultivating the political climate is of importance.
