After presenting to Congress the draft budget for 1995 totaling over 2 trillion bolivars, in which the average price of petroleum was fixed at $12 per barrel and the bolivar was fixed at 180 per dollar, Sosa said that it will be necessary to ask Congress to pass a law on public credit to cover social programs. Sosa also said that the bonds announced by President Rafael Caldera for transportation and nourishment will have to be increased. Nevertheless, Minister Sosa did not say how many more bonds would have to be issued. [Begin Sosa recording] The cabinet would have to approve this. [words indistinct] very satisfactory, however I do not want to announce this before the cabinet has taken this into account and given its approval. If this is dealt with tomorrow by the cabinet, the labor minister and I will be very happy to make the announcement. [end recording] The finance minister also referred to the suspension of constitutional guarantees, ruling out that this decision was made to avoid public order disturbances. [Begin Sosa recording] [words indistinct] taken for those reasons. I think that measure was implemented because there must be a very careful and extensive study conducted of the financial system. Our laws on banking and other financial institutions have a number of limitations that could hamper any action on the financial system that may be necessary. That is the true reason behind the suspension of guarantees. [end recording] Nevertheless, and despite the insistence of the media to learn what the exchange rate will be fixed at, Minister Sosa said it was not his duty but that of the Venezuelan Central Bank to provide this information [words indistinct] designated a technical commission for that purpose. To conclude, the finance minister announced that the government will remain vigilant of the possibility of a food supply shortage, so that in fact this does not occur.
