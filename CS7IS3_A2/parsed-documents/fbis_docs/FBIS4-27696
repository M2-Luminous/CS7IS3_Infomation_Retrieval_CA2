Ulchi-Focus Lens is a command post exercise, which started in 1976 combining the Ulchi exercise conducted by the Korean government and Focus Lens, a military exercise which had been conducted under the U.N. Command. It was separated into two and held on a smaller scale in 1991-1993 to help provide a favorable mood for the inter-Korea talks. This year the two exercises will be combined again into Ulchi-Focus, because Team Spirit, the annual large-scale Korea-U.S. joint field exercise which is usually held in early spring, has been postponed to November this year over North Korea's nuclear impasse, a Defense Ministry official said. But the official refused to say how many Korean and U.S. troops will participate in the drill.
