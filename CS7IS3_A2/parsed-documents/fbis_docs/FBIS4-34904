The source added that two employees have disappeared, between two and five are wounded, and about 12 have been arrested. Aztra sugar refinery union spokesmen say they are holding a Canar electoral tribunal employee hostage and intend to exchange him for the detained workers. The spokesmen say there are minors among the detained persons. Walter Santos, 54 years old, was shot and killed on the fourth consecutive day of demonstrations by Aztra employees, who are demanding payment of delayed salaries and protesting the sale of the company, which is located approximately 400 km southwest of Quito. The state-owned National Financial Corporation (CFN) on Wednesday transferred the company to a consortium of Ecuadoran and Colombian businessmen for $100,000, less than 2 percent of the firm's estimated value. The workers were joined in their demonstrations by residents of La Troncal, a town near the Aztra facilities, who also confronted the soldiers. The soldiers are in the streets following Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen's declaration of a state of emergency on Tuesday due to a conflict with the Indians. The CFN sold 98 percent of the sugar refinery's shares for $100,000. The mill supplies 30 percent of the sugar consumed in Ecuador. Up until March, each Aztra share sold for 750 sucres ($0.40), but unexpectedly, according to stock market sources, they were auctioned on Wednesday for 8.55 sucres each, an act described by the workers as "illegal, immoral, and shameful." Quito Stock Market Director Hector Terneus admitted that "such a broad fluctuation is not normal," but he denied the wrongdoing denounced by workers. "The transaction was legal because it was in accordance with regulations governing the Ecuadoran stock market and stock exchange," Terneus said, although other reports assert that the state lost approximately $60 million. Former CFN leader Guillermo Landazuri said the "symbolic" sale proves beyond a doubt "the dishonest manner in which Sixto Duran-Ballen's conservative administration has managed the privatization process" by "discrediting and damaging the image of state companies to lower their prices."
