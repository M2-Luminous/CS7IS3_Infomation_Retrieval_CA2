In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Bulovas said that "it was not Lithuania's fault that the agreement signed by the prime ministers of the two countries in Vilnius on 18 November 1993 on most favoured nation trading status never came into force. The agreement is of great importance for Lithuania because Russia is our major economic partner," he added. Moscow sets forth more and more new conditions, including guarantees for the economy of the Kaliningrad region, Russia's westernmost enclave, its military and transit through Lithuania, Bulovas said. He stressed that "we want it (transit) to be based on the republic's legislation and properly drawn documents, that's all. Lithuania will not take any steps which may damage the region's economy." "However, if Russia continues the policy of `delays' with regard to the enactment of the aforementioned agreement on trade, thus pushing us, intentionally or not, towards the West, Lithuania will undertake adequate measures," Bulovas said.
