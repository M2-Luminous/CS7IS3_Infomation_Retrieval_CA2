During his stay, Gen. Rose had a very brief meeting with Ferid Buljubasic, commander of the Bosnian Army's eastern Bosnian operational zone in Gorazde. After being told by the Gorazde commander that UN forces have not yet fulfilled their duty regarding the setting up of a demarcation zone 3 km from the town center, Gen. Rose briefly said this was not right and cut short the conversation. After this, Gen. Rose visited the almost destroyed hospital in Gorazde and the UN members in the town. During Gen. Rose's stay in Gorazde, people from the nearby villages started gathering outside the UN headquarters. This protest meeting is still under way, and over 2,000 residents of Kazagici, Zupcici, Bare, Ugarak, Kokino Selo, [words indistinct] are demanding to return to their homes as soon as possible--the homes they left at the height of the chetnik offensive on Gorazde. This protest meeting--these people here--are yet another of many proofs that the chetniks have not withdrawn 3 km from the town center, because that is where the aforementioned villages are situated.
