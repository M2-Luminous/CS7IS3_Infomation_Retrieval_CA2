Krajisnik made the statement on Sunday after Bosnian Serbs and Moslems had resumed talks at Sarajevo airport on prisoner exchanges. After the first round of talks on Saturday, the two sides agreed to complete the lists of POWs held by the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] to include those captured in the recent fighting on Mt. Ozren in the north and around Gorazde in the southeast. The exchanges are to take place at Sarajevo airport, in Gorazde and at Satorovici near Brcko in northern Bosnia. The two sides also agreed that a meeting be held on Wednesday by local representatives to exchange information about the missing. At the next round of talks on Friday, the two sides will negotiate dates for the exchanges. An ICRC spokesman said in Geneva on Friday the organization estimated that Bosnian Moslems and Croats were holding about 450 persons prisoner and that the Serbs were holding approximately the same number of prisoners. The one-month truce which the Bosnian Serb Republic and the Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia signed on Wednesday envisages an immediate release of all prisoners, including POWs. The truce came into effect at noon on Friday.
