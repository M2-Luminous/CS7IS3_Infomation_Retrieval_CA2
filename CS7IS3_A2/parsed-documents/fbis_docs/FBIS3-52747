In my view, it is an important topic and I hope that our ummah will pay special attention to this important topic. Recently, in his remarks the leader has a few times stressed an issue to which I feel the media has not paid sufficient attention, despite the fact that full attention is usually paid to his remarks. That issue, which is a very important issue, is his repeated references to the fact that today it is a major sin -- an unforgivable sin -- to create despondency among the people. He is emphatic on this point and repeatedly refers to it. I wish to talk a little concerning these comments. I believe that it is an appropriate time to raise this issue, because I feel that we are faced with a very dangerous and a very mischievous propaganda conspiracy. We have completed one period of reconstruction and we are on the threshold of launching the second plan. I wish to provide some explanations that are also relevant to our discussion. That plan is now being studied by the Majles. I have a very clear impression, and there are numerous clues for it, that the world arrogance, especially America -- because today it is the leader of that propaganda campaign and is guiding those pressures -- has realized that the Islamic revolution has successfully passed through many dangerous stages that they predicted would lead us to a dead end, that the people are reaching the stage of necessary confidence, and that the country is achieving necessary stability. They are afraid that if this revolution, with all that it stands for, achieves full political, economic, and cultural stability and if it can strengthen its foundations they will no longer be able to damage it and the matter will be completely taken out of their hands. You are aware of the previous stages and how they confronted us at each stage. Today we are entering a completely new stage, and I see that there is an organized propaganda campaign waged against us, so that the people may lose their confidence in Islam and feel that the revolution and Islam will not be able to build the country and will not be able to create prosperity for the people. This in short is the essence of the propaganda onslaught that is being waged by them today. Its aim is to weaken the morale of the people, if they succeed. If they do succeed in creating despondency among the people they have achieved their greatest goal in history and have prevented a danger that threatens the center of world arrogance. They will then be able to weaken the general movement that exists in the world today. Iran is not their only target. Today you see in some newspapers -- there are of course many such reports, but here you only see a small portion of it -- that arrogant observers have become worried that the wave of Islam has passed beyond the borders of Iran, that the new Islam, the Islam that was propagated by the Imam [Khomeyni] has transcended Iranian frontiers and has penetrated many Islamic countries. Even in Western countries it has aroused a great deal of interest among the perceptive individuals -- not ordinary people who are influenced by propaganda, but people of conscience, people of understanding. They have this fear. Therefore, they have to deliver their blow at the base of the revolution. If here they can persuade the people that this is not in their interest, then they have achieved their aim. I am sorry that to a large extent they receive the basic material for their propaganda from inside our country. Certain people who have good intentions and who feel concerned about the country raise some minor issues and magnify some difficulties and problems to such an extent that immediately you see that Radio Israel, BBC Radio, and Voice of America broadcast it back to us. And it is not limited to those three radio stations. You notice that any small issue that we raise here reverbrates throughout the world and gives rise to a flood of special articles in newspapers, which are today regarded as the source material for the newspapers in the Third World. They are then translated and taken to all Islamic countries. It requires special alertness. I get really worried when I see that well-intentioned individuals quote certain untrue figures and statistics that are contrary to the realities and that will only lead to the despondency of the people and make them negative. They will weaken the morale of the people or, at least, sow the seeds of doubt in them. This is our very serious duty -- to mention our positive points, to talk about the efforts of these people, the endeavors of this nation, the gains of this nation. Perhaps one of the reasons for this -- I am not sure if this is the reason -- is that our media is inclined to give prominence to negative reports. Those who are interested in appearing in the media say something negative, because they see that the following day their names and remarks are published in big letters on the front pages of newspapers. Of course, a person might have said something with good intentions, so that he can express what is in his heart. See what is happening in the world today, and why the leader of the revolution regards this as a major sin. This does not mean that we should not refer to the difficulties. It does not mean that we should not criticize. If we do not criticize, the issues will not be put right. However, one should say these things in such a way that one only refers to the facts. If a certain organization wishes to say, for instance, that the deprived classes are faced with problems, and if it raises a slogan that the bones of the deprived classes are being crushed [in last week's Friday prayer sermons Ayatollah Jannati used an almost identical sentence saying that the bones of deprived classes are being crushed], then he [as heard] should also give the correct figures and statistics. He should say how much we are spending from the public treasury for the deprived classes, how much we are spending in deprived areas, how much we are spending on reconstruction, how much we are paying in subsidies to them, how cheaply we are selling the bread, how cheaply we are selling the fuel, how cheaply we are selling vegetable oil, how cheaply we are selling medicine. Let him give those figures, and then say that there are also some problems, so that the people may know that their treasury, their country, their Majles, their government, their leader are working for them. However, if one only comes and says that the situation is a certain way... [pauses] if one did not know those individuals one would have doubted their sincerity. At times, I feel that there are some deceitful, satanic individuals who get close to podiums and pens and produce false figures, and then it goes into the newspapers. This has happened, and whether some people try to make amends for those mistakes or not the feeling of despondency will continue. As your trusted friend I tell you that with the implementation of the First Plan world arrogance realized that it has lost out. They realized the country's problems were solved, that there are no more problems. The biggest problem in the country was our strong dependence on foreign currency earned from oil sales. The West could always bring our country to its knees with that weapon. Four or five years into the plan they realized that Iran is not as vulnerable as they had thought because we have non-oil exports worth at least $5 billion annually. Of course, it is about $4 billion in official figures, because those who export do not put down true figures. If, for example, their goods are worth $1,500, they put down $1,000 in their statements. The true figure is higher. We have also saved more than that amount. In many areas we do not need the foreign currency earned from oil sales. Raw materials for many factories -- steel, aluminium, copper, chemicals, and others -- are domestically produced. Many intermediary goods are produced by our own industries. They make the machinery. The food situation is not like in the past. If we put slight pressure on consumption and control the consumption of bread and other things, our present grain production would be sufficient for our needs. Tea is reaching self-sufficiency. Wheat has had a marvelous growth. Chickens have reached self-sufficiency. Food in our country is generally no longer imported, except for a few items. For example, if we were importing $4 billion worth of foodstuffs three years ago, we need to import $1 billion today. That is, about a third. I can see that our needs from the outside world have decreased. Many of the heavy machinery that you see -- tractors, bulldozers, loaders, wagons, locomotives, engines for large and small machinery -- a large portion of them are being built by our own industries. Our defense industries' requirements were always imported and we had to undergo a huge expense. We now import practically none of our defense needs. It is the same with the chemical industry, which is the most important. Oil by-products, which we used to import, we are now producing -- most of them ourselves. We are expanding gas to replace other fuels. The West realize that our dependence on oil has decreased. For that reason, now that they cause a shock and talk about dealing us blows, they deal a blow to their own friends. Despite the fact that the price of our oil came down by nearly 30 percent in our budget calculations, we submitted our budget -- and also the Plan -- to the Majles like that of 1372 with a different growth figure. This is due to the fact that the infrastructural works carried out during the course of the First Plan have yielded their intended results, and today the problem of dependence on oil has been resolved to a large extent. Of course, if oil generates more income, we will naturally be able to work faster. For instance, instead of spending $10 billion on reconstruction, we will be able to spend $20 billion. However, if such an increase is not possible, we will not be facing any danger. The speed of work might be reduced, but the country will not face any danger. Enough infrastructural works have been carried out in our country to meet our needs today. If we do not face any unforeseen event, then we can be confident that for the next five years we will have no electrical power cuts and black-outs in this country. At present, we have connected 200 towns to the national gas network, and we are in the process of connecting other towns with a great deal of speed. We have taken telephone lines to the heart of our rural areas. Our transport system is enjoying a full balance, in the sense that we have enough cargo for our trucks, while at the same time the cargo does not have to wait for trucks. The capacity of our ports has increased from 16 million tonnes to 28 million tonnes, and at present we do not have any problem with our ports. We have, to a large extent, harnessed our water resources. Moreover, we are managing to meet the needs of our factories for raw material with what we produce domestically. Praise be to God, the country does not have any problems at the moment. This is exactly the thing that has worried the arrogant countries. I have been informed that during confidential meetings between Western countries discussing Iran, the Americans have stated that this, and not Islamic fundamentalism, is the danger they faced. When the right time comes, we will of course reveal all this in a documented manner. The Americans have said: This constitutes the real danger, and we should not allow Iran to develop itself. If Iran manages to accomplish this, then we will not be able to do anything. However, we have already passed through this stage during the course of our first development plan, and it is now too late for the Westerners to realize this and enter the arena. If they had delivered this petroleum-shock to us four years ago, then there would have been danger. Today, however, there is no danger, whatever they do. I can confidently tell you, as your expert, that even if they stop our oil exports, Iran can still maintain its present course and enjoy the same conditions as today. Of course, if such a thing were to happen, then the process of development would have to slow down. Still, that would not constitute a problem. If, for example, we were intent on building a factory in two years, we would then have to do it in five years. [passage omitted] What, however, is clear is that we have overcome the dangers, and today the Westerners are intent on disheartening the people. This is because the type of work we have carried out can naturally have economic and social consequences. The most important thing that we ever did... [pauses] one of the most important things that we have done was to reform the price systems. They consider this a weak point, however. I would like to emphasize that it is absolutely impossible for us to be able to reconstruct our country by creating artificial prices and imposing on domestic products by employing mechanisms such as ration coupons and legislations. No industry can expect growth if its products are sold at artificially set prices. No industrial producer will ever enter the arena willingly under such circumstances. The reform in the price system was another major problem of ours, the bulk of which has been resolved, while the what remains must be dealt with step by step. Those moribund snakes who have left this winter behind, have started to raise certain issues and ignore all the services offered by the government. Although they are aware that these issues are really points of strength, they still raise them hoping they may be able to weaken the people's morale. However, they are once again mistaken, as these people are very discerning. When I made the trip to Mazanderan just recently -- you saw a few small corners of what I saw there -- the people showed their mettle. The people are always waiting for an opportunity to express their feelings, what they understand. The people naturally carried out the maneuvers of being truly present in the arena. They made me understand that all those ill-omened and disheartening themes that are being fanned from some podiums domestically and by some foreign media cannot discourage them. They are far advanced in understanding the issues. They understand better than those who imagine themselves to understand and talk big. [passage omitted] It was the same in countries abroad; the same in our neighboring countries. We have had visits abroad and you yourselves have seen their example. The eyes of the Muslims outside also are on us. Fortunately the signs of Iran's construction are there as well. Mr. Niyazov who was our guest during these last few days said that the officials of heads of the CIS who were in Ashgabat three or four days ago reported to their heads that the Turkmen markets are full of goods, contrary to the other CIS states. Then the CIS heads asked where those goods came from and were told from our Iranian brethren. The Iranian merchants are filling this place in that way. That means that your neighbor is feeling the signs of construction here because of its commercial link with you. Then all the CIS heads encouraged that link, instead of being concerned. That is the Iranian that you say seeks to export terrorism. That is the movement that exists. Let us not be ungrateful for that bounty of God. I am not claiming that we do not have any difficulties either. We certainly have difficulties. Sometimes something is expensive, something may be hard to find, some might bully. Well, such incidents in a state that seeks to reconstruct, which seeks to invest in its infrastructure, seeks to struggle and lock horns with the most satanic power in the world, seeks to confront international embargoes -- well, it will have such problems as well. It is not right that a country that annually is spending hundreds of thousands of millions of tumans [10 rials] on the deprived through subsidies, through services to deprived area, through relief committees, through other organizations that have a relief aspect for the people, and many other ways. Essentially the revolution is for the deprived and essentially it is the deprived who are our friends and army in the revolution arena. Then we should constantly say from our podiums and by our pens that the deprived are being crushed. Sometimes one sees some individuals who say that the bones of the vulnerable stratum are being broken. They misspell bone, yet they can chant slogans very well. Let us not approach the people's morale in this way. The services that we are giving to those same people are not in my hands or the hands of those like me. It is the masses of the people, our community, our Hezbollahi managers, our oppressed revolutionary personalities who are advancing their country toward God as well as toward welfare in the face of the wave upon wave of prevalent mischief. They must be supported. Our enemies must not be allowed to open up unsound windows and enter with poisonous propaganda. We should not dishearten those people who are in the arena, self-sacrificing and heroic; a people who have always routed the enemy by their heroism. That is the word of the leader. In his remarks he had other great words. He said compare your country with your neighbors and the other developing countries. I do not wish to name them and give figures about their lives. Their difficulties are not at all comparable to ours. Their conditions of life are not comparable to ours. That must be made a point -- power and morale in the people. Of course many of our friends and media constantly publish figures and the services rendered. The only point I want to make is that anyone who is interested in the revolution today must avoid disheartening the people pointlessly. Of course, however, if there is some truth to be told, if it is not told it is possible for the falsehood or the wrong or the deviation to remain. It is right to criticize; it is right to point out problems; it is right to reform; and it is right to pursue reform and also to confront wrongdoers. All that has its own path, but all must be for encouraging the people, heartening the people and their presence in the arenas, because that is the very thing that is a thorn in the side of world arrogance. It is the very thing that is targeted by world arrogance to prevent the people from remaining in the arena. Thank God our people are so alert and so aware that in these 15 years they have come through the hardest trials with honor. At the end of this sermon I must offer congratulations and condolences to the families of the martyrs whose noble bodies we will be escorting for burial today. One of the most painful and and one of the most selfless families are those who have men missing in action. Their position is even more difficult than the families of the martyr's because at least they have the grave of their martyr and their situation is clear. Our dear forces on the borders are carrying out a tremendous job through finding the markers that we had for them, identity tags and numbers, which are found in either the Iraqi or Iranian soil. They are gradually finding the unknown martyrs, who are considered, for the time being, to be missing. I thank them and also call on them to speed up their operations so we could know. For this very reason we do not know how many prisoners we have in Iraq. Many of those who we think are prisoners might be martyrs or vice versa. This is a very valuable job and I thank them. We also humbly thank the families of the missing, may God bless them greater patience. [passage omitted]
