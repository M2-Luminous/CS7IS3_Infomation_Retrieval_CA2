(ii) For airplanes on which all of the modifications described in the service bulletins referenced by paragraph I.D., ``Compliance,'' on page 17 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994, have been accomplished, excluding the modification described in Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54&hyph;2118, dated July 25, 1986: (A) Within 56 months after the effective date of this AD, accomplish the modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure and perform the inspections of the adjacent structure that has not been replaced by the modification. (B) Repeat the ultrasonic inspections to detect cracking of the aft-most two fastener holes in both strut midspar fittings on the inboard and outboard nacelle struts, as required by AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;13 R1 at intervals not to exceed 1,000 landings, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54&hyph;2118, dated July 25, 1986, until the modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure is accomplished in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994. Note 3: These inspections of the fastener holes are required by AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;13 R1, amendment 39&hyph;5546, at 4,000-landing intervals. Accomplishment of the inspections of the fastener holes, as required by this paragraph at 1,000-landing intervals, constitutes compliance with paragraph A. of AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;13 R1. (iii) For airplanes on which all of the modifications described in the service bulletins referenced by paragraph I.D., ``Compliance,'' on page 17 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994, have been accomplished; except that rework of the midspar fitting lugs or spring beam aft lugs was accomplished in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2152, dated December 23, 1992, or Revision 1, dated July 15, 1993, instead of Revision 2, dated September 16, 1993: (A) Within 56 months after the effective date of this AD, accomplish the modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure and perform the inspections of the adjacent structure that has not been replaced by the modification. (B) Prior to the accumulation of 2,500 landings or 3 years since rework of the lugs, whichever occurs earlier, perform an ultrasonic inspection to detect cracking of the inboard and outboard midspar fitting lugs or spring beam aft lugs of each strut, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2152, Revision 2, dated September 16, 1993. Repeat this inspection thereafter as required by AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;07. Note 4: This ultrasonic inspection is required by AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;07, amendment 39&hyph;8678, to be performed prior to the accumulation of 5,000 landings or 5 years since accomplishment of the rework of the lugs, whichever occurs earlier, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2152, dated December 23, 1992, or Revision 1, dated July 15, 1993. Repetitive inspections are required by that AD at intervals not to exceed 500 landings for inboard struts and 1,000 landings for outboard struts. Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has approved Revision 2 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2152, dated September 16, 1993, as an alternative method of compliance for accomplishment of these ultrasonic inspections and rework of the lugs. Revision 2 of the alert service bulletin recommends that lugs that have been reworked in accordance with the original issue or Revision 1 of the alert service bulletin be inspected prior to the accumulation of 2,500 landings or 3 years since accomplishment of the rework of the lugs, whichever occurs earlier. Therefore, accomplishment of ultrasonic inspections prior to the accumulation of 2,500 landings or 3 years since accomplishment of rework of the lugs, whichever occurs earlier, and thereafter as required by AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;07, constitutes compliance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;07. (iv) For airplanes on which all of the modifications described in the service bulletins referenced by paragraph I.D., ``Compliance,'' on page 17 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2152, dated November 3, 1994, have been accomplished; except that rework of the midspar fitting lugs or spring beam aft lugs was accomplished in accordance with the Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2152, dated December 23, 1992, or Revision 1, dated July 15, 1993, instead of Revision 2, dated September 16, 1993; and excluding the modification described in Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54&hyph;2118, dated July 25, 1986: (A) Within 56 months after the effective date of this AD, accomplish the modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure and perform the inspections of the adjacent structure that has not been replaced by the modification. (B) Repeat the ultrasonic inspections to detect cracking of the aft-most two fastener holes in both strut midspar fittings on the inboard and outboard nacelle struts, as required by AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;13 R1, at intervals not to exceed 1,000 landings, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54&hyph;2118, dated July 25, 1986, until the modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure is accomplished in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994. (C) Prior to the accumulation of 2,500 landings or 3 years since rework of the lugs, whichever occurs earlier, perform an ultrasonic inspection to detect cracking of the inboard and outboard midspar fitting lugs or spring beam aft lugs of each strut, and repeat the inspection thereafter as required by AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;07, until the modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure is accomplished in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994. Note 5: Notes 3 and 4 are also applicable to this paragraph. (v) For all other airplanes not subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), (a)(2)(iii), or (a)(2)(iv) of this AD: Within 32 months after the effective date of this AD, accomplish the modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure and perform the inspections of the adjacent structure that has not been replaced by the modification. Note 6: The following table graphically illustrates the applicability and compliance times for accomplishing the modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure for as required by paragraph (a)(2) of this AD. ␣ 1Paragraph 1Accomplishment of service bulletins 1Revision level 1Compliance time (i) All in paragraph I.D. 56 months. (ii) All except 747&hyph;54&hyph;2118 56 months. (iii) All except 747&hyph;54A2159 2 56 months. (iv) All except 747&hyph;54&hyph;2118 and 747&hyph;54A2159 2 56 months. (v) (1) 32 months. 1Paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this AD is applicable to all airplanes, other than those addressed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), (a)(2)(iii), and (a)(2)(iv) of this AD. As such, these airplanes may have accomplished some or none of the service bulletins listed in paragraph I.D. of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994. (b) Perform the inspections and checks specified in paragraph III, NOTES 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the Accomplishment Instructions on pages 149 and 150 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994, concurrently with the modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure required by paragraph (a) of this AD. Prior to further flight, correct any discrepancies found, in accordance with the alert service bulletin.
