Aushev has sent an open letter to Yeltsin emphasizing that the decisions by the Russian leadership on normalization of the situation and return of refugees and displaced persons to their permanent residences are not being implemented. The state of emergency in the conflict zone has continued for two years already and more than 60,000 refugees cannot return to North Ossetia. Aushev said the Moscow talks between the North Ossetian and Ingush delegations had brought practically no results. He suggested that any further delay in implementation of the Russian president's decree on refugees and displaced persons issued on December 13, 1993, could trigger off unpredictable consequences. Aushev addressed the Russian president as the guarantee for human rights in Russia to use all his power in order to prevent new inter-ethnic conflicts in North Caucuses.
