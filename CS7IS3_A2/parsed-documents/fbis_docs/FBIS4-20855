Mr Perry also attended a session of the joint Kazakhstan-American committee on defence industry conversion to civilian production. The meetings, and the talks with President Nursultan Nazarbayev several hours earlier, resulted in the signing of an agreement on the conversion of the Kazakhstan defence industry to civilian production. The agreement is actually a supplement to the earlier reached accord on the dismantling of the SS-18 missile silos and ensures an influx of an aggregate of 70 million U.S. dollars to the republic for defence industry conversion needs. These documents are intended to ensure the dismantling of combat nuclear missile systems based in Kazakhstan and convert them to suit civilian and peaceful purposes, and additional training of the military personnel subject to demobilisation. U.S. businesses are to be invited to help the defence industry conversion effort. In particular, a number of American companies will be involved in the reconstruction of appropriate enterprises for them to change over to the manufacture of consumer goods. Mr. Perry and his party are to leave for Baykonur cosmodrome on March 20.
