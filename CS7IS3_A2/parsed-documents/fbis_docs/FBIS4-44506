According to preliminary estimates, the GDP broke the major 3 trillion yuan barrier. Fixed asset investments in the whole society broke approximately 11.5 quadrillion yuan. The fixed asset investment rate was about 37 percent. If we discount the factor that investment item prices were higher than overall prices and the factor of foreign firm investment, the fixed asset investment rate for the entire society (hereinafter the investment rate) still was as high as about 33 percent, 4-5 percentage points higher than the previous year's investment rate. The obvious increase in the investment rate raised the concern of several sectors. This brings up an acute problem: Could two successive years of high investment rates lead to an overheating of the overall economy and form serous inflation and cause us once again to have to conduct overall improvement and rectification and postpone reform? Comprehensive study of the domestic and foreign situation could lead to this conclusion: As China begins to enter the period of high investment before economic takeoff, a high rate of investment is an inevitable result of the current stage of economic development. Its essential basis is: I. Overcoming Bottlenecks Requires Added Investment From 1980 to 1992, China's investment rate went from low to high. To counter some years in which the investment rate reached 30-32 percent creating economic overheating and setting off inflation, beginning from actual experience, people arrived at the awareness that it is appropriate for China's investment rate not to exceed 30 percent. We should say that holding it within these limits for a very long period of time has been fundamentally reasonable. Looking back on a year in which an excessively high investment rate touched off serious economic problems, it was all from excessive investment in some government buildings and processing industries squeezing out normal consumer demands causing inflation in both consumption and investment and allocation of funds exceeding the total amount that could be allocated to production. After more than a decade of arduous efforts, the scale of China's processing industry production generally reached the capability of satisfying normal consumer demand and in certain industries it generally reached saturation. But possible development in fund [as written; basic?] industry and infrastructure did not correspondingly keep pace and bottlenecks in transportation, energy, and raw materials development restricted economic development and progress in reform and opening up. It is idle talk to speak of wanting to promote further economic growth without developing the infrastructure and overcoming short-term restrictions. Because the time limit on basic industries and infrastructure is long, the investment of a large amount cannot be put into operation in a short period of time like processing industries. Generally it requires five to seven years of development. So, to get by infrastructure barriers, it is necessary to go through a stage of high investment. There is not a second way that can be chosen. II. Savings Have Clearly Rebounded, Providing Sources of Funding for Investment Statistical data reveal that the overall savings rate for the whole society in 1980 was 35.6 percent. By 1992 it had risen to 43.3 percent, rising nearly 8 percentage points. The ratio of residents' savings in the broad sense to expendable income also rose from 4.5 percent in 1978 to 32 percent in 1992. The constant increase in the savings rate has provided investment with a considerable source of funds. Since the 1980s, changing trends in the overall consumption rate (including social consumption and residential consumption) more clearly confirm this problem. In the 1980s, the overall consumption rate was rather high, averaging 60 percent and above. After entering the 1990s, the overall consumption rate declined to 60 percent and below and declined from year to year. Contrary to this, the fixed asset investment rate for the whole society rose straight up. According to preliminary 1993 calculations, the overall consumption rate declined to 55.4 percent and the overall investment rate rose to 37.8 percent. The situation described above indicates that in the next stage the overall consumption rate can be essentially maintained at about 56-58 percent. If we take out the factor for reserves and the balance of payments, the investment rate can be maintained at about 35 percent, forming a high investment rate stage. This also is a requirement for China's present launching of international competition, preserving the advantage of cheap labor, and maintaining a rather low consumption rate and high investment rate. III. To Realize 1994 Economic Growth Targets, It Is Necessary To Maintain a High Investment Rate It is forecast that 1994 will still be a year of rapid economic growth. According to actual inherent economic forces, the economic growth rate could be about 9 percent. At the same time, with the push of demand and the pull of costs, prices also will go up by about 10 percent. Calculated by the indicators described above, the 1994 GDP could reach about 3.65 trillion yuan. As regards use, because of the current stable growth of consumption, calculating the consumption rate at 57 percent, the total consumption could reach about 2.08 trillion yuan. With the balance of payments maintained, after its use for consumption and normal reserves, the GDP arranged for fixed asset investment should be about 1.39 trillion yuan. According to these calculations, an investment rate as high as 38 percent is the inevitable result of an overall balance. If in a definite production situation, the scale of fixed asset investment is pushed down artificially low, it will inevitably lead to serious overstocking and an aggravation of three sided debts, leading to a slide in enterprise economic efficiency and treasury difficulties. If fixed asset investments are forced down and we want to guard against large increases in reserves, either there will be a favorable trade balance or the rate of growth of 1994 production will decline. But a decline in the economic growth rate also could forfeit the opportunity for rapid development, and a large increase in exports and reducing imports also is very difficult. So, the high investment rate is irreversible. This is a result produced by conditions in several sectors. Because the 1993 fixed asset investment base was too large, even if the actual amount in 1994 remains the same as 1993, at current values the investment scale will reach 1.265 trillion yuan and the investment rate still will be as high as about 35 percent.
