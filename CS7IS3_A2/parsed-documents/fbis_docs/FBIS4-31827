"I have already said it and say it again, this is the best program in the past five years", said the president, assessing the government's economic development plan, "The Strategy for Poland." The president added that specialists should now consider ways of implementing the plan. Many questions were on reprivatization. Walesa said that he was in favor of the restoration of property but stressed that it would be very difficult to sort out past ownership issues. The president quoted his proposals to carry out reprivatization. According to them the owner would receive the whole property, children would receive half, and grandchildren a quarter. Answering questions on vetting and decommunization, the president said that he was in favor of vetting either by disclosing all documents available or by courts, prosecutors' offices and other authorized institutions conducting this. The president said that he will take part in the forthcoming local elections and added that he hoped these will not be political elections. When asked who he will vote for Walesa said: "I trust my wife and my family." "Are we going to decide whether we live in a Polish People's Republic No. 2, or in a country where democracy is being built, or whether we're to be motivated by the principle of a separation of powers, or not?", the president asked a listener who accused him of not taking steps to fully clear up the issue of the killing of Father Jerzy Popieluszko and the punishing of the perpetrators of the crime against Grzegorz Przemyk. "What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to violate principles, take over power, become first secretary, Stalin, or make room for a Stalin?" Walesa retorted. The president confirmed that he will not sign the amended abortion law which allows abortions in cases where the woman suffers from material hardship. "I cannot sign this kind of decision on murder and I will never sign it," he said. Walesa described attempts to adopt or reject the concordat as "something we should all be ashamed of". He said in a situation where there is pressure to increase wages he will sign the new law on taxing excess wage increases, otherwise "the reforms will be destabilized". The president was also asked about personnel matters, including, why he appointed Henryk Goryszewski to the post of head of the National Security Bureau despite information, which has also appeared in the mass media, that his son-in-law was involved in "the car scandal." "Before I appointed Mr. Goryszewski, I ordered a careful examination of his involvement in these matters," the president said and added that everyone should answer for themselves. "I have four daughters and will have four sons-in-law but I don't know what they will be like and I am not going to take responsibility for them," the president said. "I did not chose a wife for you so please don't chose one for me," the president replied to a listener who accused the president of employing "political amateurs" like Wachowski and Falandysz in the Belweder Palace.
