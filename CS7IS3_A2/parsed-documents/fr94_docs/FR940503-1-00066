FR940503-1-00066 FR940503-1-00012 EPA is proposing that the sampling, testing, and volume determinations at the foreign refinery loading port would have to be performed by an independent laboratory that is U.S.-based. The proposed criteria for independence are the same criteria that apply for the independent sampling and testing requirement for domestic refiners and importers, and that are specified at ยง80.65(f)(2)(ii). Similarly, EPA is proposing that the attest requirements would have to be fulfilled by certified public accountants (CPA's) that are United States citizens, or members of a firm that is a U.S. corporation. The proposed requirements that the independent laboratories and CPA's be U.S.-based is intended to result in laboratories and CPA's over which EPA may easily exercise jurisdiction. EPA's ability to inspect, obtain judicial enforcement, or submit information requests under section 114 of the Clean Air Act is significantly more effective in the case of a person that is a United States citizen or a United States corporation. These enforcement approaches may not be easily available against non-U.S. corporations or citizens. EPA seeks comment on the proposed requirement that independent laboratories and CPA's be U.S. corporations or citizens. C. The Volume Limitation on Use of Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines EPA is proposing that the total volume of imported reformulated gasoline that could be subject to the individual baseline for any foreign refinery would be limited each year to the volume of that refinery's gasoline that was used in the United States in 1990. It has been argued that this proposed volume constraint would limit any potential adverse environmental effects of gasoline imported under individual foreign refinery baselines in comparison to the final rule, as is discussed more fully below. The proposed volume constraint would apply separately to each foreign refinery having an individual baseline, and would apply across all of the importers who import gasoline produced at each foreign refinery. Thus, for example, if the gasoline produced at a particular foreign refinery having an individual baseline is imported by ten importers during a specific year, the volume constraint applicable to that foreign refinery would apply to the ten importers collectively. Any of the hypothetical refinery's gasoline that is imported that year beyond the proposed volume constraint would be subject to the baseline otherwise applicable to the importer (normally the statutory baseline), and the individual foreign refinery's baseline would not apply to this excess volume. EPA is proposing that the date gasoline is imported would be the criterion for determining which gasoline would qualify for use of an individual foreign refinery baseline. In the event importers claim use of an individual foreign refinery's baseline for a volume in excess of the proposed volume constraint, the gasoline that is first imported that equals the volume constraint would receive use of the individual baseline. Thus, the proposed volume constraint would apply based on the date the gasoline is imported into the United States, and not based on the date the gasoline is produced. Beginning on January 1 of each year the volume constraint accounting would begin anew. EPA is not proposing any regulatory mechanisms that would provide importers a running accounting of the volume of a particular foreign refinery's gasoline that has been imported subject to an individual refinery baseline. Moreover, EPA would not know the total volume of imported gasoline claimed to be subject to any particular foreign refinery's baseline until quarterly or annual reports are submitted to EPA. EPA expects that importers would make private arrangements with their foreign refiner business partners to track the volume of each foreign refinery's gasoline that is imported under each individual foreign refinery's baseline. In this way EPA believes that importers would be able to know whether any particular batch of imported gasoline would be within the volume constraint that would apply to the foreign refinery that produced the gasoline. The proposed consequences for the importer that would result from claiming use of an individual foreign refinery's baseline beyond the proposed volume constraint are discussed below. EPA is proposing that any reformulated gasoline that is imported during 1994 and for which an individual foreign refinery baseline is used would be combined with such gasoline imported during 1995 for purposes of the proposed volume constraint. This proposal for combining compliance calculations for gasoline imported during 1994 and 1995 is analogous to the requirement in the final rule that reformulated gasoline produced or imported in 1994 must be combined with reformulated gasoline produced or imported in 1995 for determining compliance with average standards.
