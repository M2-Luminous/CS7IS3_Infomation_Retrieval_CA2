The latest Euro-barometer by the Gallup research institute confirms his view that the referendum on Austria's accession to the European Union [EU] can only produce a clear majority in favor: Never before have those in favor led by such a clear majority as last week. If the Austrians were to vote on EU membership next Sunday, 49 percent would be in favor. Only 34 percent said they would vote against EU membership. In 400 telephone interviews, Gallup found that while there was a neck-and-neck race a year ago, the share of those in favor has increased by 15 percent. At the beginning of March, when the outcome of the membership negotiations in Brussels was not yet known, only 47 percent favored EU membership, while 40 percent were against it. Admittedly, the number of those still undecided has increased over the past few weeks -- from 13 percent at the beginning of March to 17 percent last week. The question of how many people have taken a final decision on which way to vote in the June referendum has produced even more dramatic results. Only 60 percent have made up their minds so far -- 32 percent want to decide at the last minute. But 92 percent want to take part in the referendum. The increase in "pro-EU" voters might be so pronounced because the majority of Austrians hold a positive view on the outcome of the membership negotiations in Brussels. Exactly 50 percent think that the politicians have achieved a great deal in the negotiations. Yet 39 percent judge the talks negatively, saying that "too little was achieved" in Brussels. Public interest in Europe has increased enormously: 53 percent of Austrians are "very" interested in the EU (March: 39 percent), while only 18 percent are not interested in it at all (March: 29 percent). But only a quarter (24 percent) feel well-informed about EU membership, while 42 percent of Austrians consider themselves poorly informed or not informed at all. [passage omitted]
