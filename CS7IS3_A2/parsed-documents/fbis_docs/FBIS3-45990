The committee was reopened yesterday in Beijing for the first time since 1987. Meanwhile, China also plans to allow foreign financial institutions to open branches in more major cities, according to the joint statement. Liu also said China intends to make renminbi an internationally convertible currency when the time is ripe. As the first step toward this goal, China has unified its dual-track foreign exchange system. In another development, Chen Yuan, Vice-Governor of the People's Bank of China, told the committee China will allow another one or two foreign insurance companies to enter the domestic market. Currently, the American International Group (AIG) is the only foreign insurer doing business in China. He said it will take time for China to work out a plan to allow foreign financial organizations to conduct renminbi business. However, Chen said this year's financial and fiscal reforms will help promote the process. In addition, he said other restrictions on foreign banks will also be relaxed with the unification of the tax system, adding identical treatment for both domestic and overseas banks will eventually be realized. However, he said the time is still not ripe to open the securities market to foreign companies as the market remains small in scale and management and regulations have not yet been perfected. Chen said with the development of China's securities industry and the deepening reform of the financial and foreign exchange systems, China will gradually open its securities market to foreign companies. He said regulations governing the management of foreign financial organizations in China have been approved by the State Council and are expected to be made public in the near future after further revision. Co-chairing the session with Liu, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen highlighted the U.S. interest in supporting China's efforts to develop and reform its domestic capital markets, including improving opportunities for the participation of foreign financial institutions. He said the United States supports a strong, stable, prosperous and modern China. Speaking highly of China's recent decisions to move forward with market-oriented reforms of its monetary, banking, tax and foreign exchange systems, Bentsen said the United States will intensify its technical support for these reforms. Meanwhile, he said the United States will continue its staunch support for China's efforts to regain contracting party status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding on Market Access signed by the two countries. He welcomed China's decision to unify its exchange rates and improve importers' access to foreign exchange as important steps on the road to Gatt accession and to full convertibility of renminbi. The statement said the Chinese finance minister welcomes the promise of expanded U.S. technical assistance for China's reforms and appreciates the Unites States continued support for China's reattainment of Gatt contracting party status. However, Liu also said he hoped the U.S. would remove obstacles to trade with China and further relax restrictions on high technology exports to China. To advance the bilateral dialogue on particular issues of immediate interest, both of them agreed to establish initial working groups in three important areas, including monetary and banking issues, exchange system reform and investment and economic co- operation. The groups should meet at an interval of six months, or as necessary, and report progress to the annual meeting of the committee.
