FR941130-0-00026 FR941130-0-00003 OTS further revised the appraisal rules to provide that in those instances where the initial appraisal report is deemed to be materially deficient and/or substantially incomplete, the OTS may deem the entire conversion application materially deficient and/or substantially incomplete, and require the filing of a new application. 6 6 The OTS has recently issued updated staff guidance for conversion appraisers that provides specific details on appraisal methodology as well as report content, and also incorporates provisions 9 and 10 of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. In adopting the guidelines, the OTS consulted with the FDIC to ensure uniform appraisal standards. Finally, the OTS requested public comment on whether it should amend its regulations to prohibit an appraiser or its affiliates from also serving as an underwriter or selling agent. Approximately 25% of the comments addressing appraisal standards affirmatively supported the requirement that a full appraisal report and justification for methodology employed be required to insure a ``fair value'' assessment of an institution. One commenter cautioned against an attempt to eliminate any ``pop'' or ``post conversion windfall,'' and suggested management of such price increases instead, by limiting them to a reasonable percentage. Eleven commenters expressed concern that market forces cannot be regulated, that appraisals and pricing of stock are not exact sciences, and that the revisions may force the stock to be overvalued. One of the eleven stated that the stock market is not predictable enough to institutionalize an expectation that the stock of every institution will trade within a fixed parameter following conversion. One commenter requested that the terms ``materially deficient'' and ``consistently undervalued'' be defined and another commenter requested that the term ``independence'' be defined and that the OTS provide guidance as to the appropriate degree of participation by management in the appraisal process. One commenter stated that the OTS should deal with the appraiser directly when an initial appraisal report is materially deficient or substantially incomplete and should not penalize the thrift; another commenter stated that the OTS should give institutions time to correct inappropriate appraisals without the need to file costly new conversion applications. Eleven commenters addressed the issue of whether to prohibit appraisers or their affiliates from also serving as underwriters or selling agents. Six stated that appraisal firms should be separate from firms that market conversion stock so as to avoid all potential conflicts of interest. One of the six further stated that underwriters or selling agents in one situation may not be able to be objective as appraisers in another situation and that if an attorney continually uses the same appraiser, that appraiser becomes a quasi-affiliate of the attorney, with questionable independence. Five expressed the view that there was no evidence of abuse where the appraiser and selling agent are the same parties, that the two functions can be impartially carried out and that to require different parties is costly and detrimental to small thrifts. In implementing revisions to the appraisal regulations, the OTS was not attempting to create an appraisal system that would result in precise conformity between appraisal values and post-conversion stock prices. The OTS, however, remains concerned about significant discrepancies between appraisal values and immediate post-conversion trading prices. The OTS also recognizes that there will be circumstances that could not reasonably have been foreseen by an appraiser that may result in pricing discrepancies in a particular transaction. As noted in the preamble to the interim final rule, however, when there is a consistent pattern of discrepancies by a particular appraisal firm, the independence and competence of the appraiser is called into question.
