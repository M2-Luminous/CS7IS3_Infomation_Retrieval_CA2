Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, answered reporters' questions in regard to the law. Reporter: What is the significance of the formal adoption of the "Foreign Trade Law"? Wu Yi: It is of epoch-making significance in the history of our country's foreign economic relations and trade. It is a good beginning of the legalization of our country's foreign trade and is also an important step to link up with the world economy. Viewing the domestic situation, since the founding of New China more than 40 years ago, we always depended mainly on direct administrative means to govern foreign trade. It was an unavoidable method in the initial phase of New China and during the period of the enforcement of a planned economy. Meanwhile, the scale of our country's foreign trade was quite limited at that time, and so this was also an effective method. However, after more than 10 years of reform and opening up, tremendous changes have taken place in our foreign trade today. In 1993, the total volume of our country's imports and exports reached $195.72 billion, increasing by 575 times as compared with $340 million in 1949. Our country has established trade relations with more than 180 countries and regions in the world. Reform and opening up have altered the situation of monopolizing foreign trade by less than 20 state-run foreign trade companies. Now there are more than 7,000 enterprises in the whole country which are authorized to engage in foreign trade. In addition, there are over 170,000 foreign-funded enterprises. The total number of enterprises which can directly engage in imports and exports has reached some 180,000. It has become more and more difficult to use administrative means to effectively regulate economic activities of such a large scale. In the course of reform and opening up, foreign trade departments, like other economic departments, are faced with the situation of "becoming stifled when as controls are tightened, and becoming disorderly when controls are relaxed." Owing to the fact that there are several government departments administering foreign trade with diverse policies, commodity wars of various types emerged for a time. Foreign trade, as an important economic department, must be guided onto a legal track to achieve its smooth development. Viewing the situation internationally, our country's economy has become quite inseparable from the world as a result of our country's opening up to the outside world. At present, foreign trade accounts for 38 percent of the GNP. Further opening up to the outside world will continuously strengthen our country's link with the world economy. The most important part is that we must follow international prctice in administering our country's economy. In setting foreign trade policies, we must follow international trade regulations universally accepted by various countries, such as the stipulations of the GATT. Our country applied for restoring China's position as a signatory of the GATT as early as in 1986. However, the basic requirements of GATT on the trade system of a contracting party include the uniformity and openness of that trade system. Without a foreign trade law, meeting these requirements is unthinkable. Reporter: What things are provided for in the Foreign Trade Law? Wu Yi: The Foreign Trade Law will make adjustments on the import and export of cargoes, technological imports and exports, and international service trade in accordance with its stipulations. The import and export of cargoes is a form of traditional foreign trade, as well as the most important component of foreign trade. Technological imports and exports means the import and export of technologies, which has developed and expanded in our country following the implementation of reform and opening up. We have gained a lot of experience in these two trade areas, and the Foreign Trade Law provides more detailed stipulations about them. The international service trade, however, is a new task for our country. It is also a rather complex trade area which involves many trades and departments, such as banking, insurance, transportation, tourism, telecommunications, consultative services, and contracts for projects. Each type of service has its unique character. Therefore, the Foreign Trade Law only stipulates the general principle one must abide by when conducting international service trade. Reporter: Would you please brief us on the main contents of the Foreign Trade Law? Wu Yi: The Foreign Trade Law is the basic law on foreign trade. It mainly stipulates basic principles and policy and prescribes the general framework of a management system for our country's foreign trade. The Foreign Trade Law mainly prescribes the following systems, which form the basic system for foreign trade management: 1) The system of examining and approving foreign trade enterprises. 2) Besides establishing the principle of free imports and exports for the import and export of cargoes and technologies, the law clearly stipulates items which are banned or whose import is limited. The Foreign Trade Law stipulates that quotas and permits be employed to manage the limited import and export of cargoes and technologies. The distribution of quotas will be based on the principle of efficiency, fairness, openness, and fair competition. 3) Regarding international service trade, the Foreign Trade Law stipulates that our country shall gradually open up its service trade markets in line with international treaties and agreements to which it is a party or member, so that other parties or members can enjoy market access opportunities and national treatment. 4) The law establishes an antidumping and antisubsidy system which also provides for guarantee measures. The system will provide suitable relief to relevant industries of our country which are harmed by unfair trade practices in foreign countries, or to relevant industries of our country which have difficulty undertaking international businesses ventures which our country assumes. 5) The Foreign Trade Law also stipulates various measures to promote foreign trade development, including building import and export banks, setting up foreign trade development funds and funds for risk-taking, carrying out export tax reimbursement, and encouraging the development of businesses providing foreign trade consultative services. Reporter: What are the main characteristics of the Foreign Trade Law? Wu Yi: The main characteristics of the Foreign Trade Law can be summed up in two sentences: First, the law proceeds from the national condition. Second, the law gets us close to international practices. The building of the socialist market economy is a progressive process which cannot be accomplished in one step. We fully took into consideration China's special national condition when we formulated the Foreign Trade Law. Under the present situation where the enterprise operating mechanism has not been fully transformed and where the mechanism of self-restriction and self-supervision in enterprises is still not perfect, entirely abandoning the system of foreign trade enterprise approval will result in chaos in foreign trade orders. Cases in point are the raging of the "great commodity war" several years ago, foreign countries' leveling frequent dumping charges against China's export commodities in recent years, and the recurrent problem of importing duplicate equipment. Therefore, we still stipulate an approval system for foreign trade enterprises in the Foreign Trade Law, despite the fact that this system was questioned by GATT member nations. Regarding commodity and technology imports, we proceed from the reality that China is still a developing country. Therefore, we stipulate that in order to establish or accelerate the pace of the establishment of a specific Chinese industry, and to safeguard China's international financial position and to ensure China's international balance of payments, China may impose restrictions on imports and exports when it deems necessary. In consideration of the fact that China's service sector is still undeveloped and that China lacks experience in international services, we therefore stipulated in the Foreign Trade Law that China will practice a principle of gradually opening its markets according to signed international treaties and agreements, instead of practicing a principle that allows the free import and export of goods and technologies. At the same time, the Foreign Trade Law fully shows China's determination to bring China's economy in line with the world economy. This can be seen in the following areas. First, the Foreign Trade Law clearly stipulates in the general rules that China practices a unified foreign trade system. Second, the imposition of bans and restrictions on the import of goods and technology will be based on the reasons and methods stipulated in the Foreign Trade Law; the reasons stipulated in the Foreign Trade Law are completely in accord with GATT. Third, on the issue of providing appropriate protection for domestic industries, the Foreign Trade Law did away with the import-substitution and administrative examination and approval system; instead, it adopted such international practices as anti-dumping, anti-subsidy, and protection systems. Fourth, the Foreign Trade Law did away with various subsidy systems for foreign trade enterprises and clearly stipulated that foreign trade enterprises must independently run their businesses and be responsible for their own profits and losses. The state encourages the development of foreign trade. It will work out such internationally-practiced promotional measures as setting up financial organizations with the specific purpose of promoting the development of foreign trade, establishing foreign trade development funds, foreign trade development risk funds, and carrying out the reimbursement of export taxes. Reporter: As a competent department for China's foreign trade, what kind of steps will the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation take to ensure the full implementation of the Foreign Trade Law? Wu Yi: As a basic law, the Foreign Trade Law stipulated China's basic policy, principles, and a major framework for the management of foreign trade. To ensure the full implementation of the Foreign Trade Law, it is necessary to formulate a large number of supplementary administrative rules and laws. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation will step up drafting a number of administrative rules and laws, including regulations on foreign trade enterprise approval systems, foreign trade agency systems, anti-dumping activities, anti-subsidy activities, protection measures, import and export associations, and border trade management.
