Di Donato is under investigation in several cases involving alleged corruption, violation of party financing laws and bribery. Last month he was indicted by a Naples court along with a former official of the telephone company, SIP [Italian State-Owned Telephone Company], on charges of attempted extortion. According to the prosecution, executives of the IPM telephone company have testified they had been put under pressure to give jobs to people proposed by Di Donato or face cancellation of future sub-contracts with SIP. IPM managers were also asked for contributions to a magazine published by Socialist Party supporters of Di Donato, who also faces charges of abuse of office. Public prosecutors in Naples on February 12 had issued a preventive detention warrant against Di Donato in connection with alleged kickbacks paid for the privatization of the city's garbage collection services. Di Donato, who was not reelected in the March 27 elections and lost his parliamentary immunity when the new legislature was inaugurated earlier today, faces charges of abuse of office and corruption in connection with the affair. Magistrates have also issued a house arrest warrant for Di Donato in connection with the telephone company corruption case.
