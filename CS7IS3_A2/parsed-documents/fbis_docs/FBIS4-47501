Lisitsyn, K.V. Obrosov, N.A. Rozental, and V.A. Stefanov, GosNIIAS (expansion not given), Moscow; UDC 621.396] [Abstract] A suboptimal procedure for detecting moving images against a conditionally stationary background in the form of a sequence of time-separated fragments of images of a slightly changing scene was considered. The proposed procedure, which is suboptimal from the standpoint of the criterion of the maximum a posteriori probability, was synthesized under the assumption of the presence in the image being analyzed of random geometric distortions caused by a change in the observation point and additive gaussian noise. The procedure is based on optimal linear filtration of the difference between uniform fragments of adjacent frames that were previously combined by a correlation technique and on an operation separating statistical hypotheses applied to the filter output. The generally accepted model of an image was used along with a newly developed method of determining the new procedure's main statistical characteristics in the case of simple detection. A number of particular cases typical for aircraft location information systems were considered, and the range of the parameters of the backgrounds, moving images, and noise was calculated. Mathematical expectation and mean square deviation were specified relative to the maximum value of image brightness, and a correlation constant was specified in relation to the characteristic size of the moving image. The following ranges of parameters were calculated for the background: mathematical expectation, 0.240-0.400; mean square error, 0.036-0.265; and correlation constant, 0.523-2.013. The following ranges of parameters were calculated for the image: mathematical expectation, 0.320-0.550; mean square error, 0.042-0.200; and correlation constant, 1.043-5.996. The following ranges of parameters were calculated for the noise: mathematical expectation, 0.000; mean square error, 0.014-0.044; and correlation constant, 25.56-31.12. The following values were calculated for the total error of a one-frame detector in the various seasons: winter, 0.932 x 10[.sup]-4[/]; autumn, 0.747 x 10[.sup]-3[/]; and summer, 0.961 x 10[.sup]-3[/]. It was concluded that interframe processing is justified if the errors of a suboptimal detector are less than those of a single-frame detector. Specifically, it was determined that the use of interframe processing is justified if the background's movement is limited to 20-40 percent of the characteristic size of the moving image. Changing the value of the interframe movement from zero to the limiting value was found to result in an increase in total error by a factor of 7 to 20. A test of the new procedure's validity conducted by way of the example of digital processing of a pair of images of a typical scene confirmed that the proposed procedure yields an absolutely correct result.
