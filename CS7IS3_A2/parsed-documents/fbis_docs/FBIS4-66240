Tight Money Means Hardships For Business Concerns, But Slight Loosening Causes Inflation. If an Value-Added Tax Is Enacted for Land, Foreign Traders Will Recoil; If It Is Not Enacted, Speculation Will Be Difficult to Contain Several major current problems in the Chinese mainland economy provoke general discussion, and Chinese Communist policy makers continue to waver between two difficult choices. 1. Merger of Renminbi Exchange Rates, But No Renminbi Convertibility The first problem concerns the merger of renminbi exchange rates, which was done on New Year's day 1993. This so-called merger means that the official rate and the swap rate for the renminbi were merged into one. This situation seemingly shows that whereas people could formerly take renminbi or foreign currency to a swap center to exchange it, now this function has been transferred to officially run banking business centers. Some people feel that this was done in order to link the mainland market to the international market, enabling free convertibility of the renminbi in preparation for the China mainland's GATT entry. Actually, this is not the case at all. Since the first of the year, not only are people unable to exchange renminbi for foreign currency at banks (the maximum degree of convertibility), but they do not even have the minimum degree of convertibility, i.e., enterprises that have obtained foreign xchange from exports may not convert all of the foreign exchange they have earned. Generally speaking, if such a firm makes $1 million from exports, once this foreign exchange is deposited in their account, the official banks will convert only $500,000 of it for the enterprise, i.e., they may convert only 50 percent of their foreign exchange earnings. This situation is even worse than before. Formerly, when a firm needed foreign exchange, it could get it at a swap center. Now, the swap centers' function has disappeared, but the national banks will not convert the money making it even more difficult for firms to use foreign exchange. Simultaneous with the merger of the renminbi foreign exchange rates, the state tightened the conversion of foreign exchange, The reason was that it feared that free convertibility would lead to a great increase in demand for foreign exchange, thereby causing a great devaluation of the renminbi. Naturally, this has put a damper on the economy's high speed growth. Because a high speed growth economic policy can lead to vigorous demand for foreign raw and processed materials and sophisticated equipment, when demand for foreign exchange is held down, this demand is a long way from being satisfied making it impossible for the economy to grow at high speed as well. 2. Credit Still Tight Despite Desire To Loosen It Following institution of macroeconomic control in July 1993, money became tight in business concerns, forcing halts or semi-halts in production. Many factories paid only half wages, and the ten major iron and steel mills sank into a difficult situation. Thus, during October and November, the banks loosened credit by 300 billion yuan (renminbi, and the same applies hereinafter), thereby somewhat easing business firms' predicament. Nevertheless, Zhou Zhengqing [0719 2973 1987], a deputy director of the Chinese People's Bank, figures that the amount of added investment needed because of 1993's high speed growth is 1 trillion yuan; hence, as soon as the 300 billion yuan is released, it will vanish without trace. What caught the Chinese Communist authorities even more unawares was that even though the input of money only eased business concerns' predicament somewhat, information about the early 1994 renminbi exchange rate merger, tax reforms, etc. stimulated a rise in grain and edible oil prices during late November 1993, causing astonishing inflation. The Central Committee was very upset about this. It immediately held a meeting that stressed the need to "maintain stability." Once again, it proposed macroeconomic regulation and control to hold down prices and control investment in fixed assets. The Chinese Communists currently face two difficult choices on whether to loosen or tighten credit. If they loosen the money supply, inflation will ensue causing social instability. If they tighten the money supply, enterprises will be short of funds, and workers will be paid only half their wages or no wages and all, possibly making society even more unstable. Another problem is that most of the money released at the end of 1993 went to factories to solve their predicament of being unable to pay wages and bonuses. Business concerns feel that this did not solve the problem. The present factory work halts or semi-halts stem mostly from the tight money policy. Products cannot be sold; thus inventories increase. Real solution to the problem requires release of funds to the demand side, e.g., loosening credit for investment in real estate. When investment in real estate increases, the demand for construction materials will naturally increase as well. Then, worries about steel reinforcing rod and cement sales will disappear. This is the only real solution to factories' predicament. 3. Refusal To Give In on the Value-Added Tax Admittedly, tightening of credit for real estate investment had an adverse effect on investment in real estate in China. Then in December 1993, the State Council's promulgation of provisional regulations on the collection of an value added tax further discouraged foreign traders from investing in mainland real estate. By the so-called real estate value added tax is meant that when a real estate developer sells property he has built or after a property is purchased, after deducting the price of the land, construction costs, and 17 percent for taxes, the government levies a large tax on the profit realized. If the value added tax on the property's sale price is below 50 percent, the value added tax is 30 percent of the value added, and rises progressively until the value added is 60 percent. Government's reason for prescribing an value added tax is that large numbers of developers formerly obtained parcels of land at cheap prices from local governments. These developers could obtain fat profits by putting up buildings on the land. Furthermore, this resulted in speculation by holders of land. Therefore, it used an value added tax to decrease the profits of real estate dealers. Imposition of an value added tax will naturally make many foreign traders apprehensive about the mainland real estate market. For this reason, Guangzhou City and Hainan Province intimated that the national government might propose, but local jurisdictions would dispose of the value added tax. In early February, Guangzhou mayor Li Ziliu [7812 1311 3177] said that taxes and profits on land within the city would be according to the former law, and that the value added tax on land would be handled flexibly. Hainan Province made a similar statement. However, several days later, Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli [0491 0112 5668] emphasized that all jurisdictions must enforce the value added tax in a uniform manner. Before central government detailed regulations on the real estate value added tax appeared, seemingly foreign traders could only hold off on investments in mainland real estate. Furthermore, the central bank has no intention of loosening credit for mainland government agency investment in real estate. As a result, ever since it cooled in 1993, real estate has not heated up again. Without a warming of real estate, naturally, it is impossible to have demand for building supplies; thus, the mainland industrial structure, which is dominated by heavy industry, may again face a hungry period. Whether to institute an value added tax is another difficult choice to make.
