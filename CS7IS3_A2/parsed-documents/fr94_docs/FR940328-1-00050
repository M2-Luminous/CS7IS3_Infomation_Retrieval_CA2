FR940328-1-00050 FR940328-1-00023 Section 4(b)(3) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended in 1982 (Act), requires that, within 12 months of receipt of a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species, a finding be made as to whether the requested action is warranted, not warranted, or warranted but precluded by other listing activity. In the case of the 1991 ICBP petition, available information supports listing of all 53 species. With respect to 15 of these species_those occurring in Africa and Madagascar, and on associated islands of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans_a recently published book (Collar and Stuart 1985) provides detailed status data. This same source provides data supporting the listing of 13 of the African birds covered by the 1980 ICBP petition, and the Service also possesses sufficient data to support the listing of the other 2 African birds so covered. With respect to the other birds included in the two petitions, data are available from several sources, some of which are unpublished. Compilation of these data is in progress and a listing proposal will be completed as soon as allowed by the Service's other listing responsibilities. Considering the above, the Service makes the finding, hereby incorporated and published together with this proposal, that the action requested by the ICBP 1980 and 1991 petitions, with respect to the 30 African birds named below in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,'' is warranted, and that the action requested by the 1991 petition, with respect to the 38 remaining species covered therein, is warranted but precluded by other listing activity. As soon as time allows, the Service will proceed with preparation of a proposed rule on these 38 species, which are: Kalinowski's tinamou ( Nothoprocta kalinowskii ), Junin grebe ( Podiceps taczanowskii ), Beck's petrel ( Pterodroma becki ), Fiji petrel ( Pterodroma macgillivrayi ), Heinroth's shearwater ( Puffinus heinrothi ), greater adjutant ( Leptoptilos dubius ), giant ibis ( Pseudibis gigantea ), Andean flamingo ( Phoenicoparrus andinus ), Brazilian merganser ( Mergus octosetaceus ), southern helmeted curassow ( Pauxi unicornis ), blue-billed curassow ( Crax alberti ), Bogota rail ( Rallus semiplumbeus ), Junin rail ( Laterallus tuerosi ), Jerdon's courser ( Cursorius bitorquatus ), slender-billed curlew ( Numenius tenuirostris ), salmon-crested cockatoo ( Cacatua moluccensis ), blue-throated macaw ( Ara glaucogularis ), black-breasted puffleg ( Eriocnemis nigrivestris ), Esmeraldas woodstar ( Acestrura berlepschi ), yellow-browed toucanet ( Aulacorhynchus huallagae ), helmeted woodpecker ( Dryocopus galeatus ), royal cinclodes ( Cinclodes aricomae ), white-browed tit-spinetail ( Leptasthenura xenothorax ), brown-banded antpitta ( Grallaria milleri ), Stresemann's bristlefront ( Merulaxis stresemanni ), Brasilia tapaculo ( Scytalopus novacapitalis ), grey-winged cotinga ( Tijuca condita ), Kaempfer's tody-tyrant ( Idioptilon kaempferi ), ash-breasted tit-tyrant ( Anairetes alpinus ), Bananal tyrannulet ( Serpophaga araguayae ), Peruvian plantcutter ( Phytoma raimondii ), Gurney's pitta ( Pitta gurneyi ), Niceforo's wren ( Thryothorus nicefori ), Socorro mockingbird ( Mimodes graysoni ), Caerulean paradise-flycatcher ( Eutrichomyias rowleyi ), Tumaco seedeater ( Sporophila insulata ), Floreana tree-finch ( Camarhynchus pauper ), and black-backed tanager ( Tangara peruviana ).
