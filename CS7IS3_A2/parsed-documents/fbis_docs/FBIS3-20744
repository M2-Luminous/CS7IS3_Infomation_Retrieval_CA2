Dee Hill: "Czech Protectionism Grounds KLM Flights"] [Text] The Czech government last month reneged on its air-transport agreement with the Dutch government and the Netherlands' national carrier, KLM, forcing the airline to cut back the number of flights it runs between Prague and Amsterdam. KLM, which formerly ran twice-a-day, round-trip flights to Amsterdam, now has 10 instead of 14 weekly flights, with twice-daily service on alternate days. A KLM official said the airline was not allowed to choose which flights to cancel. When asked why the Czechs took this unilateral step, Ivan Rada, head of civil air transport for the Czech Ministry of Transport, replied, "To protect CSA." Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA) is a financially struggling concern that lost about 1.2 billion Kc ($40 million U.S.) last year. Blaming foreign competition for its woes, the government-owned airline petitioned the Transportation Ministry to take action. The ministry then stopped KLM from offering any flights on days that CSA offers trans-Atlantic flights. KLM protested that it had an agreement ratified by the Czech Parliament; air-transport agreements are negotiated between governments, not airlines. KLM made an attempt at conciliation, offering to limit the number of seats while keeping the same number of flights. KLM spokeswoman Marjorie Wenting said "it is a better product for our customers to have regular service." Nevertheless, KLM's flights between Prague and Amsterdam were slashed, at an undisclosed financial loss to the Dutch company, beginning Jan. 1. An estimate using the 94-seat Fokker 100 plane with a round-trip, midweek fare of 6,990 Kc pegs the loss at about 2.6 million Kc ($90,628) per week. CSA's lowest fare for the same trip is 8,560 Kc. "According to our opinion, the agreement between the two governments gives KLM rights," Wenting said. "It is a concern for us that this is possible in this country even though we had an official agreement." Rada said the problem was that while the air-transport agreement was approved by Parliament, it was not approved in its final form by the Transportation Ministry. "Troubles appeared when Holland's KLM office started selling tickets for flights that weren't approved," he said. Mike Higgins, director of British Airways for the Czech and Slovak republics, said that regardless of who is right in this instance, the government's protectionist stance toward CSA is bad for the industry as a whole. "A profitable company is better for customers all-around because it can reinvest the money in providing better service," Higgins said. "In terms of competition, the whole idea of the European Economic Community is a free market and deregulation. I would certainly hope anyone who wants to become a part of that would adopt these [free-market] principles."
