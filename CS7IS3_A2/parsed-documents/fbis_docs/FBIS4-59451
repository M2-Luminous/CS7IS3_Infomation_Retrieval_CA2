Meanwhile, the deputies of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] in the House of Representatives and a number of independent figures have decided to hold a meeting in Aden today.

Sanaa sources have stated that "an Arab state that is not a neighboring state has provided facilities at its airports for the southern air forces." Aden, on the other hand, has accused Eritrea of placing its airports at the disposal of the northern command and claimed that two ships have arrived at al-Hudaydah port loaded with Iraqi arms from Port Sudan. According to YSP sources, 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Akwa', President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's brother-in-law, or Ahmad al-Hajari may have arrived in Baghdad via Jordan in the company of someone by the name of al-Khawlani, to request additional arms (missiles and planes) which are now in Sudan having been taken there during the Gulf war.
