Kovalskaya; place and date not given: "Our Times Call for Shushkevich"] [Text] Exclusive interview with a classical writer of Belarusian literature dealing with the independence of Belarus, chances of the People's Front and the resignation of Shushkevich. There is no need to identify Vasil Bykov for the readers. The great Belarus author was known both in the former USSR as well as throughout the world. Not everyone, however, knows something else: many of the books by this author first saw the light of day in the Russian language (even though Bykov thinks and writes in Belarusian) simply because they could not be published in the author's homeland. Even during Soviet times ideological dictates and censorship that existed in Belarus were more rigid than in other republics. It is too early to speak of freedom of creativity there at present as well. The trial of writer Svetlana Aleksiyevich, who published a book titled "The Zinc Boys" about the Afghanistan war, for instance, a trial which is of a distinctly political character, is still under way in Minsk. Despite that, Vasil Bykov, an artist who has been striving for freedom all of his life, is not thinking of abandoning his native land by contrast with many of his colleagues, who, by the way, are not condemned by him but whose departure he regrets deeply. What does the author like and dislike in the Belarus of today? What are his political preferences? How does he visualize the Belarusian path into the world? Our observer Galina Kovalskaya spoke with Vasil Bykov. [Kovalskaya] Why is the issue concerning national independence of the republic of Belarus again one of the most hotly disputed ones? It would appear that it is an issue resolved a long time ago: first in September 1991, when the Supreme Council of the republic proclaimed independence, then at Belovezhskaya Pushcha, when three of the former Soviet republics reiterated the disintegration of the USSR with their agreement. [Bykov] State sovereignty is an unambiguous term that does not lend itself to any kind of reinterpretation. Either it exists or it does not. In my opinion state independence benefits the people because, as indicated by historical experience, the welfare of the people is directly associated with the existence of their own state. Naturally, we are not speaking of any isolation from the outside world, but merely about political and national independence. Independence came to Belarus somewhat unexpectedly. All of its preceding history, it would appear, prodded us in the opposite direction, toward full integration, first with the Polish state, then with the Russian empire. When it became necessary to ensure independence politically, economically, and culturally it turned out that our society and its ruling class were not prepared to do that. The principal difficulty consisted of the fact that communists dominated all of our power structures, at all levels. I know that in some places in Transcaucasia and in Central Asia communists attempted to somehow adapt to the national movement or even to head it. In our case the communists unequivocally favor the empire and continue to be the main anti-populist force. Barely recovering from the August 1991 putsch and Belovezhskaya Pushcha, the "party in power" initiated a struggle, first for the total rehabilitation and restoration of the power of the Communist Party, and then for the restoration of the empire. It has now become particularly animated as the imperial forces raise their voices in Russia. [Kovalskaya] Are you against the entry of Belarus in the ruble zone? [Bykov] Our directorial corps is strongly in favor of that, stating that it promises all kinds of economic advantages. In reality our directors know how to work only under conditions of a command and specifically an all-union economy because of which for them a return to a unified economic system is undoubtedly beneficial. I, however, believe that this would be another step toward the liquidation of Belarus independence. Among Russian economists there is also not a single one with an opinion on that. It seems that Chernomyrdin, and possibly the president of Russia, are prepared to incur some economic losses, including an increase in the inflation rate, for the sake of political goals--retention of Belarus within the Russian sphere of influence. [Kovalskaya] What political forces in Belarus do you feel closest to? Who will you vote for in the elections? [Bykov] We have a plethora of parties. In reality, however, the entire political spectrum in our case is black-and-white or, if you will, red-and-white. On one side there are the communist, imperial, and anti-national forces, while on the other side there are national forces. The Belarusian People's Front has real influence among those who are defending the ideals of national and state independence. Unfortunately it is represented poorly in the leadership of the country--its faction in the Supreme Council is very small, while in the executive power branch it has no followers at all. The other parties--the Christian-Democratic Party, the Social-Democratic Party, and the Peasant Party are quite small and not influential. Even though they too proclaim themselves as proponents of Belarusian independence. I am, of course, on the side of forces of independence. As far as the elections are concerned, I must confess that I do not believe not only in the possibility of early elections, but even in the presumption that our Supreme Council will go along with elections at the time stipulated by law. Our "party in power" is intently watching changes taking place in Russia and is becoming increasingly convinced that for it there is no need to hurry with any changes since there is a chance that everything will go back to the way it was. If the elections are held, however, I will certainly vote for the People's Front. [Kovalskaya] How about in the presidential election? [Bykov] For Poznyak, if he will be on the ballot. [Kovalskaya] But after all Poznyak is not fair and even insulting in his anti-Russian utterances. Inasmuch as I was able to notice, many in the People's Front leadership not only do not share those views but are even embarrassed by them. [Bykov] It was specifically Poznyak who created the People's Front and prevented its split. Yes, many of his positions are simply shocking. But at the same time it is hard to argue with him: he has experience, both of historical and simply human kind. He wrote his well-known article on Russian imperial consciousness and imperial policy before the New Year. Only a short period of time passed and it turned out to be downright prophetic: some statements were made by Kozyrev regarding "the sphere of vital Russian in the near abroad," and he asserted that troops should not be withdrawn from there--all of which disturbed both us and the West. Aggressive nationalism in the republics is whipped up by such imperial reasoning and is sometimes engendered by it. That is understood by many but most try not to talk about it. Poznyak, however, is not such a person. Even before the disintegration of the USSR, when the CPSU Central Committee managed everything, he forcefully took some television air time with his comrades and reaching all of Belarus stated that the Communist Party is a criminal organization. He was not silent when all others were. That is the kind of man he is. Certainly he is a radical, but in contemporary life there is no room for a centrist position: all politicians gravitate either toward one, the communist, or the other, national, fringe. [Kovalskaya] What about Shushkevich? [Bykov] Shushkevich is a tragic figure. It was specifically his attempts to be "a centrist" that played a bad joke on him and led to political failure. He is an honest, clever, and an intelligent individual, dedicated to democratic ideals, but apparently, not for our times. Our times call for Poznyak. [Kovalskaya] Why did the Belarusian People's Front never become for Belarusia what Sajudis was for Lithuania, Rukh for Ukraine, and Democratic Russia for Russia, failing to become a mass-scale popular movement? [Bykov] National self-consciousness is insufficiently developed and political culture is lacking. Particularly in view of the fact that as living standards deteriorate at present, the myth that supposedly "under the communists things were better" is gaining strength. In my opinion another myth, which is gaining currency in Russia as well, is that people are purportedly too politicized and all they do is attend meetings. It would be better if things were like they are in the developed countries where no one cares about the government at all. All this is fabricated by the authorities for the purpose of self-preservation. In actuality the population in its absolute majority has no idea at all about democratic values, it is not accepting the idea of democracy, and does not comprehend the basics of a market society. [Kovalskaya] What do you think is the solution? [Bykov] It is quite evident: the economic system must be changed. But that is impossible without a radical political reform and especially without a consolidation of national statehood. We have already fully partaken of the pleasures of a totalitarian empire. In addition to that there is also the European experience of national state building. Even closer there is the experience of our neighbors. Yes, nothing is so far working out in Ukraine--the power there, however, remains in the hands of the same communists. While in the Baltic states the reform is proceeding with difficulty but successfully even though there are more objective difficulties over there than there are in our case: there is also the lack of local energy resources, and in general they are poorer with regard to resources than we are. They also lack the advantages of our geographical position. In addition to that there is the nationality factor which, fortunately, will not appear in our case unless someone makes a special effort to that end. [Kovalskaya] That is not exactly what I mean--it is understood where we should be moving. I asked how you would prefer to get out of the current dead-end situation, taking into account that you have your Belarusian and not a Lithuanian population, and neither Yeltsin nor Gaidar are at the top, but your own leadership. [Bykov] With our leadership we will not be moving anywhere. With it the only possibility is to turn back. Even if we do go back we shall find not the communist past, but ruins. What can be done, you ask? It is necessary to struggle, of course, conduct political education. We can be saved only by a popular movement. Do you remember the late Alex Adamovich once stating that Belarus is the Vendee of reconstruction? Recently he further added that we are changing into a peculiar kind of a communist Paraguay: all the communists unsuited to the new life are coming to us from everywhere. In our country they are living not just on their personal pension but are working very actively. Democracy is inevitable. But the price it may be necessary for Belarusia to pay for it could be very high. The fact that it will be higher than in the Baltic states is without doubt. I do not know if it will be higher than in Russia. I fear that Russia is yet to pay its price and it is not known what it will amount to. [Kovalskaya] Whom do you favor most from among the Russian politicians? [Bykov] After all, we are selecting from what exists. Of course, Gaidar's group, those linked with reform and democracy.
