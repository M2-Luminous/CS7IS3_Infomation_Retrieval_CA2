This can be summarized as two sentences: The first one is that the anticorruption campaign must facilitate the sustained, rapid, and sound development of the national economy of the whole region; and the other is that all sorts of corrupt phenomena arousing complaints among the masses must be eliminated in a bid to deepen reform and maintain stability. At the eighth (enlarge) plenary session of the regional discipline inspection commission held on 28 March, Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech made at the third session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the guidelines of this session were relayed and implemented, the experience gained from opposing corruption at the preceding stage was summarized, the situation we were facing was analyzed, and the tasks for the anticorruption campaign in the foreseeable future were arranged. The session held on 29 March was attended by Qian Fenyong, Bai Enpei, Wuyunqimuge, Yu Xinglong, Yun Bulong, Zhaorigetu, Nai Deng, Ba Shijie, and Zhang Hesong. And Bai Enpei presided over the session. Wang Qun said: This year is a key year to press forward the overall reform and make breakthroughs in major fields and is an extremely important year to effect sustained, rapid, and sound development of the national economy. At the moment, the situation of Inner Mongolia is good in general, like that in other areas of China. Party committees and governments at all levels and party leading comrades at all levels must obtain a clear understanding of the current situation, enhance the sense of the whole, and launch the anticorruption campaign based on the overall situation of reform, development, and stability. Wang Qun appraised the achievements scored in opposing corruption at the preceding stage as: "The general situation was good and development was sound." He said that this could be manifested in the following three aspects: First, leaders at various levels enhanced their understanding of the principle of "taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both hands" and their consciousness in opposing corruption. Second, some substantial results were achieved in the anticorruption campaign, initial results were achieved in the self-examination and self-correction by leading cadres, some corrupt elements were subjected to investigation and punishment, and the spreading trend of some unhealthy practices and corrupt phenomena were put under control. Third, in addition to these initial results, the anticorruption campaign at the preceding stage played a positive role in promoting the improvement of the entire social mood and the sustained and sound development of reform, opening up, and economic construction. Of course, while affirming achievements, we should also understand that our anticorruption work still lags behind in understanding, work, and results. To sum up, the task on the anticorruption campaign remains extremely arduous and thus our unremitting efforts are needed. Wang Qun pointed out: To continuously deepen the anticorruption campaign through persistent efforts in line with the region's realities, we should, what is most important, seek unity of our ideas and enhance our understanding in the following three issues: 1) the issue concerning the guiding principle of "taking a two handed approach and being tough with both hands;" 2) the issue of persisting in the anticorruption campaign while developing the socialist market economic structure; and 3) the issue of fully understanding the long-duration, arduousness, and complexity of anticorruption campaign. Wang Qun said: Whether we can thoroughly implement the tasks set forth by the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and whether we can launch anticorruption campaign in a profound, sustained, and effective manner and achieve obvious and inspiring results in the campaign depend primarily on our endeavor of strengthening leadership and adopting effective and practical measures to implement the guidelines of the central authorities and the arrangements of the regional party committee down to every grass-roots area. For this, Wang Qun stressed: First, we should truly strengthen the leadership over the anticorruption campaign. Party committees and governments at all levels must grasp the anticorruption campaign all together. Principal leading comrades must assume personal responsibility for and personally dispose the building of party style and the anticorruption campaign, must personally research the conspicuous problems concerning corruption of their own localities and departments, must personally organize and guide the investigation and handling of major cases, and must personally coordinate the work in various fields in an effort to unfailingly grasp the anticorruption work of their own localities and departments. Second, we should define duties and pay attention to implementation. In line with the principle that whoever takes charge of the work should assume responsibility, we should establish the responsibility system for building party style and improving administrative honesty. In this aspect, work should be divided up clearly, each unit should perform its work well, and each level should grasp, bring along, and assume responsibility for the work of the next lower level. When a locality or department fails in building party style, strengthening administrative honesty, and opposing corruption, its top party and government leaders should assume major responsibility for the failure. And, when a department at the next lower level fails in building party style, strengthening administrative honesty, and opposing corruption, leaders of the department of the next higher level should assume responsibility. Third, we should closely rely on the masses and encourage and mobilize the masses to provide clues for crimes according to facts, and the legitimate rights and interests of the persons who provide the clues should be safeguarded. Fourth, we should strictly enforce discipline. We must handle law violation cases in strict accordance with laws. The cases whose verdicts should be withdrawn, the cases which should be sentenced to imprisonment, and the cases which should be given severe penalty should be do so based on facts according to laws. Fifth, we should give prominence to focal points and have a good command of key points. This year, the general pattern of the anticorruption work will remain unchanged. But, all localities and departments should strive to promote the sound development of the entire anticorruption campaign in line with their respective realities, with the problems strongly complained by the masses as the points to make breakthroughs. Sixth, we should give full play to the functional role of discipline inspection and supervisory organs, people's courts, and people's procuratorates. In the anticorruption campaign of this year, party committees and governments at all levels should pay attention to strengthening leadership over and support to these organs and bringing their role into full play. Wang Qun said in conclusion: Launching the anticorruption campaign is an extremely important and urgent political task set forth by the CPC Central Committee to the whole party and is a major event that has a bearing on the future and destiny of the party and the country. Party committees and governments at all levels, leading cadres holding important posts at all levels in particular, should enhance their sense of concern, truly bear their political duties, and persistently and unremittingly deepen the anticorruption campaign in order to make new contributions to ensuring and promoting reform, opening up, economic construction, and social and political unity and stability.
