Negotiations on the matter with the Sri Lankan Government could last a long time. "The bureaucracy here works very slowly indeed," a well-informed source in Colombo said. "The authorities would prefer not to have the Tamils return. They feel it best that they stay abroad for a while." In addition, the government in Colombo first wants to see how the agreement concluded in February between Sri Lanka and Switzerland works out. Both countries will cooperate in the return of two or three hundred Tamils. Expectations are that the initial asylum seekers, whose requests for asylum have been declined in Switzerland, will be sent back this month. The UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] is prepared to oversee the proper implementation of the agreement. [passage omitted]
