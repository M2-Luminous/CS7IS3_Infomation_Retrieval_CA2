As a result of the timely and powerful intervention, grain prices in these localities have tended to decline, and people's sentiments have stabilized. This newspaper's reporters stationed on the mainland yesterday sent the following reports on the grain conditions and public feelings from various localities. Report by Staff Reporter Kung Shuang-yin (7255 7175 0603) From Beijing The Beijing Municipal Government has adopted measures to check grain prices and stabilize commodity prices over the last few days. The municipal government called an emergency meeting at which Chen Xitong, secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, attended and made a speech. After the meeting, four working groups led by Chen Xitong, Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing Municipality, Zhang Jianmin, chairman of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee, and other leaders inspected local conditions on carrying out various measures to curb the prices of grain, edible oil, vegetables, eggs, and pork. There has been wide coverage in the mainland's newspapers, television programs, and broadcasts over the last few days concerning the conditions of curbing grain prices in various localities across the country. An authoritative source pointed out: It is necessary to learn to regulate and control grain prices in markets with market economic measures. When it is necessary to sell grain in large quantities, the state must do it, and the same is the case with purchases. The greater fluctuations the grain price is undergoing, the more necessary it is to resolutely break through regional blockades and guard against trade monopolies. In accordance with economic experts' proposals, the state has adopted stringent measures to curb grain prices. According to a source here, following the macroeconomic regulation and control measures adopted by the state, the rising tendency of grain prices has been controlled and even dropped to a certain extent. Report by Staff Reporter Ho Sui-yi (0149 4482 1837) From Guangzhou The people in Guangzhou, where control over grain prices was lifted long ago, faced the recent national situation of grain price fluctuation with a collective presence of mind. After the agitation of "rushing to buy rice for fear of its possible price rise" in the latter half of last month, the public feelings have stabilized now and the situation of grain markets has returned to normal. Explaining the reasons that caused the fluctuation in grain purchasing, a relevant person responsible for Guangzhou's Commercial Committee said: News has spread that the state will raise the grain procurement price, which has been on the low side, as of next March -- the beginning of a new fiscal year for grain. As a result, peasants have been reluctant to sell their grain in the current harvest season, hoping that they will be able to sell it at a higher price after the state's readjustment. Now is precisely the time for various localities and cities to fulfill their tasks of procuring and storing public grain, thus causing some tension in supply and demand as there were strong demands on one hand and reluctant sales on the other. Under the above circumstances, the overall grain price in Guangzhou, where the practice of price fluctuation in line with market conditions has been in effect for a long time, increased by 30 percent over the first half of this year, and the price of quality rice rose by a larger margin, though the price of standard rice maintained the level of 1 to 1.20 yuan per jin. But the Guangzhou people, who are accustomed to eating quality rice, still wanted to store a few bags of quality rice at home, as prompted by the mentality of "storing up grain against famine." As a consequence, the agitation of rushing to buy rice occurred a short time ago. The Guangzhou Grain Bureau has taken measures to ensure a sufficient stock of rice and edible oil in various grain shops throughout the city and to increase the supply of rice in greater varieties. Grain shops are prohibited from taking advantage of market demands to raise grain prices. Besides, the city's Administration for Industry and Commerce has been requested to exercise supervision over private rice stalls. When asked whether or not the method of rationing grain and edible oil will be employed, the source from the Commercial Committee indicated that "it would not consider reusing the typical method of the planned economy," and that "it was absolutely unnecessary to backtrack by practicing the old system as there is sufficient grain in stock in Guangzhou, and numerous and convenient supply centers." Report by Staff Reporter Kan Ku (1626 6253) From Shanghai Like other cities on the mainland, the wind of panic-purchasing and hoarding of rice also engulfed Shanghai recently, so that long shopping queues with up to hundreds of people, which have not been seen for years, were seen in front of grain shops again. In some densely populated residential areas, grain shops were unable to close their doors at the end of business hours due to the small number of grain shops and large number of buyers. The government here has determined to resolve the problem by informing the people that it is not necessary to buy and hoard grain as there are adequate supplies, instructing the state-owned grain shops to refuse to sell grain to big buyers and peddlers, and turning on a green light to all the grain-carrying trucks so that they can go freely through all city districts even in daytime. In this way the wind of panic purchasing and hoarding of rice in Shanghai has subsided. Report by Staff Reporter Yang Hsiao-yang (2799 1420 3152) From Fuzhou The State Council has decided to put 5 billion jin of grain into markets in the near future, of which 100 million jin of unprocessed grain will be transferred to Fujian. In this regard, the Fujian Provincial Government has adopted appropriate emergency measures to ensure the proper arrangements of grain in Fujian's markets in light of the present market conditions. It has been reported that the grain production in Fujian this year has been normal. Up to 20 December, the entire province has fulfilled the annual task by 73 percent, with only 540 million jin unfulfilled. However, there is a considerably large proportion of people who are still short of grain in quite a few disaster-hit rural areas. It is anticipated that a population of 4.46 million will be wanting in grain before the harvest next year and the grain shortage will come to 800 million jin. Among them, there is a "double shortage" population of 1.18 million for whom 140 million jin of grain should be provided. The provincial grain departments have indicated that they will conscientiously shoulder the responsibility of dealing with emergency rescue and providing disaster relief, make proper arrangements for the people's lives in the disaster-stricken areas before and after the Spring Festival, and stabilize the rural markets while trying to be well-acquainted with the disaster conditions. Shi Xingmou, vice governor of Fujian Province, recently called for relevant departments to transfer the exact volume of 100 million jin of unprocessed grain from Jiangxi to Fujian as arranged, so as to replenish the stock and sell out at suitable time. Report by Staff Reporter Shao Kan (6730 1626) From Changchun Jilin Province, which has wrested the second highest grain yield ever this year, has adopted various measures to accelerate the progress of storing grain purchased by order so that 90 percent of such grain has been stored, and to check grain prices in an effort to protect peasants' enthusiasm in selling grain so that the grain price of the entire province has been relatively stable with a slight increase. According to the analysis of the provincial grain department, the situation in which the state has made funds available for purchasing grain at negotiated prices and peasants have made grain available for sales has emerged at present. The vast number of peasants are reluctant to sell their grain because they are optimistic about the quality of grain this year as its moisture content is generally lower than previous years, and they are not anxious to sell their grain for the easier handling of the stock. Another reason is that peasants have more money in hand due to their noticeable increase of revenue as a result of the expanded area of cash crops in Jilin this year. In a bid to curb grain prices, the Jilin Provincial Government is taking effective measures to give positive guidance to intensifying management of the grain market and guarding against speculative acts in grain. Aiming at peasants' reluctance to sell grain, the government has also done meticulous work to protect their initiative and raise grain prices appropriately. Report by Staff Reporter Liu Wen-yan (0491 2429 5333) From Shenyang As grain prices in various southern localities were rising one after another, the price in northeast China was as stable as usual. In Shenyang, a city and economic and cultural center in northeast China, grain prices did not rise, the people were not "panic- stricken," and their general mood was stable. "When something happens, people will not be alarmed and confused so long as they have grain in hand." This year, there was an extraordinary bumper harvest in Liaoning, with the total yield reaching 32 billion kg, the highest in history. The Shenyang City Government has put in a lot of time and energy in grasping the "rice bag" and "shopping basket" projects with very satisfactory results. Now it has enough, and even surplus grain and vegetables. This is an important factor of stabilizing grain price in Shenyang. However, pork prices rose in the last few days, as lean pork and pork without skin and bone rose from 4.5 to six yuan and three to four yuan per 500 grams respectively. An authoritative person said: This is partly because the sales volume of pork has increased owing to the peak consumption period now and partly because some pig- raising households would not sell their pigs, having anticipated a further price rise with the New Year and Spring Festival drawing near.
