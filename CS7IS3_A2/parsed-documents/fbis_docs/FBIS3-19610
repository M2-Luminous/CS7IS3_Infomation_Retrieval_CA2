[passage omitted] Yesterday, Alain Juppe, secretary general of the neo-Gaullist RPR, calmed an issue that threatens to lead to a dangerous escalation of the latent rivalry between Mr. Balladur and Mr. Chirac in the run-up to the presidential elections. The foreign minister called on the majority to "unite" and invited all its leading figures "to refrain from prematurely opening the presidential campaign, which will come in due time." The Republican Party and centrist deputy Jacques Barrot have launched a similar appeal, but this did not prevent Equipment and Transport Minister Jacques Bosson from affirming that Edouard Balladur is "a statesman, an opportunity for France."
