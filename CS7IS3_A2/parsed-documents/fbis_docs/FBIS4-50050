Under the economic development target of catching up with the "four little dragons of Asia" which was put forward in the wake of Deng Xiaoping's southern inspection tour, Guangdong -- in actual operations -- has eased up on the previously planned economic retrenchment. Guangdong's economy has been developing at an extremely high rate over the past three years. Its GDP rose 17.3 percentage points in 1991, 21 in 1992, and 22 last year. As its economy grew at high rates, its economic power increased rapidly, and it now plays a notable role in China's economy. However, Guangdong's economic growth obviously has slowed down since early this year. Its first-quarter GDP growth has been predicted to be 15 percentage points, compared with the 20 percentage points registered in the same period last year -- a glaring contrast from recent years. Experts analyzed that the marked economic slowdown was caused mainly by the government's strengthening of macroregulatory and control measures, tightening of credit, and curbing of building projects; in addition, fluctuations in policy triggered by the introduction of various reformist measures this year have played a role. Against last year's 32 percent growth in first-quarter industrial output value, this year saw only 21 percent growth -- a drop of 11 percentage points. Falling industrial development rates have had a direct impact on the overall economic growth rate, but also have reduced longstanding "bottleneck" constraints on the province, resulting in improvement in the overall economic environment. This is one new salient characteristic of Guangdong's economic development this year. On the other hand, Guangdong has achieved some successes in macroregulation and control this year, with breakthroughs registered by individual economic indicators. This is the positive side to Guangdong's economic development this year. Government-released figures gave a 51 percent fulfillment rate for this year's first-quarter fixed-asset investment, up 51 percent, which is lower than in the same period last year, indicating that the abrupt surge in fixed-asset investment starting the year before is now under control. Falling fixed-asset investment is helping to reverse the problem of economic disequilibrium sparked by excessively rapid growth in investment. Guangdong's foreign trade and exports in the first quarter increased 22 percent from the same period last year to $8.2 billion. Trade surplus from the first-quarter imports and exports topped $100 million. Such a large margin of increase in foreign trade and exports has been rare in recent years. The good situation established by foreign trade mitigated the contradiction of imbalanced growth between imports and exports seen last year. In addition, Guangdong's financial revenue in the first quarter rose 48 percent, and industrial and commercial tax rates rose significantly. This has been the one among Guangdong's several economic indicators registering the greatest growth so far this year. However, economic activities in the first quarter also uncovered many problems. Experts here pointed out that there would be economic, and even social turmoil if these problems were not handled well. These problems include: 1. It is clear that industrial production is operating far below capacity. As the pillars for industrial development, in terms of production, the province's state-owned budgetary industries this year have performed very badly. Output value fell 4.2 percentage points from the same period last year; profits were down 38 percent, with 43 percent of the industries suffering losses, up 9 percentage points from the same period last year. Several factors contributed to this situation: Shortages in funds forced some factories to maintain production and fund projects with lending; persistently high prices raised production costs, with the result that some products ceased to be competitive in price and were forced out of the market; and the government adopted the policy of scaling down infrastructure projects, so many projects could not be launched, sapping the economic development of reserve strength. Apart from affecting overall economic growth, a sharp decline in industrial production also has aggravated unemployment, making the problem of slumps in the state-owned enterprise sector more acute. 2. Greater inflationary pressure: Prices in Guangdong have continued to rise since early this year, on top of last year's increase of 18.2 percentage points. Prices in January rose 1.9 percentage points from last December, then another 4.2 percentage points in February, and continued rising in March. Total social retail prices in the first quarter rose 33 percent, up 4 percentage points from the same period last year -- a rather steep hike. Factors such as greater inflationary pressure stimulating growth in consumption power played a role in this. 3. Shortages in funds have worsened the existing debt chains in the economic sector and have taken away the necessary support for economic development. High interest rates across the board have affected financial order. 4. Agriculture is still beset by hidden problems. Despite a 3 percent agricultural growth last year, Guangdong saw drastic reductions in major agricultural products, such as grains and sugar cane. Self-sufficiency in grains has remained an acute problem this year. Although spring farming enjoyed a good start, there should be no premature optimism concerning the prospects for agriculture, as factors hampering development in agricultural production remain.
