Referring to the banana issue, Agriculture Minister Mariano Gonzalez declared that is why we have taken our position on foreign trade and have said "no more obstacles to foreign trade." The minister is firm in his position that "there must be a global quota and that market forces must be allowed to operate, so that those who can offer the best quality fruit at the best price are able to win a given share." He admitted that centralism exists in the Ecuadoran Institute of Water Resources (INERHI) and said that "the current government has known of these irregularities from the beginning," and the National Council of Water Resources will be created as a result. Gonzalez spoke with EL UNIVERSO during his recent visit to the Galapagos Islands to fulfill obligations of the chief executive. The interview follows: [Peralta] After a lengthy process of negotiation, what is the situation with the country's banana trade? [Gonzalez] If you start with the great discussions in 1992 about what could happen, and the famous fights, including the meeting of presidents "all fighting for free trade," the negotiations were not really successful, because regulation 404 was imposed at almost any cost by the European Community. But everything has its good side and its bad side. On the good side is the fact that now we can enter markets that we could not legally reach before, such as France, England, Portugal, among other countries. The negative is that the global quota was reduced, and since then, there has been an effort led by Colombia to try to make the rule more viable. What was accomplished was not enough. Even more serious is that the Colombian Government did not consult with the other banana exporting countries, which caused resentment among most of us. The Ministry of Agriculture has been much criticized as having no policy, but I must say that "it was not by luck that our country for the third consecutive year was the principal banana exporter to the EC, and we continue to lead in the world market as the first exporting country. This has been achieved by a policy of lowering prices at the opportune moment and by being attentive to changes in the market." [Peralta] At the moment, one sees a divided region, Latin American unity no longer exists. How much does this affect us? [Gonzalez] On learning of a division of the quota with the agreement of Colombia and Costa Rica, we learned that Ecuador would have no opportunity to win new markets until the year 2000 or 2002, and the quota they gave us was all we could sell. This is why we have maintained the position, supported by Panama and Guatemala, that there must be a global quota and that market forces be allowed to operate, so that those who can offer the best quality fruit at the best price are able to win a given share. I believe that this is the idea that has prevailed recently. I am sorry not to have attended the meeting called by Costa Rica, but I was also concerned because there had been certain rumors inside the GATT to the effect that the European Union's proposal would be discussed again at the Costa Rica meeting. When we learned of this, it seemed to us that it would be inopportune to attend the meeting because it would send a signal to the GATT that we were prepared to discuss a proposal that had already been discussed and to which "we had already said no." We talked to Costa Rica and we said that we were willing to meet as often as necessary, but only when the results of the second panel's hearings are known. It is important to emphasize that there were to be two panels before the GATT, and that the GATT would later say that these regulations were not legal. Based on these two legal-type resolutions and within the Uruguay Round, we will take the necessary steps to change regulation 404 and make it more compatible with free trade. [Peralta] What would be Ecuador's position? [Gonzalez] What Ecuador asks specifically is that a time limit of five or 10 years be placed on regulation 404, perhaps the life of the treaty of Lome. This is the treaty that ties the EC countries to a commitment with those ex-colonies even though they are aware that what they produce is not of good quality and is more expensive than what Latin America produces. We also ask that they place a time limit on the existing taxes, a reduction to apply gradually to what was really agreed on in the Uruguay Round. It would be a reduction equal to that planned for the developed countries in the commitment to move to lower tariffs. We also intend to try to increase the global quota because the latest figures on banana sales to the European Union talk of 2.5 million tons and the fixed quota is 2.2 million tons. [Peralta] European integration brings with it the danger of reducing the market. How are you going to deal with this situation? [Gonzalez] In fact, another reason we are saying that the quota should be increased over time is that there are countries we are selling bananas to that are not members of the EC but that are asking to enter it. The moment they enter the EC, and if there is a fixed quota, they would be diminishing the market. If the countries where we are now selling fruit come under the EC quota, we will be prevented from selling our bananas freely, as we have been doing until now. With regard to this situation, we maintain that whenever a new country enters the EC, the quota should be increased so that we can continue selling to those markets as we have been able to do under free trade. It should not be forgotten that Ecuador has a disadvantage since in order to reach the European market, to which we send 30 percent of our exports, we have to consider the passage through the Panama Canal and the added distance. In order to compete with Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Honduras, we have to have a product cheap enough to absorb the additional cost of the canal and the distance. When Colombia and Costa Rica asked us to agree to the EU proposal, we told them that if we agreed to a fixed quota we would be agreeing to a position that is unfair. These are the basic outlines of our foreign trade policy, and we have said "no more obstacles to trade." We did not attend the meeting in Costa Rica. We spoke with that country and told them that we are sympathetic to the idea of trying to reform regulation 404, but what has been proposed is not suitable. We are waiting to learn the result of the hearings, and we are pretty sure that they will say that the regulation is improper. Then we will initiate a commercial-type procedure prior to the 15 March signing of the Uruguay Round in order to say to the EC "now let us sit down and talk, based on these precepts." They have said that if we do not accept their proposal, there will be no further negotiations, but we do not agree, and if they do not want to discuss it, we prefer to stay with regulation 404 as it is, rather than try for a new regulation. [Peralta] Given the existence of quotas, what is the outlook for producers and exporters? [Gonzalez] The ministry has had a very clear policy maintaining that it is in our interest to export a great volume of bananas and to set minimum export conditions, so that the country exports as many bananas as possible. When prices rise too high and market conditions become difficult, the first to suffer is the small farmer, because the large producer has his basic contracts with the big exporting companies, and he is the last to suffer. Consequently, if there is a greater demand for fruit at a given moment, as is happening now, the minimum price for exports increases. At this point we should be exporting more than in 1993. The first three weeks of 1994 have been excellent; between 2.7 and 2.8 million boxes have been shipped, which is very good for this time of year, and if this trend continues the year will be favorable. Furthermore, the National Banana Program no longer takes a deduction from the producers. The only one who pays any kind of contribution, and it is very small, is the exporter, but with the increase in price in effect since 15 January, the producer will have more profits and will be able to take care of some of the debts and other problems that he might have incurred during the second part of the year. It could even happen that prices rise above the official levels decreed by the government, during the coming months. I know that the first purchases by Chiquita were made this year, which means that another multinational has come to our country to buy. To the extent that we maintain a healthy competitiveness, we could see better days, in commercial terms, improved incomes, and more profits for the banana sector. [Peralta] Will the country's membership in the GATT influence its position on bananas? [Gonzalez] To enter the GATT, the country has to fulfill certain commitments. This week, a delegation from our country will begin new negotiations, there will be others in February and "we expect that by March or April, if there is no problem, we will be able to join the GATT, and we hope that it will be before the signing of the Uruguay Round." [Peralta] The national position on agriculture has been criticized in the Andean Pact. Are there problems for the country? [Gonzalez] We have to wait for the consolidation and the formation of the new Venezuelan Government, which is the source of most of the criticism. We hope to go ahead with the negotiations, as we have done so far. In reality, a consensus on agricultural policies exists among all the ministers of agriculture. Under the Cartagena agreement, agricultural matters are often negotiated that are outside my jurisdiction. We have had a very clear policy on agricultural markets, regardless of what others may say who maintain that we should open up to the world market. We are protecting those products that are receiving subsidies elsewhere in the world. This is why we speak of price margins, it is the protection we give our farmers. I have been criticized because I do not subsidize producers, and the reason is very simple. We have no money. And since we cannot subsidize our producers, we have to provide a margin of protection against unfair competition. I must simply tell those who doubt the results that in 1993, we exported more than 60,000 tons to Colombia, we exported an important amount of rice, some soya, but it is a process that our producers must continue to learn. To the extent that we have responsible leadership in the associations, "especially on the coast," we can open up new markets and give incentives to the farmers to produce. The problem in our country is not producing but marketing, and that depends basically on our farmers, on their business skills and on the farmers' associations. Unfortunately, we have no leadership on the coast, and that is a large part of the problem we are having in being able to market our products in the region and around the world. [Peralta] Now that the Modernization Law has been passed, what steps is your ministry taking? [Gonzalez] So far, as a result of decisions we have taken, there is new restructuring of the ministry that is being carried out by SENDA [National Secretariat of Administrative Development]. We made certain changes because there were some difficulties in the original presentation. We achieved a very important reduction in personnel on the order of 25 percent and we expect, with the Modernization Law, to make the final adjustments, without sacrificing the ministry's technical capability, as such. The ministry should have a normative rather than an executive role. In other words, if we have to work in the area of agricultural extension services, we are not going to do it with ministry personnel but contract the work out, and if the objectives are not being achieved, we will have the option of canceling the contract, which we do not have now. [Peralta] ENAC [National Enterprise for Warehousing and Marketing] and ENPROVIT [National Enterprise for Vital Products] are the first to pass into the private sector. What comes next? [Gonzalez] We took the first step with ENAC and ENPROVIT. There were a great many stores in ENPROVIT that are no longer part of that institution, and when we evaluated the sales, we saw that we sold three times more with 60 of those stores than we sold in 200 of the stores that we still have. That does not include the stores owned by ex-employees that are really doing well, since they do not sell only 12 products, but whatever they want. With ENAC, we have leased its silos and we expect to turn over to farmers other silos that we still have. In addition, we also have some driers that we want to give directly to the growers' associations so that those who do not want to turn over their rice to the warehouses can negotiate their own terms. The next step under the Modernization Law is that those persons who were not covered by the ministry's authority to negotiate their separation directly under their labor contracts can now do so. The Modernization Law will allow us to make a further reduction, but the process of modernization in the various offices and departments of the ministry has already begun and will continue, using the instruments that have been given to us. The most important asset we have is the Gran Colombiana Merchant Fleet, in which we own 20 percent of the shares. The board of directors of the fleet has already given its approval for a representative to make an appraisal and arrange for the sale of those shares. The Coffee Bank of Colombia has offered another 25 percent of the shares for sale, which with Ecuador's 20 percent would make a package of 45 percent of the shares. We expect that this process will last two or three months more, and we will sell our interest in this important firm in order to capitalize the Development Bank. Unfortunately, these procedures take longer than one would like, but "we are on the road." [Peralta] According to the law, there is a time limit for the sale of vehicles and the auctioning off of real property. What has been done? [Gonzalez] The ministry has about 3,000 vehicles, of which 1,400 are operational. We have about 700 in poor condition that give us problems. The order has been given to sell those vehicles belonging to the various departments of the ministry. A general order was also given regarding the sale of clubs and offices, as well as nonproductive lands belonging to the departments. We have ordered that they also be sold. [Peralta] To judge from the subjects under consideration, it would seem that the aim is to create the Ministry of Agroindustry and to eliminate the Ministry of Agriculture? [Gonzalez] That is definitely not the case. The Ministry of Industry has its own responsibilities. What has happened is that there have been a number of changes, three ministers in 17 months. I spoke with then-Minister Garcia and he told me "you continue to handle this situation, since you have been following it from the beginning, but in fact it is something that is the responsibility of the Ministry of Industry." We discussed this with Minister Maldonado, and, little by little, as he becomes familiar with all the details of what has happened in the negotiations, he will assume responsibility. The internal policies are really the responsibility of the Ministry of Industry, but there have been no talks in the sense of reducing his area of responsibility.
