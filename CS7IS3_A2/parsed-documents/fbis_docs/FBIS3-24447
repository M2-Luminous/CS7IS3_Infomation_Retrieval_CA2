[Kovalskaya] The new year has been marked by changes in the composition of the government. The rhetoric has also changed at once: on practically all levels the talk is about strengthening state monitoring, state regulation. This is all but the basic motive in the president's message to the Duma. Are there not threats to the reforms here? [Yasin] Strengthening of state power in Russia is totally necessary. And I can only welcome such intentions. We have spent two years under conditions of the continuous weakening of the state, which has been related also to the political situation--the disintegration of the Union, the strengthening of separatism within Russia, the replacement of the ruling elite, and to the economic reform, since the liberation of economic subjects under our conditions has inevitably also turned into the weakening of legal control. Privatization was the main thing in the first stage of the economic transformations. This task has been basically resolved. The mechanism has been started up and the further course of privatization depends already on the economic and social conditions in the country. So the task of consolidating state institutions or, in other words, of maintaining order is now advancing to the forefront. Effective functioning of the militia, the tax inspectorate, customs houses and investigatory and judicial organs is required. Let's take the problem of non-payments, one of the most acute social problems--the consequence not so much of stringent financial policy as of the absence of the monitoring of money flows. Entrepreneurial activity is being held in check not only by inflation but also by the unprecedented scope of criminality and corruption. These costs in the form of chaos and lack of control, obviously, are inevitable. But in the same way the struggle with them, moreover on the state level, is also inevitable. However, another fear is expressed in your question: will not a strengthening of the interference of the state in the economy according to formulations like those our respected academicians proposed take place? Will they not try to return to price regulations and to close up the economy? This would really bring nothing but harm. I think that in the goverment they understand that such measures would be a retreat from the reforms. Perhaps I will now surprise you. However, I think that the reforms are on the whole already behind us. The main thing has been done: prices have been liberalized, the economy has been opened up, and privatization is almost completed. Now one needs to preserve all this and to proceed further along specific institutional directions. It's right here that a strong and effective state is required. For example, the question of optimizing the management of state enterprises has been on the agenda since the middle of 1992. It was talked about in the Gaydar program for the intensification of economic reforms. There is nothing anti-market here: an enterprise cannot operate efficiently if it is not controlled by the owner. Since the owner in this case is the state, so there should be state control. In everything else the level of state interference in the economy ought to come down to promulgating good laws and providing the mechanisms for their operation. [Kovalskaya] How strongly will the departure of the reformers from the government strike at reform? [Yasin] Let's get used to the fact that the time of simple solutions and unequivocal evaluations has passed. I'm by no means delighted with the new composition of the cabinet. I very much regret the departure of Boris Fedorov, even more than the departure of Gaydar. At the same time I think that Gaydar has done his own very important part in the matter and already other people will be able to accomplish the rest. But to read the burial service over the reform and to call Chernomyrdin an anti-reformer, as many mass information media have been doing in recent months, is both incorrect and simply harmful in my opinion. [Kovalskaya] At the end of last year the government was getting ready to begin the clearing up of the finances of insolvent enterprises and the appropriate preparatory work had been done. Will this now be given up? [Yasin] As far as I can judge feelings are rather firm, in any case for the prime-minister. But the question is very difficult and is connected with the fate of millions of people. All the talk that bankruptcy will not lead to the closing of an enterprise is no more than an attempt to comfort. In the overwhelming majority of cases, bankruptcy inevitably should lead precisely to the closing of an enterprise. Otherwise, it makes no economic sense. In a normal situation the question of bankruptcy is not a state question. It is the creditors who are not being paid who should initiate legal proceedings in regard to their partners. But in reality this is not yet occuring among us. There is no financial discipline, not even an understanding that this is the case. The new stockholders don't yet know their rights and don't know how to fight for them. State interference is apparently necessary in this situation. As for state enterprises, no legal proceedings whatever are needed here at all. And a bankruptcy law is not necessary. All this talk last year that, they say, our hands are tied since there is no bankruptcy law is groundless. An owner has a right to manage his own property as he sees fit. In reality another thing brought it to a standstill: a well-founded fear of social explosion. You can't avoid the sorting out of insolvent enterprises. This is becoming a question of survival. Meager financial resources are being spread thin. As a result both promising and unpromising economic subjects find themselves under the same atttack. A stratagem for redistributing budget funds is required. Only efficient enterprises should be supported. By the way, not only state but private. I call attention to this especially, since a stereotype has taken root among us that the business of the state is only the state sector. So the criterion here should be efficiency and not the form of ownership. Especially as it is difficult with certainty to call enterprises like Uralmash just now made joint-stock companies private. They somehow occupy an intermediate niche. [Kovalskaya] The ruble exchange rate sometimes stabilizes, sometimes suddenly, as this week, falls spasmodically. What is this related to? [Yasin] It's very good to have a stable national currency. It is an indicator of the economy's health. But artificial support of a currency's stability in an unhealthy economy leads to nothing good. The stablilization of the exchange rate last year--the consequence of a stringent monetary policy--is the direct service of Boris Fedorov. Jumps are a reaction to the growth of prices. Why doesn't a smooth increase occur? Because the conduct of the agents of the currency market is determined by two circumstances: on the one hand the physical shortage of rubles and on the other--the approach of internal Russian prices to world prices, so that the dollar also ceases to be a reliable means for storing money. The special feature of our financial situation is that the dollar exchange rate, despite all the jumps, is nevertheless growing slower than internal prices. The fact is that in recent years the circle of strictly market enterprises (commercial banks and production units directly related to import and export), which very quickly and economically adequately reacts to stringent financial policy, has been set apart. They also are the basic agents on the currency exchange. But those producers which basically establish consumer prices, wholesale and retail, in their mass are far less mobile, more "socialistically" oriented, inclined to pay wages first and then debts. That is why prices in the country react slower to financial policy than to the ruble exchange rate. [Kovalskaya] It turns out that our inflation also is really not related to monetary policy and the Abalkin-Shatalin-Petrakov group is right? [Yasin] In no circumstances can one give up a stringent financial policy. But the talk about "cost inflation" instead of "demand inflation" is altogether unfounded. Inflation always is urged on by both demand and by costs. The one reinforces the other. But here it is, of course, necessary to pay attention to the structural factors which provoke the growth of inflation. Consequently, we again return to the strengthening of the role of the state. Who thought to what extent our inflation was caused by the fact that taxes are not being collected? Or by corruption? Or by the lack of currency control? [Kovalskaya] Are these really feasible tasks? Some presidents in the near abroad proclaimed the struggle with corruption their basic task and the disintegration of even those poorly operating structures which were there merely occured as a result. [Yasin] Of course, the best method of fighting corruption is a liberal economy and regulation of the functions of bureaucrats and departments. However, one also cannot attempt to suppress corruption and arbitrariness by forceful methods, with the help of the law, the militia, the tax inspectorate, and customs houses--the impunity in such cases completely demoralizes society. For example, an appropriate economic policy is needed first of all to stop the export of currency abroad: an increase in the interest rates on deposits. But currency control, which not a single state can do without, is also necessary. Corruption, I am certain, will not decline in Russia until privatization is completed, and until state property is either pilfered or plundered. But this does not mean that deliberate connivance is permissible. [Kovalskaya] Everyone is anxious about the impending reunification of monetary systems with Belarus. One of the sorest subjects is that Belarus for the last two years has stubbornly not liberated prices and has "maintained production." How are we now to unite while in fact taking on the maintenance of their unprofitable enterprises? Or to succeed in insisting on the liberation of Belarus's internal prices? [Yasin] I'm not sure. But didn't you notice that the fact is that prices are also regulated in Russia? Only not on the state level, but by the local authorities. In Moscow, for example, Luzhkov holds down the prices for gasoline and for many products. The local leaders do this in a majority of oblasts. There are oblasts that are record-holders in the regulation of prices like Ulyanovsk and Orel oblasts. In my view they are acting more reasonably in Nizhniy Novgorod, where the prices are completely free and compensation is paid to the poor. However, the government is very wise in not interfering in the internal affairs of the regions. Imagine if the inhabitants of Ulyanovsk Oblast, who are terribly proud of the low prices in their stores, suddenly found out that "from the top" they are prohibiting the freezing of prices? Let the population itself rather react to the disappearance of goods from the counters and to the inevitable setting of norms for products, or enterprises rebel against the additional tribute which the oblast assesses them in order to be able to hold on to low prices. I think that Belarus also, if the unification of finances takes place, will find itself in the position of an oblast in which prices are being regulated on the regional level. Ten million strong, Belarus will not inflict catastrophic damage on the Russian economy. [Kovalskaya] In December the country lived through a series of strikes. A new bout of the strike fever is now beginning. What, in your view, is the optimal conduct strategy with respect to strikes? [Yasin] I personally think that one should display great severity precisely towards those who try to take the country by the throat: the power industry workers, the transport workers. Of course, for a state order, once this obligation has been thoughtlessly undertaken by the government it needs to be paid for at the proper time. However, under no circumstances whatever should the government clear off from the budget the indebtedness of enterprises that are users of coal or other energy resources. That these same miners have a right to demand certain actions from the government is another matter. To close unprofitable mines and to resettle people from the North to the mainland--these are all just and reasonable desires. Very little is being done in this direction as yet. The World Bank will grant money for modernization of the coal industry but we are still not able to use it. One should respond in the right way not to intensive pressure but to the needs of those groups like invalids and single mothers who cannot stand up for themselves.
