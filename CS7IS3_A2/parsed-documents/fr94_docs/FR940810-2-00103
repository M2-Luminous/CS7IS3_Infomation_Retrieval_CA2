FR940810-2-00103 FR940810-2-00070 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34487; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;32] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Proposed Rule Change by National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Amending the Prompt Receipt and Delivery of Securities Interpretation Relating to Short Sales August 4, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on July 28, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. 1 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 The NASD amended the proposed rule change subsequent to the original filing on May 26, 1994. Amendment No. 1 was filed in order to clarify that the proposal applies to both NASD members and persons associated with NASD members. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The NASD is proposing to amend the Prompt Receipt and Delivery of Securities Interpretation (``Interpretation'') issued by the NASD Board of Governors under Article III, Section 1 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice. Specifically, the NASD proposes to amend the Interpretation to require members to annotate their affirmative determinations as to stock availability that are required to be made when effecting short sales. The following is the complete text of the proposed rule change. (Additions are italicized and deletions are bracketed.) Interpretation of the Board of Governors Prompt Receipt and Delivery of Securities It shall be deemed a violation of Article III, Section 1 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the Association for a member or person associated with a member to violate the provisions of the following interpretation thereof: (a) Purchases: No member or person associated with a member may accept a customer's purchase order for any security unless it has first ascertained that the customer placing the order of its agent agrees to receive securities against payment in an amount equal to any execution, even though such an execution may represent the purchase of only a part of a larger order. (b) Sales: (1) Long Sales No member or person associated with a member shall accept a long sale order from any customer in any security unless: (A) The member has possession of the security; (B) The customer is long in his account with the member; (C) The member or person associated with a member makes an affirmative determination that the customer owns the security and will deliver it in good deliverable form within five (5) business days of the execution of the order; or (D) The security is on deposit in good deliverable form with a member of the Association, a member of a national securities exchange, a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any organization subject to state or federal banking regulations and that instructions have been forwarded to that depository to deliver the securities against payment. (2) Short Sales ( A ) Customer short sales. No member or person associated with a member shall accept a ``short'' sale order for any customer in any security unless the member or person associated with a member makes an affirmative determination that the member [it] will receive delivery of the security from the customer or that the member [it] can borrow the security on behalf of the customer for delivery by settlement date. This requirement shall not apply, however, to transactions in corporate debt securities. ( B ) Proprietary short sales. No member or person associated with a member shall effect a ``short'' sale for its own account in any security unless the member or person associated with a member makes an affirmative determination that the member [it] can borrow the securities or otherwise provide for delivery of the securities by settlement date. This requirement will not apply to transactions in corporate debt securities, to bona fide market making transactions by a member in securities in which it is registered as a Nasdaq market maker, to bona fide market maker transactions in non- Nasdaq securities in which the market maker publishes a two-sided quotation to an independent quotation medium, or to transactions which result in fully hedged or arbitraged positions. (3) Public Offering In the case of a public offering of securities, paragraph 1 hereof shall not apply during the period from the commencement of the public offering until seven (7) business days following the date of settlement between the underwriter and the issuer of the securities; provided, however, that the member or person associated with a member believes in good faith that the customer has purchased the securities. (4) ``Affirmative Determination'' ( A ) To satisfy the requirements for an ``affirmative determination'' contained in subsection (b)(1)(C) above for long sales, the member or person associated with a member must make a notation on the order ticket at the time [he takes] the order is taken which reflects [his] the conversation with the customer as to the present location of the securities in question, whether they are in good deliverable form and [his] the customer's ability to deliver them to the member within five (5) business days. (B) To satisfy the requirement for an ``affirmative determination'' contained in subsection (b)(2) above for customer and proprietary short sales, the member or person associated with a member must keep a written record which includes: (i) if a customer assures delivery, the present location of the securities in question, whether they are in good deliverable form and the customer's ability to deliver them to the member within five (5) business days; or (ii) if the member of person associated with a member locates the stock, the identity of the individual and firm contacted who offered assurance that the shares would be delivered or that were available for borrowing by settlement date and the number of shares needed to cover the short sale. (C) The manner by which a member or person associated with a member annotates compliance with the ``affirmative determination'' requirement contained in subsection (b)(2) above (e.g., marking the order ticket, recording inquiries in a log, etc.) is not specified by this Interpretation and, therefore, shall be decided by each member. However, an affirmative determination and annotation of that affirmative determination must be made for each and every transaction since a ``blanket'' or standing assurance that securities are available for borrowing is not acceptable to satisfy the affirmative determination requirement. (5) No change. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The NASD is proposing an amendment to the Interpretation dealing with affirmative determinations made by members, or those persons associated with such members, in connection with short sales. The proposed amendment to the Interpretation establishes a requirement for a member to annotate the affirmative determination made before effecting a short sale. The affirmative determination requirement already appears in the Interpretation and requires members or associated persons to assure that securities are available to cover the short position. The Interpretation currently requires the executing member or an associated person, in connection with any sale, to make an affirmative determination that delivery will be received from the customer or that the securities will be able to be borrowed by settlement date. For long sales, the affirmative determination is required to be noted on the order ticket at the time the order is placed. However, the rule does not require that such determination be evidenced in any specific manner for short sales. The new rule would require members or associated persons to annotate, on the trade ticket or on some other record maintained for that purpose by the member firm, the following information:
