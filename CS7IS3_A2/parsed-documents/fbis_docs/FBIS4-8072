FBIS4-8072 "dreeu069_i_94024" FBIS-EEU-94-069 Daily Report 10 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Fighting, Situation Around Gorazde Reported Fighting, Situation Around Gorazde Reported Serbs: Muslims Using Chemical Agents AU1004204294 Belgrade Radio Beograd Network in Serbo-Croatian 2000 GMT 10 Apr 94 AU1004204294 Belgrade Radio Beograd Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Report by Scepan Aleksic from Cajnice] [Text] At about 1820 this evening, NATO forces bombed the forces of the Herzegovina Corps in the region of Preljuc and Goli Vrh, some 13 kilometers southwest of Gorazde. NATO air forces carried out one attack. The Command of the Herzegovina Corps is still not presenting details as to whether the Serbian forces have suffered any losses in the bombing. There is no confirmation of reports carried in foreign media that two Serbian tanks have been destroyed. With this act, as most responsible people in the Command of the Herzegovina Corps claim, NATO forces fell for Muslims lies, and without any warning carried out open aggression on the army and people of the Serbian Republic [of Bosnia-Herzegovina]. The Command of the Herzegovina Corps this evening stated that the units of the Herzegovina Corps did not enter Gorazde, thus denying reports by the Muslim radio that they had already taken half of the town. Without checking the facts, this report was carried by many western agencies this afternoon. That these claims are groundless can be concluded by the statements of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] representatives. It is incorrect that artillery is shelling the city center of Gorazde, which is also an invention by the Muslim propaganda machinery. Chemical agents have not been used, as claimed by foreign agencies. The truth is that chemical agents were used by the Muslims yesterday and this morning, but without any major consequences for the Serbian fighters.
