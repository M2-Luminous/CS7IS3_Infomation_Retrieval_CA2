FR940919-2-00094 FR940919-2-00046 SSA must have a structured approach to disability decisionmaking that takes into consideration the large number of claims (2.7 million initial disability decisions in FY 1994) and still provides a basis for consistent, equitable decisionmaking by adjudicators at each level. The approach must be simple to administer, facilitate consistent application of the rules at each level, and provide accurate results. It must also be perceived by the public as straightforward, understandable and fair. Finally, the approach must facilitate the issuance of timely decisions. As described further below, the goal of the new decisionmaking approach is to focus decisionmaking on the functional consequences of an individual's medically determinable impairment(s). The new process will assess an individual's functional ability, assess it once in the process, do it directly rather than indirectly, and rely on standardized functional assessment instruments to do so. By focusing on function, the new approach will permit both providers of medical evidence and adjudicators at all levels of the process to use a consistent frame of reference for deciding disability, regardless of the diagnosis. It will also facilitate evidence collection by lessening the need for voluminous medical records and, instead, look at the consequences of medical findings, i.e., function. Ultimately, adjudicators will make correct decisions in an easier, faster, and more cost-effective manner. The cornerstone of the new approach is, of course, the statutory definition of disability. Under the statute, disability (for adults) means the: ``.␣.␣.inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.␣.␣.An individual shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.␣.␣.'' (§223(d) of the Social Security Act). Four-Step Evaluation Process for Adults The new decisionmaking approach is the foundation on which SSA will base the claim intake process and evidence collection. The focus will be, first, to document the medical basis for concluding that an individual has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment. Second, once the evidence establishes a medically determinable impairment(s), decisionmakers will, in most cases, use additional medical findings to determine the link between the disease or impairment and the loss of function. The disability decision methodology will consist of four steps that flow from the statutory definition of disability. They are: Step 1_Is the individual engaging in substantial gainful activity? If yes, deny. If no, continue to Step 2. Step 2_Does the individual have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment? If no, deny. If yes, continue to Step 3.* Step 3_Does the individual have an impairment included in the Index of Disabling Impairments i.e., an impairment that clearly restricts functional ability to a degree that the individual is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity without measuring the individual's functional ability? If yes, allow.* If no, continue to Step 4. Step 4_Does the individual have the functional ability to perform substantial gainful activity? If yes, deny. If no, allow.* *An impairment must meet the duration requirement of the statute; a denial is appropriate for any impairment that will not be disabling for 12 months. Step 1_Engaging in Substantial Gainful Activity Any individual who is engaging in substantial gainful activity will not be found disabled regardless of the severity of the individual's physical or mental impairments. Under the new approach, SSA will simplify the monetary guidelines for determining whether an individual who is an employee (except those filing for benefits based on blindness) is engaging in substantial gainful activity. In making this determination, SSA will evaluate the work activity based on the earnings level that is comparable to the upper earnings limit in the current process (i.e., $500). A single earnings level will simplify the evidentiary development necessary to evaluate work activity and establish the appropriate onset date of disability. Additionally, SSA will continue to exclude impairment-related work expenses in evaluating whether an individual's earnings constitute substantial gainful activity. SSA will continue to evaluate whether work activity is done under special conditions and/or is subsidized. Finally, SSA will continue to use separate earnings criteria to evaluate the work activity of blind individuals in the DI program as in the current process.
