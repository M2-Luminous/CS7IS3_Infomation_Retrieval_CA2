Li Yongjin, vice chairman of the standing committee of the provincial people's congress, chaired the session. Entrusted by the meeting of chairman and vice chairmen, Zhang Liyin, chairman of the commission on politics and law under the provincial people's congress standing committee, made a report on examination of the local rules and regulations and opinions on examining the local rules and regulations. Zhang Liyin said: According to the decision made at the meeting of chairman and vice chairmen, from September to December, we comprehensively examined the local rules and regulations formulated and approved before the end of 1992. The statistics showed that 81 local rules and regulations were examined this time. Through examinations, 54 continued to be effective, 4 had to be abolished, and 23 continued to be effective but should partially be revised. Zhang Liyin set forth in his report: We suggest that the provincial people's congress standing committee should make a decision on abolishing the local rules and regulations that should be abolished and should organize forces to firmly work out a draft resolution on revision and strive to basically finish the revision tasks in 1994. Entrusted by the provincial government, Liu Deyun, chairman of the provincial family planning commission, made a report on family planning work. He said: According to the analysis and calculation by the provincial population surveying team and the investigations on the examples in family planning work, the province was expected to be able to fulfill the population control plan. Simultaneously, the overall family planning work level was improved when compared with that of previous years. After citing that the grass-roots areas were weak in the basic family planning work, their input to the family planning work was seriously insufficient, and the grass- roots statistic figures were not real, he urged that in 1994, the leaders at various levels should further upgrade their awareness of "personally engaging in the family planning work and assuming overall responsibility," exert efforts to grasp the grass roots and lay a good foundation, and concentrate efforts on solving the problems due to the failure to grasp or not effectively grasp the village-level family planning work. Entrusted by the provincial government, Song Xilin, director of the provincial land management bureau, delivered a report on implementation of the laws and regulations on land management. He said: So far, all cities and counties across the province have completely finished the establishment of the basic farmland protection areas and protected 76.075 million mu of farmland, including 70.745 million mu of cultivated area; and 72 percent of the cultivated areas were protected. From the beginning of 1992 to the first half of 1993, more than 90 pieces of state land were sold, more than 50,000 mu of land were sold, and 1.85 billion yuan of money were earned from sales of land. From the beginning of last year, the province signed 38 contracts on large-scale land development with foreign businessmen and sold rights on utilization of 43,000 mu of land; and was able to use $1.7 billion through these channels. Town and township enterprises began to experiment with the paid use of land. Song Xilin also set forth opinions on the existing problems and asked standing committee members for examinations and discussions. Entrusted by the provincial government, Gong Huanwen, chairman of the provincial planning committee, delivered a report on the construction of key projects. He said: This year, the province arranged 159 key projects, an increase of 56 projects or 54.4 percent over the previous year. The total investment was 51.5 billion yuan. The planned investment of the fiscal year was 10.82 billion yuan, (excluding the investment in preparatory projects and the Beijing-Jiulong railway project,) an increase of 6.066 billion yuan or 127.6 percent over the previous year. All this appropriately helped promote the fulfillment of the plan for investment in fixed assets and the increase in the national economy. After reporting the provincial situation in the investment in key projects, the progress of key projects, the main measures that were adopted, and the existing problems, Gong Huanwen pointed out that the provincial government would ask relevant departments to organize special leading bodies to generally and thoroughly examine and investigate the key projects with excessive construction funds, set forth opinions on solving the problems in this regard, and work out measures for controlling overspending on key projects so as to reduce construction investment and alleviate the contradictions between supply and demand of capital. Present at the session were Lu Chuanzan, chairman of the standing committee of the provincial people's congress; and Zhang Zhenhuai, Liu Zongyao, and Gao Yongtang, vice chairmen of the standing committee of the provincial people's congress. Present at the session as nonvoting delegates were Guo Shichang, vice governor of the provincial government; Ping Yijie, president of the provincial court; and Zhang Dianshan, deputy chief procurator of the provincial procuratorate.
