Meanwhile, drug mafia leaders are reportedly buying Stinger missiles from Afghan commanders. Alleged international drug dealer Haji Ayub Afridi who is wanted by the U.S. is reported to have fled to Afghanistan with the help of the Khyber Agency political authorities. The government of Pakistan had reportedly issued warrants for Afridi's arrest. Ayub Afridi's flight shows clearly that the administration did not want to arrest him; it seems that by spreading reports of intentions to hand him over to the U.S. and of making [other] arrests, a clear signal was given to major narcotics dealers to make suitable arrangements for themselves. If Ayub Afridi was in fact helped to escape by the political authorities, then these authorities should be placed under arrest and punished. Why was he allowed to escape after the government had issued orders for his arrest? The most objectionable part of the whole affair is the manner in which a U.S. agency has been allowed to take action within Pakistan as though this country was not independent but an American colony or a helpless country like Panama whose president was captured by American troops. Will similar action be taken in the near future in Pakistan and the U.S. will be allowed to arrest and take away anyone it wants within Pakistan? American spies are already raiding Pakistani homes. One cannot understand how the Government of Pakistan has allowed such things to happen. Would the U.S. ever allow Pakistani police to round up and arrest criminals it seeks in the U.S.? There is not an elected government at present holding office in Pakistan but being a caretaker government does not mean that national dignity and pride should be sacrificed. The business of narcotics undoubtedly destroys generations and nations but it cannot be eradicated by the measures that have been taken so far. Governments have repeatedly announced that drug dealers would be punished severely. We have repeatedly asked that drug dealers be put to death. But as matters now stand, major drug dealers do as they please but unimportant drug agents and sellers get caught. Powerful individuals are engaged in the drug business and perhaps governments are afraid of them or they are the government's backers. These powerful drug dealers may now be buying Stinger missiles and getting ready for a major show-down. If the reports of the sale of Stinger missiles are true, then the Government of Pakistan should first of all seek help from the government of Afghanistan and ask it to dissuade Afghan commanders from selling their Stinger missiles and protecting drug dealers.
