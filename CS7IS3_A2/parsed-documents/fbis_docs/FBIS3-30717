Feher; place and date not given: "In Spite of All This, We Would Like Good Relations With Slovakia -- Reply to the Accusations"] [Text] On 2 February in the Bratislava Parliament, Slovak Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik made a speech. He summed up his country's 1993 diplomatic results and spoke about Slovakia's foreign relations. In the course of this, he blamed Hungary a number of times for the tensions between the two countries, and for the open issues that hinder the establishment of good relations. We asked Geza Jeszenszky to reply to the accusations of his Slovak colleague. [Feher] Moravcik accused Hungary of being responsible for the atmosphere of mistrust between the two states. Does this indicate some kind of negative change in Slovak foreign policy, or is it part of the already existing process? [Jeszenszky] The Slovak foreign minister made propagandistic statements. We could term his words as some kind of self-deceit. I am convinced that history will clearly prove that his accusations had no basis. However, we do not have time to wait for the historians to make their appropriate judgment over Moravcik's statements because, in the interest of adequately informing the populations of the two countries and the international community, this kind of approach has to be calmly, but firmly refused. It is the facts that fundamentally disprove the Slovak foreign minister's views. Since the time it became clear that the Czech Republic and Slovakia would separate, Hungary has made many gestures toward both countries. We have paid special attention to the newly established Slovak state. Our historic coexistence, the 600,000 Hungarians living in Slovakia, the longest section of our border, regional politics, and economic viewpoints all dictate good bilateral relations. I would like to remind people that I held a lecture on Slovak-Hungarian conciliation on 3 September 1992, which was received positively. Prime Minister Meciar's invitation to Hungary and his visit took place after this. During the Budapest talks, [former Prime Minister] Jozsef Antall brought it to Meciar's attention that Hungary has cordial intentions with its northern neighbor, however, in two issues the Hungarian stance cannot be changed: We cannot accept the unlawful diversion of the Danube, and we have to insist on settling the situation of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia in the spirit of the international norms and recommendations. We suggested further talks on both issues. We wanted joint committees to be set up, and raised the possibility of an agreement on the protection of national minorities. (This would have been an agreement similar to the one we had made with Slovenia). Slovakia was not prepared for cooperation on these issues. As we know, the Danube was diverted, and Moravcik's latest statement on this issue is not accurate, because he said that, due to the European Union's mediation, the political antagonism between the two countries ceased to exist and it has been turned into a legal dispute. Only after defeating the Slovak Government's long resistance did Hungary manage to achieve that the European Union's mediation and The Hague Court's jurisdiction would be used. Therefore, it can be seen that, even in the case of a serious violation of the law, Hungary strived to settle the issue through negotiations, within a legal framework. [Feher] In his aforementioned parliamentary speech, the Slovak foreign minister accused Hungary, among other things, of damaging Slovakia's situation by over-emphasizing the Hungarian national minority problems at international forums. Slovakia, as a member of many international organizations, accepted as obligations the recommendations regarding national minorities. In this case, what is the basis for Moravcik's accusations? [Jeszenszky] Hungary could have hampered Slovakia's acceptance into the various international organizations. The best known example is probably Slovakia's membership in the Council of Europe. As is known, Hungary deliberately did not hinder its admittance, because we did not want to lay more burdens on bilateral relations. When Slovakia was established and when it was to be admitted to various international institutions, we did indicate our concerns regarding its policy on national minorities. In Slovakia, there is a language law that is not at all favorable to the national minorities, and the national minorities have serious reservations regarding the Slovak Constitution. Even the European Community stated at the time that the full observation of national minority rights is one of the preconditions for recognizing new states. Therefore, Hungary did not initiate this issue on its own, rather, this is an international system of requirements. Hungary was not just imagining things when Slovakia's Council of Europe membership came up: It became obvious that two new measures were threatening the Hungarian minority. These are the transformation of the schooling system and the reform of public administration, which would put the Hungarian minorities in a very disadvantageous position. [Feher] In his parliamentary speech, Moravcik claimed that the drafting of the bilateral basic agreement was in process and, on the Slovak side, nothing was standing in the way of signing this document as soon as possible. Is the drafting of the bilateral basic agreement indeed so far forward? [Jeszenszky] Unfortunately, I cannot confirm this, and the obstacles are not posed by the Hungarian side; the real problem is that the settlement of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia is indeed a prerequisite for signing such an agreement -- in the spirit, let us say, of the often mentioned Recommendation No. 1201 of the Council of Europe. If this was implemented in Slovakia and the measures that are to the detriment of the Hungarian minority are not introduced, then Slovakia's practice would be suitable for all affected sides. The agreement could refer to the desired principles and practices in an adequate form. Therefore, if the situation of the Hungarian minority is settled in the spirit of the recommendations accepted by the international community, then a bilateral agreement can be signed as soon as the following day.
