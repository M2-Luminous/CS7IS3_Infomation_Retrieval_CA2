Unyielding in their expectations of abolishment of the salary increases, the military leaders already have, among various alternatives for the possible outcome of the current crisis, a declaration of a state of national defense as a strategy to move up the call for general elections. A general who has free access within the Armed Forces and Planalto Palace told O GLOBO on 22 March: "As (Army) Minister Zenildo de Lucena has told President Itamar Franco, it is a moral problem. The Army cannot retreat." The military leaders already have proposals for constitutional alternatives that they would raise after the declaration of a state of defense, moving up the elections. They are betting on Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's advantage since he would attract all anti-Lula (PT -- Workers Party --presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva) forces. The alternatives and their possible outcome will be discussed during an Army High Command meeting scheduled for 24 and 25 March in the Brasilia headquarters. A military minister said: "The military has the constitutional duty of guaranteeing order and harmony among the branches of government. This harmony has been broken with a decision made by the Judicial and Legislative Branches to grant themselves salary increases." According to the assessment made by the military commanders, there is no possible solution to the impasse among the branches of government without producing trauma for the administration. The military commanders do not consider the possibility that the STF might retract and abolish the 10.9-percent increase granted to the Judicial Branch because this "would involve pleading guilty." The military commanders caution that even if Franco eventually decides to make the Executive Branch's position more flexible, a retreat would not be possible because it would demoralize the president of the Republic. The minister noted: "The president has taken an irrevocable stance. If he retreats, it would weaken the government." The president's irrevocable stance, expressed in a note released after a tense ministerial meeting on 18 March, was challenged by some of the ministers present at the meeting. In the opinion of these ministers, the note should leave some room for possible negotiation with the STF. It was Franco himself, encouraged by the military leaders' indignation over the salary increases for the Legislative and Judicial Branches, who decided on the communique's radical overtones. The source said: "He also could not run the risk of calling for negotiations and being defeated." Among the options reviewed by the military leaders, there was the possibility of appealing to the STF itself for its decision because the salary increase was granted at the administrative level. The military leaders, however, thought there was a risk of the Executive Branch being defeated since the action's judgment would be passed by the same (STF) justices who unanimously approved the salary increase. Another military adviser said: "The judges are making an attempt to transform the criticism of the decision that they made into criticism of the supreme institution. It is like attempting to involve the Armed Forces in criticism of a decision eventually made by the military ministers." The military leaders believe they have society's support for an eventual intervention if there is no political solution to the impasse. And, from any angle, the solution depends on the STF's retreat alone. Concerning the Legislative Branch, the military ministers' expectations are that the decision to increase the salaries will be abolished. The general noted: "The military never anticipates what society wants. Those who dared to do this failed." With much caution, the possibility of an intervention is under discussion in the barracks. It is not compared, however, with the 1964 military coup that deposed President Joao Goulart and installed an ad hoc government in our country. The intervention currently under review would reportedly be aimed at restoring harmony among the branches of government. In the military leaders' interpretation, this represents removing the salary increases for the Judicial and Legislative Branches. A late attempt at negotiating with the Executive Branch was unsuccessfully made on the afternoon of 21 March when Edson Vidigal, a Superior Court of Justice (STJ) justice (appointed by former President Jose Sarney), played the role of a Judicial Branch envoy to convince the Executive Branch of the lawfulness of the STF's decision. A military source explained: "This mission might have succeeded in initiating negotiations if it had been carried out last week before the government's and the STF's radicalization. Now it is too late." The military ministers still are expecting an unmistakable position by Minister Fernando Henrique, whom they guaranteed their support for the economic program's approval. A usual Army interlocutor claimed: "The minister spent five days out of town and still has not taken a clear position." Among the Armed Forces, the Navy is the most indignant over the decisions made by the Legislative and Judicial Branches. Despite being more cautious, the Army is no less indignant. Minister Zenildo de Lucena often has guaranteed that the democratic system is not in jeopardy and that any solution will be determined by the Constitution.
