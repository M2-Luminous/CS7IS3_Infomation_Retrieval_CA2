In NORDISK KONTAKT's special issue on security Anders Ferm, the editor in chief of the Malmo newspaper ARBETET, states that a fog hangs over the development of security policy in Europe, and that it will not be dispelled for several years to come. It is no enviable task for Nordic politicians and military people to try to navigate in this fog. It is true that initiatives and pointers are presented at regular intervals, primarily by debaters who cannot directly influence policy content, but in the absence of clear landmarks the contributions to the debate often increase the confusion. The people who are responsible for setting policy lines are lying low and contenting themselves with noting that as long as Norway, Sweden, and Finland stand in the European Union (EU) anteroom the best thing to do is wait and see. And if some of them venture to discuss security policy in the EU after the Nordic trio -- or part of it -- joins Denmark in the EU, they generally make a brief reference to the EU conference in 1996. Security Policy Cooperation? As Finland is no longer bound by the VSB [Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance] Pact but, like Sweden and Norway, has applied for EU membership, proposals on Nordic security policy and even military cooperation in the future are presented from time to time. For example, General Bengt Gustafsson, commander in chief of the Swedish Armed Forces, has called several times for increased Nordic defense cooperation. Gustafsson's proposals have not met with much sympathy. The way things look today, concrete cooperation is improbable, and even if all three Nordic candidates become EU members, it is highly unlikely that Finland and Sweden will become NATO members in the near future. And the basic constellation will remain, as pointedly expressed by minister Max Jakobson, among others: Norway has NATO, Sweden has Finland, and Finland has a mutual border with Russia that is 1,000 kilometers long. But everything is fluid and a lot can happen in a few years. After the eventful fall of 1989 the opinions of all foreign and security policy experts have become suspect, and one analysis is as good as another. In any case foreign and security policy in the Nordic countries has undergone a quite revolutionary change in recent years, and now that the prime ministers have seized the initiative one cannot rule out the possibility that cooperation will cover new areas in the future. Russia a Question Mark The big question mark in the Nordic security policy debate is Russia. The old threat scenarios are no longer relevant, of course -- not many people include a Russian invasion of any of the Nordic countries in their calculations -- but the chaotic situation in Russia could lead to crises, for example in the Baltic states, that would immediately be reflected in the situation in the Nordic region. When Finland decided to apply for EU membership two years ago the main justifications were trade policy and economic reasons. Little was said about security policy, but today it is openly stressed that membership also has an important security policy dimension. And we may assume that as we approach the popular referendum this fall security arguments will be discussed almost as frequently as the future of agriculture. Nonalignment Without Guarantees For EU membership will inevitably also lead to security policy ties. Pekka Visuri, a researcher at the Foreign Policy Institute, points out in the same issue of NORDISK KONTAKT mentioned above that it is questionable whether there will be any possibility of staying out of military policy cooperation within the framework of the economic and political dimension. He points out that the definition of "freedom from military alliances and an independent national defense system" used by Finland and Sweden will not seem particularly credible to the rest of the world unless it is combined with guarantees that the EU countries will continue to sanction this position in the future. The debate on future Nordic security policy solutions should get under way in earnest. When it comes to Finland there is a risk that we will reach a decision in the accustomed manner, with no discussion worth mentioning, and explain afterward that what happened was for the best.
