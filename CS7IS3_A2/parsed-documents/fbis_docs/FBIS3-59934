The newspaper cited U.S. and Russian analysts. Valeriy Izmalkov stated that the nuclear missile operational codes have a protection system that makes it practically impossible to decipher. He underlined that the missiles are launched based on space photographs and not geographical maps. So retargeting the missiles would require extremely complex calculations -- something that only U.S. and Russian general staffs are capable of doing. Ukraine is not prepared for this. The deputy called the allegations about Ukraine deciphering nuclear codes a small link in a big chain of provocations against Ukraine. In this connection, Izmalkov also mentioned energetic actions by Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev in Brussels, who resorted to aggressive pressure against Ukraine and encouraged other states to do the same.
