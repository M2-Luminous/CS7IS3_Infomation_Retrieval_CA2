[Begin Reina recording] Every person interprets the matter based on this opinion. What does he mean? That he abides by it. He has a different opinion because he does not think the volunteer service can meet the needs. Some tried to say he was defying this decision. I feel this is not a proper interpretation. [end recording] Throughout the news conference, Reina denied there was any insubordination on the part of Gen. Andino Flores. [Begin recording] [Reina] Absolutely. How can that be insubordination, when he obeys the orders of his boss? [Reporter] [Question indistinct] [Reina] The president is the chief of the Honduran Armed Forces. [end recording] What is important, the president said, is that the Executive Branch's bill was submitted today to the National Congress. The Legislative Branch will have to decide, he said, whether or not we are wrong. [Begin Reina recording] I am not afraid of being wrong, because this goes to the National Congress, and it will debate it. One supposes that all the people are there. If the Congress rejects it, I will openly admit I was wrong. [end recording] Although the topic of the volunteer, education, social, humanistic, and democratic military service monopolized the attention of the media, President Reina commented on other topics, such as the energy crisis. [Begin Reina recording] Let me tell you that yesterday I spoke with the Mexican president. He offered us all his help, and if this works out we will overcome the crisis in a few days. He is offering two plants that generate 30 megawatts each. We will overcome the problem with those 60 megawatts. [end recording]
