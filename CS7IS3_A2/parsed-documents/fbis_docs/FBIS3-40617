This indicates the growing problem of our debt servicing liability at a time when not only our exports have begun to stagnate but remittances from overseas Pakistanis -- once a major redeeming feature of our external budget -- are also shrinking substantially. Here is a problem which now requires special attention and careful handling. An update on the 1992-93 Economic Survey has recorded that debt service payments for that whole year totalled $1.645 billion of which $646 million were only interest payments. If total debt servicing liability is deducted from the year's disbursements in foreign assistance, that net external flow is around $800 million. Looked at from another angle, debt servicing was more than 24 percent of our export receipts, more than 15 percent of all foreign exchange earnings and more than three percent of our Gross National Product (GNP). Remittances, which in 1982-83 soared to more than $2.8 billion, have now slumped to about $1.5 billion. In case of major donors like the US, Japan, Germany and two international financial institutions -- the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank -- repayments pre-empt a big portion of new inflows. In case of the US, which has suspended new loans or concessional credits, we are perhaps exporting capital rather than importing it. Annual repayments to the US in 1992-93 were around $350 million -- much more than what is still flowing from the pipeline as economic assistance. If repayments on military purchases are added, the scenario becomes more worrisome. Pakistan has so far scrupulously avoided any default or sought any new debt relief or re-scheduling. But it is perhaps time to review the whole situation more comprehensively. It is unlikely that in the immediate future there will be any dramatic upturn in our exports. We seem to have good case for seeking rescheduling or debt relief of some kind to tide over the present situation. IMF assistance, now under negotiation, may not be adequate for a year or two. The forthcoming Donors meeting this spring may be the right forum to stimulate some dialogue on this issue. In the meantime, Pakistan should, in concert with other developing countries, press for a new North-South settlement on the debt problem for the third world as a whole.
