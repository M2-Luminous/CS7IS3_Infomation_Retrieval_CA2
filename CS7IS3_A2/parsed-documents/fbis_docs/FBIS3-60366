EC Energy Commissioner Abel Matutes said that as the Maastricht Treaty would encourage closer ties between R&D and the market, the Commission had proposed including the greater part of the Thermie programme within the proposed fourth Framework Programme on Research and Technical Development [CERT]. It remains unclear, however, which of Thermie's more industrially-oriented aspects will remain outside the Framework Programme. As far as figures are concerned, 570 million Ecus has provisionally been set aside for Thermie activities within the Framework Programme. Funding for the rest remains uncertain. Claude Desama, the Chairman of the European Parliament's Committee on Energy, Research and Technology, expressed misgivings about Thermie's inclusion in the Framework Programme. On the one hand, the constraints of the Framework Programme's overall budget would limit Thermie's scope of action. On the other, there were Thermie projects which did not strictly fall into the category of R&D and should not be included in the Framework Programme, he said. The European Parliament is also recommending that any Thermie II programme should not fall into the trap of trying to cover the whole of the energy spectrum, thus spreading itself too thinly and at the same time stepping on the toes of other R&D programmes. When the CERT comes to study the Commission's proposals for Thermie II it is expected to recommend greater concentration on, and investment in, three priority areas: promotion of clean coal and transport technologies and the production of energy from waste. As far as the Belgian Presidency of the EC Council of Ministers is concerned, continuation of Thermie is guaranteed in principle but questions still remain as to the wisdom of forcing it into the Framework Programme mould. Melchior Wathelet, the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister, stressed the importance of Thermie's strong links with industry (as compared to the complementary Joule programme on non-nuclear energy technology, which is heavily R&D-oriented). Mr Wathelet wondered whether mixing it with too much R&D would not dilute Thermie's direct industrial link. The Council of Ministers should begin to study the issue as of now, well ahead of Thermie's expiry in 1994, he said. According to the Minister, the Council was convinced of the need to strengthen all its CO2 reduction/energy saving instruments (Thermie, Joule [Joint Opportunities for Unconvention or Long-Term Energy Supply], SAVE [Special Action Program for Vigorous Energy Efficiency], ALTENER [Alternative Energy Development Program]) and impose a CO2/energy tax. The CO2/energy tax option is not one dear to the heart of the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederation of Europe [UNICE]. UNICE President Carlos Ferrer seized the opportunity of the Thermie exhibition opening to reiterate the lobby's opposition to the CO2 tax proposals. Praising the Thermie programme as one of the best examples of non-fiscal measures for controlling CO2 emissions, Mr Ferrer then went on to attack the fiscal option. A CO2/energy tax would push up fuel prices and undermine the competitiveness of European industry (the improvement of which is one of Thermie's main aims) and its ability to invest in energy efficiency.
