This was a common understanding reached at the "symposium of the development strategy for the Inner Mongolia central economic zone" held in Beijing on 13 June. The symposium was cosponsored by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regional Party Committee and Government and the China Comprehensive Development Research Institute. Attending were Wang Qun, Wu Liji, Yun Bulong, Zhou Weide, and Tu Ke, regional leaders; and Ma Hong, Liu Yunshan, Chen Tonghai, Xu Penghang, Wu Jie, An Zhiwen, Pei Yingwu, Wang Wenze, Bi Qun, Fan Weitang, Lu Yanchang, Wang Min, Lin Ling, Liu Shulan, and Zhou Daozhi, leaders of relevant ministries, committees, and units of the state. In his speech, Wang Qun expounded the important strategic significance in building the Inner Mongolia central economic zone. He said: Developing the Inner Mongolia central economic zone is a strategy to make the country prosper and the border area strong, which has taken shape after earnest investigation and study based on the state overall economic development plan and Inner Mongolia's reality. It is an issue not only for Inner Mongolia but also for the entire country; and it is not only an economic issue but also a political issue. In the overall strategy for the state's economic development, the Inner Mongolia central economic zone will become an important pillar. Building this economic zone conforms to the state's industrial policy and the requirements of the state's overall development strategy and is also conducive to the development and stability of the border minority nationality areas. Exploitation of the abundant resources of this zone is all the more conducive to the state's construction of the energy resources base in the 21st century and will also effectively promote the endeavors to strengthen the border area and consolidate national defense and to achieve the common prosperity of the various nationalities. The Inner Mongolia central economic zone is a triangle area along Huang He, which borders on northern Shanxi and Shaanxi and takes Hohhot, the capital city of the autonomous region, Baotou, the steel city in the grassland, and Ih Ju League, the sea of coal, as its mainstay. It holds not only 80 percent of the world's rare earth, one-sixth of China's coal, abundant iron, nonferrous metal, and oil and gas, but it also holds one-third of Inner Mongolia's industrial fixed assets and a half of its scientific and technical forces. With a substantial industrial foundation, convenient transport systems, and favorable conditions for the alignment of industries, it has good exploitation prospects and a tremendous development potential. Focusing on the "outlines of the development strategy for the Inner Mongolia central economic zone," the participating leaders, experts, and scholars conducted sincere study and exploration. They held: A locality should look for new ways of development if it is to narrow its gap from advanced localities. Domestic and foreign experiences proved that the most effective strategy to narrow the gap is giving preferential policies to key localities and key industries, investing the limited economic resources in a relatively concentrated manner in the localities with better conditions for comprehensive development and a relatively superior economic and social environment to facilitate their extraordinary development and to turn them into regional polar nucleus of increase or development center, and then, through their spreading and transmission role, promoting the economic growth and social progress of other localities. The Inner Mongolia central economic zone is one of the localities with the best conditions to become such a polar nucleus of increase. In addition, accelerating the development of the Inner Mongolia central economic zone will help the shaping of the polar nucleus of increase that effectively facilitates the continuous escalation of the industrial and technological structure of the entire Inner Mongolia and will lead to the economic development and social progress of Inner Mongolia. It also can be regarded as the best combination between the state's key industries and the superior localities suitable for developing these industries and the organic combination between the emphasis given to industries and that given to localities and between the preferential policies given to industries and those given to localities to develop the priorities of development. In the process of moving the strategic priorities of state development to the west, this zone will become the first base for making progress that links the east to the west. Besides, the Inner Mongolia central economic zone is an important hinterland of the economic zone around Bohai Sea and also an important area linking Northeast Asia with the Eurasian continental bridge. Accelerating the development and construction of the Inner Mongolia central economic zone conforms to the state's overall layout of economic development because it helps link the economy and the market of north, northeast, and northwest China and the Bohai rim and link China's economy with the economy of the world. Some participants familiar with Inner Mongolia's conditions also pointed out optimistically: Despite the fact that the "outlines of the development strategy for the Inner Mongolia central economic zone" have yet to be appraised and improved, construction of the zone has begun long ago, and many state and regional key projects built in this zone have made eye-catching headway. Some comrades pointed out in their speeches: The world has developed to a new historical stage, and the new world pattern calls for speeding up the exploitation and construction of border minority nationality areas and for enabling their abundant natural resources to play a proper role in economically consolidating and strengthening the border areas. The participants also earnestly discussed a series of issues in building the Inner Mongolia central economic zone and offered many valuable and constructive opinions. Wu Liji, chairman of the regional government, and Ma Hong, honorary director of the State Council Development Research Center and president of the China Comprehensive Development Research Institute, gave speeches to summarize the symposium.
