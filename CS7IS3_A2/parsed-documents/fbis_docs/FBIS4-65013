He pointed out that the deadlock in Cyprus results from the fact that the Greek Cypriot partner, which has a majority, is considered the legitimate government of the entire island. The federation we want, he said, is different from the federation the Greek Cypriots want. Denktas was speaking at a working breakfast given by the Bursa Industrialists and Businessmen's Association at Celik Palace Hotel. He stressed that the Turkish Cypriots should not pin their hopes on the world and the United Nations and expect them to mete out justice in Cyprus. He added that the Turkish Cypriots must defend their own rights and must develop economically. Otherwise, he warned, the countries of the world will continue to pursue the policy they have been pursuing for the past 30 years, either for their own benefit or in the interests of others. The president explained that if Turkey helps the Turkish Cypriots economically and shows the world that it is on their side, not only militarily but economically as well, then their image in the eyes of the world will change. He added: Had the Turkish Cypriots been strengthened economically, had Turkey created such a picture, we would not have been seen as an occupying force. Denktas recalled that Turkey promised to extend political guarantees to Turkish businessmen who invest in Cyprus, but this promise has not yet been fulfilled. He urged Turkey to extend this guarantee so that businessmen will invest in Cyprus. Commenting on the proposal that the Cyprus problem be solved through a federation, the president said: The Turkish Cypriots want a federation in which they will not have to return the rights they have gained, a federation based on equal rights, while the Greek Cypriots want a federation that will establish Greek Cypriot sovereignty on the island. Denktas stressed that even UN officials who are familiar with the Cyprus problem admit that the Greek Cypriots want to extend their power to the Turkish Cypriot side.
