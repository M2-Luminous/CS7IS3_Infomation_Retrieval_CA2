Given that oratory is ever capable of working miracles in a dream world, this section of our Palestinian community seems to judge any political action that falls short of set objectives or does not end up fulfilling aspirations in one fell swoop to be absolutely conspiratorial and capitulationist. For them, political action consists mainly in rhetoric that sets out their objectives. We had believed that the last few years saw us, Palestinians, cast off this one-dimensional, starry-eyed approach, when we began to talk in terms of political thought, political education, a phased struggle, and the need to pursue our main objectives in stages each requiring a certain shape of struggle and a language suited to changing circumstances. We must now admit that we have been proved wrong. Nearly 14 years since the first and oft-discredited rejectionist experience of the Palestinians, here we are again experiencing the same verbal negative experience. This is not to say that we have anything against the right to dissent and rejection. Indeed, this is a sacred right that should not be undermined as long as it is exercised to advance [words indistinct]. We ourselves are now exercising this very right. Our sole aim is to correct the course of the militant march and safeguard the Palestinian household and strengthen the foundation of Palestinian unity. It is just an attempt we are making from this forum to caution against the risks inherent in the rejectionist rhetoric that never advances beyond lip service. Indeed, these naysayers say nothing of merit, aside from pointing accusing fingers and raising doubts. They also fail to recognize new facts and their implications for the Palestinians and Arabs, and globally. Far from leading to a grasp of new facts and how to handle them, such an approach inevitably leads us away from hard realities. Those who point accusing fingers and pass ready-made judgments, in effect, gradually close the doors before a national dialogue and promote discord and consequently jeopardize our national unity. The naysayers even do not view stepped up struggle against occupation and forcing new facts on the ground as the road to topple the declaration of principles agreement. For them, the only means to topple the agreement is to topple Palestinian legitimacy and the historic leadership of the Palestinians. In other words, the rejectionists are not coming up with any plan of action to dislodge occupation. They have nothing to offer save the same revolutionary statements and slogans they have raised over the past 20 years. Thus, instead of proposing national action to upgrade the revolution and resistance, they are seeking the aggrandizement of factional interests that, if allowed to grow and take hold, carry dire consequences for the militant march of our people. [words indistinct] Are our people's national interests and objectives thus served? We hope this question will be weighed before it is too late.
