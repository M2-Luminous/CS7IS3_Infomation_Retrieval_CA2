Our questions: 1. What are the three major political, economic, social, or welfare tasks facing the governing forces in the next four years, tasks that your party accepts and will give preference to even at the cost of other problems? 2. What are the three larger-than-average economic, political, social, or moral burdens facing society or some strata of society in the next four years, burdens connected with or independent of the aforementioned tasks that you do not accept or accept only partially, and which you force into the background compared with other similar problems? National Democratic Federation [NDSZ] 1-2. The NDSZ's economic policy is based on a fundamentally different assessment of the situation, economic philosophy, and value system than that of the liberal (or in other words, neo-conservative) economists and the parties influenced by them. Therefore, its questions and answers are also different from the currently widespread liberal logic. In our view, rather than the fact that we previously had a socialist system in Hungary, the basic problem is that the driving forces of extensive growth that uses an increasing amount of raw materials and energy have been exhausted in the developed countries (both in the West and the East), and from a consumer society, the (developed part of the) world is entering a sustaining society that also takes the requirements of environmental protection into consideration. This transition goes with major economic commotions, and the withdrawal of resources from the developing and former socialist countries (including Hungary) through international credit links is part of this process. Therefore, for Hungary and for other former socialist countries, the establishment of some kind of a capitalist system similar to 18th century England cannot bring a solution. Instead, we have to find the economic mechanism and social structure that correspond to our national circumstances and traditions, and which meet the requirements of the 21st century. As part of this, the NDSZ: a. Wishes to break with the liberal politics that exposes Hungary's markets to the significantly more developed multinational companies, and it offers a policy of selective market protection against it; b. It also wishes to break with the liberal principle that wishes to counteract the inflationary pressure of free prices with high interest rates. Instead, the NDSZ advocates a tight price control of basic consumer goods and raw materials, to reduce inflation this way; c. The above two changes make it possible to reduce the interest rates, and to replace the restrictive financial policy typical of the past few years with a policy of economic stimulation. 2. Through its above economic policy, the NDSZ mainly wishes to alleviate the burdens affecting the broad masses of people and to improve their position. In the interest of this, it pays less attention to satisfying the needs of rich people. For us, it is more important that the average citizen be able to receive affordable and satisfactory quality goods, say, within a Central and East European cooperation, than to have all products of the world for sale (for those, of course, who have the money for them). For us, the just distribution of the national assets is more important than the increase of the proportion of private property at all costs. We do not believe the tale that can only imagine a country's economic prosperity on the basis of selfish private interests, accompanied by corruption. We do not believe that private assets are more efficient than anything else; for us, all forms of property are equal in rank. We do not believe that, for the country's economic prosperity, we first have to establish an immensely rich private owner social strata, and we accept all the tensions arising from the fact that our views are contrary to the now popular liberal, or in other words, neo-conservative, views. Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] 1. The reduction of people's burdens and, at the same time, reducing the parasite elite to obedience; -- the establishment of equality of opportunity applying to the whole life; -- climbing out of the debt trap. 2. We pay less attention to those unemployed people who do not wish to work; however, we do all we can for those who do want to work; -- we do not cry for the III/III department members dismissed from the Radio; -- we are indifferent to the fate of the workers' militia and leather jackets [members of plainclothes police in the 1950's]. Green Party of Hungary 1-2. The most important political tasks: The suppression of the extreme liberal political trends in Hungary in the interest of preventing the further proliferation of fascist and racist strife. Deceiving the domestic ethnic and national minorities with their political manifestations and hypocrisy, and with the help of their instigator organizations and provocations, they try to implant in them the feeling of defenselessness, being persecuted, and being in a disadvantageous position. Due to being organized on a racial basis, they already now create antagonistic feelings in citizens, which will continue to increase in the future because of their unlimited greed for power, and this can lead to conflicts. As they have control over some of the media, we have to conduct enlightening propaganda to prevent their deception. We strive for a neutral position, and want to withdraw the request for NATO membership. We had enough of foreign dependence. After the Soviet Union, the military forces of Western Europe would occupy our country. We would be a deployment area, and a buffer zone between the West and the East. We would again be the losers. Together with Switzerland and Austria, we could very well exist as a third small neutral country. Whatever conflicts we might have, NATO would not defend us anyway, it is not in its interest, because we do not have oil wells like Kuwait which was a U.S. interest. NATO has many times shown its "inability" to act in the case of conflicts outside its sphere of interest. Instead, we should strive for good-neighborly relations with the neighboring countries, and with Russia mainly, we should establish total conciliation and cooperation because it will soon have a determining role in Europe. Workers' Party 1. A correct analysis of the situation is a decisive condition of socially acceptable politics and of good governmental economic policy. In addition to the inherited difficulties and the world economic situation, the economic policy of the past four years was the decisive factor in the deterioration of the economic situation. The forced establishment of the economic and social bases of capitalist transformation did not result in an increased economic productivity. Today, the Hungarian economy is in a worse situation than in 1989-1990. All this has serious social consequences: 1 million unemployed people, the deteriorating status of whole social groups, and mass impoverishment. The political institutions do not reflect society's real interest conditions. Today, a sicker economy and sharper conflicts are the main characteristics of the crisis. According to the Workers' Party, two remedies will have to be applied together. On one hand, we need a new economic policy. On the other, through important political changes, we have to release the economy from the confines of the forced politics of the change of the regime. The country's situation can be significantly improved in four to five years. Our economic policy is based on three pillars. Instead of the current restrictive politics, we want development, more investments, higher consumption, lower interest rates, smaller and predictable taxes, and more workplaces. Secondly, we want an economic environment that is based on the equality of opportunity of the various forms of ownership. Thirdly, the state has to take on an active role in the economy, in ownership, in defining the main proportions, and in financing some strategic areas. We believe that the points of breakthrough in the next period can be created by establishing some leading branches in the economy. We want to develop the construction industry through a large-scale program to build 70-80,000 flats. With a more favorable economic policy, the light industries would be suitable for creating many new workplaces. In our view, the development of telecommunications and road building are important leading branches of industry. We need a state concept to lay the basis of some industries' future development, for example food industry and engineering. The area of human investments is another explicitly important area from the economic and social points of view. Financing education means financing the future. It is impermissible to exclude whole social strata from acquiring modern education. With a disheveled health system, Hungarian people will not just have less knowledge to enter the 21st century than their colleagues in Western Europe, they will also have a worse state of health and less stamina. Therefore, in our view, it is essential to ensure free medical provision as a basic right of citizens. Among the welfare measures, we consider it important to keep the current age limits of retirement, and that guarantees should protect the value of pensions against inflation. It is very important from an economic and political point of view for the new parliament to change the law on housing. The Workers' Party believes that only a policy adjusted to the needs, or at least to the tolerance level, of the workers who make up the majority of society is able to fight the serious and contradictory factors of the crisis. We cannot demand society's various segments to confront each other. With an active use of the current points of breakthrough, unemployment can be reduced to below 5 percent in five to six years' time, and inflation below 10 percent. We cannot continue the forced consolidation of the capitalist conditions and the governmental policy to expand it. Therefore, in the view of the Workers' Party, it is harmful to force privatization at all costs, without a concept of ownership. The current privatization has to be stopped. It is more important to operate the existing mixed economy efficiently. Any kind of privatization should only be done with social control and the workers' participation. In our view, it is a basic requirement to end the policy against agriculture and the cooperatives. Security has to be established in land ownership, production, and selling. Compensation has to be ended. It is impossible to build economic solutions on the basis of moral categories. It is important to rid ourselves of our illusions as regards Western Europe. Social security can only be based on an economic development that leads to a breakthrough. Naturally, to achieve this, we need resources. In addition to creating a supportive tax and credit system, we must significantly reduce the state expenditure and stop bureaucratic overspending. At the same time, we have to agree with the West that if it does not want the Hungarian economy to collapse and a domestic political explosion to ensue then they should cancel some of our $24 billion debts or the repayment of the interest. In the view of the Workers' Party, overcoming the crisis requires fundamental political changes. We support a social agreement or pact. However, this cannot be restricted to the negotiations of the employee organizations, employers, and government. A feasible social pact can only be based on a parliament that expresses society's multifold interests and asserts them through the laws. Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] 1. The SZDSZ emphasizes three main tasks of economic and social policy. The first one is establishing the conditions for economic growth. Economic growth is not a matter of decision -- when the necessary conditions were missing, forced growth created difficult situations on many occasions -- it requires the establishment of various defined conditions. The new government has to establish an atmosphere of stability and predictability by forming the conditions for clear-cut economic conditions. The increase of the budget deficit can be stopped and inflation can be curbed through a cheap state, namely by ruthlessly reducing public expenditure. An overall social agreement can protect employers from unpredictable wage demands and employees and pensioners from their income losing value. Reduced taxes and allowances on company tax and wage costs can stimulate the enterprises and the establishment of new workplaces. The stabilization of the bank system and the establishment of new money market institutions can improve the entrepreneurs' conditions to have access to more capital. The acceleration of privatization contributes to an early consolidation of the decaying large enterprises. A fast settlement of the land ownership will create stable conditions for farming and agriculture. Continuing the Hungarian economy's international integration is another major goal of economic policy. Export orientation, foreign economic opening, and an increasing presence of foreign capital are the keys to economic success throughout the world. This is the way we can have access to the indispensable additional capital, the way modern technology can become widespread in our economy, and the way Hungarian enterprises can acquire markets. We have to accept the costs of this, namely the discontinuation of uncompetitive domestic enterprises and product cultures. Preventing the division of society is the third priority. Certain elementary social guarantees have to be ensured for everyone. Therefore, compulsory health insurance has to be maintained so that all citizens can have access to health care. Basically, the system of family supplement also has to be maintained, a mininum basic pension has to be ensured for everyone, and we have to ensure that the increase of pensions does not lag behind the wage increases. 2. Economic change and the stimulation of enterprises make it unavoidable for the differentiation of incomes which is unusual in Hungary to be maintained in the coming years. The unfavorable effects of this have to be reduced by welfare guarantees but cannot completely be eliminated. Economic considerations demand that, in the course of privatization, people who can contribute to restoring the former state properties with their own capital and management expertise should first become proprietors. However, this inevitably leads to a smaller segment of society becoming owners and to significant differences arising in assets. The economic crisis, the assertion of the rights of freedom, and the opening of the borders together caused the sudden increase of the crime rate. We know that totalitarian dictatorships normally have better public order than free countries. However, rather than reinstating the total control of a police state or closing the borders, we wish to act against this by strengthening the police force, defending the injured parties, and modernizing the prison conditions. It has to be seen that public order and security can only be improved gradually; this is the cost of freedom. Something else the SZDSZ government will not solve in the coming four years: It will not place all those people who have in recent years been building the SZDSZ's organizations into well-paid positions or supervisory committees, thus making them satisfied. In personnel decision, we consider expertise and management skills as guidelines rather than party membership. Not all honest and brave Free Democrat activists are experts of banking or theater life.
