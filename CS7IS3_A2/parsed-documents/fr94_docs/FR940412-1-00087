(c) Copra must be provided with good surface ventilation and must not be stowed against heated surfaces including fuel oil tanks which may require heating. (d) Ferrous metal must be stowed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and the following requirements: (1) It may not be carried if its temperature prior to loading exceeds 55 ○C (131 ○F). (2) Prior to and after loading, it must be protected from moisture. (3) If weather is inclement during loading, hatches must be covered or otherwise protected to keep the material dry. §148.135 Stowage and segregation for materials of class 4.3. (a) Class 4.3 materials listed in table 148.10 of this part which, in contact with water, emit flammable gases, must_ (1) Be kept as cool and dry as reasonably practicable prior to loading; (2) Not be loaded or transferred between vessels during periods of rain or snow; (3) Be stowed separate from foodstuffs and all class 8 liquids; and (4) Be stowed in a mechanically ventilated hold, so arranged that the exhaust gases do not penetrate into accommodation, work or control spaces. Unmanned barges that have adequate natural ventilation need not be provided with mechanical ventilation. (b) The bulkhead between a hold containing a class 4.3 material listed in table 148.10 of this part and a hold containing a material required to be separated from such materials must have cable and conduit penetrations sealed against the passage of gas and vapor. (c) Aluminum ferrosilicon, aluminum silicon, and ferrosilicon must be stowed in a mechanically ventilated space. (d) Zinc ashes must not be accepted for transport if wet or if known to have been wetted. §148.140 Stowage and segregation for materials of class 5.1. (a) Class 5.1 materials listed in table 148.10 of this part must_ (1) Be kept as cool and dry as reasonably practicable prior to loading; (2) Be stowed away from all sources of heat or ignition; and (3) Be stowed separate from foodstuffs and all readily combustible materials. (b) Special care must be taken to ensure that holds containing class 5.1 material listed in table 148.10 of this part are clean, and that whenever reasonably practicable, only noncombustible securing and protecting materials are used. (c) Class 5.1 material listed in table 148.10 of this part must be prevented from entering bilges or other cargo holds. §148.145 Stowage and segregation for materials of class 7. (a) Class 7 material listed in table 148.10 of this part must be stowed_ (1) Separate from foodstuffs; and (2) In a hold or barge that is effectively closed or covered to prevent dispersal of the material during transportation. (b) Skin contact, inhalation or ingestion of dusts generated by class 7 material listed in table 148.10 of this part must be minimized. (c) Each hold used for the transportation of class 7 material (radioactive) listed in table 148.10 of this part must be surveyed by a qualified person using appropriate radiation detection instruments after the completion of off-loading. Such holds must not be used for the transportation of any other material until the non-fixed contamination on any surface when averaged over an area of 300 cm2 does not exceed the following levels: (1) 4.0 Bq/cm2 (10&hyph;5 uCi/cm2) for beta and gamma emitters and low toxicity alpha emitters, natural uranium, natural thorium, uranium-235, uranium-238, thorium-232, thorium-228 and thorium-230 when contained in ores or physical or chemical concentrates, and radionuclides with a half-life of less than 10 days. (2) 0.4 Bq/cm2 (10&hyph;4 uCi/cm2) for all other alpha emitters. §148.150 Stowage and segregation for materials of class 9. (a) A bulk solid cargo of class 9 material (miscellaneous hazardous material) listed in table 148.10 of this part must be stowed and segregated as required by this section. (b) Ammonium nitrate fertilizer, Type B, must be segregated as required in §148.140 for class 5.1 materials and must be stowed_ (1) Separated by a complete hold or compartment from readily combustible materials, chlorates, hypochlorites, nitrites, permanganates, and fibrous materials (e.g. cotton, jute, sisal, etc.); (2) Clear of all sources of heat, including insulated piping; and (3) Out of direct contact with metal engine-room boundaries. (c) Castor beans must be stowed separate from foodstuffs and class 5.1 materials. (d) Fish meal must be segregated as required in §148.10 for class 4.2 materials. In addition, its temperature at loading must not exceed 35 ○C (95 ○F) or 5 ○C (9 ○F) above ambient, whichever is higher. §148.155 Stowage and segregation for potentially dangerous materials. (a) A material that is potentially dangerous (PDM) must be stowed and segregated in accordance with table 148.155 of this part and with this section. (b) When transporting coal_ (1) Coals must be stowed separated from materials of class/division 1.4 and classes 2, 3, 4, and 5 in packaged form; and separated from bulk solid materials of classes 4 and 5.1; (2) No material of class 5.1, in either packaged or bulk solid form, may be stowed above or below a cargo of coal; and (3) Coals must be separated longitudinally by an intervening complete cargo compartment or hold from materials of class 1 other than class/division 1.4. (c) When transporting Direct Reduced Iron (DRI)_ (1) DRI lumps, pellets or Cold-molded briquettes and DRI hot-molded briquettes must be separated from materials of class/division 1.4, classes 2, 3, 4, 5, and class 8 acids in packaged form; and separated from bulk solid materials of classes 4 and 5.1; and (2) No material of class 1, other than class/division 1.4, may be transported on the same vessel with DRI. (d) Petroleum coke, calcined or uncalcined, must be_ (1) Separated longitudinally by an intervening complete cargo compartment or hold from materials of class/divisions 1.1 and 1.5; and (2) Separated by a complete cargo compartment or hold from all hazardous materials and other potentially dangerous materials in packaged and bulk solid form.
