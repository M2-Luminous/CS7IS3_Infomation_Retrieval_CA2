FR941020-1-00040 FR941020-1-00012 Deletion of a site from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individual right or obligations. The NPL is designed primarily for information purposes and to assist Agency management. III. Deletion Procedures Section 300.425(e)(4) of the NCP, 40 CFR 300.424(e)(4), sets forth requirements for deletion to assure public involvement in the decision. During the proposal to delete a release from the NPL, EPA is required to: (i) Publish a notice of intent to delete in the Federal Register and solicit comment through a public comment period of a minimum of 30 calendar days; (ii) Publish a notice of availability of the notice of intent to delete in a major local newspaper of general circulation at or near the release that is proposed for deletion; (iii) Place copies of information supporting the proposed deletion in the information repository, described in ยง300.430(c)(2)(iii) of the NCP, at or near the release proposed for deletion; and (iv) Respond to each significant comment and any significant new data submitted during the comment period and include this response document in the final deletion package. EPA must further place the final deletion package in the local information repository once the notice of final deletion has been published in the Federal Register . This Notice of Intent to Delete, together with a concurrent notice in the local newspaper in the vicinity of the Site, announce the initiation of a 30-day public comment period. The public is asked to comment on EPA's intention to delete the Site from the NPL. All documents supporting EPA's decision to delete the Site from the NPL are available for inspection by the public at the information repository in the vicinity of the Site and the EPA Region III office. EPA will accept and evaluate public comments on this Notice of Intent to Delete before making a final decision on the deletion. EPA will then prepare a Responsiveness Summary which identifies and addresses significant comments received during the public comment period. The final deletion decision is made following consideration of comments received during the comment period. The deletion occurs when a final deletion notice is published in the Federal Register . Generally, the NPL will reflect deletions in the final update following the notice of deletion. Public notices and copies of EPA's response to public comments received during the comment period will be made available for inspection by the public by the Regional Office. IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion The Suffolk City Landfill Site, also known as the Hosier Road Landfill Site, is a 67-acre parcel situated east of Hosier Road (Virginia Route 604) in the City of Suffolk, Virginia. To the north of the Site is a 37-acre borrow area from which current cover material for the landfill was obtained. Bordering the Site to the east is undisturbed upper reaches of Pocosin Swamp, and an escarpment that defines the western boundary of the Great Dismal Swamp. To the southeast of the Site lies a privately-owned road. Two unnamed streams (unnamed streams N and E) are located north and east of the Site. These streams meet in an area adjacent to and northeast of the Site before emptying into the Pocosin Swamp, located east of the Site. There are about 40 to 45 residences located within one mile of the Site. Most of these residences are in areas south of the Site, where groundwater is the primary source of drinking water. The City of Suffolk operated an unlined landfill at the Site from approximately 1967 to January 1985. The landfill received municipal solid waste primarily from the City and, before 1974, Nansemond County. The permit for the operation of the landfill was reissued in June 1983. The reissued permit required the City to close the landfill when the regional landfill became operational and to implement a closure plan which had been submitted to the Virginia Department of Health (VDOH). In preparing to implement the closure plan, the City discovered documentation indicating that several tons of debris that contained pesticides had been disposed of in the landfill in 1970. The disposed pesticides, which were damaged by a fire at the Dixie Guano Company, included Disulfoton, Cu7 Sulfur, 7 Sulfur, Thimet, and Cyanox. On June 3, 1970, the Tri-County Health District, the former Nansemond County (now City of Suffolk), State Water Control Board, the Virginia Department of Agriculture, and the Industrial Hygiene Department decided that the remaining pesticides would be disposed in a lime-lined trench that would be covered with lime and two feet of soil. The lime would promote hydrolytic processes that break down the pesticides. According to a June 5, 1970 VDOH memo, the pesticides were treated with lime and covered with two feet of soil in two trenches of approximately 120 feet long x 25 feet wide x 3 feet deep. EPA completed a Preliminary Assessment in April 1985 and a Site Inspection in July 1986. As a result of these efforts and a Hazard Ranking System (HRS) scoring of the Site, EPA proposed to include the Site on the NPL in June 1988 and finalized the inclusion in February 1990.
