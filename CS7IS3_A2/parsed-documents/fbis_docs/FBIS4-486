The final training programme, which will equip them for their duties at the stations, is only due to kick in next week and will continue until April 24. Training of electoral officers who have specialised functions -- such as counting the votes -- will continue right up until the election. The tasks facing the IEC in the three short weeks before the election are daunting, and international observers working with the commission are convinced it is too late for the massive election operation to be implemented as originally planned. "We are concerned that they have left it too late," an insider said diplomatically. "But there is nothing to be done except to push ahead." The outstanding tasks include: -- The training of more than 12,000 electoral monitors, who will be the eyes and ears of the IEC on the ground during the poll and will help the commission decide whether the election has been free and fair. The IEC has 8,171 monitors in hand, with another 2,300 due to join them at the end of the week. The cut-off date for the training of monitors is April 17. Their deployment around the country has not yet been finalised. -- The location of nearly 3,000 polling stations around the country. Of the 8,500 stations, 5,740 have been designated. Equipment for all the stations has been ordered and it is planned that everything will be in place three days before the election. In addition, the National Electoral Observer Network (Neon), which is accredited by the IEC, this week began recruiting the 50,000 local observers they hope to have in place for the poll. The observers -- who can only report incidents to the IEC's election monitors -- are expected to provide vital support to the monitors who will be stretched thin on the ground during the poll. The national co-ordinator of the network, Stiaan van der Merwe, complained: "The IEC is paying very little attention to making this work, despite good arrangements being made". But the IEC's chief media officer, Pieter Cronje, is not unduly worried. "Our election readiness plan is computerised, and when you look at the graphics we are on target," he said. The logistical problems are not the only ones currently besetting the IEC. One insider said that while the commission was being pushed on by "plenty of good people working helluva hard", the operation has picked up "underqualified freeloaders who walk around waiting for their beepers to go off for lunch." The IEC has almost 180,000 people on its payroll and the number is growing as more operations get under way. And, although many staffers are equipped with cars, beepers and cellular phones, they seem to have difficulty communicating with each other and bureaucratic snarl-ups have proved a constant hindrance. Last week, over 200 monitors threatened to go on strike after they did not receive salaries. "They are there to represent civil society but they have assumed a kind of bureaucratic attitude which is not explained by the pressures of time. They are not transparent at all," said Van der Merwe, who is trying to co-ordinate Neon's observers with the commission. Cronje responded: "Any large body of people working together will produce complaints about process and product. We have to work fast."
