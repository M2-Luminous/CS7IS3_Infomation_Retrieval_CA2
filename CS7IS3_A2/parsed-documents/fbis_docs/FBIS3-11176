"The program cannot be fictitious; that is why it must be rational, feasible, and practical so that it can be implemented after the elections." Lula expressed his feelings on 16 March after lunching with Maceio Mayor Ronaldo Lessa (PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party]), who is one of the possible vice presidential candidates for his ticket. He clearly stated that he does not agree to the inclusion of those topics in the program: "I do not know whether this has to do with a government program -- it could deal with legislative policy or the Constitution -- but I believed it to be democratic to include them in the program that is to be discussed." The candidate also stated that he will not accept party impositions in this respect. "Not even Lula can impose a program on society, nor can the PT impose a program on Lula," he stressed. "The program has to contain what the government plans to do."
