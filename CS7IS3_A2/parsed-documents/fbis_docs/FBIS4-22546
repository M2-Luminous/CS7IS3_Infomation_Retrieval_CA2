First, he was held up by business in his native Donetsk, where he is again running for the office of deputy to parliament and was reporting to his voters; then, contrary to etiquette, his meeting with the American ambassador ran much longer than expected because of a deep interest on both sides, then Russian television questioned him meticulously regarding the future of Ukraine... He is 61 years old. Heavy-set and deliberate of movement. His gaze is intent and penetrating, instantly appraising his colocutor and the situation. In contrast, his answers are unhurried and well thought-out. His somewhat colorless voice comes alive when he "gets going" as his interest is engaged. A typical "workaholic," for whom work and pleasure are one. He comes in at eight in the moring and leaves at ten or eleven at night. He spends all of Saturday and part of Sunday at work as well. He likes to win and respects results. He is conservative in his views: he has no use for revolutions and prefers a peaceful, evolutionary development, retaining all the positive things that were already achieved before he came to power. You could call him "lucky" in summarizing his life, or you could describe him as a otrudyagap [not further identified], who achieved success through hard work and an unquestionable talent for leadership. At his age, he is no longer tempted by a career; he simply wants to help Ukraine in this difficult time with his experience and knowledge. He is mining engineer by profession. He has passed through all the stages of the miner's hard life: from mining foreman to mine director. His "last love" was the Zasyadko Mine in Donetsk. Under him, this mine, which had always lagged behind, was transformed. The plan was one thing, but the fact is that not only was he able help the mine attain all the achievement banners, but, more important, he made people's lives a little happier. Under him, housing construction, which had been at a standstill, started up: they began with self-financing, building two-story houses, and now they are erecting 15-story buildings, with improved plans and with apartments measuring 60 square meters of floor space. The health resort he built in Sudak on the Black Sea consists exclusively of first-class accomodations with bathrooms and kitchens. "As far as I am concerned, everybody is equal: be they ministers or cleaning women. I do not divide people into black and white..." Thanks to him, the mine bought itself a state farm in the old days. Zvyahilskyy managed to arrange a meeting with Shcherbytskyy, and the latter put his magical "I approve" on the director's request for permission to buy the farm. And so the miners had meat, milk, and butter in large quantities and at production cost. In the 13 years that he served as director, he won the trust not only of the mine employees, but also of the residents of Donetsk itself. For a full year, he headed the Donetsk city council and executive committee, and then on 11 June 1993, he was appointed first deputy prime minister by a presidential decree. Since 22 September, following the departure of Kuchma, he has served as acting prime minister and simultaneously first deputy prime minister of Ukraine. Although the president is currently the official head of government, having taken on the additional burden of the duties of two deputy prime ministers -- responsible for the economy and for the fuel and energy complex -- Zvyahilskyy in fact heads the reorganized Cabinet of Ministers. It is no mere chance that the first question we asked him was: [Timofeyeva] In your opinion, what is the economic situation in the country, and what has the government succeeded in doing and what has it failed to do so far? [Zvyahilskyy] The situation in the country remains complicated, but there are some signs of stabilization of the economy. We have been able to curb hyperinflation a little: compared to December, when it was running very high, it fell by a factor of 4.5 in January-February. We have stabilized the exchange rate of the Ukrainian coupon -- it has virtually remained unchanged since January. The prices of food products are holding and not rising. And in some oblasts, for example, in Donetsk, the price of butter has fallen by 7,000 coupons. The prices of sugar and alcoholic beverages are also dropping... We now have new forms of clearing operations with the different sectors of the economy. We are not opening new credit lines for the farms; instead, we are giving them credits in the form of goods in exchange for future finished production in 1994: fertilizers, spare parts for machinery... And when they bring in the harvest, they will give the state their production at equivalent prices. This will also help stabilize the economy and prevent funds from being squandered. [Timofeyeva] What priority tasks have you set yourself for the coming year? [Zvyahilskyy] The principal task is to solve the problem of clearing operations among enterprises and farms on a nonemission basis. [Timofeyeva] You are accused of pursuing an extremely rigid line, which makes one to wonder if you are not perhaps returning to the earlier command-economy methods of managing the economy. What is your response to this charge? [Zvyahilskyy] Market relations are regulated everywhere. Go back to history, look at the United States, Germany, and other countries. Strict regulation was the only thing that enabled them to overcome their crises. And, generally speaking, why should the state renounce functions that are part of its responsibilities? Why should exports and imports flow uncontrolled? We had total liberalization of prices in Ukraine for two years. And now we are seeing the lamentable results of this policy. Why should a person be able to come to the exchange and buy a million dollars without anyone knowing whether he has returned this million to Ukraine or moved it abroad? We have now proposed something else -- a tender committee instead of an exchange (the operations of the exchange have been suspended for the time being). But now I know that if five million dollars are bought to pay Russia for gas, tomorrow this money will be on its way, and the day after tomorrow we will have the gas we paid for. We also have to control the price of energy supplies. Three or four months ago, dealers held back oil products and kept them standing while they waited for a large issue of money to be injected into the market (they are no longer satisfied with a price of 12-13 million; they are waiting for it to reach 15 million...) Why should they be allowed to control the economy by speculation? That is not what a market is all about. To begin with, it is our state enterprises, the State Oil and Gas Committee and Ukrahroservis, that should be buying the oil. We follow the weekly reports from the Mediterranean area plats [not further identified]. We calculate, watch, compare this with our own currency exchange rate, and determine that the price of oil products in Ukraine should be 150 dollars and not 240 or 250, as some would like. We have set a fixed rate of exchange for petrodollars for the priority branches of industry and we maintain it. You see, ultimately petrodollars enter into the price of flour, bread, milk, meat... This being the case, why is that what we are doing is viewed as wrong? Who can explain this to me? Yes, reforms are under way, including in agriculture. Is privatization not reform? And holding down prices on food products -- is this not reform? [Timofeyeva] How do you understand the term "Ukrainization of the economy," which is used from time to time to scare the Russian government? [Zvyahilskyy] That is Gaydar's idea. He is the one who believes that it is not necessary to regulate the economy and that reforms will happen of their own accord. Fortunately for Russia, the proportion of its exports is still higher than its imports and that every year it receives a certain sum of hard currency, which it can infuse into the economy and thus curb inflation. But what will happen when there are no more exports?.. The inordinately high nonpayment amounts are strangling both Russia and Ukraine. But your prices have begun to climb, while ours have stabilized. Why? Because we regulate the exchange rate of our currency. I do not interfere in the production process and tell a plant director that he must not make engines but must make meat grinders instead... No. Technology, production, raw materials -- these are all up to the one organizing production. My only requirement is that there be a demand for your product. It must be exportable and competitive. If you produce for the warehouse and then demand that the government give you money because you cannot sell your products, what purpose does this kind of production serve? Let these producers either switch to making something else or declare bankruptcy. Towards this end, we need to work out a program to protect the unemployed. Take our banks as an example. They were completely unregulated. When the tax inspectorate came, it was shocked at the number of abuses it found. What makes a banker more valuable than an academician, allowing him to pay himself a salary of 150 million? Why does a miner, who works underground in extremely difficult and dangerous conditions, earn a maximum salary of four million coupons? We decided that the maximum salary should be six million. Anything above six million and you pay a progressive tax up to 90 percent. And what does raising bank interest rates from 250 to 400-500 percent mean? It means higher prices, which fall as a heavy burden on the shoulders of the people. And so now if a banker hikes up rates, we will collect a higher percentage from him. That is the point of state regulation -- to prevent businessmen from artificially elevating the prices of essential goods and products. [Timofeyeva] We have heard talk behind the scenes here that Ukraine is planning to join the CIS not as an associate member but as a full-fledged partner in this union. Is this true? [Zvyahilskyy] Yes, and we are planning to consider this matter very carefully at a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers in the very near future. [Timofeyeva] How do you think your proposal will be met? Will you not be accused of betraying the interests of Ukraine? What effect will this have on the fate of your government? [Zvyahilskyy] Sensible people who wish Ukraine well, who are distressed by the state of their country's economy, will understand. As to the attitude of others -- on their conscience be it... [Timofeyeva] What has made you decide to run again for parliament? Is this a reflection of your precarious position in the government, or is this a determination on your part to combine the duties of a deputy with those of a prime minister? [Zvyahilskyy] Let me answer you as follows. I was elected deputy four years ago as a candidate of the labor collective of the Zasyadko Mine in the Kiev district of the city of Donetsk, where there are 103,000 voters. I recently held eleven meetings with members of this constituency. At just one meeting -- attended exclusively by pensioners and veterans of the Great Patriotic War -- nearly 1,000 people showed up. I talked with people at the mines, who had just come off their shifts. In short, with people who are accustomed to speak the truth to your face. And at no time did I hear an insulting tone or a provocative remark. People talked of the hardships that surround them, made suggestions, expressed criticism, but with concern rather than agitation. This is normal. In the four years that I served, I fulfilled virtually all the mandates of those who elected me, even though these were rather large. It gave me moral satisfaction to have been able to help people. But all these mandates still need to be carried through to completion and followed to ensure that they are fulfilled. Thus, if I did not run again from the same district and from the same labor collective that put forward my candidacy, my conscience would bother me that I had failed to perform my duty. This is the main reason. Then, too, if I am to represent the interests of the people, I need to be a people's deputy, so that I can deal on an equal footing with other deputies, who otherwise could say to me at any moment: we have been elected by the people, and who are you? [Timofeyeva] What tasks do the coming elections have to solve? Who needs them to begin with -- the government, the deputies, or the people? [Zvyahilskyy] This was the will of the people in all the regions, both east and west. And the will of the people must be obeyed. As a matter of fact, I supported this at the session of the Supreme Council and voted for it. This idea was supported by the miners and metallurgists. Ending the crisis in the economy requires that something be sacrificed. So let us sacrifice ourselves. [Timofeyeva] Does this mean that these elections will bring a new government, new people onto the scene: will the parliament not have to confirm it? [Zvyahilskyy] This can happen. Although I think that frequent changes of government will hardly help to stabilize the situation.
