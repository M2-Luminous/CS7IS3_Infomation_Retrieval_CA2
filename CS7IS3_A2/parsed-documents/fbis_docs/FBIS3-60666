In an exclusive interview to Pakistan Observer, and weekly Hurmat, General Beg, who had been associated with policy formulation on the subject, revealed that the country had attained the required capability during the last tenure of the PPP government and the decision to adopt policy of restraint was made unanimously by all concerned. According to him, the decision was taken collectively by the then President, Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan; the Prime Minister (then) Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto and the (then) COAS (Mirza Aslam Beg). Clarifying the position whether the programme has been capped or freezed, the former COAS explained different stages of nuclear weapon programme. He said in the first stage Uranium is enriched at low or high level. Low Enriched Uranium (between 3 to 6 percent) is used in atomic power plants whereas High Enriched Uranium (90 to 95 percent) is meant for weapons-oriented programme. In the second stage enriched Uranium is given device shape and different components of the device are manufactured. The third stage involves laboratory system whereas the whole system is tested in the fourth stage either through cold test or hot test as done by India in 1974. Dropping of the nuclear warhead is the fifth and final stage of the programme. With this background, he said stoppage of all the stages simultaneously would be called capping and stoppage of work on one or two stages would be called "freezing". But there is a third term "restraint" meaning not to proceed beyond attainment of the required capability. General Beg said the capability was achieved during BB's previous rule and she had all the powers to take a decision about the fate of the nuclear programme. He said the decision to adopt policy of restraint was taken by GIK, BB and he (Mirza) himself and Nawaz Sharif inherited this decision. He strongly dispelled the impression that the decision was taken because of any outside pressure and said it was a voluntary decision. After this, the scientists were asked to work on other projects like missile manufacturing. "Had our programme been rolled back, all the scientists and technicians working on it would have been rendered superfluous and sent to their home which is not the case", he explained. Replying to a question, General Beg said BB was a party to the decision to pursue the policy of "restraint" and Nawaz Sharif too continued this policy during his rule. Therefore, he said, they ought not blame each other. To another question, he said the United States wants us to roll back and destroy the nuclear programme but "no Pakistan Government could do that". He said the present government should take the nation into confidence about the nature of the programme and its present stage as people would never allow any compromise on this vital issue. The former COAS was of the view that there was a time when Pakistan could have detonated its nuclear device but any such action now would create many problems for the country. General Beg was also critical of the decision of Pakistan Government to withdraw Kashmir resolution from a UN Committee and said India has agreed to talk to Pakistan only to buy some time. He said the present session of the UN General Assembly is ending on December 15 and India expressed its readiness to discuss the Kashmir issue with Pakistan only to deprive Pakistan of the opportunity to raise the issue at the world body. Now Pakistan would have to wait till next session. He was of the view that the forthcoming round of Pak-India talks would be fruitless. The very basis of the dialogue i.e. Simla agreement is not relevant because the discussions should focus on how to implement the UN resolutions. About (American) General Hoar's visit to Siachin, he said the United States wanted to convey a signal to India that it would be in trouble if it (India) tried to improve its relations with China. Similarly, when India was going to sign an oil pipeline project agreement with Iran, the United States openly supported. Pakistan on Kashmir but when India described the project as "not feasible", Americans showed a gesture of goodwill by advising Pakistan not to take up Kashmir issue to UN.
