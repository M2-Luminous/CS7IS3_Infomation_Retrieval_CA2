The ring planned to assassinate high-ranking Lebanese officials to destabilize the country and embarrass Syria ahead of the Syrian-U.S. summit. AL-SAFIR reports that one ring member who was arrested recently was tasked with assassinating a high-ranking official. The authorities have also foiled a plan to assassinate a minister and a senior military official. Citing well-informed sources, AL-SAFIR says the Israel agencies and another, non-Israeli, party have drawn up a plan to weaken Syria's position. They want to weaken President al-Asad's position ahead of the Geneva summit with President Clinton. So they planned to embarrass him in Lebanon. This information follows Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's recent visit to the occupied border strip and his veiled threats against Lebanon and Syria.
