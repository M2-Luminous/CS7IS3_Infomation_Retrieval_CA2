"We desire to develop our long-term and stable friendly relations with Germany based on the principles of seeking common ground while reserving differences, mutual respect and trust, peace and mutual benefit," Qiao said. Kohl said Germany and China share special ties, they can closely cooperate not only in economy, but also in other areas. He said as China has a time-honored culture, bilateral cooperation can also be extended to science and technology. "There is much that I am willing to do in this regard," Kohl said. Both Qiao and Kohl shared a common view that a series of agreements signed between the two countries during Kohl's visit to China last November will be fully implemented. Kohl said: "What we have promised will be surely abided by." He stressed, "China has always supported Germany's reunification while Germany supported China's reunification in the past and will continue to do so in the future." During the meeting, Qiao briefed Kohl on China's domestic situation and reforms. "We hope for an early resumption of China's status as a signatory party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)", which will make China's economic relations with countries all over the world to take onto the normal way," Qiao said.
