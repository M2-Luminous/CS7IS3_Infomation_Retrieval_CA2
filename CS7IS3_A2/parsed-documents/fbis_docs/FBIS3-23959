An economic program and a strategy for structural changes in the economy that are coordinated with manufacturers should be developed and released, with priorities pointed out and effective ways for their support and development outlined, including those in the area of conversion. 2. The country's problem of nonpayments, which is rooted in the failure of the state to honor its obligations to pay industrial and agricultural enterprises for products, should be solved. The state's debt to defense enterprises, the agrarian sector, and the spheres financed from the budget should be settled. An amnesty should be implemented for the status as of 1993 with regard to arrears in the payment of interest for the use of bank credit and in penalties of all types for delays in compulsory payments. 3. In 1994, the upper limit of all types of taxes actually paid and other compulsory payments made by manufacturers of goods should be restricted to a level not exceeding 35 percent of the actual generated profits. The rate of tax on property should be restricted to a volume of no more than 0.1 percent of the book value, with depreciation factored in. 4. Funds allocated by manufacturers to replenish their proprietary working capital should be exempted from taxation in 1994 without any restrictions or qualifications; to this end, manufacturers should also be granted the right to interest-free tax credit with a repayment term of 24 months. 5. All funds actually allocated as investment in production should be exempted from taxation in 1994 without any restrictions or qualifications. 6. A special bank investment rate shall be set at a level not to exceed one-third of the discount rate of the Central Bank on loans used for housing construction. 7. The standard duration of postal transit in the processing of payments by banks should be established. The sender and recipient banks should be charged with monitoring the duration of payment processing and should be granted the right to debit from the guilty parties without acceptance, for the benefit of the sender enterprise, fines for delaying payments in the amount of two times the discount rate of the Central Bank of Russia, on the basis of the registration dates of payment documents. 8. Export duties on raw-material commodities should be set in 1994 at levels equalizing domestic and world prices. Import duties on goods should be set in 1994 at levels which, on one hand, ensure reasonable priority for domestic manufacturers of similar goods while, on the other hand, destroying monopolies on the domestic market. Technical equipment and subcontracted parts imported for the purpose of manufacturing competitive products should be exempted from customs duties on imports. 9. Temporary state regulation of prices for primary energy resources should be introduced, ensuring financial support for extractive enterprises at the initial stages out of funds especially created to this end, gradually reducing subsidies as the economy is restructured. 10. The thoughtlessly destroyed economic relations with republics that belonged to the Soviet Union should be restored, and artificial barriers in the path of the movement of merchandise and money should be removed.
