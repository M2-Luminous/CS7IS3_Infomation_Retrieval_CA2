FR941028-1-00004 FR941028-1-00001 The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39&hyph;6702 (55 FR 33279, August 15, 1990), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), to read as follows: Boeing: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;120&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18, Amendment 39&hyph;6702. Applicability: Model 747SP series airplanes; variable numbers RG001 through RG142 inclusive, and RG171 through RG222 inclusive; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent fuel leakage onto an engine and a resultant fire, accomplish the following: (a) For airplanes on which the ``terminating modification'' [between front spar station (FSS) 640 and FSS 670] specified in Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;57A2259, dated February 15, 1990; or Revision 1, dated September 6, 1990; has not been accomplished: Within the next six months after September 21, 1990 (the effective date of AD 90&hyph;17&hyph;18, amendment 39&hyph;6702), perform a visual and an ultrasonic inspection of the front spar web between front spar station (FSS) 636 and FSS 675 in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;57A2259, dated February 15, 1990, or Revision 1, dated September 6, 1990. If no crack is found, repeat these inspections at intervals not to exceed 1,000 landings until the inspections required by paragraph (b) of this AD are accomplished. (b) For airplanes on which the ``terminating modification'' [between front spar station (FSS) 640 and FSS 670] specified in Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;57A2259, dated February 15, 1990; or Revision 1, dated September 6, 1990; has not been accomplished: Prior to the accumulation of 4,000 total landings on the airplane, or within 1,000 landings after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, perform the inspections specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this AD to detect cracks in the web between FSS 628 and FSS 675, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;57A2259, Revision 2, dated June 9, 1994. Accomplishment of these inspections terminates the repetitive inspection requirement of paragraph (a) of this AD. If no crack is found, repeat these inspections thereafter at intervals not to exceed 1,000 landings. (1) Perform an ultrasonic inspection in the web under the upper and lower chord footprints; and (2) Perform a high frequency eddy current inspection in the web in an area one inch below the upper chord and one inch above the lower chord footprints; and (3) Perform a detailed visual inspection in the forward face of the web of the wing front spar at fastener locations in the web-to-stiffeners and web-to-rib posts. (c) For airplanes on which the ``terminating modification'' specified in Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;57A2259, dated February 15, 1990; or Revision 1, dated September 6, 1990; has been accomplished: Prior to the accumulation of 4,000 total landings on the airplane, or within 6 months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, perform the inspections specified in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this AD to detect cracks in the web between FSS 628 and FSS 636, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;57A2259, Revision 2, dated June 9, 1994. If no crack is found, repeat these inspections thereafter at intervals not to exceed 1,000 landings. (1) Perform an ultrasonic inspection of the web under the upper and lower chord footprints; and (2) Perform a high frequency eddy current inspection of the web in an area one inch below the upper chord and one inch above the lower chord footprints; and (3) Perform a detailed visual inspection of the forward face of the web of the wing front spar at fastener locations in the web-to-stiffeners and web-to-rib posts. (d) If any crack is found during any inspection required by this AD, prior to further flight, accomplish a terminating modification (between FSS 623 and FSS 670) in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;57A2259, Revision 2, dated June 9, 1994; or in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. (e) Installation of a terminating modification (between FSS 623 and FSS 670) in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;57A2259, Revision 2, dated June 9, 1994; or in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Seattle ACO; constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD. (f) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle ACO. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO. (g) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on October 24, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
