Major tasks of this meeting are to mobilize the entire industrial front of the province to extensively launch the activities of "transforming mechanism and improving management, skills, and efficiency," further implement the targets concerning the provincial industrial economy of this year, and make arrangements for the production in the second quarter of this year. Successfully holding this meeting is of positive and promoting significance in implementing in an even better manner the guidelines of the second session of the eighth National People's Congress, in submitting to and facilitating the overall task of "seizing the favorable opportunities to deepen reform, open still wider to the outside world, promote development, and maintain stability," and in comprehensively fulfilling the goal of pushing the economy onto a new stage this year. 1. On the Current Provincial Economic Situation In the first quarter of this year, the province's situation in economic operation was, in general, normal, and new headway was made based on the high-speed increase of last year. The situation in the countryside was very good. The bumper grain harvest and the increased purchasing prices of grain and cooking oil last year mobilized the initiative of peasants in growing grain. As a result, the funds and materials prepared for spring plowing were relatively sufficient. The prepared chemical fertilizers reached 2.8 million standard tonnes, accounting for 68 percent of the total demand, of which, 2.4 million standard tonnes have already been delivered to the hands of peasants. This year, 150 million kg of seeds are needed, and 140 million kg has already been delivered to peasants, accounting for 92 percent of the total demand. Affected by market demand, the structure of the cropping industry was readjusted. Local financial revenues of the province increased by a relatively large margin. Revenues in January and February totaled 520 million yuan, an increase of 82.4 percent over the corresponding period last year, of which, revenues from industrial and commercial taxes amounted to 430 million yuan, an increase of 44.5 percent. Financial situation was relatively stable. Saving deposits of urban and rural residents increased by a large margin. In the first two months of this year, savings deposits of urban and rural residents increased by 4.05 billion yuan, an increase of 10.4 percent, or 2.18 billion yuan more than the increased amount in the corresponding period last year. Of this amount, bank savings deposits increased by 3.11 billion yuan, an increase of 10.1 percent, or 1.75 billion yuan more than the increased amount of the corresponding period last year, a record high. Foreign economic relations and trade continued to keep the trend of rapid development. In January and February, export volume totaled $240 million, an increase of 50.6 percent over the corresponding period last year. Of this, the barter trade volume was $43.58 million, an increase of 480 percent. Since the beginning of this year, the province has newly approved 303 foreign-invested enterprises, with the value of contracted foreign funds reaching $233 million. Sales on market were relatively brisk. In the first two months of this year, the total volume of retail sales of commodities was 5.51 billion yuan, an increase of 17 percent over the corresponding period last year. In the first quarter of this year, industry in the provincial economic operation increased slowly. Major problems facing industry were: First, the increase margin of industrial production was relatively small. From January to February, output value of the industry at or above the township level was 9.355 billion yuan, an increase of 1.6 percent only over the corresponding period last year. Of this, output value of heavy industry increased by 3.8 percent, that of light industry declined by 2.7 percent, that of state-owned enterprises dropped by 5.3 percent; that of nonstate-owned enterprises increased by 30 percent; and that of large- and medium-sized enterprises increased by 1.5 percent. Sales value realized by enterprises amounted to 10.65 billion yuan, a decline of 1.8 percent from the corresponding period last year; and marketing rate of enterprises was 85.7 percent, a decrease of 4.4 percentage points from the corresponding period last year. In January and February, the national industry increased by 18.2 percent, while the increase in the provincial industry was 16.6 percentage points lower than the national level. In March, the growth rate of the production of the province's industry at or above the township level was enhanced. It is estimated that from January to March this year, the increase margin of industry at or above the township reached 3.1 percent. However, this margin lagged far behind the goal of effecting a 15-percent increase. Second, the economic results were not ideal enough. In the first two months of this year, the state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises registered only a 1.1- percent increase in profits; the money-losing budgetary enterprises suffered 264 million yuan of deficits, an increase of 330 percent over the same period of last year; and 60.4 percent of the budgetary state-owned industrial enterprises suffered deficits. After striking a balance between profits and deficits, the state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises across the province changed their situation from creating 110 million yuan of profits in 1993 to suffering 150 million yuan of losses. Increasingly more enterprises partially or completely suspended their production. According to the statistics compiled by the end of February, of the 4,930 enterprises at or above the county and district levels in the province, 19.5 percent partially or entirely suspended their operation. There emerges a tendency that the scale of entire or partial suspension of operation has been expanded from small-sized enterprises to large- and medium-sized ones. There were many factors for causing the changes in the province's industrial production situation from fast development in 1993 to low-speed increase in the first three months of this year and for creating the bigger fluctuation. Viewing the major environment, we know that the state stresses the necessity to control the aggregate credits and the scale of investment in fixed assets in order to control inflation, alleviate the "bottle-neck" restrictions, and maintain a sustained, fast, and sound development of the national economy. Our province lays particular stress on the industrial structure. The state-owned enterprises account for a large proportion. So, we are rather poor in suiting the market changes. The implementation of the "general rules for financial affairs of enterprises and the business accounting standards" as well as such state major reform measures as the new tax system and the unified foreign exchange rate is the necessary step for speeding up the setup of the socialist market economic system. However, some new problems have been brought to enterprises. That is, some enterprises have the factors for increasing taxes and reducing profits and undertake heavier burdens. According to the statistics compiled through the survey on 98 budgetary enterprises of 12 industrial bureaus in Changchun city, through implementation of the "general rules and standards," these enterprises are expected to reduce 190 million yuan of profits in the first half of this year, and have to pay another 130 million yuan of taxes this year due to the increase in tax rates and the changes in the categories of taxes. The implementation of the unified foreign exchange rate has results in the increase in the value added taxes of imported vehicle parts. Thus, the production cost of each Audi sedan car of the Changchun No. 1 Vehicle Manufacturing Plant increases by 28,000 yuan. After implementation of the new tax system, the Jilin carbon plant and the Jilin paper-making mill will hand over to higher levels 23.36 million yuan of taxes annually. Due to the increase in taxes, some enterprises that used to make small profits will suffer profits. Viewing the overall situation of the province, we know that there were two direct reasons for causing the declines in industrial production in the first quarter of this year: First, since the beginning of this year, the large enterprises and key trades, that gave a stimulus to the increase in the province's industrial production last year, have lowered their production growth rate. When compared the first quarter of this year with the same period of last year, the production growth rates of such large enterprises as the No. 1 vehicle manufacturing plant, the Jilin ferroalloy plant, the Jilin paper-making plant, and the Qianguo oil refinery were reduced in varying degrees; and those of medical, sugar refining, and metallurgical trades were reduced by a big margin. Second, the working funds for industrial production were in short supply. Although more capital was put into circulation, the enterprises used a considerable number of funds to pay taxes, electricity charges, debts, and wages retroactively; and only a small amount of money were directly used in production. Therefore, from the beginning of this year, the enterprises were generally short of funds. According to the calculation by the provincial economic and trade commission, this year, 8.29 billion yuan of working funds should be added for industrial production but only 4.7 billion yuan can be supplied and 3.59 billion yuan are in short supply. The main reasons for causing the strain on capital are insufficient input, the increasingly higher occupation of capital by enterprises, and the increasingly heavier debt chains. According to the statistics compiled by the people's bank, the industrial credits in the first two months of this year only increased by 46 million yuan, a drop of 120 million yuan from the same period of last year. As of the end of February, the 1,248 enterprises with industrial and commercial bank accounts had 24.51 billion yuan of funds tied up by finished products, goods shipped in transit, and receivable and advanced payment for goods, an increase of 820 million yuan over the figure at the beginning of the year. Enterprises were linked up with one another with the debt chains involving 31 billion yuan. Due to the bigger deficiency in capital and the excessive more capital occupied, many enterprises are unable to normally organize production. The current economic situation shows that to comprehensively fulfill the various tasks for promoting Jilin's economy to a new height this year and to safeguard political and social stability, we should ensure the attainment of three targets as defined by the provincial government earlier this year, namely a 12-percent increase in gross domestic product, a 15-percent increase in industrial output value, and the price rise kept within 10 percent. Industry is the key to fulfillment of these three targets. We may say that industry is where the priority, difficulty, potential, and hope lie. A large part of Jilin's economic growth and revenue come from industry. We plan to increase this year's industrial output value by 15 percent and will strive for an 18- percent increase, and we will increase the profit-tax rate of funds by 2 percentage points. These two indicators will be the major criteria for judging Jilin's endeavor to promote the economy to a new height. Industry is the sector affected most by the measures that the state has drawn up and is drawing up for the reform of the financial and tax, banking, foreign exchange, price, and investment systems. To achieve rapid and healthy development in industrial production, we should do a good job in helping the enterprises which have suspended production totally or partially resume production and provide for themselves in addition to making a number of key enterprises successful. This has a direct bearing on social stability. Therefore, making this year's industrial economy successful is at once an arduous economic task and a major political task. Leaders at all levels must approach this issue from the perspective of safeguarding the basic principles and general task for the work of the entire party and entire country this year and correctly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability. Since the beginning of this year, cities and the autonomous prefecture as well as economic departments and departments in charge of industries have exerted great efforts to organize industrial production under rather difficult conditions, and they have scored some achievements. We should play up the achievements, continue to work hard in unity, change the current passive situation in industrial production as soon as possible, promote industry, and facilitate sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development in the province to provide a solid economic foundation for the smooth progress of reform and for maintaining political and social stability. 2. Regard the Activities of "Transforming Mechanism and Improving Management, Skills, and Efficiency" as the Theme of This Year's Industrial Work The State Economic and Trade Commission decided to carry out the activities of "transforming mechanism and improving management, skills, and efficiency" among all the enterprises in the country beginning this year. This represents an important measure to respond to the central authorities' call for establishing the modern enterprise system and for new ideas for economic development and also is the road enterprises should take in the new situation of deepening reform. In early March, the State Economic and Trade Commission again conducted further study and made arrangements at the national enterprise management forum held in Zhuzhou. The activities have changed the past practice of dealing with mechanisms, management, and efficiency separately and brought to light the internal relationship between the mechanisms, management, skills, and efficiency of enterprises. Related to the establishment of enterprises' position as the major participators in market competition and establishment of the modern enterprise system, the activities constitute a basic project for establishing the socialist market economy system and are in total conformity to Jilin's reality. We should carry out the activities among all the enterprises in the province and regard the activities as the theme of the endeavor to organize Jilin's industrial economy. We should note that the activities have a very important immediate significance in Jilin's endeavors of deepening enterprise reform, enhancing the vigor of large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, relying on scientific and technological advance, adjusting the product mix, and improving economic efficiency. Jilin's state-owned enterprises are faced with the common problems of sluggish transformation of the operating mechanism, outdated technology and equipment, low-level management, and heavy debts. In the past, we invigorated enterprises, to a very large extent, by granting them more autonomy, allowing them to share more profits, and implementing supporting policies. Following the in-depth development of the economic reform, the focus of enterprise reform has been shifted from policy adjustment characterized by tax reduction and more profit retention to system innovation aimed at establishing the modern enterprise system. It can be said that reform has entered a period for tackling the most difficult problems and the arduous task of establishing the modern enterprise system, with the focus on reform of property right, has been put forward. Under such conditions, the way for state-owned enterprises, especially competitive enterprises, to survive and develop lies in deepening reform, transforming the operating mechanism, and participating in the market competition by relying on their own efforts. Poor economic efficiency is the conspicuous contradiction restricting Jilin's faster industrial development. Our profit-tax rate of funds was 3.3 percentage points lower than the national average last year, and factors leading to enterprises' increase of expenses and decrease of profits will increase due to the implementation of the several major reform measures this year. To improve the economic returns of industry, we should strengthen enterprise management, tap the potential of enterprises, improve their quality, reduce their material consumption, and raise their efficiency. To promote the economy to a new height this year, the basic measure is still to invigorate enterprises. The activities of "transforming mechanism and improving management, skills, and efficiency" will facilitate enterprises' reform and development and speed up their march toward the market economy. We should pay close attention to this theme and use it to lead the various work of enterprises so as to fulfill the tasks for promoting industry to a new height this year. [passage omitted] 3. Go All Out To Organize Well the Industrial Production for the Second Quarter of This Year The second quarter is the golden season for industrial production. In view of the underproduction in the first quarter, the second quarter is the key to a better growth rate and efficiency in industrial production in the first half of this year. The general demand is to uplift spirit, organize meticulously, and mobilize forces from all quarters to promote industrial production. We should pay attention to funds, which constitute the key link; help the enterprises which have suspended production totally or partially, especially large- and medium-sized ones, start up production; explore and address the new contradictions and new problems we encounter in the process of deepening reform; and ensure a two-digit growth rate in industry in the first half of this year and better efficiency in second quarter than in the first quarter. First, we should adopt every means possible to collect and enliven the circulation of funds. Funds are the most conspicuous problem which arouses the strongest dissatisfaction. Whether the industrial production of the second quarter of this year can be promoted is decided, to a certain extent, by how the problem of funds is solved. The following are the current priorities. 1) We should pay attention to collecting funds. We should maintain the good trend in the increase of bank savings that emerged in the first quarter and strive to increase urban and rural savings deposits to overfulfill the task of increase in bank savings deposits for the first half of this year. Meanwhile, we should collect funds from various channels, such as inter-bank lending, introduction of foreign capital, issuance of bonds and securities, and other direct or indirect money-lending methods. We should further strengthen contacts with the head offices of the various specialized banks of the state and do more work to win state support. 2) We should grasp fund enlivenment. The target set in this regard is to have the industrial enterprises throughout the province release 1.2 billion yuan from enlivening the irrational occupation of three funds. Various cities, autonomous prefecture, and departments concerned should further break down the target; fulfill the target to every enterprise; and integrate fund enlivenment with bank loans. Loans lent to enterprises that have fulfilled the target will not be withdrawn and those that have not fulfilled the target will no longer receive new loans. Financial and banking departments should help enterprises handle their left-over debts, do a good job in adjusting the equipment set aside and conducting mortgage and auction for tangible assets, and actively clear up the idle accounts and loans as well as the "debt chain" among them so as to promote the fund circulation to enter a benign cycle. The provincial economic and trade commission and banks should cooperate each other, do a good job in fund management, optimize the orientation of investments, and ensure the limited funds to be put to best use. Second, a good job should be done in boosting the large enterprises that are influencing the province's economic situation. The state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises have occupied an important position in the national economy of the province and made important and great contributions over the past few years to the province's reform, development, and social stability. The rapid growth scored by the industrial enterprises throughout the province last year and the somewhat of improvement in their economic results chiefly depended on the impetus given by large enterprises, including the Changchun No.1 Motor Vehicle Plant and the Tonghua Iron and Steel Plant. The low growth of industrial production across the province in the first quarter this year was also, to a certain degree, due to the fluctuation of production in the large enterprises, also including the motor vehicle and iron and steel plants. By judging from the whole situation in the economic development strategy, Jilin Province requires the vigorous fostering of collectively-owned and township enterprises; "three types of foreign-funded" enterprises; and privately and individually-owned enterprises. These new growing points of the economy may upgrade the proportion of non-state-owned enterprises in the national economy. However, the decisive position occupied by large and medium-sized enterprises in economic development and the pillar industrial business formed by these enterprises, which is with the No.1 motor vehicle plant and the Jilin chemical industrial company as the mainstay, cannot be replaced by other economic sectors and industries. Therefore, successfully boosting the large and medium- sized enterprises always represents a focal point of the province's work. [passage omitted] Third, we should actively do a good job in encouraging the production-suspension-or-semi suspension enterprises to fully restore their production. Present prominent factors that are affecting the social stability include commodity prices and these production-suspension enterprises. The province's increased scale of retail prices scored in January this year was 10.7 percent calculated in term of new accounting standard and that in February was 17.3 percent. Although the increased scale of prices is lower than the national average level, it is still too high. By no means should we lower our guard in this regard. [passage omitted] In dealing with the production suspension or semi suspension of enterprises, we should have in principle every level be responsible for the work. Problems belonging to the level should be resolved by units at the level. According to the different conditions of these production-suspension enterprises, we should conduct classified guidance. As for the enterprises whose products enjoy good sale and that have encountered production suspension or semi suspension just because of fund shortage, we should help them restore their production. With the agreement of departments concerned, we may allow these production-suspension enterprises covered by the local tax revenue plan to be the first group of restoring their production by postponing paying the taxes of various categories. Banks should allow these enterprises to preferentially use the debt and loan repayments to buy raw materials and to retroactively pay their staff members and workers. Governments at all levels should raise some funds specially for these production-suspension enterprises to restore their production. They should integrate their investments with the output of enterprises and use the funds by circulating them. These production-suspension enterprises should extensively open more avenues, organize their staff members and workers to provide for and help themselves by engaging in production, and find out a way out by opening markets. The leading personnel of these enterprises should set an example in work and lead their staff members and workers to wage arduous struggles and to commonly tide over the difficulty. The leading cadres of all money-losing enterprises are not allowed to buy sedans and marketable houses. [passage omitted]
