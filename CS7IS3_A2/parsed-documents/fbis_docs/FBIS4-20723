'Awwad, Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, Zuhayr al-Rayyis, Wahid al-Hamdulillah, and 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi; place and date not given; by 'Ali Salih: "Arms Phenomenon in Occupied Territories Greatly Blown Out of Proportion"] [Text] Even if the spread of weapons in the occupied territories, specifically in Gaza and Jericho, is not as great as newspaper reports claim, it has become a phenomenon that demands attention, study, and debate, as well as treatment. The importance and gravity of the situation lies in the upcoming Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, and the implementation of autonomy in those two areas, with the start of the five-year transitional phase, according to the Declaration of Principles (the Oslo Accord) signed in the White House garden last 13 September. Its importance and gravity also lie in the fact that some people anticipate that it could--if it continues--lead to a civil war along the lines of what happened in Afghanistan or Somalia. There may be a good deal of exaggeration in such expectations, as many Palestinians say, both supporters and opponents of the accord. They attribute it to various causes: the nature of the Palestinian people, their level of political awareness, and the fact that the Israelis will not be withdrawing completely from the occupied territories. Hence the spread of this quantity of arms (between 10-15,000 weapons, according to one Fatah official), especially in the Gaza Strip. The fact that these arms are reaching the hands of citizens, wary of the future and afraid of the unknown, creates fear and unease among those who hope that this will not lead to a civil war, or to armed clashes between factions--or even inside a single organization, to settle old scores. They could be used for revenge, armed robbery, and theft, which have recently been on the rise. And then there is Israel's attempt to exploit the situation, stir up trouble, and use their agents to foil the autonomy experiment. In order to shed some light on this phenomenon, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT asked Palestinian officials from six major Palestinian factions and parties, plus some independent figures, a number of questions about the extent of the spread of arms, the reasons, motives, consequences, the sources of the arms, and the role of the Palestinian police in containing them. What follows are the replies AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT received from Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir), mobilization and organization officer and Fatah Central Committee member in Tunis; Hamas's Amman representative, Muhammad al-Nazal; Dawud al-Tilhami, member of the politburo of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Damascus; Ghassan al-Khatib, a senior official in the People's Party in Jerusalem; 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, member of the politburo of the Democratic Palestinian Union (DPU) in Jerusalem; Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Damascus; Dr. 'Awwad Muhammad 'Awwad, a doctor by profession and well-known national figure, from Tulkarm; Bethlehem Mayor Ilyas Frayj (Independent); Wahid al-Hamdulillah, a well-known independent national figure, and a member of the Board of Regents of al-Najah University in Nablus; and Zuhayr al-Rayyis, a writer, journalist, nationally known figure, and prominent personality in the Gaza Strip. [Salih] How widespread are weapons in the occupied territories? Is it as great as the newspapers say? [Abu Mahir (Fatah)] There are an estimated 10-15,000 weapons--and that could rise--mostly in the Gaza Strip. [Al-Nazal (Hamas)] I doubt that there is any great spread of arms. It is extremely difficult to obtain arms to fight the occupation, and this is a major obstacle. We have reports that confirm that the allegations about the abnormal spread of arms are untrue. [Al-Khatib (People's Party)] There is a widespread, large-scale spread of arms, particularly in the Gaza Strip, and in the occupied territories as a whole. It is not only a problem of the extent of the spread, but of the lack of any control over who is stockpiling these arms. Of course, some political organizations obtain arms, but there are also other groups and individuals that get them if they can afford them. [Dawud al-Tilhami (DFLP)] Perhaps there is some exaggeration about the volume of arms in the occupied territories, especially in Gaza. This exaggeration is intended to create a climate of fear for the residents of Gaza at a time when the occupation forces are preparing to pull out of the cities and camps and redeploy in the sites specified in the Cairo accord between 'Arafat and Peres. [Al-Shu'aybi (DPU)] The spread of arms is relative to how it was in the past. What is remarkable is the transformation in this phenomenon now, to a virtually public one, especially in the Gaza Strip. One cannot speak of this type of phenomenon existing in the West Bank. But there is a noticeable increase in the buying and selling of arms, and a boldness in carrying them. [Al-Shaqaqi (Islamic Jihad)] The spread of arms is aimed at the Gaza Strip and to a lesser extent the city of Nablus in the West Bank. This is not new, nor is it on the scale alleged by newspaper reports. What is new is the openness with which people are bearing arms, especially Fatah members. This comes after the Oslo accord, whereby the authorities no longer hold Fatah people responsible specifically for bearing arms. Some families historically known for owning arms, for trading in them, or other purposes, are no longer afraid to display them. Most of them are small, light arms; and, by our estimate, do not exceed the volume of the arms in the hands of all the factions and families, by more than a few hundred weapons. [Dr. 'Awwad (Independent)] There are several reasons why arms are more widespread in the Gaza Strip than in the West Bank, but there are no precise estimates about this. Regarding the spread of arms in Gaza in particular, it is now said jokingly that arms are sold by the bushel, like fruits and vegetables in Gaza. But the truth is that there is a noticeable rise in armament, with hundreds of guns like Kalashnikovs, Uzis, and pistols reaching Gaza. [Frayj (Independent)] There is no accurate information about the volume of arms. Talk on this subject is exaggerated. [Al-Hamdulillah (Independent)] Where there is smoke, there is fire. Guns have begun to appear openly, especially in the Gaza Strip, and much more widely than was normal in the years of intifadah. But the reports being circulated are not accurate, and do not present a reliable or realistic picture. [Al-Rayyis (Independent)] This phenomenon has become clear and well known; it has been acknowledged by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in official reports. I believe that the quantities of arms in people's hands are increasing day by day despite the continuous warnings of the danger of this phenomenon and the negative effects it might have, especially in Gaza. [Salih] The causes and motives behind the spread of arms--do the factions have a hand in this? [Abu Mahir] There are many and varied reasons for this phenomenon, which I would summarize as follows: First: the occupation, and its continued presence during the transitional period, and our people's belief that there will be no withdrawal unless the enemy is forced out, by force of arms. Second: the sense of a need for protection from settler attacks and their crimes, which now occur under the very noses of the occupation soldiers. Third: the attacks of armed gangs on people and property, and crimes committed by people claiming to belong to Palestinian factions. Fourth: the spread of rumors about interfactional fighting once the transitional period begins. [Al-Nazal] We believe that the most important reason for the purchase of arms is confrontation with the occupation authorities. And I repeat that there is no phenomenon of widespread arms. [Al-Khatib] There are a number of reasons for the spread of arms. First, their availibility from Israeli sources, through the black market, and the underworld (gangs) in Israel. Second, citizens' feelings of insecurity and unease. Third, the uncertain future. Fourth, the existence of rivalry, at times, among political factions. Fifth, Israel's reduction of monitoring and punishment of people transporting arms or possessing them, especially in Gaza. [Al-Tilhami] Naturally, a large number of intifadah fighters had arms, especially in the last three years. This was a distinct increase, to confront the occupation. In recent months, especially after the Oslo accord, there have been more guns in Gaza, both smuggled in from Sinai or bought from arms dealing networks in the occupied territories. Of course, in light of the mounting chaos in Gaza, it was natural for organized Palestinian forces to provide the arms necessary for self-defense against occupation attacks, settler operations, or occupation agents. We do not rule out that the Israelis, using their access to arms-dealing networks, might be trying to turn political disputes among the factions into armed clashes. This is something we seriously and firmly warn against. [Al-Shu'aybi] Historically, the national movement has sought to obtain arms to use them in militant operations. They used to smuggle the arms in. In recent years, faced with the difficulty of smuggling, they have resorted to obtaining arms from Israeli dealers in the underworld. They get arms stolen from Israeli camps. After the Madrid negotiations and Israel's willingness to withdraw from Gaza, the Israeli fist began to get lax in its rule and control, and this phenomenon encouraged a large number of people to buy arms and start dealing in them. The state of intensified polarization among factions after Madrid and Oslo aided the wish to strengthen every faction, and very openly, in society, to increase the trafficking, and sometimes the transport of arms stocks in the West Bank and Gaza directly to the market for sale. They took advantage of the high prices that resulted from the worsened financial conditions of many social factions and faction members, after the PLO cut off their financial aid. [Al-Shaqaqi] The enemy is helping Fatah to get weapons for its members, since these arms no longer pose a threat to [Israel]. Some Fatah elements have begun to traffic in arms. There are other fighting factions who want to buy arms, either to fight the enemy or for self-defense. This is rather limited, because arms are expensive and there is a limited supply. On the other hand, some families have begun to fear for the lives of their children in the coming phase, about which nothing is clear. So they want to protect themselves. Some of these families previously owned guns, which they are now bringing out to use in familial or organizational problems. [Dr. 'Awwad] I think the main reason for the spread of arms is to settle scores, for self-defense, and the political struggle within some of the major groups in the PLO. There are scores to be settled among families and organizations, in addition to fear and the wish for self-defense: fear of a security vacuum when the withdrawal begins. These reasons have led some persons to leave Gaza for Egypt until things settle down. [Frayj] I think it unlikely that the factions have any desire to see arms spread. [Al-Hamdulillah] We in the occupied territories accuse the occupation authorities and their intelligence service of playing a secret and dangerous role in the spread of this phenomenon. These authorities have recently begun to arm their collaborators more openly, and on a wider scale, to defend themselves, instead of moving them behind the so-called Green Line [pre-1967 border]. There is no doubt, however, that the "transfer of authority," which has not yet occurred, may be seen as one of the major causes for this phenomenon. Add to that the family feuds, the assassination of collaborators, and the rivalry over power centers. All these have made some people keep guns handy for self-defense. Some others, of course, carry guns to combat the occupation. In short, the policy of the occupation authorities, and the vacuum created after the withdrawal, could result, some believe, in an interest in guns stemming from fear of the future. I personally do not think that the factions have any hand in this. [Al-Rayyis] The diverse factions have their own reasons and motives that compel them to stockpile what arms they can gather. This is in spite of the constant assurances that there will be no fighting among brothers, and that the government will be reasonable and logical. But what makes the situation dangerous is the spread of arms among ordinary citizens, who imagine that these weapons are necessary to safeguard their security and safety, and to confront the unknown. [Salih] What are the sources of these arms? [Abu Mahir] Recently, most arms have come from southern Lebanon via arms dealers, and through collusion with occupation officers. [Al-Nazal] There are numerous sources for obtaining arms. It varies from faction to faction. Hamas's principal source of arms is the occupation soldiers killed by al-Qassam heroes, who take their guns. [Al-Khatib] Israel is encouraging this phenomenon. [Al-Tilhami] As I mentioned previously, most of these arms come from arms dealers and even the occupation soldiers, some of whom sell arms for material gain. There is a certain quantity of arms smuggled in from Sinai. [Al-Shu'aybi] In the Likud era, Israel made it easy for some of the groups opposed to PLO factions to obtain small arms, specifically in the Gaza Strip. The negotiations encouraged Palestinians and Israelis to start trafficking in arms across the Egyptian border. [Al-Shaqaqi] We believe that the phenomenon is a limited one. It is not as newspaper reports portray it. The supply is meager, and the high prices are staggering. The cost of a gun, since the signing of the Oslo Accord, has not gone down one cent. The price of a revolver is the equivalent of $3,000. A Kalashnikov is $7,000, and a U.S.-made M-16 is at least $10,000. The sources of the guns are as follows: 1. The theft of Israeli-owned cars, especially in the territories occupied since 1948; most of these cars have guns inside. 2. Arms smuggling over the Egyptian border. 3. Drug dealers who trade drugs to Israeli soldiers in exchange for their guns, which are then sold. 4. Some bedouin in Beersheba have family connections in Gaza and bring arms to their relatives. 5. Arms stolen from Israeli army stockpiles or settlements. 6. Arms stored since 1967, which are reappearing now. These are Egyptian guns whose owners want to sell them and profit from high prices before it is too late and they lose their value. [Dr. 'Awwad] There are a number of sources. There are Israeli arms dealers, well known to the Israeli authorities. There are arms stockpiles collected over the long years for use at the proper time, which for some has now arrived. And there are arms smuggled over the Egyptian border. [Frayj] If the reports are true, the people fueling this phenomenon are the enemies of the Palestinian people. [Al-Hamdulillah] In my view, the sources are restricted to the following: the remainder of the arms left behind by the Arab armies in the 1967 war; guns smuggled over the borders of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan; and Israeli sources, including the arming of collaborators. [Al-Rayyis] Recently a gun-toting Palestinian youth was shown on Israeli television answering a reporter's question by saying that, since it is now possible to move people and cars in and out of Gaza, it isn't difficult to take in a little gun that could easily be hidden, from any source, and by any means. It may be said that the arms sources are the Israeli intelligence services, Israeli soldiers, the bedouin, and smuggling from Jordan and the Sinai. [Salih] What might be the outcome of this spread of arms? Could it reach the point of civil war, as some reports say? [Abu Mahir] Apart from the motives of those who promote guns, or facilitate their supply to citizens, these arms are patriotic and Palestinian when possessed by our people. They will eventually be used against the soldiers of the occupation and the settlers. There is no danger of gun ownership leading to a civil war, because a gun by itself is not a condition for civil war, which has its own causes, terms, and motives. These factors and conditions do not exist. There are no ethnic divisions or sectarian conflicts among our people. Guns in our people's hands frighten the occupation soldiers, settlers, and agents, and give citizens self-confidence, especially when security is lacking, as is the case before the transfer of power to the Palestinians. [Al-Nazal] I do not believe that combatants bearing arms against the occupation will lead to civil war. I believe in the good sense and ethics of our people in managing and solving its problems. Times past are the best proof of this. The strange thing here is that one political movement--in support of the Oslo and Cairo accords, that is, 'Arafat's group--is behind the allegations about the abnormal spread of arms, and its being blown out of proportion in the media. We have not heard anything about there being something scary about the spread of arms from any opposition faction. In addition, exaggeration is part of the campaign 'Arafat's group is waging to get wanted persons to turn themselves in, along with their guns, to the occupation authorities. [Al-Khatib] It is to be feared that this phenomenon may increase the chances that people will resort to arms in any political or tribal, or even personal, dispute. There is also the danger of the spread of vendettas and vengeance, especially given the assassination of those accused of collaborating, without any trial or investigation of the charge, in most cases. Finally, there is the likelihood that it will be difficult to control the situation when the PLO and the Palestinian police go into Gaza. I believe that this is Israel's goal in encouraging this phenomenon. [Al-Tilhami] We do not rule out that the occupation authorities might intend to "Somaliaize" or "Afghanize" the Gaza Strip, and create violent anarchy and civil war in order to keep Palestinian forces opposed to the Oslo-Cairo accords from continuing their resistance to the occupation. It would also weaken the uprising against the occupation and give the impression that the Palestinian people are unable to handle their political relations and disputes in a rational manner. For our part, we will foil the Israeli plans and do everything in our power to prevent a civil war. We will keep all guns pointed at the enemy, and keep political disputes within limits, giving the masses a voice in them. [Al-Shu'aybi] The spread of this phenomenon, apart from its direct aims, behind which some of the Israeli security services may lurk, is an attempt to position its aims and outcomes negatively, to hasten the outbreak of internecine fighting, and create an unstable social situation, preventing the natural transformation of Palestinian society into an independent state, and to push the people into accepting any solution, even an annexationist one. Particularly as the trial run will be in Gaza and can affect the people's position in the West Bank later, and in the diaspora too. It would be hard for a civil war to break out between factions, because public opinion is against it. But it would be possible to cause family conflicts and at times internal fighting, within a single faction. [Al-Shaqaqi] The existence of a few hundred guns cannot ignite a civil war. If families feel that their children are safe, there will be no danger in these families owning guns. But we must consider that some of these families have members with differing organizational loyalties and affiliations. This is especially true with families loyal to the opposition because of their members' loyalties. Here the autonomous authority comes into play. If it behaves as an oppressive power, as many fear it will, then the problems will come to a head--but I rule out civil war. There is another point I want to explain, that the Israeli army has acted officially so far to spread arms; yes, it has eased up a little in some areas. But not to the point of being responsible for spreading the phenomenon. If that were the case, there would be more guns and they would be cheaper. I am afraid that the Isareli army's accusation is the prelude to repression of those who are bearing arms against the enemy today, and buy them with their food money, or their children's, to defend their country and their land. [Dr. 'Awwad] Armed struggles and internal purges within major organizations have been attributed to this phenomenon. This phenomenon will serve to increase the opposition's armed operations against settlers and the Israeli army when the withdrawal begins. The spread of arms will escalate the armed struggle between supporters and opponents of the settlement. These confrontations could escalate into a civil war in the event the Palestinian authority is unable to create political channels for solving disputes by democratic means. [Frayj] It makes no sense whatsoever for Palestinian factions to ignite a civil war. [Al-Hamdulillah] I would like to say, frankly and with certainty, that we do not sense or see any competition or rivalry in the occupied territories, or any struggle to obtain arms. So I do not agree with those who are afraid that this will lead to a civil war. Everyone knows that the enemy is present there, and not moving. I do not believe that the Palestinian sides will lose their reason or rationality. This does not mean that there may not be some undesirable and unacceptable, or even dangerous practices and violations. But the occupiers' desire for Palestinian infighting and civil war will not be satisfied. Our people, suffering under occupation, and following the course of events silently, will not forgive those who harm or squander their rights. [Al-Rayyis] The spread of arms is pushing events to the edge of the abyss, and raises doubts about all the assurances about good intentions and the genuine desire for a solution to conflicts through dialogue, with higher interests prevailing. After that, the discipline we need becomes difficult and will require redoubled efforts on the part of everyone who wants to avoid collapse and deterioration. [Salih] And the role of the Palestinian police in containing this phenomenon when they take over security affairs, after the evacuation of the Israeli forces from the occupied territories? [Abu Mahir] Unquestionably, when the Palestinian police take up their duties, they will have an important and basic role in creating an atmosphere of security and stability among citizens. They must also build national unity, provide social justice, and establish democracy in society and its institutions, and enforce the law among the people. These factors will lead to an atmosphere of self-control among citizens, helping them to control and regulate arms, preventing infractions, and turning the arms phenomenon into a positive factor helping the authority to establish security and deter violence when Israel withdraws its army and settlers from the occupied areas. [Al-Nazal] We are afraid the 'Arafat group's talk about the arms phenomenon is just a prelude to the repression of opponents and disarming them to prevent them from fighting the enemy, in accordance with the promises they made Israel about ceasing military operations. I believe that this is the real motivation behind this overblown campaign warning of so-called dangers. [Al-Khatib] When the Palestinian police assume their security responsibilities, they should take arms away from individuals and groups, excepting those who have official tasks assigned them by the government or the security service. There must be strict controls on the transport and possession of arms. Most importantly, a feeling of security must be created for citizens, to put an end to any motive for possessing or using arms. [Al-Tilhami] We are afraid, after reading the provisions of the Oslo and Cairo accords, that the so-called Palestinian police will be entrusted with the mission of repressing the intifadah and the people. This is something the occupation forces have been unable to do for the more than six years of the intifadah. We do not rule out that the promotion of anarchy, criminality, theft, and the terrorizing of citizens in Gaza might open the way for the Palestinian group that signed the Oslo and Cairo accords to be put to the test, controlling the intifadah and repressing its people. This is what makes us fear the content and provisions of those two accords, to which we are totally opposed. They do not ensure withdrawal from the occupied territories. So we will work with all opposition patriotic and Islamic forces, groups, and persons, including members of Fatah and the Palestine People's Party who oppose the Cairo accord, in order to reject this mission entrusted to the so-called Palestinian police. We reject the transformation of this body into an instrument of oppression against the people, to serve a plan to repress the intifadah and provide security for the occupation, instad of eradicating it. [Al-Shu'aybi] The Palestinian police, in the context of public law and order, will limit the consequences of arms purchasing, even if they cannot put an end to arms purchasing itself. [Dr. 'Awwad] The Palestinian authority will not succeed in collecting arms from organizations and the populace, because that would lead to a clash that would not be in its interest. Plus the fact that disarming the opposition would be seen as cooperation and collusion with Israel. That would certainly lead to an open confrontation between the authority and opposition forces. [Frayj] [He did not respond to this question.] [Al-Hamdulillah] This question would be better put to the leadership that concluded the Oslo accord with Israel, and subsequently the Cairo accord, on forming the Palestinian police and the missions with which the Israelis entrusted them. So excuse me for not answering this question. [Al-Rayyis] The ordinary Palestinians look very positively upon the Palestinian police and have great hope in it. They have confidence that they will represent discipline, the law, and human rights, and with the same strength and to the same degree, they see them as a force for maintaining public order, and not just the system of autonomy.
