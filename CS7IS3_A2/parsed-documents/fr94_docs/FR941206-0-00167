Surface Impoundment Standards The surface impoundment standards establish the requirements for surface impoundments using air emission controls to comply with the general standards of the rule. No air emission controls are required under the subpart CC standards for a surface impoundment in which all hazardous waste placed in the unit has been treated to remove or destroy organics in accordance with the requirements specified in the general standards. Also, air emission controls are not required for a surface impoundment in which biological treatment of a hazardous waste is performed under the same conditions specified in the rule for tanks. The surface impoundment standards specify that the owner or operator install and operate on each affected surface impoundment a cover (e.g., air-supported structure) that is connected through a closed-vent system to a control device. Under the subpart CC standards, an owner or operator is allowed to use a floating membrane cover (without any additional controls) for affected surface impoundments under certain conditions specified in the rule. The requirements under the subpart CC standards for surface impoundment air emission control equipment are consistent with the requirements for tanks. 6. Container Standards The container standards establish the requirements for affected containers (containers with a design capacity greater than or equal to 0.1 m3) using air emission controls to comply with the general standards of the rule. No air emission controls are required by the subpart CC standards for any container with a design capacity less than 0.1 m3 regardless of the volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste placed in the container. For affected containers used for storage, treatment, or handling of hazardous waste, the owner or operator is required to use either: (1) A container that is equipped with a vapor leak-tight cover; (2) a container having a design capacity less than or equal to 0.46 m3 (approximately 119 gallons) that is equipped with a cover and complies with all applicable U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations on packaging hazardous waste for transport under 49 CFR part 178; or (3) a container that is attached to or forms a part of any truck, trailer, or railcar and that has been demonstrated within the preceding 12 months to be organic vapor tight in accordance with the procedure specified in Method 27. For a container in which treatment of hazardous waste is performed, the owner or operator is required to place the container inside an enclosure that is connected through a closed-vent system to a control device at all times that the container is completely or partially uncovered during the treatment operation. Transfer of hazardous waste by pumping into a container having a design capacity greater than 0.46 m3 is required to be performed using submerged fill loading. The requirement for use of leak-tight covers on containers is established by testing the cover for no detectable organic emissions as determined using Method 21 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The test is performed when all openings in the cover (e.g., lids, bungs, hatches, and sampling ports) are secured in a closed, sealed position. Under certain circumstances, the EPA has determined that a cover other than a rigid, gasketed cover can be used on a container that will meet the requirement for no detectable organic emissions. For example, the EPA has concluded that use of a tarpaulin with a vapor-suppressing foam is an acceptable cover for roll-off boxes used for short-term storage (e.g., less than 30 days) of bulk solid materials (refer to RCRA docket entry number F&hyph;94&hyph;CESP&hyph;S00507 for specific conditions under which this type of cover is acceptable). As an alternative to using covers tested for no detectable organic emissions on drums and other containers with a design capacity less than or equal to 0.46 m3, the subpart CC standards allow an owner or operator to place the hazardous waste in drums meeting the DOT specifications and testing requirements under 49 CFR part 178. When a container meeting these DOT regulations is used, no leak detection monitoring nor recordkeeping for the container is required by the subpart CC standards. It is important to note that none of the exceptions to the 49 CFR part 178 regulations other than the exception for lab packs used for combination packagings as specified in 49 CFR 173.12(b) apply to a container for the purpose of complying with the subpart CC standards. The subpart CC container standards allow use of a tank truck or tank railcar that has been tested for organic vapor tightness within the preceding 12 months in accordance with the requirements of Method 27. This method is a pressure test procedure originally developed by the EPA for determining the vapor-leak tightness of a tank truck into which gasoline is placed. The EPA considers Method 27 also appropriate for determining vapor-leak tightness of tank trucks and railcars into which hazardous wastes containing volatile organics are placed. No Method 21 leak monitoring or recordkeeping is required for tank trucks or tank railcars complying with this provision of the rule. When it is necessary for a container to be open during certain treatment processes, the subpart CC standards require the container to be located in an enclosure connected to a closed-vent system with control device. The enclosure must be designed to operate with sufficient airflow into the structure to capture all organic vapors vented from the container and route the vapors through the closed-vent system to the control device. The enclosure may have permanent or temporary openings to allow worker access, passage of containers through the enclosure by conveyor or other mechanical means, entry of permanent mechanical or electrical equipment, or to direct airflow into the enclosure. Whenever an open container is placed inside the enclosure, the pressure drop across each opening in the enclosure is to be maintained at a pressure below atmospheric pressure such that no organic vapors released from the container can exit the enclosure through the opening. Finally, the container standards include the same unit and control equipment safety venting provisions allowed under the subpart CC standards for tanks and surface impoundments. 7. Closed-Vent System and Control Device Requirements The design and operating requirements under the final subpart CC standards for a closed-vent system with control device are the same as those already applicable to TSDF owners and operators under subpart AA in 40 CFR parts 264 and 265 with one exception. The subpart CC standards require that each control device achieve at least a 95 percent reduction in the total organic content of the vapor stream vented to the device or, in the case of an enclosed combustion device, a reduction of the total organic content of the vapor stream to a level less than or equal to 20 ppmw on a dry basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen. The standards do not require the use of any specific type of equipment or add-on control device. The standards allow the owner or operator the flexibility of choosing the control device best suited for a control application based on the characteristics of the particular organic vapor stream. Furthermore, the subpart CC standards do not require that each tank, surface impoundment, and container be vented to a separate control device dedicated to that particular unit. Vent streams from several units can be combined and discharged to a single control device that achieves the required level of performance.
