The flight programme for the last two days included geophysical and astrophysical investigations as well as routine servicing of some systems of the station and modules. Using videospectrometric equipment installed on the stabilised platform of the Kvant-2 module, the cosmonauts made several snapshots of the Earth's surface. The main tasks of this work were investigations of the ecological situation in major industrial hubs and areas of oil and gas production. To study further mechanisms of generation of elementary high- energy charged particles in the earth's radiation belts and near- earch space, the crew fulfilled several experiments with the use of a magnetic spectrometer. Under a medical checkup plan, the ship commander and flight engineer will undergo an echographic investigation of the cardiovascular system on Friday under the supervision of the crew doctor. The station's flight continues under a preset programme. The cosmonauts are healthy and feel well.
