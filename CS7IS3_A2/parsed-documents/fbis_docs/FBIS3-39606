The negotiations are said to be in a relatively advanced stage, but for the time being nothing is known about the price to be paid by the Philippine Army. When the Belgian Government agreed its medium-term purchasing plan for the Defense Ministry in the middle of last year, it immediately gave the green light for the sale of 20 Mirage-5 aircraft. Sabca [Belgian Aeronautic Construction Company] was instructed to seek buyers. The aircraft had just been refitted when the government decided to slim down the Air Force. At present they are deployed at the Weelde airbase. Before long the base will also station a number of F-16's which are also for sale. A number of countries have been contacted for this sale including Pakistan and NATO ally Greece. For the time being there has been no result here either.
