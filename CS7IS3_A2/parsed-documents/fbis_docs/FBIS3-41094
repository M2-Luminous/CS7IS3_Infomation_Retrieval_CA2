[passage omitted] [Begin Francisco de Vargas, president of the Chamber of Deputies, member of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party recording] I believe that President Juan Carlos Wasmosy initially agreed with the coming of the mission, but after pressure from military leaders who demanded Paraguayan participation, which was not granted, this project was obstructed. This is the information I have. I hope the permit will be granted to allow them to come. I do not see any unsuitability. It is said that the mission's hidden objective would have been the struggle against drug trafficking. If this is the case, I welcome it. [end recording]
