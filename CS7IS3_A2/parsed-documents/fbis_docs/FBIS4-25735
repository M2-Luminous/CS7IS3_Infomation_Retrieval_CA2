This Chinese saying shows how important training qualified personnel is. The key to training qualified personnel lies in developing education. With this issue in mind, this station reporter recently interviewed provincial party committee Secretary Yan Haiwang on what measures Gansu will take to speed up the province's educational development in the years ahead and what blueprints Gansu has drawn up to this end. [Reporter] Will you please tell me what Gansu has done with respect to implementing "The PRC Education Reform and Development Program" and "The PRC Teachers Law" in recent years? [Yan Haiwang] The provincial party committee and people's government have all along attached great importance to and vigorously implemented "The PRC Education Reform and Development Program." Gansu Province held a provincial education work conference in 1993, which drew up the province's "Opinions on Implementing and Instituting `The PRC Education Reform and Development Program'." The conference stated in no uncertain terms that it is imperative to attach strategic priority to the province's educational development and called for deepening education system reform and rapidly training all sorts of qualified personnel required by the province's economic growth. As a result, we have further increased input into education. We have also pledged to enable educational funds to account for about 4 percent of the province's gross national product, keep annual increase of the province's educational funds at and above 13 percent, and adopt practical measures to annually increase education-related operational funds in the Nineth Five-Year Plan. Thus we are confident that we will implement to the letter "The PRC Education Reform and Development Program" and "The PRC Teachers Law" thanks to such a correct guiding ideology and the aforementioned policies and measures. Since last year's conference, party committees, people's governments, and education departments at all levels across the province have conscientiously implemented "The PRC Education Reform and Development Program" and "The PRC Teachers Law" in light of actual local conditions, actively pushed forward educational reform and development with some initial successes, and mainly attained the following two goals: First, we have raised educational funds through a variety of channels despite a flat budget. We raised educational input to a certain extent in 1993 in comparison with the previous year with the result that the province's educational funds rose to 1.496 billion yuan, of which budgeted educational funds accounted for 0.959 billion yuan, up by 10 percent over the previous year. Moreover, the province's per capita educational funds rose to 277.18 yuan, up by 5.14 percent over the previous year. Second, we have raised wages of primary and secondary schools teachers, repayed more than 27.5 million yuan in wages owed to those teachers, and basically guaranteed monthly wages for primary and secondary schools teachers. Implementation of "The PRC Education Reform and Development Program," "The PRC Teachers Law," and Gansu's "Opinions on Implementing and Instituting `The PRC Education Reform and Development Program'" has given a powerful impetus to the province's overall educational development. As a result, some 54 counties in the province have implemented compulsory primary education for all school-age children while some 14 counties in the province have implemented compulsory secondary education for all school-age children. At present, some 95.8 percent of the province's school-age children are going to schools. The province's dropout rate has also declined. The ordinary college and technical secondary education are now available to more people in the province. The province's adult, vocational, and in-service education and post-related training have also seen rapid growth. A total of 45 counties in the province have eradicated illiteracy. The illiteracy rate among the province's young and middle-aged people has dropped to lower than 20 percent. Nevertheless, the province's overall educational standard is far below the country's average. The province's educational development is still plagued by a series of problems, including contradictions between educational development and economic construction, and between educational scale and development speed, on the one hand, and insufficient educational funds on the other, and so on. These problems are unlikely to be solved in the foreseeable future. [Reporter] Will you please tell me what specific measures Gansu will take to press ahead with educational reform and development? [Yan] In accordance with requirements spelled out by the State Council, the Eighth Gansu Provincial CPC Congress held in 1993 put forth a basic train of thought and some basic tasks for Gansu's educational reform and development. The basic train of thought is: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, Gansu should comprehensively implement "The PRC Education Reform and Development Program"; persistently attach strategic priority to educational development; energetically develop elementary education by implementing a nine-year compulsory education system across the province; continually develop vocational, technical, adult, and college education; further develop the province's educational cause in terms of quantity and quality; strive to raise the province's overall educational standard onto a new stage in order to make, by the end of this century, compulsory primary education basically available to all school-age children and compulsory junior secondary education available to about 70 percent of the province's rural population; basically eradicate illiteracy among the majority of young and middle-aged people in the province; by the end of this century, enable all types of technical secondary schools to enroll the same number of students as ordinary senior secondary schools in the province do, and enable one or two higher learning institutions and more than 10 specialities to meet requirements laid down in the state "211 Project." [Reporter] What specific steps will Gansu take to make educational reform and development successful? [Yan Haiwang] Generally speaking, we're going to take the following four specific steps: 1. In order to attach strategic priority to educational development, leaders at all levels across the province should fully understand education's strategic position and role and take education as a key link in the province's overall work. To this end, principal leaders at all levels across the province should personally take charge of educational development while members of leading bodies at all levels across the province should also show concern for educational development. We should constantly study all major issues relating to educational reform and development, attach great importance to and support educational work, help overcome practical difficulties and specific problems in the course of educational development, and strive to successfully accomplish educational tasks. 2. We should make continued efforts to deepen education system reform. To this end, we should mainly try to develop elementary education by relying on local resources at the moment. We should encourage various undertakings, enterprises, and individuals to participate in running all types of educational institutions. We should strive to develop college education by relying on the government support and gradually encourage people of all walks of life in the society to contribute to college educational development. We should strive to develop technical secondary and adult education by relying on concerted efforts on the part of relevant trades, professions, undertakings, and enterprises as well as the people of all walks of life in the society. Moreover, we should make energetic efforts to push ahead with school management and enrollment and graduate job assignment system reform, thereby deepening the province's overall educational reform. 3. We should strive to improve the province's educational quality. To this end, we should step up basic knowledge, theory, and skills training among students so they will be able to ethically, intellectually, physically, and aesthetically improve themselves, do more practical work, and become socialist builders and successors with ideals, moral integrity, cultural accomplishments, and a sense of discipline, 4. We should make every possible endeavor to provide educational development with necessary assistance, further raise educational input, secure a proper increase in educational funds year in year out, allocate a certain amount of funds for scientific research and educational development and for improving housing conditions of teachers as well, and increase wages of teachers. To this end, we should first increase wages of primary and secondary schools teachers by 10 percent on the basis of the newly promulgated professional and technical wages scale, continue to pay seniority subsidies to teachers in charge of individual classes, increase as of 1 October, 1993, monthly wages of non-government schools teachers by 35 yuan, cultivate a fine general mood of society in which teachers and education will be respected and highly valued, as well as urge and encourage social organizations and individuals to donate cash to schools or raise funds for schools. In a nutshell, we should make every effort to provide education with excellent conditions and a favorable environment.
