FR940304-0-00052 FR940304-0-00016 Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not require any information collection activities and therefore no approval is necessary under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) requires the Federal Government to anticipate and reduce the impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small businesses.
