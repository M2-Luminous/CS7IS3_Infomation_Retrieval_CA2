The fighting, which was the heaviest during the last fortnight, continued throughout the night and gradually died down in the morning. The two sides used heavy artillery and rocket fire on each other's positions in Bala Hesar, (Tapamaranjan), (Tivihilloc), Takatu, and (Omryan). The presidential palace in Kabul and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekymatyar's headquarters in Chahar Asiab also came under heavy fire. Meanwhile, efforts are continuing to search new avenues for peace in Kabul. Iranian officials have begun distribution of relief supplies to Afghan refugees in tents in Jalalabad. The supplies were flown to Peshawar and were taken to Jalalabad by road. The head of Iran's aid operation for Afghanistan said his country also plans to give supplies to Kabul once the city's airport is reopened to cargo planes.
