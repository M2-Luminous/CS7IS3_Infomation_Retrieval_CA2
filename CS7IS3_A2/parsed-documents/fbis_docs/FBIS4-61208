Essentially before the signing of the treaty Russia was once again confronted with a choice: Either switch to resolving all political, economic, and class contradictions through talks and compromise, or continue the war until victory. Until one side had totally annihilated its political opponents. Today it is becoming quite clear that what transpired in October of last year in Moscow was a sharp skirmish between forces seeking to destroy their opponent and forces seeking accord. As we can see, those who were victorious in October have used their victory not in order to annihilate their opponents but in order to achieve accord. The treaty's critics declare that it has been imposed from a position of strength, concerns only the elite, and originated in the Kremlin, not in the midst of the people's masses. This is fundamentally true. But it should not be forgotten that, first, it is a matter of the constitutional strength of the president and the executive branch, and, second, the political elites that took part in signing the treaty reflect precisely the sentiments of the people's masses. Scarcely anyone would dispute Russian society's desire for peace and accord inside the country. Ultimately what matters is not the form of the treaty. What matters is the fact that at long last the idea of a quest for dialogue between different political forces has met with broad support. Such documents, even if they outwardly appear superficial, are entirely capable of changing the face of society and helping it to embark firmly on the road of democratic development and rid itself once and for all of the threat of dictatorship which constantly hangs over it (as confirmed by A. Rutskoy's recent statement regarding his intention to create a social-patriotic, essentially paramilitary party in order to seize power). And the president of Russia, as the initiator of the conclusion of the treaty, here played what is for him a not altogether common constructive role. At the same time, paradoxical though it may appear, the treaty on accord has split the Russian political elite into two camps -- signatories and nonsignatories. This is primarily testimony to the strict pragmatism of both camps. Characteristically, the killing of State Duma Deputy A. Aydzerdzis on the eve of the signing of the treaty, contrary to many expectations, did not wreck the signing ceremony. Incidentally, the same goes for the president's refusal to replace the minister of internal affairs. If you analyze the deep-seated essence of the treaty, you may come to the conclusion that it offers essentially a mechanism for the preservation, redistribution, and transfer of power in Russia. It is easy to see that the overwhelming majority of signatories to the treaty are already part of the power structure in one degree or form or another. By the fact of their signature they demonstrated that they are ready to waive some convictions in order to start cooperation with the president and the executive branch without waiting for the next elections and that they are prepared to continue this cooperation even after 1996. Naturally, they are hoping here to increase their share of power. V. Zhirinovskiy's party is acting most frankly here. The party leaders declare quite frankly that, unlike V. Zorkin, who once wanted to see B. Yeltsin as a Russian De Gaulle or F. Roosevelt, they consider the role of a Russian Hindenburg more advisable for the president. So they intend to press for the appointment of V. Zhirinovskiy to a key government post. So that the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader, while gaining the statesman's image he needs, can use his ministerial post as a springboard to vault into the presidency. However, these plans are scarcely destined to be realized so long as the LDPR's influence among the president's entourage is negligible. At the same time it looks as though the LDPR leaders are not the only ones entertaining such thoughts. And the statement made by V. Chernomyrdin in Orenburg that no personnel changes are expected in the Russian Government in the immediate future should scarcely be regarded as pure chance. For their part the political leaders who firmly refused to sign the treaty -- primarily A. Rutskoy and G. Yavlinskiy -- quite clearly gambled on a different way of coming to power. This strategy is based not on slow integration with the authorities (which, incidentally, is simply impossible for them both under the present regime), but on instant arrival in power. The hope here is presumably that there will be a sharp deterioration in the economic situation in the country and, as a consequence, that voters will turn against the entire political elite implicated in running the state. But, as always happens with such splits, a number of political leaders are between the two camps. The most dramatic figure in this respect was G. Zyuganov, who came to the Kremlin but did not sign the treaty. Thereby demonstrating the utter contradictoriness of his position. It looks as though, as an experienced politician and a true pragmatist, the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation] leader realizes the need to sign the treaty but, being tightly bound by plenum decisions, he is forced to comply with party discipline. The Agrarian leader M. Lapshin looks much more prosaic against this background. He did not come to the Kremlin. The next day he took part in a press conference by the "hard-line nonsignatories" -- the leaders of the "Accord for Russia" bloc. However, in the Duma corridors he immediately disowned his neighbors at the press conference and, according to information from reliable sources, will soon sign the treaty once he has obtained the requisite concessions from the government in the agrarian sphere. Overall, analysis of the initial period of operation of the treaty on accord makes it possible to conclude that it has become yet another powerful stabilizing factor in Russian domestic political life. And in principle there are now no factors in the country capable of seriously unbalancing the situation. The main potential source of destabilization -- the question of the president's health -- has apparently lost its urgency. Since the conclusion of the treaty the problem of the worsening economic situation can now be resolved by civilized means, up to and including changes to the government. The problem of crime and corruption presents a serious threat to stability. The fact that the president has signed a directive on checking the "purity of the ranks" of staffers of the top state apparatus gives grounds for assuming that the state authorities are at last launching a large-scale offensive on this "front." Which in turn makes it possible to conclude that the signing of the treaty on accord has on the whole led to a strengthening of the executive branch and of its collaboration with the legislative branch and ultimately to a strengthening of the state.
