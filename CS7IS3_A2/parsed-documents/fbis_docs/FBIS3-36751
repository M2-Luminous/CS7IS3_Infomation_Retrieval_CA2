Guretskaya, including recording of remarks by Russian Television Director Oleg Popstov and an unidentified TV viewer; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] [Announcer] We have received a statement of the central committee of the Union of Communications Workers of Russia saying that from 10 February the Ministry of Communications can only guarantee the broadcasting of the news programs of Ostankino and Russia's Television, and that only in the morning and in the evening. [Guretskaya] The first reaction of an ordinary TV viewer, a man in the street, to the prospect of facing a blank television screen was this: [Unidentified speaker] They are just hooligans, I think this is absolutely outrageous! [Guretskaya] Here is a reaction to the same by a professional, the chief of one of the state television companies. [Poptsov] I think this is a natural action, a normal step to take, and it should not be called blackmail. This is not blackmail, this is a forced measure. Please understand: This is a cry, an appeal for help. [Guretskaya] Last year the heads of the Communications Ministry, not without help from the heads of the TV and radio companies, prevented a general strike of communications workers eight times. But all things in this world of ours are interrelated: We owe money to communications workers, they in turn to people in power engineering while the government owes money to them all. Everyone has turned out to be a bankrupt. [Poptsov] Why do we have no budget? Because people don't pay taxes. There are no funds to make up a budget. Taxes are not being paid because the tax system is not functioning. The government which is unable to guarantee the implementation of its own decisions in fact dooms the very concept of statehood and legality to failure. [Guretskaya] Oleg Poptsov has pointed out correctly that what the reactionary forces failed to achieve during the night of 3-4 October 1993 -- they failed to make TV screens go blank -- can now be done without any great shocks. You simply stop paying money, and the screens go blank of themselves. Thus money -- or, rather, the lack of it -- is the cause of everything. Or maybe there is another cause? [Poptsov] I am deeply convinced that there is a powerful lobby behind the idea of the shortening of broadcasting time. This force, acting behind the government's back, wants the state broadcasting reduced in order to get free space for themselves and wants the state to reduce and finally lose its interest in TV and radio broadcasting. Then some very different forces can enter that area and then, I am sorry to say, the state, the government, the president and the Duma will lose control of this country called the Russian Federation -- or simply of Russia.
