The press points out that the Tuesday signing of a joint Russian-British statement on the de-targeting of strategic nuclear missiles from each other became the chief result of the Moscow talks between President Boris Yeltsin and British Prime Minister John Major, who had arrived in Russia for his first official visit here. Newspapers practically with one accord note the friendly partnership atmosphere of the talks, although, as NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA points out in particular, "There were complex issues under discussion, such as the situation in Bosnia." Commenting on the Russian-British talks, TRUD points out that "Russia and Britain are not adversaries any longer". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star), describing the talks as a "dialogue of partners", writes: "it is important that our mutually respectful dialogue between equal partners is carried on. And not only with the United States but also with European countries that are friendly to Russia, with Britain rightfully among them". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, recalling the words of President Yeltsin that Russia and Britain have now developed the best-ever relations in their entire history, emphasises that "this conclusion has been backed up by a package of joint documents". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the signing of a bilateral Russo-Tatar treaty in the Kremlin on Tuesday as a result of talks between Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Mintimer Shaimiyev: "The presidents of Russia and Tatarstan summed up the results of the three-year negotiating process between Moscow and Kazan. From now on, the Republic of Tatarstan is a state united with the Russian Federation on the basis of two constitutions and the treaty on the delimitation of the areas of jurisdiction and mutual delegating of powers between the state power bodies of the Russian Federation and Tatarstan. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with Shaimiyev, who recalled in particular that he had stated way back in January this year that Tatarstan "will sign a treaty with Russia before the beginning of March". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the signing of the Russia-Tatarstan treaty: "An ossified centre is being replaced by a federal authority, the power of which is in the emancipation of the subjects of the federation". At the same time the newspaper points out that, for a variety of reasons, primarily socio-economic ones, Russia and Tatarstan" are just destined to be partners". The newspaper ROSSIYA, under the rubric "a political portrait", carries an article about Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the fifth state Duma in Russian history. ROSSIYA runs excerpts from a speech made by Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov at the congress dealing with "the reality and economic development prospects". The newspaper notes "a critical tenor of the speech made by the mayor who, perhaps, for the first time unambiguously stated his disagreement with the way economic reforms are being carried out in Russia...Luzhkov in point of fact read out his own reform programme which differs from the government one". At the same time ROSSIYA states that the mayor strongly criticised the privatisation policy being pursued under the guidance of russian state property committee chief Anatoliy Chubays, pointing out that "this privatisation is ruining the economy".
