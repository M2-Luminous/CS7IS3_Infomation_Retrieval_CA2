In an interview with CTK today, Benda said he did not believe that by his statement on NOVA Television in which he described Augusto Pinochet as a "brave man" he had harmed the interests of his party. "Moreover, because of this statement new people have joined our party," he said. Benda said he had invited General Pinochet for lunch with the awareness of the KDS Political Council and that "not one objection against such an approach was raised" at a council meeting, he added. "When I told the meeting that if I were chairman I would recommend a meeting with Pinochet, KDS Chairman Ivan Pilip said in a very resolute manner that he was naturally also for Pinochet and had no objections whatsoever against such a meeting," Benda said, when asked whether he had discussed the whole matter with Pilip. Benda said he had realised from the very beginning the "political risk of the whole operation" and had chosen such an approach out of moral rather than political reasons. He said he had expected at least 83-percent disapproval and was pleasantly surprised by the extent of support and solidarity he was receiving from individuals and organisations. Benda admitted that the KDS Executive Committee would discuss the matter at its meeting on Saturday and did not rule out that some kind of stand would be taken there. He said that the course of the meeting would show the level of support he enjoyed among KDS members.
