A new but limited study has confirmed that four out of 10 animals tested positively to the bovine immunodeficiency virus, BIV. A ministry scientist, Dr Joe Brownlie, took blood samples from all 115 surviving animals in the herd of Linda and Tim Blything, who farm at Kelsall. But Mrs Blything said: "The ministry is so far refusing to put up the money to have all the samples tested for the virus." The Milk Marketing Board has stopped taking milk from the herd although some of the cows are still going for slaughter, mainly to be used in mince, sausages and pies. The Blythings say some of their herd has had to be destroyed and that most of the survivors are visibly sick, with mucous clogging their nostrils and ulcers in their noses and mouths. A ministry spokesman said: "We are considering a request from Dr Brownlie at our Institute for Animal Health for more money to test all the animals for BIV. A decision will be taken in due course. But we continue to believe that BIV is a mild and transient condition in cattle from which they normally respond spontaneously." According to Dr Brownlie's report last week to the Blythings' vet samples from 10 animals were analysed and four tested positively on all three tests for the virus. Three more tested positively to two of the tests, leaving their health in doubt. "This is a very much higher level than would be expected in a healthy herd where no more than 4 per cent would normally be positive on all three tests," Dr Brownlie said. "We really ought to find out more."
