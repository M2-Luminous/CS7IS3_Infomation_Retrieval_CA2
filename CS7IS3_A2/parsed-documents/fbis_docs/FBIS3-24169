Russia's retired and reserve military personnel living in Estonia should organize into units to defend their honor and dignity, thinks Pyotr Rozhok, representative of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party in Estonia. "If some Estonian official should try to send out a Russian officer, he better look out for himself. Should there be a police check or some other inspection by some kind of officials, they should just be removed by force, and that's that," said Pyotr Rozhok, in his interview with SILLAMYAESKI VESTNIK [Russian language local newspaper in Estonia]. Rozhok thinks that Estonia is `an ancient Russian region'. "Nobody has nullified the Nystad peace treaty or the 1975 Helsinki accord. This is why retired and reserve members of the Russian military living here should know that they live in ancient Russian territory," asserts Zhirinovskiy's representative in Estonia. Rozhok also thinks that all Russians living in Estonia should take out Russian citizenship `so as to benefit from the protection and support of great Russia'. Rozhok says that he convinced Zhirinovski not to toss around such expressions as `let's bring in the tanks', but to threaten Estonia only with economic sanctions. Commenting on the statement that, should economic sanctions be applied, the first to be hit would be the Russian industrial workers, Rozhok replied: "Russians have nothing left to lose, anyhow." Referring to organizations for Estonia's Russian-speaking population, Rozhok spoke highly of the activities of Yuri Mishin, leader of the Narva Russian Citizens' League. The Representative Assembly, however, was termed by him as the 'academy for dismantling all Russian movements, parties and organizations, under the baton of Estonia's government.'
