FBIS4-55869 "dreeu099_i_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Serbian Attacks on Gorazde, Bugojno Reported Serbian Attacks on Gorazde, Bugojno Reported AU2005120594 AU2005120594 BFN [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1000 GMT on 20 May within its regular 16-minute newscast carries several reports on the situation in the republic. Kemal Halilhodzic reports that "the past 24 hours have been extremely difficult for Bugojno and parts of the free Donji Vakuf territory. The approximately 60 destructive long-range shells that the chetniks launched from the surrounding hills on the populated regions from the direction of Kupres and Donji Vakuf killed four people and seriously or lightly wounded 10, including four children. Smail Terzic reports that "in the region covered by the 7th South Operations Group, the village of Sije has been exposed to the fiercest attacks. During almost all of last night, the aggressor shelled this village and the defense lines with mortar bombs. The material damage is huge." Further on in the report, Terzic says that "the enemy is attacking these free territories with all available weapons and artillery pieces in order to reach the Doboj-Teslic road. However, the defense lines are increasingly firmer and more stable by the day" A report by the 4th Corps Information Service says that "last night and the early morning hours in the zone covered by the 4th Corps were somewhat calmer than during the previous day, although on several occasions, the chetniks fired all kinds of artillery pieces, with the barrels directed at [names indistinct]. Some provocative activity has been registered on the Mostar battlefield as well. A calmer start to the day, with only occasional aggressor's fire from antiaircraft weapons on the Konjic battlefield in the region of (Djelomici) and (Glasicevo), does not mean that the chetniks have given up the shelling of residential districts in the zone covered by the 4th Corps. These areas have been shelled almost incessantly lately; artillery assaults are being launched suddenly, therefore the general danger alarm is still in force in Konjic. "Along the lines of separation between the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO], there have been no incidents during last night and this morning, unlike the previous day when, on several occasions, HVO extremist snipers fired on our fighters' lines on the Mostar battlefield. Frequent explosions coming from the Dubravska Plateau have also been registered and it seems that HVO extremists have been blowing up the remaining Bosniak houses, which means that there are still some hotheads in the HVO ranks who oppose the signed agreements." Studio Announcer Aleksandra Hafeti reads report of the Gorazde Press Center that "the protected zone of Gorazde has still been exposed to aggressor's attacks with shells and anti-aircraft weapons."
