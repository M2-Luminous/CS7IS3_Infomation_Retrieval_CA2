About a thousand troops backed by air and sea cover returned to base in coastal Trincomalee following the operation over the weekend against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels in the region, officials said. Troops destroyed an abandoned LTTE camp that included 15 well- fortified bunkers and ten small accomodation units, a military spokesman said. They also recovered about 50 anti-personnel mines from the rebel camp, he said. "The Tigers left the camp to avoid confronting advancing troops. One soldier was wounded when he stepped on an anti-personnel mine," the spokesman said. The latest offensive was part of a military campaign to flush out LTTE rebels in parts of the island's north and the entire east ahead of key local government elections in the region on March 1. The LTTE, which is fighting for a separate state in the northeast for Sri Lanka's minority Tamils, have vowed to disrupt the polls in northern Vavuniya, in Trincomalee and the neighbouring districts of Batticaloa and Ampara.
