This was stated by Moldovan President Mircea Snegur at his meeting with Deputy U.S. State Secretary, Chief Coordinator on the New Independent States James Collins in Kishinyov today. Snegur said the issue was being discussed with Russia. Snegur stressed that no Russian military base could be established on Moldovan territory. Information on its establishment was not more than an allegation by the media, he added. James Collins stated that the participation of Moldova in international organizations and its signing of the NATO Partnership for Peace program proved once again that the Republic was moving towards democratization of its society. He highly appraised the general vision of possible ways of settlement of the problems in Transdniestria and the centers mostly populated by Gagauz displayed by the Moldovan leadership.
