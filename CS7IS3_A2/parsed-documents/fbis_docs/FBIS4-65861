Sources close to the talks said the final delegates from all three sides had arrived in Geneva Tuesday. [passage omitted] The Bosnian Serb delegation arrived Tuesday, headed by Momcilo Krajisnik, the speaker of their self-proclaimed parliament. Krajisnik said his side wanted a ceasefire as soon as possible and did not attach any conditions to a truce or new peace talks. But, he insisted, referring to sanctions in effect against Serbia and NATO air raids against Bosnian Serbs, "we think we must be treated in the same way." "Serbs are the only ones to be threatened ... to get bombed and to have sanctions imposed against them," he said, speaking after a meeting with international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. A member of the Moslem delegation who asked not to be named accused the superpowers Tuesday of trying to "dictate and impose" a solution on Bosnia-Herzegovina that would not restore peace. He rejected a European plan for the ethnic division of Bosnia- Herzegovina, which the contact group backed at a meeting in Geneva on May 13 and urged all sides to accept. [passage omitted] The Moslem delegate Tuesday said the Moslem and Croat leaders -- who agreed this year to form a new Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- would use their own proposal made in Vienna earlier this month. That plan gave the federation a greater chunk of land, 58 percent of Bosnian territory, than the European plan. The European plan provides 51 percent of the territory for the Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for Bosnian Serbs. The Moslem delegate said the Moslems and Croats would present themselves as a "united" front at Talloires and "undertake discussions on the basis" of their Vienna plan. Krajisnik said setting percentages for partitioning land was "a useless way of doing things. It must not be a precondition for the continuation of talks." [passage omitted]
