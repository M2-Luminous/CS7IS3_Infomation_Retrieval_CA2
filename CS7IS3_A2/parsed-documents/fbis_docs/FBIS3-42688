[Dudayev] My good sense has not quit on me yet, and good sense has stopped working long since in any person who calls for physical violence on a national basis. The Almighty will not, I believe, let me drop to this level. Grant me the strength not to sink to the level of the barbarian and respond with such methods to citizens of my republic: this would be blasphemy on my part. [Akiyev] A multitude of publications and statements of the special services concerned that SS-20 missiles are allegedly deployed on the territory of Chechnya have appeared lately. Please comment on this. [Dudayev] Are we not worried that a quantity of nuclear potential which could wipe out the world in a matter of days has been stockpiled on the territory of other countries? We are entitled to our defense, like all peoples. [Akiyev] And the international agreements on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons? [Dudayev] There is in the world the law of the strong. No one observes other laws or juridical, humane, or legal provisions. Only strength is recognized. [Akiyev] You believe that only the wolf's laws operate? [Dudayev] Yes. And the stronger the state, the more strongly it extends these wolf's laws to the weak and merely hides behind the screen of the law. All these are ways to further torture peoples that are small and incapable of survival. [Akiyev] The news media reported that you met with Bill Clinton during his election campaign. [Dudayev] The point is that this meeting could not have had a positive influence on Bill Clinton's campaign and could have turned the situation against him. Not every meeting in the personal interests of one party has a positive influence on the other. I turned down this meeting as far as possible, therefore; Bill Clinton's opponents could have used it against him. [Akiyev] Does Chechnya as of the present have diplomatic relations with countries of the "far abroad" and with which precisely? [Dudayev] Diplomatic relations with half the countries of the world. [Akiyev] Are they enshrined legally? Does Chechnya have embassies and missions in other countries, as in sovereign states? [Dudayev] As in sovereign states, we have missions in many countries of the world. And if it is a question of the recognition to which the world is accustomed, we do not need this recognition, we reject it and will continue to reject it. [Akiyev] But this is irrational. [Dudayev] It is rational. [Akiyev] The world is the world, and this is an aggregate of all the nations in the world, and you are required to observe primarily statutes and laws. [Dudayev] We must observe our interests, and our interests consist of not succumbing to the euphoria to which Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Moldova, and other republics of the state succumbed. No sooner had they crowed about this recognition than disintegration set in. What happened in Georgia? The world recognized Georgia. The intelligentsia and the whole people stood up in support of Gamsakhurdia when Georgia acquired its sovereign law. And what? Political forces embarked on a power struggle. Gamsakhurdia has perished.... [Akiyev] I would like to ask you about Chechnya's refusal to take part in the elections. How do you justify this refusal?! You could have found a compromise with Russia and have sent your observers to the State Duma, to the Federal Assembly. [Dudayev] First, no one invited us as observers, second, what is the Duma today? We were citizens of the USSR. This juridical, legal base has been demolished. The initial demolition came from deprivation of citizenship of the USSR. And Russia was a subject of the USSR. There is no citizenship in Russia as of the present either, I believe, and all elections have been pointless, consequently. [Akiyev] What do you think of Ingushetia's problems? Does it not seem to you that the entire economic potential, which was accumulated by both the Chechen and the Ingush, has remained on the territory of Chechnya and that Ingushetia is in the position of a girl without a dowry? [Dudayev] For 75 years both the Chechen and the Ingush were bequeathed the most onerous legacy throughout the former Soviet Union. According to the statistical data of Russia of 1990, Chechnya was in 73d place in social development. We were left with the highest infant mortality. We were left with the highest percentage of tuberculosis morbidity and intestinal disease. We inherited the most devastated economy. All resources were pumped out of here for 100 years. So neither the Chechen nor the Ingush were left with any technical potential or production. The legacy was identical. We are EQUALLY POOR! [Akiyev] Will Russians, Chechen, and Ingush ever see a Boris Nikolayevich and Dzhokhar Dudayev hand-shaking ceremony? [Dudayev] I am sure of one thing: Russia could win an unprecedented victory in the Caucasus were Chechnya to shake Russia's hand. Russia's 500-year endeavor could be eclipsed by this handshake. This would be the most dazzling victory in the Caucasus. If it does not want this victory, this is its PROBLEM. [Akiyev] So you are not, for all that, prepared to meet? [Dudayev] Not only not prepared, I reject this meeting. For any meeting a base has to be prepared, and it should produce a conclusive result. [Akiyev] You mean, recognition of Chechnya? [Dudayev] Not entirely. We have been recognized by the Almighty. [Akiyev] But the Almighty has, I believe, recognized all mankind? [Dudayev] We are an indigenous nation here. This land was given us by the Almighty, and we have a right to administer it independently of the wishes of any other state. [Akiyev] Your attitude toward the measures that have been adopted in respect to your fiercest enemies: Rutskoy and Khasbulatov. [Dudayev] I can assure you that neither Rutskoy nor Khasbulatov were ever my enemies. [Akiyev] But political foes? [Dudayev] Not entirely. They have their interests in their state, and as far as Chechnya is concerned, had some others been in their place, the attitude toward them could have been even worse. They are people of their time and their structure, and I am far from thinking that they are my foes. But I will say unequivocally that their being incarcerated will not improve the situation in Russia. Khasbulatov is a son of the Chechen people, he was raised and educated by Chechnya, and, whatever he did against Chechnya while in Russia's power structures, he will remain a most gifted politician of our time. From the editors: Mr. Dudayev's answers were not emended for style. We deemed it possible to leave without comment the president's graphic expressions, especially since two days ago he conferred on Chechnya by edict a new name--the Republic of Ichkeria.
