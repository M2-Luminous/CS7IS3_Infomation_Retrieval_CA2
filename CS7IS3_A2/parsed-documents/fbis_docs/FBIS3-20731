"Elipton To Be Manufactured (Also) in Serbia?!"] [Text] (From VJESNIK correspondent) Belgrade -- The Thursday edition of POLITIKA published a statement by Tomislav Simic, owner of the "Elektron" factory in Sabac and president of the local branch of the SSJ [Party of Serbian Unity] led by Zeljko Raznjatovic-Arkan, stating that a "secret Russian weapon" would be manufactured in his factory in the second half of next year. This is the Russian "elipton" bomb that the leader of the Russian Liberal Democrats, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, bragged about when he visited Belgrade recently. On this occasion, Zirinovski allegedly gave this "powerful Russian weapon" to Arkan, who boasted that the "Russian bomb" had already been tested at Brcko, where "13 Muslims were killed in the experiment."
