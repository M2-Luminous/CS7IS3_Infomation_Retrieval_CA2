I think that the reopening of Tuzla airport would to a great extent improve the humanitarian situation. After the talks at NATO headquarters in Brussels, let us recall, you said that the West was close to a decision on taking military action to open Tuzla airport and carry out the replacement of Canadian troops in Srebrenica. However, Butrus-Ghali is still opposed to the use of force, and this has not been done to the day. [Izetbegovic] This has not been done, but I think that regardless of how much Butrus-Ghali and others oppose it, I think that Tuzla airport will be reopened at the end. Things are moving in this direction. I think that these things are now almost impossible to stop. There will still be some haggling over this, but I think that Tuzla airport will be opened by hook or crook. I think that the Serbian side will realize that they should not run the risk of being attacked from the air and that it will agree to this under certain conditions. [Hodzic] They are obstructing it. In the past few days, the shelling by the Serbian aggressor has intensified in the area around the airport. [Izetbegovic] Yes. [Hodzic] They are doing this to show the international community that the airport is not safe. [Izetbegovic] I visited this airport about a month ago. They are threatening the airport from some Crna Planina, Crni Vrh, or whatever it is called. I think this is the name of the hill where their artillery is. The hill from which they are controlling the airport is approximately 5 km away, as the crow flies. They know very well that if they put up resistance, this position would probably be bombed, silenced, and neutralized. I think that they will have to (?agree) to the opening of the airport. Regarding the replacement of the Canadian battalion in Srebrenica with the one from the Netherlands, I think that this will also be accomplished in approximately 15-20 days. [Hodzic] Mr. President, regarding the humanitarian situation, the possible withdrawal of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and the UNHCR is frequently mentioned. What should be done in this situation, if it arises? [Izetbegovic] First, I would like to say that this is a kind of blackmail at the time of negotiations. This is a kind of unfair blackmail, a blackmail through food with starvation. Our resistance is obviously resting on two factors -- arms and food. Both of these factors, as you can see, are only partly in our hands. Only a small part of it is in our hands. Food is hardly in our hands altogether. We totally depend on humanitarian aid for food. This is something that is unfortunately in someone else's hands, in their hands. They are now trying to blackmail us through this food to force us to accept something that we should perhaps not accept. However, we told them that in case they do decide to withdraw the troops, there would be no reason whatsoever for the embargo to remain in force. We demand and will demand that in case this decision is made, the arms embargo be lifted on the same day so that we can defend ourselves and they can go their own way. However, assessing the future course of events, it does appears that they will stay here for some time. Therefore, in my view UNPROFOR will not be withdrawing soon, in the foreseeable future. I think that the situation will continue to develop more or less in the same way as it has been developing up to now. Food will be arriving in Bosnia-Herzegovina with a varying degree of difficulties. There has recently been some mention of a possibility of military helicopters escorting relief convoys. I think that this will come about. They would be able to remove the difficulties that could possibly (?arise). We recently sent our soldiers, our army, a letter in which we told them how important it was that we ourselves do not create any difficulties. As you known, there was an attack near Zenica, the murder of a Englishman. This was actually supposed... this could only have been done by someone totally blind, deliberately (?blind), someone who is (?deliberately) working for someone else's interests. [Hodzic] This second reason is more likely. [Izetbegovic] This second is very likely to have been the case, because this was a direct attack on our main interest, namely to secure a normal supply of food. Some forces in the world were waiting for this to happen to raise the question of UNPROFOR's withdrawal, to use this as an argument. We acted swiftly and we found those responsible. Unfortunately we cannot establish their motives [words indistinct] all three kidnappers [words indistinct] stopped. However, I think that there will be fewer difficulties in this respect in the future. [Hodzic] The Presidency of our state recently proposed that Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro recognize each other. Would this be a fresh contribution toward the settlement of the crisis of the former Yugoslavia? [Izetbegovic] Yes, this would certainly be a step forward if such mutual recognition did take place. We made that move but are not convinced that they will accept this. Of course, we are making a political point because we are showing that we do not want war here. It is their turn now. They could accept it. That would be a step forward. They could reject it. This would then show that they have (?extreme) intentions concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina. If they really want peace, they ought to recognize Bosnia-Herzegovina and we will recognize them. We could then negotiate [words indistinct] Bosnia-Herzegovina, as we are negotiating now, but this would then be done from the position in which our borders are mutually recognized. I do not believe that they will respond positively to our move. [Hodzic] Talking of Serbia and Montenegro, the two aggressor states against Bosnia-Herzegovina, many international agencies have recently written about the arrest of the Muslims and the leaders of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] in Serbia and Montenegro. Do you have any more detailed information about what is really going on there? What do we want when it comes to Sandzak? Should the issue of Sandzak have been stressed more vigorously in the international negotiations? [Izetbegovic] Yes, we have been trying to do that, but our words have always fallen upon deaf ears in that respect. We have been demanding that the representatives of Sandzak participate in the negotiations and are involved in the negotiations, but that has been rejected. We keep repeating this demand, and we will reiterate it at the next round of talks, that the Sandzak delegation be allowed to participate in the talks about the future of Bosnia- Herzegovina as an interested party. As for this court trial, it is meant to worsen the position of the Muslim people in Sandzak, both in its Montenegrin part and the Serbian part. The SDA members have been persecuted in both parts. Two nights ago Montenegrin television showed pictures of a group of 12 people who had been arrested, and who were said to have had 13 rifles in their possession, as if they were going to undermine Montenegro and Serbia with these 13 rifles. That can convince no one. However, it can do something else. This is an extraordinary political exploitation of a case in which the entire Muslim nation has been accused of working against the state, of being one disloyal part of it, which should then be put against the wall. They have managed to do that. I think that the position of the Muslims in Montenegro and Serbia is very difficult. It was difficult even before, but now it has deteriorated so that no one feels any security [words indistinct] 12 people as far as I know, and the court trial [word indistinct], while over 50 people here [words indistinct]. We have lodged protests from here, to no effect most likely, but we have to draw the attention of the world to the very difficult position of a part of our nation in Serbia and Montenegro. This is an attempt to satanize a nation, to make other people revolt against it, and make life and existence impossible for the nation there. The trial that is in progress in Serbia and the one that is being prepared in Montenegro have that as the aim. [Hodzic] Serbian mobilization has increased recently, particularly of Serbian refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina in Serbia. They have been forcefully mobilized and returned to the fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What does that mean? [Izetbegovic] You see, they have problems -- we know that; their military might is suffering from a shortage of people and weapons. They have not had vast problems as far as weapons go, since they had stocks of arms. For 40 years the Yugoslav Army amassed arms in a paranoid way, spent huge amounts of money, and stockpiled arms for 40 years. Just in the region of Sarajevo -- and I only established that later when I got here to this building -- there were six or seven barracks just in the Sarajevo region, and barracks and warehouses of arms throughout the former Yugoslavia. So they have never had problems with arms, but they have always had problems with the other element, manpower, and with the morale of that manpower. I think that this mobilization is an attempt to improve the situation in that respect, to find new youngsters to fight in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that has more of a psychological aim -- to raise the poor morale a bit. I do not think that this will significantly affect the balance of power [words indistinct]. [Hodzic] Let us go back now to our western neighbor, the Republic of Croatia, which -- after overwhelming evidence of its open military deployment in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- has officially been proclaimed the aggressor on our country. Mr. President, you have had a chance to get to know the Croatian politicians well. How can you explain this policy of theirs, a policy that has led to open armed intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Izetbegovic] How to explain it? That is an interesting question, and the answer will be long in coming. But I would like to give you my private view here. Tudjman is obsessed about creating a Croatia with borders [words indistinct]. He is a historian, by the way, and one that not only studies the past but also lives in it. He cannot understand that this is not 1939, the eve of the World War II. If you remember, if you recall, that was the climate in which Bosnia-Herzegovina was so infamously partitioned, and this was on the eve of World War II. Fascism ruled in Europe. But democracy rules in Europe now, so the situation is completely different. In the old Yugoslavia there was a different balance of power, and the Muslims did not even exist as a political factor. Bosnia, as they say, fell silently then. But not this time. We are putting up a tremendous fight, and Bosnia is not falling. Tudjman does not understand that, and he keeps pushing for this partition of Bosnia. We would have defended ourselves from the main culprit in the partition of Bosnia had it not been for this stab in the back from the west. After all, this has also damaged Croatia, since -- from the Serbian aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina -- this diversion by the HVO and Croatia turned the conflict into some kind of civil war with three warring factions, which in essence it is not. So the picture of this war has been distorted, and the international public has been confused about the character of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. So the result of one vision from the past, of one obsession to create a Croatia with certain borders [words indistinct] thanks to such a balance of power, and generally the constellation of the powers in the world, which today cannot be established. Tudjman does not seem to want to see that. He is pushing for partition, and at the same time signing agreements with us, which we can see are not sincere, or is offering new arrangements. Meanwhile he is negotiating something else with Milosevic, something completely the opposite. We know that. The Croatian Convention will be held here in two days, and I think that it will steer things in another direction, or at least we hope so. We know that the mood of the Bosnian Croats is not for such an option, nor is the mood of a large part of the Croatian public. Opposition parties and forces are against such a policy. Changes are probably ahead. We will follow this closely. [Hodzic] Has President Tudjman perhaps stressed 1939 in your talks? I think it is important to point out that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army did not exist then, and also that the existence of the Muslim nation was neglected in 1939. Now we have a completely different situation. [Izetbegovic] Exactly. I have said so to Tudjman, particularly when he told me that we were faced with the threat of a bipartite partition of Bosnia. He said that what is on offer now is a tripartite partition of Bosnia, and we are being given a large part, the best part of Bosnia, and so on, but, he said, if you reject that, you are risking the danger of Bosnia being divided in two, just like in 1939. I told him that we did not have 200,000 soldiers then, that the Muslim nation was organized now, that this was the case now, and of course that plan will not wash. [Hodzic] Tudjman's recent proposal for a union of Croatia and the Bosnian republic was rejected. If that proposal had referred to the two internationally recognized states, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, would it have been accepted? [Izetbegovic] To tell you the truth, this is an issue of great importance. None of us would have been authorized to accept that definitely. We would have probably turned to our Assembly and our public to decide whether that suited us. One kind of link with Croatia would certainly suit us, a firm link, because we are turned toward the West because we are driven in that direction in our development. We would have a link with the Western countries through Croatia. A sincere relationship based on equality and mutual respect would suit us, if such a relationship could be established. The public would probably be in favor of such a firm link with Croatia. The problem is obviously not between the nations but in the regimes. I do not know whether it is possible to arrange something with the current Croatian regime [words indistinct] a hypocritical policy. We have to be very cautious about every arrangement. [Hodzic] After everything that the Serbian and Croatian aggressors have done to Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly to the Muslim Bosniak people, will it be possible to preserve the multinational Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Izetbegovic] That is a very hard question. I would say very briefly: We would have to have a bad case of amnesia for that. You know what that means [words indistinct] to forget, to forget many things, to wipe many things from the memory. Whether one case of amnesia or more would be needed, I do not know, but we will need to forget. Whether the people will be able to forget is another question. [Hodzic] Could you briefly sum up the work of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government led by Dr. Haris Silajdzic? You know how busy the government is, particularly as far as the humanitarian needs of the population are concerned. We spoke about that earlier. How do you assess the results of the work of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government? [Izetbegovic] I think we should wait a few more days for that. The government will then have been in office for 100 days, and it is common practice [words indistinct], after 100 days the government normally comes out in front of the Assembly or the public and reports on the results of its work. I think that the prime minister will come out with a report to the Assembly on 7 February. He will report on his results. Let us wait for that. Then we will see how realistic the results are. What can be seen now is that the government has finally started functioning, because we practically had no government [words indistinct] you could not have called that a government. That was more of a [word indistinct] body, which was paralyzed [word indistinct]. This government is without a doubt putting in a sincere effort to do something, and under very hard conditions, too [passage indistinct]. There is a division of duty, according to our laws. The division of authority is not so strict, but it is known that the Presidency has the final say in the field of foreign policy, the army, and interior affairs. So the foreign affairs, interior affairs, and the army are within the authority of the Presidency, the body that I chair. All other things are more or less within the authority of the government. The three fields, probably the most important ones [words indistinct] are within the authority of the Presidency. I think that the government has no problems when it comes to support; it has our full support. Everything it has proposed has been accepted without serious problems [words indistinct] nor will it have any in future, I hope [words indistinct]. [Hodzic] Mr. President, at the end of this program, I would like you to answer some questions that every so often tend to confuse the public. I am referring to the support of the Muslim countries to Bosnia-Herzegovina. How do you see this support, and is it sufficient? [Izetbegovic] Regarding the support of the people, this support is general. This support is total and we are completely satisfied. Therefore, the Muslim people support Bosnia-Herzegovina and are profoundly interested in what is going on here. Regarding the governments, the situation is not the same. Some governments do not support Bosnia-Herzegovina at all, while some are indifferent. These countries are in the minority. Some governments strongly support Bosnia-Herzegovina, although this number is not so great either. Some countries are extending support, (?limited) political and material support. Therefore, to be brief, there is a general support from the people and fairly selective support by the governments. Nevertheless, one should say that this support is important and has perhaps been crucial for Bosnia-Herzegovina in all respects. We (?have) friends all over the world. We also have many friends outside the Muslim countries. However, the support from this category of countries, the Muslim countries, has indeed been crucial and decisive. I think that this support will continue. The Muslim world, which is an enormous world of a billion people, could have perhaps done more. The prime ministers of Pakistan and Turkey, two very important countries, were here yesterday. I suppose Turkey will become a small giant in this part of the world. Turkey today has approximately 60 million people, and its national income is over $100 billion. This is a strong economic power whose strength is on the rise. This also applies to Pakistan. These two countries have over 200 million people alone. These two countries, for instance... Saudi Arabia must also be mentioned as a country that is helping Bosnia-Herzegovina; Iran, too, [words indistinct] then Malaysia is very important country, even though it is very far away, several thousand kilometers. We are in opposite time zones, so you can see how geographically far away this world is and yet it is very interested in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ordinary citizens there know quite a bit about our situation. Their government is very interested. Indonesia is a very large country that is just beginning to display an interest in our problem. This is a big country with almost 200 million people; it has very strong potentials. All this is something that is of great importance (?for our country) right now and in the future. [Hodzic] It is claimed that the support and help from these countries is more concrete than the declarative support of the countries in the West. [Izetbegovic] We must not forget one thing regarding humanitarian aid. The help from the West is not negligible. For instance, regarding the sending of UNPROFOR troops, you must know that France is well represented, as is Britain. The Netherlands has also become well represented, while Canada used to be. I am sorry that the United States is not among them. This would then be a decisive factor. So, we cannot ignore the help from the Western countries. This help is, of course, selective and is precisely worked out to maintain a balance, a situation in which they can dictate a political solution. They are not letting us significantly gain in strength so that we may set our own conditions. All in all, we are managing to somehow coordinate this help, to use this support for the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina and prolong the resistance, to strengthen the defense. [Hodzic] Mr. President, our program Open Studio is coming to an end. I would like to ask you whether, at the end of our program, you perhaps have a message for the people and the defenders of our country. [Izetbegovic] Yes. I would like to say to our people and our defenders to keep going. I would like to express gratitude on the part of the government and the people for what they have done in the defense of the country. My message to the people is not to lose hope, for things will improve, that we are not alone in the world, and that, as you can see from what I said earlier, we have many friends, and that the cause for which we are fighting cannot be defeated. [Hodzic] Mr. President, thank you very much for being a guest of Open Studio of the Radio of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
