The treaty of association--a chance to put an end to the artificial division of Europe"--this was stressed by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak during his talks with the "12" on the last day of his visit to Brussels. In his talks with EC Chairman Jacques Delors and members of the Commission, the prime minister appealed for both greater opening of markets to Polish goods and for a greater influx of investments. The prime minister stated that "Poland expects the '12' to propose a schedule of joint work on inroads to membership and to establish the date for a conference which would review our mutual relations." Delors avoided answering a question concerning the timetable. At a press conference, the EC chairman merely recalled that the "12" had made a political commitment to admit new countries; however, it will do this only when it is possible. The prime minister also indirectly criticized the West publicly for its trade policy toward Poland. In a paper delivered before Polish and Western dignitaries, invited to Brussels by the Washington Center of Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and by Zbigniew Brzezinski, Prime Minister Pawlak declared that Poland is threatened by, among other things, the maintenance of barriers in the economic and civil development. "Our efforts to take part in Western structures are supposed to serve the purpose of European cooperation and extending the zone of stability, and, as a consequence, the purpose of strengthening the entire continent," he said. The "Partnership for Peace" initiative was referred to by the prime minister as "a first step" toward improving our security. According to him, Poland and NATO should begin cooperation in such areas as making systems of communications and logistics uniform, because without any great financial investments they could contribute to the adjustment of our Armed Forces to Western standards. At a breakfast with members of the press, when asked about the attitude of Moscow toward Polish efforts to become a NATO member, the prime minister said that Russia's reservations show that the time when some states meddled with the affairs of others is not yet over. German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, who was present at the CSIS conference, saw "Partnership for Peace" as a preparatory step for Polish membership in NATO. He stressed that "stabilization in the Euro-Atlantic region is possible only with Russia, but the security zone cannot be limited from outside by any state." "Germany does not want its eastern border to be a line of division between the area of stability and the area of instability. Poland is entitled to membership in Europe and to the protection of its democratic development," said Ruehe. Waldemar Pawlak, in talks with EU General Secretary Willem van Eekelen, tried to convince him that the organization's council, jointly with the Central European states, should negotiate the draft of the status of their association with the Western European Union [WEU]. Pawlak emphasized that "we are interested in obtaining the association status we already have with the EU." Eekelen gave assurances that the status of such states as Poland is being discussed in the WEU. [passage omitted]
