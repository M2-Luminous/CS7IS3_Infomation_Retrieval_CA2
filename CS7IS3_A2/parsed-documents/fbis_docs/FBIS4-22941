Reznikov and L.D. Belyakova, Petrochemical and Coal Chemistry Synthesis Institute and Physical Chemistry Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 543.544] [Abstract] The separation and identification of complex mixtures of compounds with similar physicochemical properties require the creation of new heat-resistance adsorbents that are sensitive to the electronic structure of the molecules being separated. In view of this fact, a study examined the mobility of adsorbed molecules (i.e., the changes in the entropy of adsorption) of organic materials on barium sulfate (BaSO[.sub]4[/]). The changes in entropy were calculated from values of Henry's constant and from changes in internal adsorption energy that were determined by gas chromatography. Experimental and calculated values were derived and compared. It was discovered that saturated hydrocarbons (n-alkanes and n-alkenes) interact with the surface of a BaSO[.sub]4[/] adsorbent nonspecifically, mainly on account of dispersion forces. The energy of nonspecific interaction on the surface of BaSO[.sub]4[/] is much lower than on the surface of a nonspecific nonpolar adsorbent such as graphitized thermal black (35 versus 49 kJ/mol, respectively, for n-C[.sub]8[/]H[.sub]18[/]). The adsorption of n-alkanes was found to be delocalized, and the heat of adsorption increased as the number of hydrocarbon atoms increased, which is to say that the mobility of the molecules on the surface decreases because of intensification of the dispersion interaction. In the cases of n-hexane and n-heptane, ultramobile adsorption was observed on BaSO[.sub]4[/]. In a homologous series of n-alkenes, the mobility of the adsorbed molecules decreased as a result of intensification of the dispersion interaction with the surface. The adsorption of aromatic hydrocarbons on the surface of BaSO[.sub]4[/] was also found to be delocalized. The molecules' mobility was limited because of �-complexing of the �-electrons of the benzene ring with the Ba[.sup]2+[/] cations. In the series benzene-butylbenzene, the mobility of the adsorbed molecules decreased as a result of an increase in the contribution of the dispersion interaction of the BaSO[.sub]4[/] surface with the alkyl radicals of the alkylbenzenes. The molecules of tetramethylbenzene formed stronger bonds with the surface than those of trimethylbenzene do; however the rotation of trimethylebenzene's molecules is more difficult than is the motion of the molecules of tetramethylbenzene because of the latter's great asymmetry. Adsorption of halogen-containing aromatic compounds was also delocalized; the mobility of their molecules on the BaSO[.sub]4[/] surface was limited (i.e., the rotational motion of the molecules was difficult). Adsorption of ethers and both unsaturated and aromatic hydrocarbons on the surface of BaSO[.sub]4[/] was delocalized, and the rotational motion of their molecules was difficult because of the interaction of the electron pairs of the oxygen atoms with the Ba[.sup]2+[/] cations and the interaction of the ether's dipoles with the electrostatic field of the BaSO[.sub]4[/] (an orientation interaction). Ethyl acetates were absorbed on BaSO[.sub]4[/] with a great deal of energy (the contribution of the energy of the specific interaction to the total energy of adsorption amounted to 43 kJ/mol). Adsorption of nitrogen-containing organic compounds on BaSO[.sub]4[/] resulted in the formation of strong complexes because of the nonshared pair of electrons at the nitrogen atom. In the case of pyridine, there was a high degree of localization of its molecules on BaSO[.sub]4[/]. Tables 3; references 11: 7 Russian, 4 Western.
