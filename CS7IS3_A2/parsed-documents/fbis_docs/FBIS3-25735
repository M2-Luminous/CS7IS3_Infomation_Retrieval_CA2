In a statement sent to AFP here, the government called for the Togolese Supreme Court to be allowed to determine the results of last Sunday's second round of polling "completely independently, without any pressure." After the National Electoral Commission on Wednesday refused to publish the full count, Commission president Garba Sipohon acknowledged all the votes had been counted but said the results would be sent to the Supreme Court "for evaluation." The court has until March 13 to decide the outcome; however a new parliament is due to be installed by Tuesday. Two opposition parties, Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) and Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD), claimed they won 43 of the 81 seats. Under the constitution, an absolute majority would entitle them to form a new government. The Commission, for its part, proclaimed only 76 deputies "provisionally elected": 33 from CAR, 5 from UTD, 35 from Togolese People's Rally (RPT, which backs President Gnassingbe Eyadema who has ruled Togo since 1967), 2 from the pro-Eyadema Union for Justice and Democracy (UJD), and one Centrist. It failed to confirm the election of three CAR candidates and 2 UTD candidates in constituencies where RPT alleged irregularities took place. Unless the row is settled by Tuesday, only 76 deputies will take their seats in the new parliament. Meanwhile the RPT has claimed to be the leading party in the future parliament, based on the "provisional" results, and called for "its just due in the future government." The government in its statement Sunday called for the constitution and electoral code to be respected "as is the tradition in each of the states represented in the international committee" monitoring the elections. Officials from Burkina Faso, Egypt, France, Germany and the United States sit on this panel. France, Germany and the United States have said the elections were generally free and fair despite some irregularities and violence. All have called on the Lome government to respect the results.
