Jesus Rangel M.] [Text] The Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) has published in the official gazette the rules, 29 reforms outlining method, seven on concept, by which foreign financial institutions may establish branches in the country. These reforms will provide more flexibility, according to interested parties. Among the benefits, a list of shareholders will no longer be required by those who own at least 1 percent of the shares of a foreign financial institution; instead, it will be demanded of those who own at least 5 percent. An application to open a branch will be considered complete even if it lacks the authorization issued by authorities at the location where the institution was founded, and its consolidated financial statements will be reduced from five to three years. Beginning today, requests can be made to establish bank branches, financial corporations with limited objectives, general warehouses, mortgage companies, financial agent companies, exchange houses, stock-trading companies, stock exchange experts, investment corporations, corporations that operate investment corporations, insurance companies, or guarantor institutions in the country. The SHCP has stated the goal of these measures is to locally increase competition within the Mexican financial system. It has also said a first package for approving the branches will be passed during the second half of the year. The deadline for requests is 31 July. The rules will apply not only to U.S. and Canadian institutions but to all those anywhere in the world that have branches in any of those two nations. Among the requirements that must be met is the delivery of a list of the financial institutions and trade and industrial companies in or outside the country in which the company owns more than 10 percent of shares with a right to vote. The following stand out as some of the most flexible rules: - The SHCP will ask for a list of shareholders who constitute a controlling group as well as a list of shareholders who hold more than 5 percent of the shares of the foreign institution. In the original draft bill, a list of shareholders who held more than 1 percent of the shares was requested. - The obligation to deliver forecasts on the amount of capital and assets will be for three years instead of six [number as published], as proposed in the draft bill. - A copy of the foreign financial institution's latest prospectus on the issuance of its shares and, if applicable, the related corporation will be needed. - Limits applicable to the branches, in accordance with the corresponding international treaty or agreement, will be based on information provided by the local supervisory commission of the type of branch being dealt with. - Concerning the sole results of the presentation to which this rule (second transitory) refers, a request will be considered complete whether it has the authorization referred to in various clauses. Concerning the results stemming from a calculation of the time limits referred to in NAFTA Article 1411, when applicable, an authorization and legal opinion must be presented; these are essential for authorizing the corresponding request.
