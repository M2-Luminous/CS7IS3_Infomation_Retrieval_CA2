Commenting on their calls, Georgiy Satarov, an adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday [8 January] that under the new Russian Constitution "the president of the Russian Federation... As of the day this constitution enters into force shall execute his powers established thereof until the expiration of his term of office for which he has been elected." This provision can be changed by two thirds of the state Duma, two thirds of the Federation Council and as many of the subjects of the federation. Additionally, attempts to question the will of the voters by any party would mean disrespect for their opinion, Satarov said. At the same time, Satarov, who also heads the Russian Social and Political Centre which groups over 20 parties, believes that the "state, if it is interested in normal communication with society, should provide material support to all political parties irrespective of their political orientation because it is the parties that perform the function of such communication." If the state intends to maintain the dialogue with society, it should find out, with the help of parties, and take into account public interests in its policy, Satarov added. He noted that as far as multi-party system is concerned, "we are still living by the old Soviet legislation which does not differentiate between the types of public organisations." According to Satarov they are divided into three groups. Political parties are one of them. "Because they (political parties) participate in the formation of such important substance as power, political parties should be absolutely `transparent' for society and the state," he said. In other words, citizens have the right to know what goals are pursued by such parties, who finances them and how they spend their money. Under the current legislation, this cannot be found out because it is impossible to differentiate between political parties and non-political organisations. Apart from political parties, there are also non-political organisations in Russia, including human rights, youth, children organisations and others. "The state can and should effectively use such organisations to pursue its policy, for example provide support for the family, victims of repressions and so on." Satarov believes that these organisations would carry out their functions and use state funds more effectively than the structures within the presidential administration. "In all civilised countries the state tries to hand over such functions to public organisations," Satarov noted, stressing that the state should retain the right to control their expenditures. Additionally, there are sort of interest clubs which unite philatelists, dog owners, plant growers and others. They act independently from the state and solve their problems on their own. Satarov emphasised that "there should be three different legislations for different public organisations." But in Russia which has no normal civil society, its formation cannot be left without the participation of the state. The Russian Social and Political Centre has been established as a means of the state's participation in this process. As a state structure, the centre provides information and analytical materials to all branches of power. Recently, Satarov appealed to President Boris Yeltsin, urging him to work out a new legislation applicable to different types of parties and public organisations and taking into account the new realities of Russian life.
