UN area security coordinator Stafford Clarry delivered the warning Monday to Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, who lead respectively the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK]. One hundred people at least were killed in heavy fighting between the KDP and the PUK that erupted early this month and ended a week ago. Barzani and Talabani "should realise that the international community has not chosen to remain in Iraqi Kurdistan .. so they can engage in armed conflict among themselves," read Clarry's warning. The message, a copy of which was given to AFP, stressed that the UN presence aims at providing the Kurds with "protection against an external threat", in a reference to Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's government. The KDP and the PUK have controlled a major part of northern Iraq since an uprising following the February 1991 defeat of Iraq in the Gulf war. The US and its allies imposed an air-exclusion zone over northern Iraq to keep out Iraq warplanes and protect the Kurds. Clarry, an American, said the latest clashes will seriously affect the goodwill of donor countries who financially support the Kurds. He also said the clashes have stopped or seriously disrupted the UN aid programs, including water supplies to villages, food distribution and medical services. Most of the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) operating in Kurdistan had to stop their activities during the fighting, although they were pressing ahead with existing programs. The clashes however "may make it difficult to initiate new programs," said Save the Children field director Bronwen Lewis, a Briton. The fighting, which the PUK said was triggered by a personal dispute, has already had a negative impact on the German NGOs, whose coordination and support office in Shaqlawa town was ransacked and its Kurdish guards arrested. The head of the office, Eberhard Walde, said he was recalled back to Germany.
