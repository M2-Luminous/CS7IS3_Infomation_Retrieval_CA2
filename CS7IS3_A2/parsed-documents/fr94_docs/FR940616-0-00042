FR940616-0-00042 FR940616-0-00009 30. For those entities required to file regulatory fees with their applications, such as licensees in the private radio service, we proposed procedures for filing waiver, deferral and reduction requests similar to those we have fashioned for application fee waiver requests. See 47 CFR 1.1115(e). Persons seeking waiver or reduction of a regulatory fee would submit the required fees and forms along with their requests for waiver or reduction. We noted that this procedure assures efficient collection of necessary fees and avoids the possible imposition of a late fee in the event that the licensee's request for waiver or reduction is denied. In the case of standard regulatory fees, we further proposed that the required fee accompany any request for waiver or reduction. In either case, we proposed to return or modify the tendered fee upon grant of the waiver or reduction request. Finally, we proposed that a request for deferred payment of the required fee should be submitted 60 days in advance of the date established for the payment of the fee in order to permit review and action prior to the fee's due date. 31. Several state broadcasting associations (State Broadcasters) in their joint comments, suggest that the public interest would be served by granting permanent or temporary waivers or reduction or deferment of fees to Mass Media licensees who can demonstrate that payment of the fees would impair their service to the public. The State Broadcasters contend that our authority to waive, reduce or defer fee payments in such cases is clear if a showing is made that payment of the fee would result in degradation of service to the public, citing NBC v. United States, 319 U.S. 190 (1943); FCC v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station , 309 U.S. 470 (1940). In order to demonstrate financial hardship, the State Broadcasters urge that they be allowed to submit any relevant evidence, including tax records, unaudited balance sheets or any other financial statements. Further, the State Broadcasters argue that the fee should be automatically waived if a Mass Media licensee is in bankruptcy, receivership or trusteeship because this status is a clear signal of financial hardship. 32. The Broadcasters, joined by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), contend further that the requirement to file the regulatory fee payment with a request for waiver is irrational where the basis for the waiver request is the financial hardship of the licensee. Further, the NAB states that it will be impossible to dispose of waiver requests before the fee payments are due for FY 1994 because of the short period between the completion of this proceeding and the date for submission of fees. Moreover, the NAB stresses that Congress contemplated that there would be situations where the financial burden imposed by the fee requirement would be so onerous that payment should be waived. According to the NAB, if Congress' purpose in providing for waiver, reduction or deferment is to have any practical effect, according to NAB, we should not require applicants requesting waivers for financial hardship to suffer additional financial burden that they cannot afford. 33. We are not persuaded that we should modify our proposal to generally require the filing of the regulatory fee with each waiver or reduction request. Rather, we continue to believe that our current procedure will help ensure efficient collections. 34. Nevertheless, we recognize that there may be exceptional instances in which requiring payment of the regulatory fee along with a waiver or reduction request could result in the reduction of service to a community or other financial hardship to the licensee or other regulatee. In those instances, the licensee should submit, together with its waiver request, a petition to defer payment until the waiver request is resolved. In order to reduce the burden on regulatees, we will accept petitions for waiver, reduction and deferment so long as they are filed no later than by the date payment is due. The filing of the deferment request will toll the requirement to pay the regulatory fee until disposition of the deferment request. 13 13 We deny NABER's request that we modify the fee that Congress required for filing a petition for waiver of a private radio service rule. Section 8 of the Communications Act empowers us only to adjust fees for applications and other filings based upon changes in the Consumer Price Index. 35. Petitioners seeking a waiver, deferral or reduction of a regulatory fee based upon financial hardship may submit any relevant information in support of their request. We will review the supporting documents and base our ruling upon the information submitted and any additional information available in our records. If a petitioner presents a compelling case of financial hardship, no payment of the regulatory fee will be due. If the supporting materials do not present sufficient evidence of hardship, we will deny the petition. If the fee has not already been submitted, the petitioner will then have 30 days to file its regulatory fee in order to avoid the assessment of penalty charges and the invocation of any other available remedy. The filing of a petition for reconsideration will not toll this 30-day period. D. Procedures for Payment
