[Vigneron] Former Western advisers to the Russian Government -- including Jeffrey Sachs -- have had very harsh words for the conditions the IMF has forced upon Russia. Do you agree with them? [Fedorov] Their criticisms are excessive. True, the IMF's approach was not always appropriate and its procedures lack flexibility. However, the principle of enforcing conditions must not be compromised: One must never give Russia money without demanding guarantees with respect to economic stabilization. In 1993, it was possible to meet the Fund's requirements (budget deficit down to 5 percent of GDP and inflation down to 5 percent monthly by year's end). These goals were the reason behind everything I did as finance minister. Unfortunately, 60 percent of my program could not be implemented due to the government's lack of financial discipline. Let me give you one single example: I proposed last year to cancel some 50 decisions approving expenditures for which no funding had been found. To no avail. In Russia, the government decides on an expenditure first, and then it looks for ways to fund it. How do you conduct a stabilization policy in such conditions? [Vigneron] How were your relations with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin? [Fedorov] In the West, people find it hard to understand that a finance minister could disagree with the head of government as to which policy is appropriate. We had frequent rows. But frankly, I do not think Viktor Chernomyrdin is very conversant with economic mechanisms. However, he is a born politician. This is why he gave me his support every time I was able to convince him that he would benefit politically from a particular economic decision. Mark my word: To secure financial assistance from the West, Viktor Chernomyrdin will make all the promises asked of him with respect to budgetary and monetary rigor. Then, of course, he will break them. [Vigneron] What do you think the West can do now to support the reform process in Russia? [Fedorov] Western assistance must be channeled in two directions. On the one hand, it must contribute to funding private projects, as this creates jobs and stimulates related activities. On the other hand, technical assistance to training must be emphasized. Giving 10,000 people the training they need in the new economic context is far more effective than having 10,000 Western experts churn out studies or reports.
