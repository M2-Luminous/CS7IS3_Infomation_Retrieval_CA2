Organised by Umm al-Ma'arik research centre at al-Rashid Hotel, the symposium was attended by a large number of Arab and foreign writers and media men. More than 30 research papers in Arabic and foreign languages were discussed during the symposium. The discussions were mainly focused on three main topics namely political and economic hegemony, and facts distortion and lies discrimination by Western media to manipulate the world public opinion. Addressing the opening session, head of Umm al-Ma'arik research centre Dr. Muhammad Mudhaffar al-Adhami said the symposium aims at exchanging views to reach scientific analyses and conclusions away from effects of the world super powers. Chaired by Arab thinker Muta' al-Safadi, the first session discussed political hegemony. In his speech, Mr. al-Safadi said the symposium helps bring together Arab and foreign writers who wrote about Umm al-Ma'arik battle and who had not the chance to meet before, adding that the symposium will help expose facts and reveal the real intentions of the U.S.-led aggression against Iraq. During the said session a large number of research papers were discussed, among them were papers on various books written on the Gulf war. They include Jeff Archer's "The Sledge Hammer and the Ant;" Muhammad Ahfood's "The Gulf War, a Test for International Legitimacy;" 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Jawhari's "The Arab Gulf and the Allies War on Iraq;" Noam Chomsky's "On U.S. Gulf Policy;" Pierre Salinger and Arabic Loran's "The Secret Dossier of the Gulf War;" Dr. 'Awad Butrus' "Gulf War, Who Is Responsible;" and Colin Edwards' "Turning Ploughshares Into Swords in U.N." Research papers on Ramsey Clark's book "The Fire this Time" and Michel Jobert's "Journal Du Golf" were also discussed. The second session, held on Thursday, was dedicated to economic hegemony. Speaking at the session, Dr. 'Abd-al-Illah Beliqzeez (Tunisia) said goals behind the U.S.-led aggression on Iraq are clear and well known, saying that the United States aimed at controlling wealth sources. He added that the U.S. tried to hit Iraq as it represents a power in the region that threatens its interests. Dr. Beliqzeez went on to say that the U.S. and its allies are currently heading towards dismembering the Arab region. A number of papers on economic hegemony were presented during the session. They included among others papers on "The Palestinian Intifadah and Gulf Convulsion" by Ahmad Sidqi al-Dajani, "America and the Secrets of the Gulf War From Carter to Bush" by Dr. Nabil al-Samman, and "America Invades the Gulf" studies of the American Congress translated by Wajih Radi. The third session was devoted mainly to the misinformation and fact distortion and lies disseminated by Western media. During the session chapters from Michel Collon's book "Attention Medias" were reviewed and discussed. The book reveals and exposes America's immoral practices and big lies disseminated by Bush administration to promote its war policy. The book also made it clear that prior to the military aggression against Iraq, Bush administration launched a smear media campaign to distort Iraq's image. The researcher from Belgium shed light on the mechanism and status of the Western media saying that four factors determine the functioning of the Western media organs, chief among which is the financial control of the multi-national firms on Western media and the subordination of the media organs to the said firms and the authority, noting that media organs were obliged to beautify the image of the government to maintain good relations with the said firms and the government which supported them financially. The participants on Wednesday visited al-'Amiriyah shelter which was bombed by specially designed bombs to rip through shelters. On Thursday, the participants visited a museum that documents the scale of damage inflicted upon Iraq's infrastructure by U.S.-led war and outcome of the postwar nationwide reconstruction drive. In the evening, the participants listened to lecture delivered by Dr. Muhammad Mudhaffar al-Adhami on the origin of Kuwait.
