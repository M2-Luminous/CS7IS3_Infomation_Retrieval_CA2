With respect to the African economic integration, an encouraging sign is that the number of the countries has increased to 34 that have ratified the treaty on the establishment of the African Economic Community, which was signed by the African leaders in Abuja, new capital of Nigeria, in June 1991. With the ratification by one more country, the treaty will come into force. Besides, progress has also been made in regional economic integration in 1993 in the western, eastern and southern parts of the continent. Treaties on the establishment of regional common markets have been signed to facilitate the inter-regional trade and economic development. In order to promote the intra-Africa trade, the African Development Bank (ADB) took the initiative in establishing the "African Export-Import Bank" in Cairo, while the U.N. secretary-general has proposed the establishment of a commodity diversification fund for Africa. Those efforts have obviously demonstrated the eagerness and determination of Africans to overcome the economic crisis and step up the economic development on the continent. As regards the economic situation of Africa in 1993, many countries have appeared to set on course to harvest the benefits of peace. The U.N. Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) estimated that the economic growth in Ethiopia might reach 9.3 percent, 5.3 percent in Mozambique and 7.1 percent in Uganda due to the relative peace and stability in the countries. However, the economic situation in Africa as a whole was still marked by a meagre growth in 1993. According to an ECA preliminary estimation, African economy grew by only 1.4 percent in the year, representing an improvement over the 0.7 percent growth of 1992. This is barely half of the regional population growth rate. Analysts pointed out, in addition to the deep-seated problems including lack of domestic resources, poor infrastructure and domestic political deficiencies, there are three major factors that are hindering the African economic growth. First of all, it is the continuing civil conflicts and political crises in several countries that restrained the economic growth. For example, the economic growth in Zaire is estimated to have dropped by 4 percent in 1993 following a more severe decline of 12 percent in the previous year because of the political unrest resulting from disputes over democratization process in the country. Nigeria's economy may have only grown by about 3.7 percent in 1993, far below the annual average of 6.2 percent in the 1988-1992 period due to political upheaval. The natural disasters, especially the drought that struck eastern and southern Africa in the year, are another factor that has suppressed the economic growth. Due to the worst drought, Zimbabwe's economy is estimated to grow by 1.4 percent in 1993 as compared with the 8.5 percent growth in 1992. Parts of Ethiopia and Eritrea have also experienced crop failures because of the drought. The third factor is the unfavorable international economic environment. The weak growth in major industrial countries led to a sluggish demand for main African products. And the weak demand in turn led to the continuing fall in prices of fuel and non-fuel commodities. As result, Africa's export earnings are estimated to have shrunk by about 2.7 percent to 72 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, following a drop of 1.1 percent in 1992. Besides, external debt has further deteriorated in 1993. According to the ECA, the share of multi-lateral debt of Africa in aggregated debt stock has risen to 24.2 percent in 1993 compared to 20.5 percent in 1992 and 19.5 percent in 1991. This shows that Africa's external debt will be above 275.15 billion U.S. dollars in 1993. Meanwhile, external resources flowing to Africa are declining. According to the latest estimation of the World Bank, sub-Saharan Africa's share of total official development assistance of the bank has fallen from 37.1 percent in 1990 to 36.3 percent in 1992. Net lending commitments by the World Bank to sub-Saharan Africa fell a dramatic 30 percent or 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in its last financial year. Non-project lending to sub-Saharan Africa virtually halved in 1993 to 455 million U.S. dollars from 895 million U.S. dollars the previous year. IMF also reported a downturn in lending to Africa in its latest financial year. The disbursements totalled some 525 million U.S. dollars in the year ending April 30, 1993 compared with some one billion U.S. dollars for the previous year, a fall of nearly 50 percent. All those factors have added more difficulties to the lack of resources of African countries that need capital to develop their economies. With respect to the prospects for African economy in the new year, it does not allow much optimism because all the factors that have hindered the African economic performance in 1993 will remain a constraint to the growth. Besides, with the loss of some preferences conceded to Africa after the GATT Uruguay Round agreement was signed and with the reduction of aid and resources flowing to Africa from World Bank and other international institutes, Africa will face more crises. In face of the challenge, Africans have uttered stronger voice for self-reliance and intra- Africa cooperation in developing the continent's economy.
