Noting that the U.S. imperialists have deliberately massed their Armed Forces and deployed nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula, systematically violated provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement and paralyzed even the armistice observation mechanism, the joint statement says: We call upon all the peoples and peaceloving governments of all countries to firmly unite to defend world peace and denounce the U.S. imperialists' illegal acts of aggression. We consider that the DPRK's proposal to replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement is justifiable under the current situation and practical measures should be taken immediately to establish a peace arrangement on the Korean peninsula. We will stand firm on the side of the DPRK Government and people who have struggled for peace and security on the Korean peninsula.
