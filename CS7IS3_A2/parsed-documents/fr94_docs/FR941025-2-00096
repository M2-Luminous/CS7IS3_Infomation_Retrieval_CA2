The notice was published in the Federal Register on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41793). At the request of the company, the Department again reviewed its certification for the workers of Spartan Undies/Imerman, Inc., in Spartanburg, South Carolina.

The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports. Accordingly, the Department is amending its certification to include worker separations at the New York, New York location of Imerman, Inc.
