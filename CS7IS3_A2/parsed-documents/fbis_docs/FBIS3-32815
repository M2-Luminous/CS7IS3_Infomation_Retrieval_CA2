That is what happened to President Nixon, and we all know the consequences he had to face, ending with his resignation from his post. The smoke screen, or lies, to use a strong but realistic word, which the President has created to cover up two events have no justification. The first event is that he violated the Constitution by not consulting the Senate, or if that was not possible, the State Council, before authorizing the transit, not only the transit, but the installation of U.S. troops in various parts of our country. This action, as the State Council members have unanimously agreed, hurts our national sovereignty. The second event is the president's stubborn attempt to hide the truth about the activities carried out by the U.S. soldiers in our country, which have gradually been disclosed. It has been learned that they are not here simply to build a school or a health center at a beach in the Pacific Ocean in Valle del Cauca Department. The accusation of indignity, for which President Gaviria could be judged should the Chamber of Representatives accept the State Council's request, would be the result of constant attempts by the government and its officials to try and hide facts or actions that were finally disclosed or partially revealed with vague or unclear intentions, or carry out actions that violate the laws and regulations approved by the Constituent Assembly. During the current administration, the permanent violation of juridical and constitutional regulations has been almost a normal practice in implementing various economic and political, and even judicial measures. In the case of the agreement signed by the defense minister and the U.S. ambassador supposedly to obtain assistance from military engineers to build facilities that could be built by Colombians, the president invoked an old treaty, from the time of the Cold War, which according to some people has not been ratified by Congress. The treaty and the juridical situation are not the most serious problems he faces. The fact that he took advantage of a congressional recess to infringe on the Constitution by allowing the entrance of foreign soldiers who are currently operating in Juanchaco, in the eastern plains, and the control of some radar that scan our skies are also serious. He did this without consulting the State Council, which was his constitutional duty. Now the State Council has issued an urgent call to the Attorney General, asking him to initiate a possible disciplinary action against the president. It also submitted a unanimously approved statement to the Accusations Commission of the Chamber of Representatives, asking them to take immediate action to determine if the president should face a political and penal trial for his prevarications. The president's attacks on a high body of the judicial branch, like the State Council, are unjust and senseless. He has attributed statements to the State Council which it never made. During his 9 February news conference, he said the State Council's declaration would prevent the appointment of military attaches from other countries. Nowhere in its letter to the president or in its 9 February declaration did the State Council make such a statement. It was also absurd, almost irrational, to describe the members of the State Council or anyone else opposed to the presence of the U.S. soldiers as accomplices of drug trafficking. Are the U.S. soldiers here to implement, using the Vienna Convention, the policy of repression which the United States has already announced will not be applicable in that drug-consuming country, but which is applicable in drug-producing countries with the bloody results we have seen in Colombia? Why were the Colombian people not informed that the detachments sent from a base in Alabama are here for that purpose? Why did the Juridical Secretariat of the Palace threaten Senator Gomez Hurtado with removal from Congress if he dared to inspect the area near Juanchaco? What unspeakable pressure is there behind this drama which has led the State Council to make such a serious decision as the one it recently made by categorically affirming that the head of state broke the oath he made when he assumed the position his compatriots gave him at the polls and which has endangered national sovereignty?
