Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is a revolutionary policy of economic construction that reflects our party's intent to enhance the superiority of socialism of our own style by effecting a new upsurge in economic construction and to consolidate the national economic power by further strengthening our economic independence and self-reliance. The implementation of the agriculture-is-first policy is the most important demand in realizing our party's economic strategy. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: This year is meaningful because it is when the 30th anniversary of the presentation of the socialist rural theses is marked. We should make a new turning point in developing our rural economy by vigorously carrying out the struggle to accomplish the historic tasks of the rural theses. The year 1994 is a meaningful one in which the 30th anniversary of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's presentation of the socialist rural theses is marked. Our people have stoutly carried out the struggle to implement the socialist rural theses under the wise leadership of the party and the leader. By vigorously advancing along the road presented in the rural theses, our people have been able to correctly solve the socialist rural problems without a slightest deviation and an improvement close to a complete realization [wanjonhan silhyone kajang kakkaun kaesone chopkun] of the rural theses is drawing near today. Thus, the rural areas of our country have turned into socialist, cultural rural areas with good living and working conditions, and increasing agricultural production has made it possible to solve the people's food problems more smoothly. With this great result we have already achieved, we should vigorously carry out the struggle to accomplish the historic tasks of the rural theses this year, when the 30th anniversary of its presentation is marked, and completely implement our party's revolutionary economic strategy. Complete implementation of the agriculture-is-first policy is considered to be an important demand in realizing our party's revolutionary economic strategy because it enables us to greatly enhance the superiority of socialism of our own style by improving our people's living conditions. Food problems are the most imminent in the people's material life, and how to solve the problems is one of the important questions that influence the result of socialist, communist construction. With our party's people-oriented policy to smoothly solve the people's food problems, our country supplies sufficient food to our people, who enjoy happy lives without food problems [mogul kokchongul morugo]. The people, however, demand more and more abundant living as their living conditions improve. When we do farming well by implementing the party's agriculture-is-first policy, we can meet the people's ever-increasing demand and can ultimately guarantee the people's happy lives in accordance with the socialist demand. In particular, the thorough implementation of the agriculture-is-first policy is an important demand in fully displaying the superiority of socialism of our own style. The true superiority of socialism can be displayed in various fields of social life, but it can be shown practically in the people's happy, abundant, and material lives. Without properly solving the people's food problems, we can neither talk about the true superiority of the socialist system nor firmly keep it against the enemies's various offensives and denouncements. To highly display the superiority of the socialist system of our own style, we must therefore achieve a century-old desire of our people who want to eat rice and meat soup, wear silk clothes, and live in tile-roofed homes. When we thoroughly implement the agriculture-is-first policy, we can have the people eat plenty of rice and meat soup as well as lead them to constantly raise their standard of living. As a result, we can highly display the superiority of the socialist system. The thorough implementation of the agriculture-is-first policy is regarded as an important demand in carrying out our party's revolutionary economic strategy. This is because we can strongly solidify the country's economic might by strengthening the chuche character and self-reliance of the economy. As are cases in all other sectors, we cannot achieve the self- reliant economy when we depend on other countries regarding food problems. Food problems are very important and essential to the people's material lives. In the people's material lives, starvation is the most difficult to put up with. Therefore, solving the food problems of the people is very important in strengthening the self-reliant economy. Also, agriculture provides various raw materials to the light industry to strengthen its self-reliance and to satisfy the demands of workers for various industrial products. When people have many things to eat, including rice and meat, their consciousness can become much better and everything will be fine. As a result, they can vigorously accelerate the socialist economic construction. To thoroughly implement our party's agriculture-is-first policy, we must successfully promote electricity and irrigation in rural communities and adequately introduce machines and chemicals. Also, we must further develop all sectors of agriculture, including grain production, by thoroughly implementing the chuche farming method. Our working class must produce more modern agricultural machines, including tractors and automobiles, and various farming chemicals, such as chemical fertilizers and agricultural chemicals, and supply them to rural communities. Farmers of cooperative farms and agricultural working people throughout the country must assiduously carry out all agricultural works in a position of being befitting to masters responsible for the nation's rice granaries. As a result, they must surely reach this year's grain production goal put forward by the party.
