It is known, among other things, that, in June, Poland will be visited by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, and we can expect the visit of Boris Yeltsin himself to attend ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw Rising on 1 August. Minister Olechowski confirmed Andrey Kozyrev's international reputation of, as he put it, a splendid interlocutor. In the opinion of the head of our diplomacy, there is a good climate for pushing matters ahead in Polish-Russian relations. We agree with the Russians regarding the objective of Europe without frontiers, the only difference being that we want to achieve this by joining NATO, and the Russians see everything differently.
