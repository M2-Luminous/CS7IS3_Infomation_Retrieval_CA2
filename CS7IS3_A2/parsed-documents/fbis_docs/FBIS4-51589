Kim Chong-mun, chairman of the Higashinari branch of the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon, said that the Korean compatriots in Japan got angry with the fascist crackdown on the prefectural headquarters and its branches by the Japanese police and that they would meet the intolerable challenge of the reactionaries with a united force and make all efforts to defend their organizations and the nation. Kim Ae-min, chairperson of the Higashiyodogawa, Osaka Prefecture branch of the Democratic Union of Korean Women in Japan, said that they would further consolidate the singlehearted unity and counter the suppression by the reactionaries with a struggle. Hong Chang-kwang, director of the organization department of the Taito branch of the Tokyo metropolitan headquarters of Chongnyon, strongly demanded that Japanese authorities immediately stop the crackdown on Chongnyon and Korean residents in Japan, saying that the recent incident is a product of the national chauvinist policy of the Japanese Government authorities. Yi Chu-song, chairman of the Kanto District headquarters of the union of Korean students studying at Japanese schools, warned that if the Japanese authorities continued to pursue the hostile policy against Korea and Korean nation without repentance of their past colonial domination over Korea, they would face the strong denunciation of the Korean residents in Japan and conscientious people of Japan. Kim Chong-kil, director of the International Department of the Fukuoka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon, and Choe In-chol, vice-chairman of the Tokyo metropolitan headquarters of the League of Korean Youth in Japan, denounced the forcible search by the Japanese authorities as total challenge of Japan to Chongnyon. On April 27, officials of Chongnyon organizations of different levels and Korean residents in Japan staged a protest against the Osaka prefectural police headquarters and the Higashi police station of Osaka Prefecture. Branches of the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon held protest meetings.
