ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule is issued pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (the Act) to implement the requirements for contractor certification of indirect costs. Section 2151 of the Act amended Section 306 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 256). This provision extended to the civilian agencies the same certification of indirect costs which is currently applicable to Department of Defense (DoD) contracts, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2324(h). This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before February 17, 1995 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW, Room 4037, Washington, DC 20405.
