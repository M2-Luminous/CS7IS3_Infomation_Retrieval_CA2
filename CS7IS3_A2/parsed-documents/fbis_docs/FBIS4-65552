[passage omitted] The organisation's field coordinator, Jacques Ladyson, told AFP that "until a visit by French ambassador Henry Jacolin, the conditions of our comrades were very difficult. "They were poorly fed, moved here and there, and were given mock executions." "One evening, they were made to walk around in their underpants, with their eyes blindfold, for no apparent reason." The 11 -- 10 men and one woman -- had been held by Bosnian Serbs since April 8, the day after being stopped at the last Serb checkpoint before entering Sarajevo and forced to travel to the Serb-held suburb of Ilidza for a full search. The Serbs refused to allow the team to remain overnight in their vehicles. The next morning, when they returned to their convoy, they found Bosnian Serbs filming ammunition crates, removed from the trucks. The aid workers were immediately detained and accused of gun-running to the Moslems, which the 11 strenuously denied. Their Serb captors initially offered to exchange the group for 11 Serb prisoners held by the Bosnian army, but Premiere Urgence refused. On May 7, the Serbs said that a trial of the aid workers had been put off until early June. A day later they extended their month-long detention for another month. [passage omitted] The 11 were due at Paris's Villacoublay military airport around 11:00 p.m. where they were to be met by Defense Minister Francois Leotard and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. French President Francois Mitterrand expressed "joy" at the release and praised the courage of all aid workers in Bosnia- Herzegovina. [passage omitted]
