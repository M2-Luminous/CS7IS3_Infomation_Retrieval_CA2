Mr Mandela arrived at the club and greeted staff before telling his predominantly white audience his welcome at the club was a sign of the times -- especially in light of the relationship between the petrol from oil giant and the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation] (which has attacked its installations in the past). Asked to comment on this week's National Party federal congress, the ANC leader said: "What is there to say about a party on its way out? The National Party is still a racist party." He requested business people to trust the ANC as its policy mirrored the basic aspirations of all South Africans. He added the ANC was not out to run a campaign of revenge against the people who had jailed party leaders, but rather wanted all South Africans to work together. The country's economy had become stangnant due to years of apartheid and it was up to the ANC and the people of South Africa to stimulate growth. "We would like all of you, especially white businessmen, to help achieve this. We all have a common loyalty to South Africa and we all want to live in peace." Turning to the spate of sabotage attacks on the offices and homes of ANC aligned people and organisations in the [Orange] Free State, Mr Mandela told his audience: "They (ANC homes and offices) are being bombed by people who are demanding to cling to apartheid...It is our people being killed by the right wing...By security organisations and by other black groups...But the whites in this country are totally silent. When there is violence it is sparked off by the right wing and is tolerated by the De Klerk government. Without peace we are not going to get investment from abroad." Mr Mandela added money was being taken out of the country because of the violence. If a right wing inspired civil war broke out, it was not only blacks who would be killed. Whites were destroying the future of their children by not acting stongly enough on the violence sweeping the country.
