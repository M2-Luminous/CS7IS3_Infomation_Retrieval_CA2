Jansen] [Text] Damascus--Now that the tragic death in a car crash of Major Basil al-Asad, the eldest son and heir apparent of President Hafiz al-Asad, has been mourned and a consensus on who will ultimately succeed the president seems to have developed, Syria can get back to its main preoccupation, the peace process with Israel. On the streets of Damascus, one can still see black mourning flags and long black streamers hanging down the facades of buildings while tens of thousands of pictures of Basil are on almost every wall. Although Basil was not a real candidate to succeed his father because at 32 he was eight years too young for the post, his death revealed that for at least five and perhaps 10 years, he was being groomed for leadership through service in the army and as his father's personal assistant, during which time he performed delicate negotiations in Lebanon. Three weeks after his death, a consensus on what the succession will be has emerged. It is expected that there will be no one leader after President al-Asad but a collective leadership of, perhaps, three persons (because a triumvirate is more stable than a duumvirate) while the primus inter pares, eventually, will most probably be 'Abd al-Halim Khaddam, presently the first vice president and for many years the forceful foreign minister and Syrian viceroy for Lebanon. But since Mr. Khaddam is a Sunni Muslim, he would require the backing of the real holders of power, a group of generals belonging to the 'Alawite minority, who, though only 11 per cent of the population, have been the overlords in Syria for over two decades. The succession question out of the way, for the time being Syrian attention switched back to the other major preoccupation, peace with Israel. This, too, has been clarified and by none other than the main Israeli negotiator with Syria, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who on Feb. 11, said that "there was no chance of an Israeli-Syrian agreement"--which is true--in the present format of their talks-- which is untrue. There is nothing wrong with the bilateral format except for the fact that in the talks an irresistible force, Syrian determination, has come up against an immovable object, Israel's intransignce: Syria has not budged an inch from its well-established position that Israel must vacate the whole of the occupied Golan Heights--no return, no peace--and Israel will not budge an inch in refusing to return the Golan only at best the smaller portion of it. The Syrians have almost reached the point of accepting that the Israelis are never going to concede on the Golan. The Syrians will accept this position because they will have no choice. But Israel will not get the peace which it says it wants: "The Arabs cannot make war without Egypt and cannot make peace without Syria." For how long more would Syria be prepared to go on with the present fruitless exercise? -- Perhaps another half year. A recent display of Israel's stubborn arrogance has further convinced the Syrians that that is what is going to happen. They noted the way in which the Israelis slapped their great and good friend U.S. President Bill Clinton in the face when they rubbished his claim that Syrian clarifications at the Geneva summit of what Syria meant by full peace and normalisation were "new" and "very important," which is exactly so. And having been slapped, Mr. Clinton, like a good Christian, turned the other cheek, when a few days ago, his secretary of state announced officially that the U.S. was not going to pressure Israel on withdrawing from the Golan. But because the Israelis, like that other difficult and dangerous people, the Serbs, only make concessions when under pressure, where is the pressure on Israel going to come from when the U.S. has opted out? Perhaps from the Palestinian people in the occupied territories who, individually, are killing individual Israelis on an almost daily basis. That would explain why Damascus is the headquarters of no less than 10 "rejectionist" Palestinian groups which oppose the peace process and particularly the Oslo accord. It would also explain why Damascus refuses to curb the pro-Iranian Hizballah, which maintains pressure on Israeli forces occupying parts of southern Lebanon. The message from Damascus is clear: If there is no peace, there will be an Arab war of attrition against Israelis in occupied Arab territories.
