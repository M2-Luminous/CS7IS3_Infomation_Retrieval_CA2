He said the draft budget is based on several principles, foremost of which is the continuation of the fiscal policies leading to a gradual decrease in the state's general budget deficit and the focus on social issues. The plan also pays attention to enhancing the economic dimension through an integrated group of investment, monetary, credit, and fiscal policies that seek to develop the state's revenues, secure the necessary investment for development and production, enhance the infrastructure, encourage the private sector, and take care of production, as well as taking into consideration current world economic changes. He said that the total expenditure in the draft budget of the year 1994-95 amounts to approximately 70.541 billion pounds against 65.313 billion pounds in the 1993-94 budget.

He added that financing through local and foreign loans amounts to about 8.75 billion pounds and thus the net deficit in the new budget amounts to approximately 488.4 million pounds against 1.338 billion in the year 1993-94. Al-Razzaz said in his statement that the general taxes are estimated at 16.244 billion pounds representing 44 percent of the state's total revenue.
