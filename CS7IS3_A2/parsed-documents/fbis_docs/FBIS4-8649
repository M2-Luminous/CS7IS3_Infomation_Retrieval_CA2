The head of the Defense Ministry objects to the duty imposed by the budget law to buy Polish Iryda planes for the Army. [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] The verdict of the Constitutional Tribunal--should it be favorable to the Ministry of National Defense--will eliminate a dangerous precedent. This would be the first point. The second is that I foresee no problems, since the government draft budget would then be restored, and all the orders placed in the remaining 30 enterprises of the armaments industry would then be implemented in full. At the moment, this money must be found somewhere. It must either be removed from orders already processed by the industry in other enterprises that provide equipment needed by the Army and that fulfill all specifications, or training will have to be cut. This is a matter that is dangerous to the defense capabilities of the country. [end recording] Minister Kolodziejczyk gave an interview for the "Sygnaly Dnia" program. Presidential spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski has said that it is not impossible that Lech Walesa will bring action against the budget regarding that part that refers to the Ministry of National Defense.
