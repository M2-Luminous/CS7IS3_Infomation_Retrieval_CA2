The TEC said in a statement in Pretoria that Ciskei had been given until midday on 28 January to apply for membership of the body but had failed to do so. Earlier, Ciskei withdrew from the Freedom Alliance, which remains opposed to the 26-28 April election. Ciskei's failure to apply for membership of the TEC means that its troops will have to withdraw from the multiparty National Peacekeeping Force, which began training near Bloemfontein on 24 January.
