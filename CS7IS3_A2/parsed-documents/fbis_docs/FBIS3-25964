And it is only one of 193 State mines in the country in the same predicament. The Mineral Resources Law enacted in 1986 stipulates that all mines need licenses from State authorities. Those set up before 1986, mainly State-owned ones, should have additional licenses issued by the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources (MGMR). To obtain these licenses, however, the mining companies first need the approval of local governments on the sizes of the mines. But the sizes are not always easy to determine. Many of the State mines are usually surrounded by newly established local ones. Sometimes their boundaries overlap. Apart from the Datong Coal Mine, there are other big mines still awaiting approval from local governments. These include Yangquan and Fenxi mines in Shanxi Province, Pingxiang Mine in Jiangxi Province and Fushun Mine in Liaoning Province. Licenses for collectively- or privately-owned mines are issued by local governments. But some local authorities have, out of regional interests, approved the establishment of small collectively- or privately-owned mines within the boundaries of existing State-owned mines, which have yet to get their licenses. These small mines are posing a serious threat to large State- owned mines. In Changguang Coal Mine in Zhejiang Province, for example, four small separate mining companies were set up within its boundaries. As a result, the mine has been almost depleted of its entire coal stock. Moreover, the often destructive excavation by the small companies has led to a severe waste in resources and has caused many accidents, said a ranking official from the MGMR, who requested anonymity. Some observers blame the problem on the Mineral Resources Law, saying that the old large- and medium sized State mines should have been granted licenses as soon as the law took effect in 1986. But the MGMR official rejected the accusation. He said that the law should be observed by all concerned. Local governments may face difficult times ahead as some of the smaller, privately-operating mines could be closed down once the boundaries of State-owned mines are determined. The authorities will be expected to compensate the workers made redundant by such a move. Unless these problems are resolved, the law will not be properly observed, the official said. But government rulings alone will not be enough to resolve potential disputes. Instead, careful mediation is needed. In one case in 1990, the official said, local governments were required to make a decision, within a month, whether or not to grant licenses to a State-owned mining company. However, most local government did not carry out the national government directive. To help the mediation process, a vice-minister from MGMR has been put in charge of solving disputes. Last year, 19 mining disputes were settled. By the end of last year, 9,239 or 97.9 per cent of the 9,436 State owned mines were granted licenses. Both central and local governments should make compromises in resolving their conflicts, the official said. Mines that encroach on farm land and pollute the local environment should pay compensation to the local people. Compensation can be made in cash or through other means like providing jobs for the locals. In the meantime local governments should not consider only their own interests. They should recognize that large and medium-sized State mines play vital roles in the national economy. They should also take some responsibility for protecting precious resources. Before disputes are solved, local governments should not approve the establishment of small privately operated mines within the boundaries of State mines, the MGMR official said. If companies are found to be operating in such a manner, the MGMR will report them to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and their licenses will be revoked.
