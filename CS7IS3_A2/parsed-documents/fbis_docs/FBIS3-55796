The event could be considered an exception since previously not a single former Soviet republic had succeeded in getting Russia to assign it cash. The Russian Goskomsotrudnichestvo [State Committee for Cooperation with Commonwealth Members] confirmed that cash worth 30 billion rubles [R] had been imported into Tajikistan and that intergovernment agreements between the two countries have stipulated a sum of R60 billion. Actually all leading workers at the Goskomsotrudnichestvo with whom we talked were very reluctant to provide information and asked not to be named. This behavior is entirely understandable since we can now expect a sharply negative response from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, and some other countries of nearby foreign parts which have sought but have not gotten the same favor from Russia. Why has an exception been made for Tajikistan? One deputy chairman of the Goskomsotrudnichestvo called this a "big exception" made "by force of circumstances." It is not hard to guess what these circumstances are -- the complete collapse of the Tajik economy, the continuing war on its borders, and Russia's interests in this region. On the other hand it is wrong to suppose that Tajikistan has now fully entered the ruble zone and has joined its money area with Russia. Yet this view does exist among Tajik leaders. But the rubles were not supplied for nothing but as a state credit. And on the same terms which have been set for other republics and primarily the transfer of gold and currency reserves to Russia. It is true that there are not so many of these reserves in Russia so the agreement stipulates that the supply of cash be compensated largely through the mortgage of property. But from talks with Goskomsotrudnichestvo staffers it could be understood that the specific establishments to be mortgaged have not yet been determined. In addition the credit has been supplied for six months, during which period Tajikistan must fulfill all terms for really entering the ruble zone. And these terms provide for the complete subordination of the national bank to the Central Bank of Russia, the coordination of tax, customs, and budget policy, and the implementation of economic reforms. If the Tajik leaders manage to do all this within six months then they are relieved of their obligation to service the credit provided to them. Otherwise they will pay in full.
