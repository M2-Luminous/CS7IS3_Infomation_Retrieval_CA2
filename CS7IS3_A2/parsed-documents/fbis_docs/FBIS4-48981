C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, April 30 (CNA) -- Taiwan will seek to sign a multilateral government procurement agreement in line with the Uruguay Round codes of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) sometime next year, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Saturday [30 April]. But, the council noted, Taiwan hopes to follow the example set by Hong Kong and South Korea to postpone acting on the new government procurement agreement until 1996. Previously, Taiwan rejected the agreement because of the great number of state organizations which would be affected. It now needs to sign the accord in order to facilitate its entry into GATT. Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and hopes to become a full member by the end of this year and before GATT is superseded by the World Trade Organization. CEPD Vice Chairman Hsueh Chi said that the council will establish a task force to overhaul Taiwan's government procurement practices to come into line with the GATT requirements. Dozens of rules and regulations concerning government procurement will be revised and updated, Hsueh said. In addition, he said, the base price for open tenders will be lowered and all the bidding procedures will be completely open and transparent. When the domestic government procurement market begins to open, he noted, the government will seek to exclude the International Telecommunications Administration, Taiwan Power Company, Chinese Petroleum Corp., and China Steel Corp. from the agreement. Abrupt market opening might trigger unfair competition and thus adversely affect these state-run companies in view of Taiwan's weak competitiveness in power, telecommunications, energy, and steel, he explained.
