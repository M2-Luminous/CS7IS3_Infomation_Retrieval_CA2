On June 11, puppet Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku and puppet Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu met U.S. State Undersecretary Tarnoff in Seoul and prattled that U.N. Security Council's sanctions against the North are inevitable". This tongue-wagging of the South Korean puppet clique is a never-to-be condoned criminal act to leave fellow countrymen victims of outside forces by realizing "sanctions against North" through the United Nations" by all means by entreating the U.S. and Japanese masters. We solemnly warned the Kim Yong-sam group that "sanctions" against our Republic is immediately a war and a war is merciless. This notwithstanding, the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique are making desperate efforts to get "sanctions" taken against the North with the help of foreign forces. This is a dangerous criminal act which may bring an unpredictable grave situation to the Korean peninsula. The outcries of the Kim Yong-sam group over "sanctions" will precipitate their own destruction. The South Korean puppet clique must act with discretion, clearly mindful of the tragic end.
