I thank you for the trust you have shown in me. My vision of the federation of the Bosniak and the Croatian peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina has always been a positive one. For me, beside other things, the federation means the inescapable and as rapid as possible closure of all trenches between the forces of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. The federation means the opening of all communications for free passage of goods, people, and capital. The federation means the return of each exiled person to his own home. The federation means directing our armed forces and all other antifascists forces against the Serbian fascism if a just peace cannot be achieved through negotiations. The federation means the reanimation of the transportation and economic backbone, from Brcko to Neum and from Capljina to the Usora River. The federation is the best guarantee for the preservation of the internationally recognized borders of our country. The establishment of the federation is the biggest strategical defeat of the Serbian fascism. This is a Stalingrad of the idea of Greater Serbia. The federation means the normalization of all relations between our country and the Republic of Croatia and their joint international economic cooperation with a great number of countries who are Bosnia's friends. The federation is a joint historic interest and, let us be frank, also a marriage of convenience. Marriages that are based on joint interests, as experience shows us, are stable, long-lasting, serious, and prosperous. Gentlemen, deputies and representatives! I feel the need to also issue a message to the part of the Serbian peoples who stood for the Serbian fascism, that is, to the so-called Karadzic's Serbs. My message to them is: Condemn the crimes, return whatever is not yours, and join the federation. Learn to respect human rights, organize your cantons to suit the norms of the civilized world if you want to be a part of it. Do not plan on bringing up your children on foreign soil, in foreign homes, on foreign property. Those who base their future on seized property do not have a future. [applause] For this reason, the leaders of the czarist Serbian Democratic Council are, en masse, buying villas for their children in Cyprus. Remember that any type of fascism has always been defeated. This was my message. Gentlemen, deputies and representatives! Wars, sorrows, fires, occupations, [word indistinct], and horrors of all sorts have ravaged this suffering country of Bosnia. However, Bosnia has always survived and, as they say, defiant with dreams, it has always resurrected more beautiful and proud than before. On us, gathered in this hall, the resurrection of Bosnia greatly depends. Finally, I would say something entirely personal, with your permission. Whenever I am entrusted with a responsible and difficult task, I remember my deceased mother and father who taught me to do any job thoroughly and finish it. Thank you! [applause]
