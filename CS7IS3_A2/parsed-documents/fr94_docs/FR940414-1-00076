The employment losses are likely to overstate substantially actual impacts because of the use of a maximum employment impact multiplier and because non-sample facility impacts (for which an impact location is unknown) are assumed to occur in the same MSA as the sample facility is located. In fact, the non-sample facility employment impacts are likely to be distributed among these and other unknown MSAs in a way that does not yield as high a concentration of impacts at the sample facility locations as indicated in this analysis.
