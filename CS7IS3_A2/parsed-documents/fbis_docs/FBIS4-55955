The State of the Crops Is Good"--first paragraph is NEPSZABADSAG introduction] [Text] Thanks to the favorable spring weather, the state of the winter grains is extremely good. That was the most important conclusion from the aerial inspection to which Laszlo Medgyasszay, political state secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, invited the press. When viewed from the air, it is striking that cultivation of large plots is still predominantly typical of crop production. Although there are small plots here and there, some of the new smallholders are leasing their land to large-scale farms. And one encounters also spontaneous associations. There is substantially less land left fallow: 250,000 hectares, 5 percent of the sowing area. The experts accompanying the reporters pointed out that the absence of artificial fertilizers in recent years is evident on the fields. At the press conference following the aerial inspection, the additional information was supplied that, in spite of everything, the situation has improved this year in comparison with recent years: the amount of artificial fertilizer applied this year was double the amount used last year, but several more years would be needed for agriculture to attain the level needed for high quality crop production. At the news conference after the inspection, the political state secretary also said that the submitted applications for loans from the Agricultural Development Fund would be judged between 1 and 15 May. It seems that the fund's present allocation would not be enough to satisfy the entire demand for loans. Therefore the applications are being arranged in the sequence they were received. The applications for which the money in the fund has run out will not be rejected for good. Instead, they will be set aside until the fund will have been replenished. For the time being, the state secretary has been unable to make a definite promise as to when that would happen.
