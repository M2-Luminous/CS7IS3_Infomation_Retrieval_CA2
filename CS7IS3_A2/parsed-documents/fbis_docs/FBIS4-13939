This incident has raised questions regarding the U.S. military command and their troops who have the most advanced tracking and identification equipment. The lack of motivation and interest in military operations, and the disordered state of U.S. soldiers in other parts of the world are among the causes of such incidents. The U.S. forces have the most advanced equipment at their disposal but they are becoming weaker by the day. These disasters can be attributed to the Somalia crisis and the Persian Gulf war. At present U.S. military capability in various operations all over the world is being questioned, and Pentagon officials have to respond to official inquiries into such disasters. The incompetence of the U.S. forces becomes clearer when such incidents occur and this will certainly have an adverse impact on military relations between the United States and its allied countries. The U.S. allies should review their military relations with Washington as a matter of course, especially if they wish to eliminate, or at least reduce, such incidents. U.S. military officials are also under pressure from their own people, who do not wish to see their offspring killed for the ideas of these officials. In any case, in view of the increasing U.S. military intervention around the world, the frequency of such incidents will increase proportionately. Such incidents are possible in every part of the world where the U.S. troops are deployed.
