FR940406-0-00037 FR940406-0-00002 (2) Such notice shall contain: (i) The date of acceptance of the class complaint by the Board; (ii) A description of the issues accepted as part of the class complaint; (iii) An explanation of the binding nature of the Board's dismissal, final decision or resolution of the class complaint on class members; and (iv) The name, address and telephone number of the agent of the class or, if represented, the representative. (e) Obtaining evidence concerning the complaint. (1) Upon the acceptance of a class complaint by the Board, the administrative judge shall notify the agent of the class and the Board's representative of the time period that will be allowed both parties to prepare their case. This time period will include at least 60 days and may be extended by the administrative judge upon the request of either party. Both parties are entitled to reasonable development of evidence on matters relevant to the issues raised in the class complaint. Evidence may be developed through interrogatories, depositions, and requests for admissions, stipulations or production of documents. It shall be grounds for objection to producing evidence that the information sought by either party is irrelevant, overburdensome, repetitious, privileged, or that production would be unlawful. (2) If mutual cooperation fails, either party may request the administrative judge to rule on a request to develop evidence. If a party fails without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely fashion to a request made or approved by the administrative judge for documents, records, comparative data, statistics or affidavits, and the information is solely in the control of one party, such failure may, in appropriate circumstances, cause the administrative judge: (i) To draw an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information; (ii) To consider the matters to which the requested information pertains to be established in favor of the opposing party; (iii) To exclude other evidence offered by the party failing to produce the requested information; (iv) To recommend that a decision be entered in favor of the opposing party; or (v) To take such other actions as the administrative judge deems appropriate. (3) During the period for development of evidence, the administrative judge may, in his or her discretion, direct that an investigation of facts relevant to the class complaint or any portion be conducted. (4) Both parties shall furnish to the administrative judge copies of all materials that they wish to be examined and such other material as may be requested. (f) Opportunity for resolution of the class complaint. (1) The administrative judge shall furnish the agent of the class and the Board's representative a copy of all materials obtained concerning the class complaint and provide opportunity for the agent of the class to discuss the materials with the Board's representative and to attempt resolution of the class complaint. (2) The class complaint may be resolved by agreement of the Board and the agent of the class at any time as long as the agreement is fair and reasonable. (3) If the class complaint is resolved, the terms of the resolution shall be reduced to writing and signed by the agent of the class and the Board. (4) Notice of the agreement of resolution shall be given to all class members in the same manner as notification of the acceptance of the class complaint and shall state the relief, if any, to be granted by the Board. An agreement of resolution shall bind all members of the class. Within 30 days of the date of the notice of the agreement of resolution, any member of the class may petition the Commission to vacate the agreement of resolution because it benefits only the agent of the class or is otherwise not fair and reasonable. Such a petition will be processed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and if the administrative judge finds that the agreement of resolution is not fair and reasonable, he or she shall recommend that the agreement of resolution be vacated and that the original agent of the class be replaced by the petitioner or some other class member who is eligible to be the agent of the class during further processing of the class complaint. The Board may determine, with respect to the petition, that the agreement of resolution is not fair and reasonable, which vacates any agreement between the former agent of the class and the Board. The Board's decision to vacate the agreement of resolution shall be communicated to the former agent of the class and to the petitioner, and shall inform them of their right to file a request for review with the Commission under §268.401 of this part. A copy of EEOC Form 573, notice of Appeal/Petition, shall be attached to the Board's decision pursuant to §268.209(b)(5) of this part. (g) Hearing. On expiration of the period allowed for preparation of the case, the administrative judge shall set a date for a hearing. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with §§268.208(a) through (f) of this part.
