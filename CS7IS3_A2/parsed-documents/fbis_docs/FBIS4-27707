FBIS4-27707 "dreas107__a94010" FBIS-EAS-94-107-A Daily Report 3 June 1994 ANNEX Japan MPT Savings Bureau/Fund Operation MPT Savings Bureau/Fund Operation Division--Investing Postal Savings', Supporting PKO 11111111 [15 Feb 94 p 2] 11111111 [15 Feb 94 p 2] CSO With a 180 trillion yen balance on account, postal savings make up 30 percent of all individual savings and deposits nationwide. The job of the Fund Operation Division is to invest these funds and to provide for their repayment to depositors and savers. This is not to say the MPT has the entire amount to invest. Once customer deposits are transferred to the Fund Operation Department of the Ministry of Finance, most of it is lend to government-related financial institutions or used to underwrite government bonds. Only the remainder is available for the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to invest at its own discretion. These funds are called "financial deregulation countermeasure funds" [hereafter, "response funds"] and can be borrowed from the Fund Operation Department to be invested by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. Estimates for fiscal 1993 place the total amount of postal funds on deposit with the Fund Operation Department at 10.4 trillion yen; about 4.75 trillion yen will be returned to the MPT as response funds. Of the outstanding balance, approximately 180 trillion yen at the end of fiscal 1993, about 25 trillion yen is expected to be invested by MPT at its own discretion. Kiyoshi Mori (Class of 1973) assumed the head post in the Fund Operation Division in 1992. A veteran in the telecommunications field, this is his first assignment in the Postal Savings Bureau, but he is proving to be an able leader, bringing fresh, new ideas into the division. When entering the division, one's eyes are drawn to a magnificent dealing room in the back. At meetings convened at 0830 every morning, dealers exchange information with each other, including their views on the previous day's activities and trends on foreign markets. They then begin their day's work. There are 16 dealers. Often the division receives advice on investments from organs affiliated to the ministry like the Postal Savings Fund Research Association--a collection of "investment pros" who are on loan to the association from various securities firms. About one-half of all response funds which are targeted for investments are put into government and regional bonds. These funds are also invested in corporate bonds, bank debentures, and foreign bonds. Again, of the funds placed in designated unit investments, which are handled by trust banks via the Postal Life Insurance Welfare Corporation (an affiliate of the MPT), some are directed into stocks. Designated unit investments fall into one of two categories: "new designated units" place no restriction on the amount that can be invested in stock ([unit] investments in fiscal 1993 amounted to 500 billion yen); "old designated units" limit such investments to 30 percent of the total ([unit] investments in this case amounted to 450 billion yen in 1993). There has been no indication of what percent of the division's investments have gone into the stock market, nor what issues were bought. All one is told, according to Chief Mori, is that the division's "investments are undertaken with the objective of maximizing profit returns to the [depositor]." One thing that has been said about "public funds" like postal savings deposits, however, is that they have played an important role in maintaining stock prices through the government's PKO (price-keeping operation) policy. Nor does there seem to be an end to speculations circulating on the market about the Fund Operation Division. [17 Feb 94 p 2] [Text] MPT Post Office Life Insurance Bureau/Operations and Planning Division--Racking Brains To Come Up with a New Product The Post Office Life Insurance Bureau's Operations and Planning Division seems to have a counterpart in private enterprise: it is responsible for developing new products. In this case, a new insurance plan with new coverage terms and new incentives to join. Staff launches a new product every year after coordinating its efforts with government organs like the Ministry of Finance. The work of coordinating its plans with the Ministry of Finance progresses in tandem with the ministry's work to draft a new fiscal budget. The outcome of the division's "battle over the budget" this time was mixed. "We lost one round and won a round," says Division Chief Itsuo Ooyu. The round he and his staff won was over a plan to increase annuity payments when the annuitant became bedridden. The round they lost was about a new endowment plan that would pay the insured a one-time, lump-sum payment at the time of childbirth. This plan was rejected by MOF. During the past several years, the Operations and Planning Divisin has been on a winning streak, and in April 1992, the enrollment age for regular old-age insurance was raised from 65 to 70; in April 1993, insurance payments for insurees under special contract were raised; and from January 1994, a combined educational endowment and scholarship annuity plan was started. For its part, the MOF has maintained: "there is no need for a large-scale revision of products every year." Chief Ooyu (Class of 1972), whose area of specialty is operations and systems, is an old hand in the Insurance Bureau. When the issue of establishing an endowment plan paying a lump-sum at the time of childbirth came up, he said he felt the MOF people had dug in their heels and wouldn't budge. "Private insurance was experiencing a slump," he says, "and the ministry had put up its guard with respect to trying to come out with a stronger product." Again, with regard to raising the upper limits for insurance payments (currently set at 13 million yen), it was decided to put the proposal on the back burner for awhile. "We felt it would be useless to try to push it this year," says Ooyu, "so we didn't push it to start with." While he agrees, "the role of the Operations and Planning Division is to strive to respond to subscriber needs," there seems to be a sense within the division that every possible new product has already been thought up, and staff seems to be at a loss for any new ideas. A new unit, the Financial Deregulation Response Office, was set up within the division in June 1991 to respond to reforms in the insurance system. Unlike the Financial Deregulation Promotion Office (in the Postal Savings Bureau), which is busy dealing with the deregulation of interest on current deposits, the Response Office, according to Ooyu, "isn't yet sitting in the hot corner.'" Because MOF's insurance reform hasn't gone very far yet, things are still in the state of preparation. [18 Feb 94 p 2] [Text] MPT Postal Insurance Bureau/Fund Operation and Planning Division--Postal Insurance Funds, Free To Invest the Entire Lot Postal insurance funds, said to total 65 trillion yen (as of the end of fiscal 1992), are different from postal savings and deposit funds in that the entire amount can be invested by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] at its own discretion. The unit which decides on the investment plan is the Postal Insurance Bureau's Fund Operation and Planning Division, which is also involved in reforming the insurance fund system. The actual responsibility for investments falls to First and Second Fund Operation Divisions. One finds that close to 60 percent of all insurance funds as of the end of fiscal 1992 went to financial investment and loan institutes and local public entities as loans or toward the purchase of bonds. Thirteen percent also went into the purchase of corporate bonds, bank debentures, and foreign bonds and another 11 percent was invested in stocks and bonds by way of designated unit investments, which were made by trust banks on behalf of Postal Life Insurance Corporation, an affiliate of the MPT. The chief of the Funds Operation and Planning Division, Michihiro Fujioka (Class of 1975) took up his current post last year after heading the First Fund Operation Division. When it comes to investing postal insurance funds, he is said to have a "feel for the lay of the land." For actual investments, advice is sometimes sought from PI Investment Consultants, a consulting firm that was established in 1993 through funding of the MPT's affiliates. The firm is staffed by personnel on temporary loan from trust banks Operation of the life insurance funds include designated unit investments, which are attracting a lot of attention because of their association with government efforts to maintain stock prices through a PKO (price-keeping operation). Through fiscal 1993, investments in designated units amounted to 7.62 trillion yen. In fiscal 1994 there are plans to add another 1.5 trillion yen. With system reforms slated to take effect next fiscal year, the MPT has attempted to ease the burden on Postal Life Insurance Corporation and, for a certain portion of designated unit investments, has revised rules governing the makeup of portfolios. This revision is the outcome of constant, ongoing negotiations between Fujioka and the Ministry of Finance. At this stage, of all This revision is the outcome of constant, ongoing designated unit funds, 50 to 60 percent are slated for stock investments. "With system reform," says Fujioka, "we will have the kind of environment that should facilitate stock investments." He adds, he would like to "raise our stock investment ratio." [23 Feb 94 p 2] [Text] MAFF Economic Affairs Bureau/Agricultural Cooperative Division--Helmsman for Agricultural Cooperative Administration As the troubles of housing loan companies, carriers of large amounts of nonperforming loans, continued to surface during the summer of 1992, concern spread among financial institutions that were affiliated with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] who were also providing housing-related loans. The group involved in hammering out measures to respond to the crisis together with the Ministry of Finance and Bank of Japan was MAFF's Agricultural Cooperative Division. The division oversees Agricultural Cooperative Credit Unions, who have been having a hard time since the collapse of the bubble economy. Agricultural cooperatives are organized on three levels: on the local level, there are the Individual Municipal Agricultural Cooperatives; then, there is the Prefectural Credit Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives; and finally, the Norinchukin Bank. The Agricultural Cooperatives Division is in charge of the Municipal Cooperatives and the Prefectural Credit Federations. Back in the era when Agricultural Cooperatives were operating in a stable environment, the position of division chief was considered to be a relatively light-weight one though, in fact, the calibre of men who have held this post since 1980 has been on the order of division chiefs like Taichiro Okawahara (currently a Diet man in the lower house), who rose to the rank of vice minister. In any case, the situation for agricultural cooperatives these past several years has completely changed. In addition to a succession of ill-fated securities investments, agricultural cooperatives are carrying housing loans in excess of 6 trillion yen--a situation which has weighed heavily on shoulders of the division. Thus, a special "inspector's office" has been set up within the division to provide inspections of agricultural cooperatives. A succession of able young men have also been assigned to the division to take the helm. Included are former division chief Yoshio Kobayashi (Class of 1973) and Hiroyuki Kinoshita (1971), who currently heads the division. "Because of the self-help nature of cooperatives," says Kinoshita, "government agencies haven't intervened very much in their affairs." But with financial deregulation and the government's decision to liberalize the rice market, "the agricultural industry is at a major turning point in its history and," he stresses, "there's bound to be an understandable distance between us in our positions on some issues." An immediate task is to restructure the corpulent agricultural cooperative organizations. But the idea of merging the Prefectural Credit Federation with the Norinchunkin Bank and thus just having a simpler, two-tiered structure consisting of the central bank, on one level, and the individual municipal agricultural cooperatives, on another level, is moving forward very slowly. When will legislation to promote the merger of the Prefectural Credit Federation and Norinchukin Bank be put before the Diet? The question comes down to the ability of those at the helm of the agricultural cooperative administration. [24 Feb 94 p 2] [Text] MAFF Economic Affairs Bureau/Finance Division--Directing, Overseeing Strategy of Norinchukin Bank A subject that has elicited a lot of talk is the diversification strategy of the Norinchukin Bank. A giant among institutional investors, the Nochukin moves some 40 trillion yen belonging to the agricultural cooperatives. Last year, it formed a securities subsidiary and later a subsidiary investment trust company. Also moving right along are preparations to issue "preferred investment securities," which will come from a broad base of funds. Directing and overseeing this strategy is MAFF's Finance Division. The division is in charge of overseeing and providing direction to the Norinchukin Bank as well as the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Finance Corporation and Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Credit Found, which are two government-affiliated financial institutions. In preparing for the liberalization of rice, the division bears an important role in agricultural administration in such matters as creating a low-interest loan system through the Norinchukin Bank and the Agriculture Finance Corporation. Top executives of the Norinchukin Bank and government-affiliated financial institutions have traditionally come from the "former officials" circle of Agriculture's vice ministers. The Finance Division must also serve as a pipeline between this fraternity of vice ministers and Agriculture's top bureaucrats. Those assigned to the head position in the Finance Division, then, are on an elite course within the ministry. Not a few vice ministers have taken this course, including Sakue Matsumoto (currently chairman, Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Industrial Technology Conference), Fumio Watanabe (Ibaraki Prefecture Governor) and Yoshihiro Hamaguchi (chairman, BRAIN [Bio-Oriented Technology Research Advancement Institute]). The executive ranks also include people who once served as Finance Division chiefs like Economic Bureau Chief Takeki Manabe (Class of 1963). "At the very least, the elite course will lead to a bureau chief's post somewhere within the ministry. According to Fumio Tahara (1972), the man who currently heads the division, "agricultural cooperatives are in a period of unprecedented change." With the bubble's collapse, profits are tight on the local cooperative level as well as on the prefectural level among the credit federations. The third-tier is also having a tough time. According to Tahara, "the Norinchukin Bank is faced with its own investment problems." But the same sense of crisis felt by banks and securities firms still hasn't filtered down into the cooperatives--a fact which is making government policy difficult. Says Tahara, "They have to be more realistic, and be ready to respond to change." [25 Feb 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/General Affairs Division--Financial Administration's "General Manager" On 8 February, the day the government announced its 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package, Toshiharu Kitamura (Class of 1969), General Affairs Division chief in the Ministry of Finance's Banking Bureau, read his carefully prepared report titled "Administrative Guidelines Concerning the Nonperforming Assets of Financial Institutions." The guidelines, intended to bring stability to the financial system, include recommendations for more flexibility with regard to non-tax exempt write-offs, improving the liquidity of interest-exempt credit and giving assistance to financial institutions planning to merge. The report is the work of the General Affairs Division, the Banking Bureau's "general manager." The General Affairs Division is the general managing unit for monetary and fiscal administration and is subdivided into a number of smaller units. The "general affairs desk" manages general administrative matters concerning the various divisions within the Banking Bureau. The "correspondence desk" handles Diet-related correspondence and documents and contacts with other bureaus. The "planning desk" is involved with plans and proposals related to policy matters in general, and the "Bank of Japan desk" manages bureau matters related to the central bank. Thus, the General Affairs Division sees a wide range of incoming intelligence on financial matters. Understandably, the division chief's position is a very important one, and not a few of its alumni have been considered suitable candidates for the Banking Bureau's head post. Kitamura, an old-hand in the Banking Bureau, was promoted to his current position as division chief last June. He is known in financial circles as a conscientious, hard-working official and has earned the trust of his immediate supervisor, Banking Bureau Chief Nobuyuki Teramura (1961). Masamichi Kono (1978), a planning official, is Kitamura's assistant and had a central role in putting together the administrative guidelines for dealing with nonperforming assets. He was also Kitamura's chief assistant when Kitamura headed the Banking Division, and the two again teamed up to cope with the crisis that has followed the collapse of bubble economy. The Financial Markets Office is also under the jurisdiction of the General Affairs Division. The office was created as a small unit in June 1989, but its importance is growing as a "window" for negotiations with the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. Besides attending to the regulation of interest rates on savings and deposits following changes in the official discount rate, the office has recently been involved in negotiations regarding the deregulation of interest on floating deposits, one of the final steps in the deregulation of interest rates. Two separate positions are being taken with regard to the deregulation of interest on floating deposits. On the one hand, financial institutions in the private sector maintain that interest on regular postal savings accounts should follow the lead taken by interest on regular bank deposits. The Ministry of Finance supports this stance. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has opposed it. To get the two sides to come together will likely be a test of the negotiating skills of Toyonari Sasaki (1976), the man (formerly with the Small Banks Division) now in charge of the Financial Markets Office. [1 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/Banking Division--Garrisoning a Broad Territory, Division Is Busier Than Ever The "MOF man in charge." This broad appellation, a popular reference to the men in the Ministry of Finance [MOF] who are in charge of supervising private financial institutions, covers everything from policy to personnel matters. Most frequently, one finds these men in offices of the Banking Division. Because they cover a broad territory--city banks, regional banks, long-term credit banks, and trust banks--they travel many different roads. As a supervisory agency of the government, the Banking Division has to understand everything of importance about the banking industry, from the profit situation of individual banks and the operations of branch offices to their various management plans. Although no longer its responsibility, the amount of nonperforming loans that banks are saddled with, a figure which each bank is now responsible for releasing on its own, was also the Banking Division's job to tally up and report. "It has gotten so that I don't have any time to sit down and talk leisurely with the desk chiefs or division chief's assistant," says the MOF man in charge of city banks. A veteran in this field, he seems astonished at how busy the Banking Division has gotten recently. It means work for the "MOF man in charge." For city banks, the overriding interest at this time is entering the securities field through subsidiary companies. But in consideration of the effect such moves would have on the operations of existing securities firms, the idea of putting limits on the number of such banks entering the field has taken very strong hold. Given this situation, the Banking Division's intentions in its negotiations with the Securities Bureau becomes very important information to have. Another is MOF's response to the nonperforming loan problem. There are, in fact, "a mountain of things" one would like to ask these MOF men. The division chief of Banking, Toshiyuki Tsukazaki (1970), has an unusually wide circle of contacts in the financial world even for someone in the Banking Bureau. During his days as chief of the Research Division, he was involved in drafting the Financial System Reform Bill, which recognized the idea of banks and securities firms entering each other's turf through subsidiary companies, and as chief of the Small Banks Division, was involved in drafting a proposal for the restructuring of housing loan companies. Yoji Ninomiya (1975) is in charge of matters concerning the overseas activities of banks. He was promoted from his position as an assistant to the division chief to his current post as division planning official in view of the impact BIS agreements, such as those concerning capital-to-asset ratio requirements, would have on the operations of the banks. Also commanding some urgency are regulatory groundwork and preparations regarding the introduction into Japan's banking system of netting contracts to settle mutual obligations. [2 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/Special Banks Division--Administrative Guidance, The Dilemma of Public Versus Private The Banking Bureau's Special Banks Division often receives faxed "requests" from politicians. They are almost always a request that special consideration be given to a supporter seeking a loan from one of the government-affiliated financial institutions. The Special Banks Division's main work is to provide supervision and guidance to government-affiliated financial institutions, including the Japan Development Bank, the Export-Import Bank of Japan, and the Housing Loan Corporation. Since these are government-affiliated institutions, politicians seem to think all they need to do is ask and something can be done. But, in fact, says Special Banks Division Chief Kazuto Nishikawa (Class of 1971), "it's impossible to go around intervening in individual cases." The role of government-affiliated financial institutions is to provide long-term, stable funds at a low interest in areas where the private sector response has been inadequate. In other words, these loans are merely meant to supplement private efforts. Because of the government's economic stimulus package, however, public loans are assuming an increasingly larger share of the loan market. Criticism is also growing in the private sector about "the pressure government enterprises are putting on private industry." "There is a lot of misunderstanding in such criticisms," says Nishikawa. Because private lending is stagnant, government activities have come more noticeably to the fore. But, says Nishikawa, "that doesn't mean we've gone too far with government lending." "What would have happened to Japan's economy if we didn't have these government-related activities?" he asks, convinced of the answer. On the other hand, an unusual situation has developed over the past several months. Government-affiliated financial institutions raise funds using the interest from government investments. These funds are then loaned out with interest. Since last November [1993], however, the long-term prime rate has fallen substantially, and the basic interest on their loans are now higher than those of private lenders. This time, critics are charging that, with their higher interest rates, "there's no reason to have public loans." The Special Banks Division thus seems to be caught "on the horns of a dilemma," wedged in between these critics and the fiscal authorities who decide the interest on public investments. As fiscal system reform moves forward, the place of public loans will also be under reconsideration. That seems to put the role of the Special Banks Division at a strange crossroad in time. [3 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/Small Banks Division--Back Stage Maneuverings in Troubled Times During the past several years, the financial sector has been shaken by a series of events--the dissolution of Toyo Credit Bank, the liquidation of Kamaishi Credit Bank, to name just two. Many nonbanks have also undergone management restructuring. According to a Ministry of Finance official, "In each of these cases, the private financial institution has accepted the principle of self-responsibility and have dealt with the problem on their own initiative." Among the majority of those closely involved in such incidents, however, the consensus seems to be that the Small Banks Division played a very strong role. To the degree that strong management skills are needed for such a job, the division chief's position is commonly said to be one of the ministry's more difficult posts. Historically, it seems to have been the place where high-achievers with a lot of experience behind them in the Budget Bureau have come to test their financial skills. Like his predecessors, the current division chief, Atsuo Saka (Class of 1970), has the reputation for being an achiever and is also one of those who have come out of the Budget Bureau. He has also worked in the office of the Private Secretary to the Minister of Finance. The Small Banks Division supervises regional banks, credit unions, and credit cooperatives. Regional fiscal authorities and prefectures have direct supervisory jurisdiction over the credit unions and cooperatives, but the Small Banks Division also has a detailed grasp of their operations, including their profitability and management plans. Given the apparently weak management structures of many regional financial institutions, it seems that reorganization will continue to be a problem for awhile, and the division can expect to receive an increasing number of calls for consultation. Nonbanks, which have an outstanding loan balance totaling 100 trillion yen, are supervised by the Financial Companies Office. The Ministry of Finance lacks the same supervisory authority it has by commercial statute over nonbanks as it exercises over banks, securities firms, and life insurance companies. Because the real estate backed loans of the bubble period have turned into nonperforming assets, causing concern about the stability of the financial system, the ministry set up this office in July 1992. Today, the unit has a staff of six members, who are responsible for matters concerning nonbanks, money-lenders, backed securities, prepaid cards, commodity investments, and special credits. Office chief Takashi Matsumoto (1976) is only the second person to have filled the post. He has had many years experience working in the Budget Bureau, and was also head of the Department of Planning and Development for Kumamoto Prefecture. Among other things, he is currently studying how to increase the liquidity of interest-exempt assets, which are used by special-objective firms. [4 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/Research Division--Fiscal Administration's Think Tank' It was the Research and Investigation Division that handled the desk work for the Financial System Research Committee, an advisory body to the minister of finance. It was the division that worked together with the Banking Bureau to come up with recommendations the idea of allowing banks and securities firms enter each other's turf. This idea forms one of the pillars of financial system reform. Its staff of eleven, though relatively small in size, serves as the Banking Bureau's "think tank." Now that the first stage of financial reform has been completed, the division is tackling the task of defining the direction and the role of financial administration in the post-bubble years. The focus of their inquiry, taking into account the materialization of nonperforming loans and the failure of a succession of financial institutions, asks how such problems might be controlled and eliminated in the future. Last autumn, the division formed the Commission to Investigate Basic Problems, a subgroup under the Financial System Research Committee, which it has now begun deliberations. In January 1994 several commission members, including Tetsuro Nishizaki (an international management consultant), and Research Division Chief Toshio Muraki (Class of 1972), went abroad on a two-week study tour, visiting the United States, England, France, and Germany to study financial administration in each of these four countries. They are planning to put together their findings sometime around June [1994], indicating the future direction for financial administration as it pertains to Japan. According to Muraki, "While businesses and service fields are being deregulated, there are tougher regulations now on the level of government supervision." In his opinion, the trend is toward tougher administrative regulation. The division also serves as staff for the Commission to Investigate Basic Problems, as well as the desk work for a task force working on disclosure and a special committee on electronic banking (EB). The disclosure task force reconvened at the end of March [1994] to begin an inquiry into what kind of information is needed to to reflect off-balance transactions. In the EB committee, members will be looking into regulations regarding electronic transactions by financial institutions. The ways things stand, securities firms, through their subsidiary companies, may enter areas that were exclusively the domain of banks before. From this summer [1994], however, the division will be reconsidering some areas, including matters such as the "fire wall" [banning exchanges of information about customers] between parent and subsidiary companies and limits to the type of business or services subsidiary companies may engage in. The head position in the Research Division, often filled by young men on a seniority basis, has become another "gateway to success" within the Banking Bureau. One of those who passed through this gateway is Masaaki Tsuchida (1959), who after becoming Banking Bureau chief, went on to head the National Tax Administration Agency. [8 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Banking Bureau's Insurance Department/First Insurance Divivion--Change Urgent for Life Insurance Guidance Under Adverse Trend Management of the insurance companies is facing a crossroads. While fund operations is become increasingly difficult in view of the historically low interest rates, participation by individuals has stalemated and earnings opportunities are declining. At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks which ended in a rupture, the opening of Japan's insurance market became an debating point. Even Satoshi Nishikawa (MOF class of 1971), who was transferred from director of the Second Insurance Division with jurisdiction over casualty insurance companies to director of the First Insurance Division in charge of life insurance companies and is well-versed in both life and casualty insurance, says: "No one could possibly predict such changes." The mainstay and small and medium life insurance companies are faced with the consequences of a sharp decline in hidden stock profits and the high yield in mass volume during the bubble economy, and business operations have deteriorated markedly. Director Nishikawa calls for an awareness reform among managers, saying: "In the future, management premised on improved earnings will not be possible." In addition to granting business licenses to life insurance companies, the First Insurance Division issues permits for new commodities and services. It also periodically checks operational content and provides guidance on fair methods for the use of assets and accounting processes. Given the complex and specialized knowhow necessary for insurance computation to determine premiums, two "accountant officials" are assigned to the division. A momentous task of insurance system reform awaits the insurance industry. The core consists of approving mutual entry between banks and securities through insurance company subsidiaries, and combined business operations by the main life and casualty insurance companies in the three areas of injury, disease, and nursing-care, in addition to deregulation formulas to determine insurance premium rates. In July 1993, a research office was established within the Insurance Division to perform the enormous task of completely revising the Insurance Industry Law written in the "katakana" syllabary. A revision bill is scheduled for submission to the ordinary Diet session in 1995. Kimio Yamaguchi (class of 1967), director of the Insurance Department, has served in principal the MOF posts including budget examiner in charge of Agriculture and Forestry and director of the MOF Secretariat's Audit and Planning Division. Although this is his first assignment in the Insurance Department, he is evaluated highly for his sound management. [9 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Banking Bureau's Insurance Department/Second Insurance Division--In the Forefront of Casualty Insurance Management and General Consultation The six months from last fall to February 1994 was an unusually busy period for the Second Insurance Division of Insurance Department, Banking Bureau. The insurance talks at the Japan-U.S. economic framework conference, centering on the Second Insurance Division, eventually ended in a "rupture" at the Japan-U.S. summit on 11 February [1994]. However, Director Toyomi Takimoto (MOF class of 1972) who was in the forefront appears disappointed about the breakdown in negotiations, saying: "Except for the numerical targets, it was generally possible to reach an agreement." The Second Insurance Division is in charge of guidance and supervision of the casualty insurance industry. Concretely, its main duties consist of licensing casualty insurance businesses, approving insurance commodities, and overseeing assets operation and accounting procedures by casualty insurance companies. Liaison with companies is indispensable, and responsible MOF officials constantly visit officials of the Second Insurance Division. The Second Insurance Division has stood in the forefront of the First Division which handles life insurance whenever framework talks are held because the United States has presented priority demands for expansion of entry by foreign companies into the field of casualty insurance. For example, it has demanded introduction of the "broker system" which will have a major impact on casualty insurance companies. Director Takimoto and his aides have found it necessary to travel to the United States almost monthly since September and to spend virtually all their energies in overall discussions. From Japan's standpoint, there are many "unreasonable" points in the U.S. demands. For example, 12 states have not inducted the broker system in the United States. Also, regarding cancer insurance which is dominated by U.S. insurance companies, it seeks to defer discussion of liberalization of the so-called "third area." The situation was reportedly one of "saying whatever one pleases." However, many portions in the U.S. demands overlap with the insurance system reform currently under study by the Japanese side. The Second Division director expects a future reopening of negotiations and says: "Understanding by the U.S. side will definitely be won through steady progress toward system reform." The overall discussions on insurance system reform has somewhat delayed due partly to a shortage of time. The zeal of casualty insurance companies has reportedly cooled down due to the burst of the bubble economy. Much is expected of the prowess of Director Takimoto who was present during the financial system reforms as a councilor of the Cabinet Legislative Bureau. [11 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Minister's Secretariat/Research and Planning Division--Dual Role of "Brain" and Policymaking The Research and Planning Division has two aspects. One is the role of an economist group that performs analyses of the economic situation as an MOF think-tank. Its other role is in serving as hands and feet of deputy vice minister for policy coordination and drafting the government's economic policies. The government's economic policies were undertaken twice by the Research and Planning Division since Tadashi Iwashita (MOF class of 1970) became director: once in September 1993 and once in February 1994. Drafting the government's economic policies is responsibility of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA]. However, because public works investment is centered on economic stimulus measure such as expanded government spending and tax reduction, the MOF ultimately becomes the center of policymaking. The Research and Planning Division serves as the window in consultations with other ministries and agencies. It is also the division's duty to persuade the other divisions within the MOF and to draft economic measures as centerpieces of the MOF. It is often caught in a dilemma between the other agencies and the MOF bureaus. Regarding the general economic measures in February when deregulation was one of the centerpieces, an executive of the Research and Planning Division was seen complaining: "It was very difficult to find an effective deregulation measure." In economic policies, monetary measures form the other wheel of the cart with fiscal measures. It is also the Research and Planning Division that is consulted by the MOF as its window when the Bank of Japan [BOJ] raises or lowers official discount rate. Therefore, it constantly exchanges views with the BOJ on the economic situation. Researching and analyzing the economic situation is also an important task of the division. It utilizes the MOF's unique data and other statistics to perform independent analyses such as analyzing the detailed quarterly corporate statistics surveyed by the Research and Statistics Department of the Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy within the MOF. In addition to about 10 analysts who conduct survey on economic trends, there are specialists who are in charge of commodity prices, money supply, and employment following in detail the indicator trends and backgrounds in their specific fields. As a division that drafts policies, elite officials have successively served as its director. Among former officials include Yoshihiko Yoshino (MOF class of 1953), governor of the Japan Development Bank, who also served as administrative vice minister and Toshio Osu (MOF class of 1959), director of BOJ, who served as director of the Financial Bureau. Among the current directors, Masami Ishizaka (class of 1963), director of Financial Bureau, and Takatoshi Kato (MOF class of 1964), director of International Finance Bureau, have served as head of the Research and Planning Division. [15 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Secretariat's Financial Inspection Department/Control Division--Checking Problems of Travel and Operations "Out on business trips two-thirds of the year." The lengthy period of business trips for inspectors in the Financial Inspection Department of the Minister's Secretariat who inspect operations of financial institutions is unparalled within the MOF. Trips to inspect regional banks outside of the capital (Tokyo) region sometimes last more than a month each. There is no impressive layout of policy nor is the work easy. However, the department is truly a pillar of financial administration. The Inspection Department was moved from the Banking Bureau to the Minister's Secretariat in July 1992. Following the exposure of the so-called securities scandals involving compensation of huge losses by securities companies, the MOF's posture was also questioned. Before that, the need for independence of the inspection sectors located within the Banking Bureau and the Securities Bureau respectively was pointed out. The reason was that "unclear" aspects existed such as the internal toleration of unsound trading pointed out by the inspection sectors. As a result, the sector for inspection of securities and exchange became independent as the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission-- an external bureau of the MOF, while the Inspection Department of the Banking Bureau and the sector for inspection of operational problems within the Inspection Division of the Inspection Bureau were merged and moved to the Secretariat. The Banking Inspection Department is divided into the Control Division and the Examination Division. The Finance and Securities Inspectors Office exists within the Control Division, and finance and securities inspectors in the office conduct the actual inspections, with an average of five to seven inspectors assigned to a team. The inspectors from the main ministry cover city banks, long-term credit banks, trust banks, and regional banks including secondary regional banks, in addition to large-scale securities companies. The credit associations and small-scale securities companies are inspected by the Financial Bureaus in the respective regions. The Control Division is also in charge of general affairs of the Banking Inspection Department and sets up inspection plans such as deciding the order of inspections of financial institutions. On the other hand, the Examination Division checks the post-inspection reports submitted by inspectors and the notifications of inspection findings to the financial institutions that point out items to be supplemented or corrected. In addition to its inherent role of checking inspections, the Examination Division examines items submitted by the institutions for approval of tax-exempt depreciation of bad debts and issues depreciation certificates. The number of requests submitted for debt depreciation has risen sharply with the increase of bad debts, and the work of the division has expanded incomparably. Amid the progress in liberalization, the work of the Examination Division seems likely to change both qualitatively and quantitatively. [16 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Securities Bureau/Coordination Division--Role of Drafting Deregulation Policy The Securities Bureau accomplished its internal role of securities deregulation with ad hoc economic measures in September 1993 and supplemental deregulation measures in December 1993. Director Akira Yamamoto (MOF class of 1969) decribes the division's role as "a thankless job of underpinning support." The scope of its precautionary support is broad and includes not only personnel and accounting but also general coordination among the bureau's divisions. Recently, it has also taken over the explanations given to coalition administration's Diet members concerning securities-related tax revisions and formulation of the Securities Bureau-related interpellations and replies with the Diet in mind. The Research Office within the Coordination Division handles work related to finanical system reform. It performs the role of the Secretariat for the Securities and Exchange Council [SEC] and also the role of reviewing long-term problems of the securities and exchange system. The office is currently undertaking revision of the Securities and Exchange Law, concerning "report on the improvement of a securities system in conjunction with deregulation of the acquisition of own-company stocks" the SEC issued in February 1994. The deregulation of own-company stock acquisition is "aimed toward increasing options for corporate finance and enhancing the freedom for the securities and exchange system" (Yoshio Okubo, office director, MOF class of 1974). On the other hand, drawbacks accompanying purchases of own-company stocks such as insider trading are predicted. To prevent this, new rules will be instituted including regulation of insider trading, procedures for open buying, and methods for display of stock-acquisition information. It is advancing its operations with an eye on the trend toward revision of the Commercial Law now in progress by the Justice Ministry. With smooth sailing, the revised law should be enacted in the current Diet session and the new system shoud start by the spring of 1995. A major event will also take place this year. Annual general meeting of the IOSCO [International Organization of Securities Commissions] will be held in Asia (Tokyo) for the first time in October 1994. A Preparation Office was also installed within the division early this year. Representatives of some 100 organizations from about 60 nations will come to Japan. Expected to take place on an unprecedented large scale, planning official Tadashi Kamimura (MOF class of 1977) and his secretarial staff will be extremely busy. [17 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Securities Bureau/Securities Market Division--Building an Environment for Issue and Secondary Markets In July 1992 with the reexamination of securities administration sparked by securities scandals as a turning point, the "Secondary Market Division" and the "Capital Market Division" were merged and inaugurated. The principal roles include overseeing the "issue" and "distribution" of securities, promoting a sound environment including the legal aspect of fair and efficient market operations and seeking revitalization of the market. One example is last year's reopening of the market-price issue of stocks and public subscription of capital increases. Being suspended since April 1990, capital procurement through the stock market, which is the representative function of the capital market, had stopped; however, Director Takashi Fujiwara (MOF class of 1972) says: "We could not leave the conditions as they were; therefore, we improved the environment to enable resumption of blue chips that are attractive for investment and could lead to revitalization of the stock market." This month, capital for Japan's jumbo DPE [express delivery services] was increased as a first case, and concrete moves are expected to continue in the future. Meanwhile, the Public and Corporate Bond Market Office within the division will conduct reexamination and abolition of existing regulations and practices concerning the issue and distribution of public and corporate bonds, and promote market improvement. Although the importance of corporate bond issues as a fund procurement means for the companies has increased, the ratio of corporate bonds in the market distribution is still low compared to national bonds. Therefore, efforts are made to attempt "improvement of the secondary market in order to diversify capital procurement means" (Director Kenjiro Suzuki, who entered the MOF in 1974). In a recent case, a step was taken in April 1993 to ease the "optimum bond criteria" that must be met when issuing corporate bonds. The removal of the ban on the issue of five-year corporate bonds in September 1993 as a deregulatory step may be seen as an example. Since November, a total of four companies have made offerings. In October 1993, the environment improved with the removal of the limit on corporate bond issues under the revised Corporate Bond Law. [18 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Securities Bureau/Corporation Finance Division--Improving Rules for Disclosure Information The importance of disclosing corporate information is strongly stressed. The reason is that, in order to bring back and protect the investors who have left the stock market, it is necessary to accurately inform them of the risks that face the issuing companies. The Corporation Finance Division of the Securities Bureau is in charge of matters concerning disclosure, such as the formulation of rules for disclosure. The division's Planning Office is in charge of managing the Corporate Accounting Council, which is an advisory organ to the finance minister. The council drafted a report in June 1993 to seek better disclosure of leased property. In the future, the focus will be on reexamination of foreign currency-denominated trading and off-balance (extra-ledger) trading. The division also serves as the window for the Japanese Government's formulation of "international accounting standards." The standards are set by the International Accounting Standards Committee, which is a group of accountant organizations from various nations. Given the deep interest among the companies that procure capital in overseas markets, high expectation is held toward the division's coordinating capability. Concurrently, the division provides listings of companies to the nation's stock exchanges and checks the financial and accounting contents of the companies listed over-the-counter at the Securities Industry Association based on securities and bond reports. If window-dressing settlements and unclear account manipulations are discovered, the companies will be asked to correct them and will be reported to the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission which has prosecuting authority. The audit corporate industry--the watchdog group of corporate finance--also has a supervisory role. It conducts qualification examinations for certified public accountants; names of the successful applicants will be posted on walls of the division's corridor. Yoshiaki Niihara (MOF class of 1972), director of the Securities Bureau, is new to the bureau. He served successively at the embassies in Belgium, Luxemburg, and France and is well-versed in international finance. [23 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Securities Bureau/Securities Companies Division--Responsibility of Supervising Securities Companies Questioned Scandals involving securities companies continue to surface. Cosmo Securities which incurred huge losses through illegal "tobashi" [stock shuffling] trading was given relief through a merger with the Daiwa Bank in August 1993. Recently, Kankaku Securities incurred losses of about 50 billion yen through similar stock shuffling and is expected to receive operational support from The Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Ltd. Demands are beginning to be heard concerning the supervisory responsibility of the Securities Companies Division of the Securities Bureau which controls securities companies. The Securities Companies Division has a major impact on the securities industry. Ever since the securities industry moved from the notification system to the licensing system during the 1965 recession, the division has checked the operations of companies through licensing as its weapon. In case a securities company creates a scandal, it is the Securities Companies Division that determines the content of punitive measures. The Kankaku Securities Company's stock shuffling case was handled by Director Akihiko Matsutani (MOF class of 1970) who interrogated President Yoichiro Kato, and the activities of the Business Department at its corporate headquarters was suspended for two weeks. The division is waging a heated debate with the Banking Bureau over reform of the financial system. In particular, it argued for the interests of the securities industry in connection with participation by city banks in the securities business and strongly proposed gradual participation. However, simultaneous entry by the top city banks was decided, and the division was forced to compromise broadly with the Banking Bureau. The position of the Securities Companies Division director is a key post within the MOF. It is considered to be second only to the Coordination Division director within the Securities Bureau. Current Director Matsutani has served for many years in the budget field and has proved his capability. The Investment Control Office was established within the Securities Companies Division in 1987 to specialize in supervising rapidly growing investment trusts and investment advisers. The Investment Trust Research Society was started in November 1993, with the Investment Control Office serving as its secretariat. It seeks out problems in Japan's investment trust system which has remained virtually unchanged since 1951 and considers measures for its improvement. Its goal is to compile a report by June, and Director Sumiharu Kusu (MOF class of 1975) and his staff are busy in preparation. [24 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission--Gradual Buildup of Achievements and Staff Apart from the MOF which has devoted itself to protecting and nurturing the securities industry, there is the "watchdog of the securities market" which oversees securities companies and the markets. Instituted in July 1992, the commission has gradually achieved results within a year and eight months or so including the criminal indictment case of the Japan Unisys stock manipulation and the recommendation of punishment in nine cases by securities companies. The chairman is Toshihiro Mizuhara, former superintendent of the Nagoya High Public Prosecutor's Office with commissioners Masaji Narita and Hidetaka Mihara serving under him. The secretariat consists of Director Shigemitsu Sugizaki (MOF class of 1964) and 84 members. It is a mixed group that hails from the National Tax Administration Agency, the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the Board of Audit, the Public Prosecutor's Office, the courts, and the National Police Agency. The members total about 200 with inspectors of securities and exchange from the Regional Financial Bureaus included. Under the secretariat are two divisions: the Coordination and Inspection Division and the Special Investigation Division. The Coordination and Inspection Division headed by Director Sei Nakai (MOF class of 1968) is divided into the inspection sector which inspects securities companies, the exchange sector in charge of watching the market and the coordination sector which handles office affairs. The Special Inspection Division consisting of Director Hisao Tateishi (MOF class of 1971) and 25 staff members are in charge of inspecting illegal activities such as stock manipulation on the basis of the Securities and Exchange Law. It does not have authority for summary arrest but is authorized to conduct compulsory inspection as necessary including search and confiscation. In the past, in addition to conducting compulsory inspection and indictment in connection with the Japan Unisys stock manipulation case, it has conducted compulsory inspection of the bankrupt educational publishing company "Aipech" [as transliterated] late last year on suspicion of window- dressing settlement. Compared to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] with its powerful authority, Japan's personnel is a mere one-thirteenth, and there are calls for a stronger organization. In addition to approving an increase of two staffers in the FY94 budget, efforts are made to improve the organization by sending its members to the U.S. SEC for training. [25 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Financial Bureau/First and Second Capital Divisions--Sole Control of Financial Investment Capital Financial investment and loans constitute what is called the "second budget." The First Capital Division and the Second Capital Division are in sole control, ranging from the "entrance" of capital such as postal savings to the "exit" where loans are made to public corporations such as the Japan Development Bank and the National Finance Corporation. Staffers say: "There are two divisions, but we are one capital family." The First Division is the staff headquarters so to speak. It is in charge of not only planning and drafting financial investment programs for each fiscal year but also watches the trends in postal savings and pension problems at the "entrance" and government-related financial institutions at the "exit." On the other hand, excluding the Japan Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of Japan which are handled by the First Division, the Second Division is a frontline corps that supervises 50-odd lenders individually. Attention on financial investment has recently mounted sharply. Amid the severe financial circumstances in the general account, many housing measures and small-and-medium business measures have utilized financial investment in the continuing business stimulating decisions during the past two years. The function of financial investment called business adjustment is operating fully during the prolonged recession. On the other hand, there are also dilemmas. The funds of the Fund Operation Department which supplies original capital for financial investment are entrusted to it by the people, and surety of redemption is demanded of their use. At the end of 1993, the coalition ruling parties proposed a concept of establishing a loan-purchase organization which uses financial investment funds to promote processing of bad debts by financial institutions. However, Director Fumio Inui (MOF class of 1970) of the First Division pointed out the principle of financial investment, and asked: "What would you do if the funds become frozen?" The proposal was deferred. Pressures for "reliance on financial investment" continue to grow, but since difficulty in advancing funds is beginning to surface, a debate on the direction of financial investment is likely to flare up. First Division Director Inui, "boss" of the "single capital family" who works in a large room without compartments, served for many years in the Budget Bureau and also in the Taxation and Financial Bureaus. He is therefore well-versed in finance. Second Division Director Yuzo Harada (MOF class of 1972) who oversees individual lenders has served chiefly in the field of international finance. The two are working in tandem on financial investment which faces a crossroads. [29 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Financial Bureau/Government Debt Division--"Keystone" of National Bond Management Policy Widening apprehension that the rise of long-term interest rates is deterring a business recovery. Early this year, the circulation yield on national bond index issues temporarily rose to the 4-percent level, exceeding the usual early-year rises by 1 percent. Providing the backdrop for the rise in interest rates is the fear of deteriorating supply-demand in the bond market due to increasing issues of national bonds. Given the volatile business trend, attention is drawn to the trend in the Government Debt Division as the keystone of national bond management policy. With a decline in tax revenues and the continuing implementation of economic measures, the national bond issue balance is expected to exceed 200 trillion yen at the end of FY94. Director Shokichi Takagi (MOF class of 1971) emphasizes following a natural course, saying: "We will merely digest them with stability by adapting a planned volume to market conditions." Regarding interest rates, he points out the difficulty of reading the financial market, saying: "A variety of economic factors reflect on them." Within the Government Debt Division is a separate room with a transparent wall. The director and his staff meet there with representatives from banks and securities companies or talk with them over the phone to exchange views on schedules for national bond bidding and market conditions. When it is time to bid or submit tenders, reporters from the news agencies are seen going in and out of the division and reporting the prices. Given the close daily relations with the financial market, the busy activities of the division are conspicuous within the Financial Bureau. In addition, the division handles accounting of national obligations including the special account and watches for counterfeit national bonds. Takagi served successively as assistant division director in the National Property Coordination Division, the First Capital Division, and the Second Capital Division and is well-versed in the affairs of the Financial Bureau. When he was director of the Securities Market Division, he solved the problem of liberalizing fees for stock sales and purchases, and therefore, he is knowledgeable in securities affairs. Masanori Totsuka, government debt auditor (class of 1962), is in charge of the government debt consolidation fund special account which controls the redemption sources for national bonds. [31 Mar 94 p 2] [Text] MOF International Finance Bureau/Coordination Division--No Time To Relax With Numerous Unexpected Cases The Foreign Exchange Bureau of the MOF was changed to the International Finance Bureau in 1964 when Japan completed its transition as a nation under Article 8 of the IMF and became a member of the OECD. Subsequently, with the internationalization of finance, the bureau's importance rose rapidly. Its personnel of 136 surpassed the Banking Bureau (128) and the Securities Bureau (84). The Coordination Division manages and supports the large personnel. The duties of the International Finance Bureau are widely diversified. They range from stabilization of foreign exchange to overseeing the international finance and capital market, compilation of international balance statistics, coping with cumulative debt problems, and economic aid to the developing nations. It is the difficult task of the Coordination Division as the general coordinating sector to implement these parallel duties simultaneously. It often faces with unexpected cases that are impacted by changes in the international situation such as the suspicion of nuclear development in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [North Korea], and there is no time to relax throughout the year. Another source of headaches is the inability to rest on weekends when international conferences converge. The post of director of the Coordination Division increases in importance as the "ranking" of the MOF's International Finance Bureau rises. In many cases, a future candidate for the bureau director--often a candidate for finance secretary which is treated as a deputy minister-class post--is assigned. Current Division Director Norimichi Kawai (MOF class of 1969) served successively as director of the International Organizations Division, director of the Foreign Exchange Fund Division and director of the Development Policy Division, which are the principal divisions within the International Finance Bureau, and he is highly experienced. The International Coordination Office was established within the Coordination Division in July 1993 as a sector specializing in bilateral negotiations on finance. At present virtually all of its duties are concentrated on negotiations with the United States including the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The discussions have been suspended after the Japan-U.S. summit talks ruptured in February [1994]. Since September 1993, Daisuke Kotegawa (class of 1975), office director, and his staff who continued coordination efforts for days and nights are presently "recharging their batteries." [1 Apr 94 p 2] [Text] MOF International Banking Division--Coordinator Between Japanese Banks and Foreign Governments The posture of Japanese banks vis-a-vis international banking has changed considerably during the past decade. It is particularly true concerning exchange with the developing nations. Since the mid-1980's, banks have devoted themselves to debt recovery due to the rise of cumulative debt problems. However, with marked economic growth in Asia from the early 1990's, they have shown a stance of aggressive advancement into the region. Recently, they have been focusing on Central and South America which are the "central sources" of debt problems. The International Banking Division serves as the coordinator between the Japanese banks which are eager to advance overseas and the foreign governments. The Foreign Exchange Law stipulates general capital exchanges with foreign countries as the supervisory scope of the division. Consequently, the division is visited by the officers in charge not only from banks but also from securities companies and general trading companies. Its recent duties, however, consist predominantly of works related to the advance into Asia by Japanese banks. The Asian strategy among Japanese banks focuses not only on Hong Kong and Singapore where branches have been previously established, but it also focuses on full-fledged advancement into Thailand, Malaysia, and China. Some city banks want to "be allowed to establish branches ahead of their competitors and to use that advantage toward concrete results" (a bank executive). Director Yukio Yoshimura (MOF class of 1970) who served in the embassies abroad for many years is a leading internationalist within the bureau. In his previous post as director of the International Organizations Division, he traveled to numerous countries to attend such international conferences as the IMF and the G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors conference. Even such internationalist as Director Yoshimura, his views on the somewhat overheated eagerness of the banks to advance into Asia are calm and points out "a need to pay more consideration to local circumstances." In the International Banking Division, the study of derivatives such as swaps and options has surfaced as a new task. The reason is that a sharp rise is seen in international derivatives trading. The offices that were formerly handled inspection of loans by Japanese banks to the developing nations have recently been engaged in the study of derivatives products. [5 Apr 94 p 2] [Text] MOF International Finance Bureau/International Organizations Division--The Hub of the IMF and International Conferences A clock showing the times in Washington and Paris hangs on the wall in the large room. On the desks are piles of documents written in English. English is constantly heard throughout the division and fax messages are exchanged with various stations. While serving as Japan's window at the IMF, the division is the secretariat for the MOF at international conferences such as the G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors conference held in February and the APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] conference in March [1994]. The division personnel totals 13, but "they accompany the minister and finance secretaries, and someone is always on a trip overseas" (Director Shigeo Kashiwagi (MOF class of 1973). The sector is directly linked to the "international stage." The division was originally established with jurisdication over the international monetary system with its central role as a window to the IMF and the OECD. Following the transition to a floating rate system in 1973, the importance of policy cooperation among the advanced nations in economic operations rose and its role as a conference secretariat expanded correspondingly. Amid rising expectations and hopes in Japan toward recovery of the global economy, the staff members are busy preparing for the G-7/IMF provisional committee meeting which is scheduled for late April [1994]. It will be followed successively by the OECD ministerial directors meeting in June and the Naples summit in July. Unlike the schedule of busy preoccupation with the budget from summer until the yearend with a respite in early spring, the division will face its "real grind" from here on. It occupies a pivotal position between the overseas offices and Japan concerning the IMF. It conducts endless liaison with the Japanese director's office in Washington on items on the agenda of the directors meetings held three times weekly at IMF headquarters. It transmits data overseas on how to present Japan's position regarding problems of the global economy and a variety of problems on relations between Japan and the advanced and developing nations. Director Kashiwagi who has been assigned to the IMF as an economist stresses the need for personnel contribution commensurate with an economic power when he says: "Of the approximately 2,200 staffers at the IMF headquarters, there are only about 10 Japanese excluding those on assignment from the MOF. This number is far too few." [6 Apr 94 p 2] [Text] MOF International Finance Bureau/Research Division--Role To Prepare International Balance of Payments The External Economic Reform Outline decided by the government at the end of March [1994] clearly indicates the government forecast that the FY94 current account surplus will show a GDP [gross domestic product] of about 2.8 percent. Furthermore, it presents its goal of "a significant reduction in the mid-term current account surplus." Providing the backdrop for the government's determination toward surplus reduction is the reality that Japan's surplus in 1993 exceeded $130 billion, reaching the highest level in history. The International Finance Bureau's Research Division prepares statistical bulletins on the international balance of payments every month and makes public Japan's current account surplus which is the focus of attention at home and abroad. Every year, the Research Division prepares the international balance portion of the government's economic forecast while consulting with the Audit and Planning Division of the Minister's Secretariat and the EPA [Economic Planning Agency], parallel with the formulation of the budget draft. The current account surplus in the FY94 forecast is expected to be about 13.8 trillion yen, or a drop of 600 billion yen from the previous fiscal year. The Research Division also serves as the secretariat for the Foreign Exchange Council which is an advisory organ for the MOF and MITI ministers. In June 1993 the council prepared a report seeking stronger risk controls over such derivatives as swaps and options in view of expanding exchange in the international financial markets. This fiscal year, it is conducting research on the theme of how international financial exchange is being conducted in the public and private sectors. Another important duty of the Research Division is to ascertain principal economic indicators of the various nations and to manage their data. Comments made by Director Hiroshi Uchimura (class of 1974) during the announcement of international balance of payments attract the attention of market-related quarters as representing the Japanese Government's view concerning the surplus problem. Consequently, on the eve of the announcement, the division is busy checking figures and drafting statements. Kazuko Tanaka (class of 1966), an expert on international balance of payments, is responsible for reexamining computation methods for the balance of payments. It is conducted as a response to the IMF's revision of the criteria for submission of international balance of payment reports. [8 Apr 94 p 2] [Text] MOF Foreign Exchange and Money Market Division and International Capital Division--Determining Pros and Cons of Market Intervention The Foreign Exchange and Money Market Division is the MOF's "dealing room" with rows of terminals that report the trends in the foreign exchange market. Its role is to decide the direction of market intervention while keeping an eye on trends in the exchange market. Because of the development of the high yen since last year, calls for moves by the division have increased. It is the window to the Bank of Japan [BOJ]'s International Bureau and is filled with tension particularly during the business hours of the Tokyo market. In tense situations, it watches the market from dawn to late in the night and instructs the BOJ to intervene if necessary. The Foreign Exchange and Money Market Division controls the Foreign Exchange Capital Control Special Account which supplies intervention funds. When the BOJ intervenes in yen sales and dollar purchases, payments are made from this account. However, Director Nobuhiko Kawakami (MOF class of 1971) says: "Alsolutely no comment on intervention," and the realities are wrapped in secrecy. Nonetheless, there was a surplus payment of 3.83 trillion yen from the account in FY93. It was the second largest overpayment after FY86 and indicates the second largest scale of intervention since the Februry 87 Louvre Accord which took place last fiscal year. Director Kawakami, who transferred to his present post from director of the International Finance Bureau's Development Finance Division in July 1992, sounds edgy concerning his fight againt the high yen when he says: "The continuing situation does not permit one to relax." The International Capital Division is in charge of internal and external capital exchange. Whenever companies issue foreign bonds or when foreign governments and companies issue yen-denominated bonds directed toward Japan's investors, a notification to the MOF is required, and the division serves as the window. Director Toru Nio (class of 1972) says: "Our task is to maintain a balance between capital flow and deregulation in tune with the international environment." Regarding deregulation, in January 1994 the division set forth a measure to ease the qualifying criteria for foreign bonds issued by the companies and yen-denominated foreign bonds issued by foreign companies. It has held discussions with market-related groups on yen-denominated foreign bonds since early this year and is studying measures to revitalize the market including its marketability. [12 Apr 94 p 2] [Text] MOF International Finance Bureau/Third Development Division--Role in Reducing Surplus Through Capital Reflux Japan-U.S. relations are deteriorating over Japan's huge current account surplus. Attention is focused on an overlay of Japan's public works investment and an expansion of domestic demand as breakthrough measures, but actually capital reflux measures by Japan play a large role in reducing the surplus. The MOF International Finance Bureau's "three development divisions"--the Development Policy Division, the Development Institutions Division, and the Development Finance Division--may be regarded as the practical business corps, so to speak, of such capital reflux measures. The Development Policy Division which controls the bilateral-based ODA [Offical Development Assistance] maintains indispensable liaison and negotiations with MOFA [the Ministry of Foreign Affairs], the EPA and MITI. The reason is that "development assistance measures cannot be implemented by a single ministry or agency." At summit conferences by the advanced nations, the problem of aid to the developing nations is invariably discussed, and the workload of the division rises steadily prior to such conferences. The Development Policy Division's important task consists of putting the support framework and methods into concrete form. It is also in charge of solving the debt problems of the cumulative debtor nations thus braodening the scope of its jurisdictional duties. The ODA [Official Development Assistance] provides not only bilateral support but also support through international institutions. It is overseen by the Development Institutions Division. The division personnel handles office procedures for decisionmaking by international institutions and preparations for annual general meetings. The division is divided into sections by institutions, such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development [IBRD], the Asian Development Bank [ADB], and the United States Development Bank and provides thorough "background support" to enable the respective institutions to conduct smooth operations. The International Finance Division, unlike the Policy Division and Institutions Division, is in charge of work related to individual financing problems, rather than to the policy aspect. A classic example is the disposition of financing cases by the Export-Import Bank of Japan. The majority of the bank's financing is cooperative financing with Japan's private banks and may be regarded as the most "businesslike" among the three divisions in terms of practical business affairs. The division is also in change of yen loans.
