Interviewed in Johannesburg today, he said the political climate and not the election date should be changed, and ANC President Nelson Mandela has supported this saying he won't agree to a postponement of the election as this would effectively be a postponement of freedom. Yesterday, a joint IEC-kwaZulu and South African Government working committee said an election couldn't be held in kwaZulu-Natal in the current political climate. [Begin recording] [Kriegler] I think it would be irresponsible for the IEC to give a message to spoilers that if they make enough of a nuisance of themselves the election will be postponed. We don't say that. We don't believe that. The election will carry on. The few spoilers are not going to frustrate the vast majority who wish to vote. [Unidentified correspondent] Amid speculation that a postponement of the election was possible, Mr. Mandela was adamant that he opposed such a move. [Mandela] There will be no postponement of the election. [applause] [Correspondent] On the possible postponement of regional election in Natal-kwaZulu he kept the same strong stance. Later at a news conference Mr. Mandela said the IEC report stated that a final decision was still in the hands of political leaders. He said Friday's summit meeting for him was an opportunity to discuss the position of King Goodwill Zwelithini. [Mandela] The main purpose is to see how I can address his concerns and to allay his feeling that his position is threatened by the government of national unity. [Correspondent] Mr. Mandela said he believed the ongoing violence in the province might be reduced if an agreement could be reached with King Goodwill. On the subject of the security forces he said it was unrealistic to expect them to control the violence overnight. Mr. Mandela left for discussions with ANC regional leaders. [end recording]
