FR940627-0-00002 FR940627-0-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Parts 330, 332 and 351 RIN 3206&hyph;AG11 Interagency Placement Program AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management is issuing revised interim regulations that implement the new Interagency Placement Program. This new program supersedes the Displaced Employee Program and Interagency Placement Assistance Program through which OPM provided job placement assistance to employees displaced by reduction in force. In response to requests for a more effective and simplified program, OPM merged these existing programs into one single automated comprehensive program, the Interagency Placement Program which became activated on December 1, 1993. Through this program, OPM can provide quicker and better placement service to employees and agencies. In addition, 5 CFR part 351, Reduction in Force, is being amended to add §351.807, Certification of Expected Separation, which was erroneously removed at 58 FR 32046 dated June 8, 1993. DATES: These interim regulations are effective June 27, 1994. Written comments will be considered if received no later than August 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to Leonard R. Klein, Associate Director for Career Entry, Office of Personnel Management, Room 6F08, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: OPM operated two placement programs, the Displaced Employee Program and the Interagency Placement Assistance Program. Upon requests from agencies, OPM developed the new Interagency Placement Program. Agencies stated the Displaced Employee Program and the Interagency Placement Assistance Program did not meet their needs. Among their reasons were: •Displaced Employee Program registrants were not required to update their registrations. When employees were referred to agencies through the Displaced Employee Program, many were no longer available or could not be reached. This resulted in a high declination rate and a slow, ineffective and cumbersome referral process, and was very costly and time-consuming to the agencies. It also affected the credibility of the program. •Each OPM Service Center maintained its own Displaced Employee Program inventory. When an agency recruited for a position that was located in a geographic area not within the jurisdiction of its local OPM Service Center, it had to contact another OPM Service Center to clear the Displaced Employee Program. It was confusing to agencies as to which Service Center to contact. •The Interagency Placement Assistance Program was not successful in placing employees who were identified as surplus. •The Interagency Placement Assistance Program was not successful in placing excepted service employees who did not have personal competitive status. Similar to the Displaced Employee Program, agencies must consider Interagency Placement Program registrants before making competitive appointments to positions that are expected to last more than 1 year. This means that agencies must consult the Interagency Placement Program inventory when filling positions through a competitive register held by OPM or an agency with delegated examining authority; direct-hire authority; or the Outstanding Scholar provision. Agencies do not need to consult the Interagency Placement Program inventory when making noncompetitive appointments or conversions to the competitive service. No individual may be selected for such a vacancy as long as a qualified IPP registrant is available. Appointing officers may not pass over an IPP eligible to select a non-IPP eligible unless an objection to the IPP eligible is sustained. To meet the needs of its customers and resolve the problems identified, OPM is proposing only a few changes to existing regulations. The existing regulations remain the same with the following changes to 5 CFR part 330, subparts C, D, and H; 5 CFR part 323, subpart C and 5 CFR part 351, subpart H: •these proposed regulations reflect the new Interagency Placement Program name; •the Interagency Placement Program automates and centralizes OPM's placement program, expedite the referral process, reduces costs to the agencies, increases the period of placement assistance for career-conditional employees from 1 year to 2 years, and requires registrants to update their registration every 6 months to maintain a current placement program inventory; •excepted service employees must have personal competitive status obtained from a previous appointment and be in Tenure 1 or 2 to be eligible for registration in the Interagency Placement Program; and •employees must have received a specific reduction in force notice or a Certification of Expected Separation to register in the new Interagency Placement Program. Agency personnel offices have been provided an Interagency Placement Program Operating Plan and an Automated Applicant Referral System Users Handbook which describe the operation of the Interagency Placement Program. Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Delay in Effective Date Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking because it would be contrary to the public interest to delay access to benefits. Also, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), I find that good cause exists to make this amendment effective in less than 30 days. The delay in the effective date is being waived to give effect to the benefits extended by the amended provisions at the earliest practicable date. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it affects only certain Federal employees.
