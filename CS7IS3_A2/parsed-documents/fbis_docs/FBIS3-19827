Over to our Brussels correspondent Pedro Oliveira: [Begin recording] [Oliveira] [passage omitted] Everything has been postponed to next weekend's meeting in Ioannina, Greece, where the EU foreign ministers will have their last chance to avert a crisis. [passage omitted] There is a possibility of adding political appendices which would meet the objections of Britain and Spain, but these would have no formal legal guarantees, and London and Madrid want guarantees. Britain actually wants population sizes taken into account -- the large versus the small, in other words. Portugal is adamantly against this: [Barroso] Any compromises introduced at this stage taking population figures into account, lending greater weight to the larger countries, cannot and will on no account be accepted by Portugal. [Oliveira] Durao Barroso thinks London and Madrid are being unrealistic if they think the other 10 members will change their mind. [passage omitted] The Portuguese foreign minister is averse to additional protocols and amendments, but admits that there may be a political way out. [Barroso] We are open to a binding compromise of a political nature, provided that -- and I repeat -- no idea of discrimination among the member states is brought in through the back door.
