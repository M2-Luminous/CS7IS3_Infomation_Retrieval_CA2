The sputnik was launched by means of a heavy "Proton-K" three-stage carrier-rocket equipped with a "DM-2" acceleration block. The orbiting was successful. The sputnik's flight is controlled by the centre for testing and controlling the vehicle. The sputnik, developed by the Applied Mechanics Scientific Production Society (Krasnoyarsk-26) under the direction of Chief Constructor and Director-General Mikhail Reshetnev, weighs about two tonnes and will be able to remain on the orbit for three years. It is fitted out with six-channel board relaying unit, designed to transmit telephone and telegraph signals. The sputnik will be placed on the near geostationary orbit -- 90 degrees eastern longitude -- approximately seven hours after the start. Then it will be moved to its final position -- 45 degrees eastern longitude -- by means of low-thrust engines. It will be used for the designed purposes in that position. The launching of the "Proton-K" carrier-rocket was the 215th since its first start in 1967 and already the third since the beginning of this year. Only six launchings of this type of carrier-boosters were effected last year. Two "Soyuz" vehicles were launched from Baykonur this year in addition to the "Protons". Such a busy launching schedule was made possible by the concerted efforts of men from the Russian military-space forces, who, in spite of several unresolved problems linked with the Baykonur cosmodrome and the town of Leninsk, are continuing to prepare and launch spuntiks. Talks on the status and lease of the Baykonur cosmodrome are continuing between Moscow and Almaty. If they prove successful, the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan will sign corresponding documents this March.
