An official from the Ministry of Coal Industry said that in the first quarter of this year, state-owned key coal mines yielded 110 million tons, whereas local and township mines turned out 130 million tons, 12 percent more than in the same period last year. He said that in general, the overall coal production of state- owned mines remained at the same level as last year; however, the developments of these mines varied in different regions. The coal output went up in the regions with relatively developed industries and advantageous transport, but showed a downward trend wherever the railways were clogged, he explained. He said the output of the local and township mines continued to grow, but there remained a lot to be done to "rectify, transform, unite and upgrade" the township mines. Coal has been the main energy in China, accounting for over 70 percent of the country's consumption of primary energy sources. Fierce competition in the coal markets has been waged by producers since the government lifted price controls at the beginning of this year. It is expected that the total output of coal will reach 1.16 billion tons this year. The coal ministry said that it would exercise control over the aggregate production, restructure coal products and raise the economic efficiency of the industry.
