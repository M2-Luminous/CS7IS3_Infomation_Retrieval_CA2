It was confirmed that the report on the arrest of the two Russian officials and their Egyptian companions was not true. What happened was that the two Russian officials were the guests of the Egyptian family. The first secretary took some photographs of nature scenes on the Nile River banks. A citizen, who did not know their identity, remonstrated him and took him to the security officer guarding the Banha Bridge because he thought that the two Russians were violating the law. When the officer ascertained their identity, he apologized profusely for the error. The Russian diplomat gave the film to the officer who promised to return it after checking that it did not contain any photographs that violate security. AL-WAFD apologizes to Yuriy Kuder Vicev, first secretary in the Federal Russian embassy; Dr. Evgeny Zelenev, director of the Russian Language Institute in the Russian Cultural Center; Mrs. Widad Ahmad Wahdan; and her son Ayman. AL-WAFD stresses that the publication of the report was not meant to be an affront to the Russian diplomats or to bilateral relations.
