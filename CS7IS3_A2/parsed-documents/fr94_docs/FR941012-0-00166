All work shall terminate and each employee shall move to a place of safety when environmental conditions, such as but not limited to, electrical storms, high winds, heavy rain or snow, extreme cold, dense fog, fires, mudslides, and darkness, may endanger an employee in the performance of their job. (6) Work areas. (i) Employees shall be spaced and the duties of each employee shall be organized so the actions of one employee will not create a hazard for any other employee. (ii) Work areas shall be assigned so that trees cannot fall into an adjacent occupied work area. The distance between adjacent occupied work areas shall be at least two tree lengths of the trees being felled. The distance between adjacent occupied work areas shall reflect the degree of slope, the density of the growth, the height of the trees, the soil structure and other hazards reasonably anticipated at that work site. A distance of greater than two tree lengths shall be maintained between adjacent occupied work areas on any slope where rolling or sliding of trees or logs is reasonably foreseeable. (iii) Each employee shall work in a position or location that is within visual or audible contact with another employee. (iv) The employer shall account for each employee at the end of each workshift. (7) Signaling and signal equipment. (i) Hand signals or audible contact, such as but not limited to, whistles, horns, or radios, shall be utilized whenever noise, distance, restricted visibility, or other factors prevent clear understanding of normal voice communications between employees. (ii) Engine noise, such as from a chain saw, is not an acceptable means of signaling. Other locally and regionally recognized signals may be used.

(ii) Flammable and combustible liquids shall not be transported in the driver compartment or in any passenger-occupied area of a machine or vehicle.
