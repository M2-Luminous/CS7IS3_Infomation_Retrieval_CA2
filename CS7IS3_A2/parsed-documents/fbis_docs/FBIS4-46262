The announcement came in reaction to a complaint submitted by the "View Toward Peace" [Mabat Leshalom] organization. The bureau's announcement came in the wake of an investigation conducted by Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami', head of the Israeli team at the joint security committee. The communique stated that the Palestinians had said that the candidacies of all applicants to join the Palestinian police were brought before the committee. The Palestinians also asserted that the Fatah Hawks had not been recruited but had only been concentrated in one location pending a decision on their future.
