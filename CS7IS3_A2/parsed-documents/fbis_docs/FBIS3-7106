Till today, however, this promise still remains to be fulfilled. On Tuesday, the May 1992 Heroes' Relatives Committee appealed to the government to speed up the building of the monument to remember the deaths of those who took part in the bloody prodemocracy rallies on Ratchadamnoen Avenue and to wrap up investigations into the disappearance of some 41 people during the May crisis. The anxiety of the families and friends of those who went missing in May 1992 is understandable. Many of the pro-democracy demonstrators who disappeared were breadwinners for their families and their next-of-kin have not been given any financial assistance whatsoever by the government. Though the Interior Ministry announced that it had already provided a total of Bt26 million to 1,359 families of victims of the bloodshed and would continue to provide assistance until May 1995, it should be borne in mind that this aid does not extend to the next-of-kin of the missing. The problem of those missing after the May massacre has to be accepted as a national trauma, even though some quarters in Thai society might suggest that they are best forgotten. The May 1992 Heroes' Relatives Committee accused the Chuan government of having failed to do enough to ensure justice for the relatives and they felt let down by the administration. "The government has been negligent on issues concerning the May victims. This shows the coalition is insincere in getting to the bottom of the problem and doesn't support democracy in a meaningful way," said the committee's leader Adun Kheowboriphun who lost his only son in May 1991, when he was cut down by a hail of bullets on Ratchadamnoen Avenue. The question remains: What is the underlying fear that prevents the Chuan government from letting the public know the findings of a commission set up by the Anan II administration to look into the May 1991 events? The point to be made is that if the public knew the truth about what really happened, some of the wilder rumours about how the bodies of the missing were disposed would be dispelled. Until this is accepted, there will be further argument between opposing sides and the conflict will never be resolved. Nearly two years later, we can't help but ask: Was it worth going out onto the streets, facing police batons and Army bullets on Ratchadamnoen Avenue, risking our lives and demanding democracy -- only to get a lameduck government that disregards everyone's interests but its own? Democracy in Thailand survives on promises for a better future and a fear of a return to the brutal past. But now it seems the promises made by Chuan cannot be fulfilled. A major message of May 1992 is that an eligible candidate for the prime ministership must be an elected MP. The post of the country's chief executive can no longer be monopolized by army generals and political appointees. Also, politicians must be more cautious about their conduct because they can come under intense scrutiny as a result of heightened public expectations. But many politicians seem to have forgotten the profound changes that have taken place around them and remain pre-occupied with their own narrow self-interests. Political bickering has become their way of life, to the extent that they have lost sight of their official duty -- to make decisions on how to deal effectively with problems facing the country. Politics in Thailand has become a game of self-aggrandizement played by society's well-to-do. Little thought is given to the people, let alone the pro-democracy protesters who helped place MPs in their positions of authority and responsibility. The proposed constitutional amendments are a good example of how little these politicians care for the people. While the amendments are of utmost importance to guarantee the rights of the people, MPs are arguing over the number of points to be passed at the extraordinary session of Parliament next week. Instead of displaying his leadership to rein in government and opposition MPs over this issue, and to help solve many other problems plaguing the country, Chuan has been behaving like Nero fiddling away while Rome burns. Day by day, the prime minister seems to be losing support. The May relatives have now joined the academics and pro-democracy movement in not wanting to have anything to do with him. The message is clear: Whatever government purports to represent us must also champion our rights. Chuan Likphai has failed the very people whose loved ones gave their lives for his government. The writing on the wall is clear. Since Chuan has, after two years, failed to shape up, he must now ship out.
