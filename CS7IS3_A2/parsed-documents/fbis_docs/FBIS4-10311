The communique states that the letter has been misinterpreted and specifies that all de Greiff did was send the information, which was requested by La Quica's defense attorney, to the United States. Second, the communique notes that by constitutional mandate, the Prosecutor General's Office must investigate the pros and cons involved in any case. Third, it points out that it was the Prosecutor General's Office that sent the evidence to the United States that allowed La Quica to be condemned in the United States for forgery. De Greiff's controversial letter could change the course of La Quica's case, but the judge will not decide until this afternoon whether the letter will be accepted.
