He believes that the negotiations will begin in July. Speaking on the Syrian issue, the prime minister said that the secretary of state will arrive in the region in mid-July on a shuttle mission between Damascus and Jerusalem. The gaps with the Syrians have not been narrowed and, until the Syrians launch a serious dialogue with us, there will be no progress. Our correspondent at the Knesset Tamar Asalem reports: [Begin recording] [Asalem] At present, there are serious doubts regarding Jordan's willingness to sign a separate peace agreement with us, Rabin said. At the same time, we have reached an understanding that the tripartite framework -- the United States, Jordan, and Israel -- should be employed on economic issues. The talks aim at creating a reality of dialogue in the region, even if a peace agreement is not signed and only economic and civilian agreements are attained. Rabin also disclosed that Israel had offered Jordan the holding of open meetings in Israel and Jordan alternatively. In the first stage, Jordan wants to find a spot in the 'Arava, near the disputed areas, and also demands that talks be held in air conditioned mobile homes. The prime minister believes that these negotiations will begin in July. Regarding the Syrian issue, the prime minister said that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will shuttle between Damascus and Jerusalem in mid-July. The United States will not make offers, and we are not interested in them doing so. The Americans may relay stands but, until the Syrians begin a more serious dialogue, there will be no progress. Knesset Member Binyamin Netanyahu said that he believes the Syrians are growing weak in several spheres, including the military. Rabin responded to that by saying: Where did you hear this joke? Netanyahu showed the committee a document drafted by the Foreign Ministry's Political Planning Department regarding the negotiations with Syria. [Netanyahu] The document, drafted by the Foreign Ministry's professional echelons, says: The negotiations with Syria should be conducted with a cool mind, no haste, and patience. The prime minister is doing the opposite: He is impatient, rushes forward, and is nervous. In fact, he seems to be panicking with real or imaginary fear of the next war. [Asalem] The prime minister said that it seems to him that the party most concerned with his declaration regarding a possible war with Syria -- is Syria. According to him, he does not remember such a vast amount of weapons, some of which are the most advanced, arriving in Syria since the end of 1993. Coming out of the committee room, Rabin added that this is part of the overall Middle East arms race. [Rabin] All the Middle East countries are increasing their military power. Egypt, which lives in peace with us, is increasing and upgrading its military ability. So are Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Syria. The current reality is that there is an arms race in the Middle East. [end recording] The prime minister also told the committee members that Israel has already established an authority for handling and rehabilitating Palestinians collaborators. He added that large amounts of money have been allocated for the authority, and former Major General Shlomo Gazit has been appointed to head it.
