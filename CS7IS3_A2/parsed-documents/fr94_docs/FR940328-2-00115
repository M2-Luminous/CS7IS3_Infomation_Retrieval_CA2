ACTION: Notice of request for an amendment to an existing OMB clearance (9000&hyph;0129). SUMMARY: Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501), the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Secretariat has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to approve an amended information collection requirement concerning Cost Accounting Standards Administration. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Fayson, Office of Federal Acquisition Policy, GSA (202) 501&hyph;4755. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Purpose The clause at FAR 52.230&hyph;5, Administration of Cost Accounting Standards, requires contractors to send information to the prime contractor's ACO, who then forwards it to the ACO of the cognizant subcontractor. To eliminate this double step, the clause will be changed to require the prime contractor to send the information directly to the subcontractor's ACO with a duplicate copy to the prime contractor's ACO. B. Annual Reporting Burden Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average .05 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat, 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405, and to the FAR Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. The annual reporting burden is estimated as follows: Respondents, 500; responses per respondent, 50; total annual responses, 25,000; preparation hours per response, .05; and total response burden hours, 1,250. Obtaining Copies of Proposals Requester may obtain copies of OMB applications or justifications from the General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), room 4037, Washington, DC 20405, telephone (202) 501&hyph;4755.
