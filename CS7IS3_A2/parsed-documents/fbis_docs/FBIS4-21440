People may not understand and accept it but we should not overlook it,'' he said. Chuan presided over a seminar entitled ``Nuclear Power Plants,'' held at Parliament yesterday. He said nuclear power could not be rejected since it is a vital new resource for generating electricity. He said nuclear power had been used elsewhere for more than 20 years due to increasing demand for power worldwide. Chuan said that 20 years ago, Thailand consumed only 1,000 megawatts of electricity. This year, demand has risen to 9,800 megawatts. ``And in 15-20 years, demand will be 30,000 megawatts,'' he said. At present, Thailand has to import electricity from Laos and natural gas from Malaysia, Vietnam and Burma. Although there were many other fossil fuels for electricity generation, the world was concerned about their environmental impact. He quoted the greenhouse effect, and acid rain as examples of problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels. ``The government is interested in nuclear power as one of a number of options for the future,'' he said. He said he had instructed the Sciences Technology and Environment Ministry to amend the laws concerning nuclear power plants and to formulate an organizational structure to supervise the new industry. ``Everything must comply with international standards. We want to be sure people will be safe and that it will not affect the environment,'' he said. He stressed that public sentiment over the issue was the most important factor. ``The government will study the positive and negative aspects of nuclear power plants. And we will pay prime attention to the public's feelings,'' he said. The chairman of the House committee on energy, At-ong Chumsai na Ayutthaya, recently insisted on the need to build nuclear power plants and criticized an opposing conclusion reached by the House environment committee. ``We have to select the best and safest system. Don't take bad examples which rely on one-sided information,'' he said. A Phalang Tham (Bangkok) MP, At-ong said before deciding whether or not to build nuclear power plants, it is necessary to study the size of the country's remaining energy reserves. ``We have to accept that the energy demand is rising. The consumption of electricity increases by 1,000 megawatts yearly.'' ``We are not talking about a change which will happen today or tomorrow but we are focusing on the situation in 50 years, when other energy sources have already gone,'' he said.
