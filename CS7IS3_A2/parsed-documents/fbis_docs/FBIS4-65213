The fact that the head of state has to call upon the prime minister-designate to abide by the cardinal principles of the Constitution of the Republic in itself highlights how acute the issue of democracy is in Italy." This is how Massimo D'Alema, the conventional "number two" at Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters], addressed LA VOCE, which pressed for his judgement as the opposition. [Orlando] Are you happy with the list of ministers? [D'Alema] Of course. They are all servants of the old and new regimes. [Orlando] And what about the method used to form the new government? [D'Alema] This is a complete regression with respect to the retreat from party politics that began under the Ciampi government. Here we have replunged into the old private, party, and prevailing way of thinking. Unfortunately with the addition of more serious aspects. [Orlando] Which serious aspects? [D'Alema] Something that is almost congenial because of its coarse arrogance; something else that is very serious because of the deep mystery that surrounds it. [Orlando] Let us proceed in steps: What is the serious matter that is almost congenial? [D'Alema] It is the rise of the audacious arrogance of a new political class from the hypocrisy of the old DC [Christian Democratic Party] regime that follows the same itinerary as the old but with the light-hearted impudence and ferocity of a neophyte. You can do anything for heaven's sake, but the idea of nominating your family attorney as justice minister is like having a monarchy, as royal absolutism was defined before the constitutional monarchy. [Orlando] And the other matter, the serious and even mysterious one? [D'Alema] I am referring to the appalling lack of openness during all these negotiations. There were turbid rather than mysterious elements onn both sides of the clash between Berlusconi and [Northern League Secretary] Bossi over the Viminale [Interior Ministry]. [Orlando] Are you alluding to "the reasons that could not be reported" under which Berlusconi first refused the Viminale to the League? [D'Alema] Certainly. Which are the reasons that cannot be reported and for which a League party member cannot go to the Viminale? And how is it possible that the League party member was later considered fit for the Viminale? Do the reasons that could not be reported no longer exist? Or do they remain and was it Berlusconi who had to yield after having been given no option by the League? However, this is not sufficient. What is just as serious and turbid is the reason the League used to justify its request to have the Viminale: It said that it wanted the Interior Ministry to guarantee a democratic government. In conclusion Bossi says to Berlusconi: "I want the Viminale because I do not trust your democratic loyalty"; and Berlusconi answers: "I cannot give it to you for reasons that I cannot even state in public." [Orlando] And the head of state? [D'Alema] The head of state is obliged to make continued calls for obeying rules that should apply to everybody. [Orlando] In practice he is reminding that he is the one who nominates the ministers upon the proposal of the prime minister-designate. [D'Alema] Yes, but I do not know what kind of equilibrium can be formed under these conditions. I only know that there is reason for concern. Can one imagine a government exposed to this type of influence at every crossroads? To blackmail? And how will it behave? Are we moving toward Europe or toward a world without rules? [Orlando] Do you think that the lessons of the bribery scandals were not sufficient to induce all the old and new parties to respect the rules? [D'Alema] But the rules are not only those that call for administrative honesty. Within a month we will be voting in the European elections, and our prime minister will be presenting himself as a candidate in all the Italian electoral constituencies. Can you imagine Major or Kohl presenting themselves to the British or German people knowing that they cannot go to Strasbourg? Berlusconi, the prime minister, cannot be a representative at Strasbourg. Or rather he can, but must resign as prime minister. Why is he campaigning himself then? He is misleading the voters, he is making improper use of his institutional role, he is showing contempt for the European institutions. He is campaigning for the sole purpose of channeling votes toward Forza Italia candidates by exploiting his own person and his own role. All this had never been seen before in Europe. [Orlando] Perhaps these are the mistakes of the first steps. [D'Alema] Let us speak clearly. If the infringements made to date are taken one by one, none of these are dramatic: neither the Fininvest-party management at Arcore [Berlusconi's residence], nor the family attorneys as candidates for the parliamentary speakerships, or as ministers, nor the exorbitant financial resources. But all together they can be one dramatic infringement. Let us take the resources: There is an enormous disproportion with respect to the other political alignments. The Center has even been reduced to silence. Forza Italia instead is everywhere, with posters on city walls and on Fininvest television stations. If an equal confrontation among the parties is not reconstructed, democracy will end. [Orlando] I know that the Center does not have the resources. But Center and Left are both sleeping. Is the opposition sure that it is doing all its duty. [D'Alema] We have our faults. We have not yet brought to the attention of the voters what the risks are in a new governing group that disdains the rules and is full of subversive ends. There is no doubt that the parliamentary opposition forces must stay close to the head of state in his role as a guarantor, otherwise he cannot do this alone. [Orlando] Is the idea of a common opposition front reemerging? [D'Alema] No, also because there are already people who are making the right moves. I must acknowledge the fact that Pact for Italy leader Mario Segni rigorously and energetically presented the problem of incompatibility between the public function that Berlusconi is getting ready to exercise and his private interests. But then it is a good thing that Center and Left are moving independently of each other, also to prevent the Right from moving into the Center. If the Right moves into the Center, the risks for democracy increase. [Orlando] Will we finally have an opposition that is worthy of the fundamental role that it deserves in democracy? [D'Alema] There is a fundamental new fact in the Italian political scene. Not only does the opposition, the great majority of the opposition, no longer refer to antisystem models, it is linked, with all its three great components -- Socialist, lay, Catholic -- to the democratic cultures of the West. We are members of the Socialist International, others of the Liberals, others of the Christian Democrats. The opposition parties will not be the ones to make Europe worry about Italy.
