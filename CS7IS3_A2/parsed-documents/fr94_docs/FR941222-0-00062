FR941222-0-00062 FR941222-0-00006 18 CFR Part 35 Electric power rates, electric utilities, reporting and recordkeeping requirements. By the Commission. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. In consideration of the foregoing, the Commission amends Part 2 and Part 35 of Title 18 of the Code of Federal Regulations as set forth below. PART 2_GENERAL POLICY AND INTERPRETATIONS 1. The authority citation for Part 2 continues to read as follows: Authority: 15 U.S.C. 717&hyph;717w, 3301&hyph;3432; 16 U.S.C. 792&hyph;825y, 2601&hyph;2645; 42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4361, 7101&hyph;7352. 2. Part 2 is amended by adding ยง2.25, to read as follows: ยง2.25 Ratemaking Treatment of the Cost of Emissions Allowances in Coordination Transactions. (a) General Policy. This Statement of Policy is adopted in furtherance of the goals of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, Title IV, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (1990). (b) Costing Emissions Allowances in Coordination Sales. If a public utility's coordination rate on file with the Commission provides for recovery of variable costs on an incremental basis, the Commission will allow recovery of the incremental costs of emissions allowances associated with a coordination sale. If a coordination rate does not reflect incremental costs, the public utility should propose alternative allowance costing methods or demonstrate that the coordination rate does not produce unreasonable results. The Commission finds that the cost to replace an allowance is an appropriate basis to establish the incremental cost. (c) Use of Indices. The Commission will allow public utilities to determine emissions allowance costs on the basis of an index or combination of indices of the current price of emissions allowances, provided that the public utility affords purchasing utilities the option of providing emissions allowances. Public utilities should explain and justify any use of different incremental cost indices for pricing coordination sales and making dispatch decisions. (d) Calculation of Amount of Emissions Allowances Associated With Coordination Transactions. Public utilities should explain the methods used to compute the amount of emissions allowances included in coordination transactions. (e) Timing. Public utilities should provide information to purchasing utilities regarding the timing of opportunities for purchasers to stipulate whether they will purchase or return emissions allowances. (f) Other Costing Methods Not Precluded. The ratemaking treatment of emissions allowance costs endorsed in this Policy Statement does not preclude other approaches proposed by individual utilities on a case-by-case basis. PART 35_FILING OF RATE SCHEDULES 1. The authority citation for Part 35 continues to read as follows: Authority: 16 U.S.C. 791a&hyph;825r, 2601&hyph;2645; 31 U.S.C. 9701; 42 U.S.C. 7101&hyph;7352. 2. Section 35 is amended by adding Section 35.23, to read as follows: ยง35.23 General Provisions. (a) Applicability. This subpart applies to any wholesale sale of electric energy in a coordination transaction by a public utility if that sale requires the use of an emissions allowance. (b) Implementation Procedures. (1) If a public utility has a coordination rate schedule on file that expressly provides for the recovery of all incremental or out-of-pocket costs, such utility may make an abbreviated rate filing detailing how it will recover emissions allowance costs. Such filing must include the following: the index or combination of indices to be used; the method by which the emission allowance amounts will be calculated; timing procedures; how inconsistencies, if any, with dispatch criteria will be reconciled; and how any other rate impacts will be addressed. In addition, a utility making an abbreviated filing must: (i) clearly identify the filing as being limited to an amendment to a coordination rate to reflect the cost of emissions allowances, in the first paragraph of the letter of transmittal accompanying the filing; (ii) submit revised pages that can be inserted into each rate schedule; and (iii) identify each rate schedule to which the amendment applies. (2) The abbreviated filing must apply consistent treatment to all coordination rate schedules. If the filing does not apply consistent rate treatment, the public utility must explain why it does not do so. (3) If a public utility wants to charge incremental costs for emissions allowances, but its rate schedule on file with the Commission does not provide for the recovery of all incremental costs, the selling public utility may submit an abbreviated filing if all customers agree to the rate change. If customers do not agree, the selling public utility must tender its emissions allowance proposal in a separate section 205 rate filing, fully justifying its proposal.
