[Correspondent Witold Laskowski, in Moscow] An accused former activist in the radical Self-Defense Movement was meeting the leader of Russian nationalists in freshly refurbished offices in a prestigious building in the center of Moscow, which he described as his Moscow bureau. In a small conference room plates with halves of eggs with black caviar, sandwiches with a less prestigious red caviar, fish, cold meats in aspic, and fruit were already on the table. This meeting today -- does it have any special aim? Are you (?discussing] any concrete issues, or is it just a friendly, social meeting? [Janusz Bryczkowski, Front Narodowy-Samoobrona, identified by caption] A friendly meeting and we want to discuss, as it were, the agenda of Mr. Zhirinovskiy's visit to Poland. [Laskowski] Is there already a date? [Bryczkowski] Oh, yes, there is: The congress of our party is on 12 March. [Laskowski] And then Mr. Zhirinovskiy would be coming to Poland? [Bryczkowski] Yes, he announced that he would come with all the entourage of the, as it were, Polish set of his deputies: Mr. (?Zhebrovskiy), Mr. Vengerovskiy. [Laskowski] Zhirinovskiy failed to come to Poland in January because, as he claims, he had problems with means of transport from Belgrade. Now, Janusz Bryczkowski promises him that he will be meeting businessmen and representatives of otherwise unspecified social organizations. Zhirinovskiy considers his greatest successes since the parliamentary elections to be the fact that several radical reformers led by Gaydar have left the government. He is temporarily tolerating Prime Minister Chernomyrdin treating him as a lesser evil. He claims that his organization is growing every day. He intends to win the 1996 presidential elections when he is leader of the party with a membership of half a million. Several days ago we almost witnessed a split in Zhirinovskiy's parliamentary faction: One of his closest aides could not agree to irresponsible statements issued by his boss while on foreign trips. Everything is pointing to the fact that Zhirinovskiy will weigh his words while in Poland: Otherwise this visit could just be one of his last foreign trips. Witold Laskowski speaking for the Wiadomosci [bulletin] from Moscow.
