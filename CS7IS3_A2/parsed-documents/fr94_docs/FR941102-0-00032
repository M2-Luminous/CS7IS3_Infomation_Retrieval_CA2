FR941102-0-00032 FR941102-0-00005 In light of this, the Board invites comment as to whether the abbreviated notice procedure for small acquisitions should be retained, eliminated, or amended. Simplified Notice Procedures The Board believes that these proposals will substantially reduce the burden associated with the approval requirement under section 4 of the BHC Act without resulting in unsafe and unsound banking practices. Because the provisions of Section 346 are implemented immediately, the Board is proposing to adopt the following regulation as an interim rule in connection with nonbanking activities conducted pursuant to section 4 of the BHC Act. The Board invites comments on all aspects of this interim rule, and will amend this rule as needed to reflect the comments received. The Board also invites suggestions on other means of reducing the regulatory burden associated with the System's application and notices procedures. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Board does not believe that these changes will have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This interim rule will reduce the regulatory burden on bank holding companies imposed by the Board's procedures, and the Board is inviting public comment on additional ways to reduce regulatory burden. Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis No collections of information pursuant to section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ) are contained in these changes, and comment is invited on a proposal that would reduce the current information collection requirements imposed in connection with certain applications.
