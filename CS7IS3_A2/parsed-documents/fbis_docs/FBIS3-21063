The chance for plastics to develop into a recyclable packaging material continues to increase. Since the Federal German Packaging Ordinance went into effect, more and more paths are bypassing the landfill. According to Dr. Albrecht Eckell, "the question of plastic recycling will be answered by 1998," simply by means of raw-material recycling. Dr. Eckell is the chairman of the Association of the Plastics Producing Industry. He said that the chemical transformation of plastic waste back into its initial products could recycle several hundred thousand metric tons in the coming years. This was recently at the symposium on "Plastics + Environment" in Cologne. The announced recycling push is also urgently needed. However, in the opinion of Prof. Dr. Klaus Topfer, in the future, human labor will no longer be scarce. Rather energy, raw materials, and environmental media will be the scarce commodities of the economy. This will show up in the costs of the production processes as desired by the Federal Minister of the Environment. For this reason, he wants to continue to set clear priorities and provide an economic stimulus for material recycling (quota for plastics starting on 1 January 1998: at least 60%, half of this by means of polymer reutilization) even in the amendment of the Packaging Ordinance. However, Topfer also admits that thermal recycling is not only a possibility but a necessity for the remaining 40%. The recycling principle behind the German Packaging Ordinance is correct in the opinion of Wolfram Bruck. He is the manager of Dual System Deutschland (DSD) in Bonn. "Our government was compelled to reduce the amount of waste going to landfills because an economy can also choke on clogged landfills." Today, with the help of the Dual System, about 50% of the volume has been transferred from the trash cans of Federal German households onto other recycling tracks. In Cologne, Prof. Dr. Michael Droscher also confirmed the necessity of plastics recycling. "Used plastics do not belong in landfills," according to the chemist with a master's degree, responsible for environmental issues at Huls. Independent of this, there is less and less landfill space available. Droscher says, "In 1977, there were still 1,355 landfills. Today, there are about 290 and, by 1995, the capacity will drop again by 50%." In spite of this, the plastics expert remains skeptical with regard to the recycling quotas of the Minister of the Environment. "At some specific recycling quota, we start to make ecological nonsense," says Droscher. For this reason, the plastic recycling should not be controlled using rigid quotas but rather using ecological and economical factors. Droscher says, "There is no one true path. Every recycling path must be optimized. Processed-material recycling is to be limited to large pure material streams. Raw-material recycling and thermal recycling should handle large quantities of mixed plastics. Small and highly polluted packaging should remain in the trash and be mineralized, thus incinerated, with this trash."
