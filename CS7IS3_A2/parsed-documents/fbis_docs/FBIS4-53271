He said that news reports that used nuclear fuel rods have already been removed for installment of new ones are contrary to the truth. But, he hinted that preparatory work to replace nuclear fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor may have begun by now. He added: "We do not know whether nuclear fuel rods are being replaced. But, it, if any, may be preparatory work. It takes two months to replace nuclear fuel rods." In the meantime, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] said that a team to inspect North Korea's nuclear facilities went to Yongbyon via Pyongyang on 18 May. The inspection team will conduct inspections of the nuclear reprocessing facilities--whose inspections were held in check by the North Korean side last March--and will examine the surveillance camera installed at the nearby nuclear reactor. The IAEA side pointed out that such an examination alone can find out whether fuel rods at the nuclear reactor have been replaced or not.
