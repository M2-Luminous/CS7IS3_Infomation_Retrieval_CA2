In a communique, the rebels announced the creation of a guerrilla group called the Zapata National Liberation Army [Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional -- EZLN]. The communique calls on EZLN forces "to advance toward the capital of the country, defeat the Mexican Federal Army, protect the civilian population during this liberating advance, and allow the liberated people to elect their own administrative authorities in a free and democratic manner." Eyewitness Ernesto Riedwyl told AFP that in San Cristobal de las Casas some 200-300 people took over the municipal palace. According to Riedwyl, these people are now engaged in destroying and looting the building. Riedwyl said: "They are all wearing uniforms with green trousers, brown shirts, and red hats and scarfs. They are also carrying weapons of various calibers, and they have modern radio communications equipment." He added, "Most of them are Indians, but there are also some white people with light-colored eyes." According to this witness, the rebellion began at 0230 (0830 GMT) when the rebels took over the Justice Palace, which they burned. Later, they took over the San Cristobal de las Casas Mayor's Office. According to Radio Red, the rebels are also causing "disturbances" in other areas of Chiapas State, which borders Guatemala. According to reporters, security forces in Chiapas have tried to persuade the rebels to resolve their problems through legal means, but this report has not been officially confirmed.
