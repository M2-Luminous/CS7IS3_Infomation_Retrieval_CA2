He emphasized during the discussion: It is a long-term strategic task to arm the People's Liberation Army [PLA] with the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should apply what we have studied in our practical work and raise our awareness of the need to carry out the major tasks. Present at the discussion were Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission; and Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou, members of the Central Military Commission. Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech after hearing views of several trainees. He pointed out: We should study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping thoroughly and unremittingly. Since the publication of the Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, the whole party, the whole PLA, and the whole country have rapidly whipped up an upsurge of study, which has played a great role in achieving an ideological unity in the party and in promoting reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the Marxism of contemporary China, as well as a strong spiritual pillar which inspires the whole party, the whole Army, and the people of all nationalities across the country to work with one heart and one mind to attain our grand goals. The more progress we make in reform, opening up, and modernization, the more new circumstances and new problems we will have to deal with. So, it is even more necessary to arm ourselves ideologically with scientific theories. We will be able to achieve one success after another in reform, opening up, and modernization if our party has a large number of cadres who have had a grasp of basic Marxist theories and the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, systematically and practically, not fragmentarily nor hollowly, and who know how to apply these theories in studying and solving important problems. It is no easy task to truly master and use skillfully Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and it won't work to merely study it once or twice. We must study it constantly and repeatedly in light of our reality, deem the study to be a long-term strategic task, and pay attention to it persistently and unremittingly. Jiang Zemin pointed out: Comrade Xiaoping has always called on us to study Marxist stand, viewpoints, and methods, and he always opposes dogmatism and pragmatism. The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a complete scientific system, in which the basic views and doctrines are inter-related and none of them is isolated. During the course of study and application, we should always pay attention to comprehensively and correctly understanding the essence of those views and doctrines and know the relationship among them. We should have a firm grasp of the quintessence of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. We should know how to study and ponder Comrade Xiaoping's basic views in conjunction with the relationship among them, so that we will have a thorough and profound grasp of them. Jiang Zemin said: In order to study well Comrade Xiaoping's works, it is very important to study them in conjunction with the important party documents issued since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, as well as the important policy decisions of the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. In this way, it will be easier for us to enhance our understanding of Comrade Xiaoping's important thoughts and his basic theories and views, as well as the party's policies. At present, it is particularly necessary to study well the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the theory and basic knowledge on socialist market economy. Jiang Zemin emphasized: During the course of thoroughly studying Volume 3 of the Selected Work of Ding Xiaoping, we should consider the major tasks of the party's work this year and raise our awareness of the need to carry out those tasks. The Central Committee has set the major tasks of the party's work this year as seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining statability. They are based on a comprehensive analysis and correct appraisal of the present domestic and international situation. The key to success in promoting China's reform, opening up, and modernization lies in handling well the relationship among reform, development, and stability. We have promulgated a number of reform measures this year for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, which is like a battle to storm heavily fortified positions. If we win in the battle and successfully build the framework of a socialist market economy, we will lay an important foundation for China's economic development. To win in this tough battle particularly requires the whole party, the whole Army, and the people of all nationalities across the country to unite as one, share weal and woe, take concerted actions, and forge ahead. Leading party cadres at all levels should fully understand the major tasks of the party's work and conscientiously subordinate themselves to and serve these major tasks. Our armed forces should provide a strong security guarantee for reform, opening up, and modernization and take up the historic responsibility. Through the study of Comrade Xiaoping's works, all PLA officers and men should identify themselves ideologically with the major tasks of the party's work and with the party's and government's important policies of deepening reforms. We should strive to promote reform, development, and stability at our workposts. We should educate the vast number of officers and men to treat correctly the readjusted relationship among different interest groups in the course of reform; conscientiously subordinate their individual interest to the interest of the whole; and set an example in stressing lofty ideals, good discipline, unity, and the interest of the whole. Jiang Zemin emphasized, "While thoroughly studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiapping, we should strive to improve the overall quality of the leading groups and promote Army building in an all-round way. While studying Comrade Xiaoping's works, we must consider the Army's realities, carry out well the decisions of the Central Military Commission, and constantly promote Army building. In strengthening the leading groups, we should first adhere to the requirements of making the leading cadres more revolutionary, a younger average age, better educated, and professionally more competent. Comrade Xiaoping has always attached importance to training and selecting young outstanding cadres. He has had many important expositions in this regard, and we should comprehend and implement them very well. Second, we should raise our ability in conceiving strategic concepts and policy decisions. We should strive to learn from Comrade Xiaoping's rich experience and superb leadership in governing the party, the government, and the Army, as well as his revolutionary courage and resourcefulness, his realistic spirit and his scientific methods. We should learn from his ability in grasping the development characteristics and law of things. We should know how to discuss important matters and formulate important policies in consideration of the interest of the whole. We should constantly improve our ability in guiding the Army building and in keeping complex situation under control. Third, we should step up the cultivation of party character and maintain ethical integrity. A strong and pure party character among the leading cadres is an extremely important condition for realizing the party's program and line. During the course of developing a socialist market economy, leading cadres should take the lead in resisting the influence of mammonism, extreme individualism, and decadent life style. Fourth, we should seriously improve the style of leadership and perform actual deeds. We have already laid down clear and definite principles and policies for the building and reform of the party, the country, and the Army. The key now is making actual, strenuous efforts to carry them out. Leading cadres at oil levels should go deep into the realities of life, conduct investigation and study, combine general calls with specific guidance, and do a solid and effective work. We should resolutely oppose the seeking of superficial forms and pretty appearances, as well as the practice of exaggeration and fraud. There are a multitude of things to do for the troops, but all of them must be done eventually at the grass- roots units. We must build the grass-roots units well, fully arouse the enthusiasm of the cadres and fighters there, lay an even stronger foundation for the Army, and enhance its combat effectiveness in an all-round way. The rotational training class is run by the National Defense University at the request of the General Political Department. Also present at the discussion were Xu Caihou, deputy director of the General Political Department, and Zhu Dunfa and Li Wenqing, commandant and political commissar respectively of the National Defense University.
