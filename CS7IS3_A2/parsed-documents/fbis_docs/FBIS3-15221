He said the arrest of the spy must not hamper the partnership between Moscow and London. "Contrary to Americans, who are fretting due to the Ames case we do not make a tragedy of what has happened. The British special service is collecting material on Russia, it is natural. It is not natural to take the stand of "offended innocence" as the U.S. did in the Ames case," the diplomat stressed. He emphasized that intelligence and counterintelligence were inalienable parts of any state. They have existed and will exist as long as the state itself exists. At the same time, there must be civilized ways to react to the arrest of a spy working for the other state. This reaction, in fact, tests the true character of the bilateral relations, the diplomat said.
