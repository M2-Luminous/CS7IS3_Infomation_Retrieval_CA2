The four companies are: France's Sotema (Agricultural Remote-Sensing Company), Germany's GAF [expansion not provided](Gesellschaft fur Angewandte Fernerkundung), Great Britain's NRSC (National Remote Sensing Centre), and Italy's Telespazio, a subsidiary of the IRI-STET [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction-Turin Telephone Finance Company] group. The Eurofast GEIE will specialize in agricultural and forestry applications of satellite imaging. "The creation of Eurofast demonstrates the intent of the Europeans to organize as a high-performance remote-sensing structure, with sights set on occupying center stage in a high-technology sector of the future," said Jean-Claude Cazaux, general manager of Sotema, in his 24 January announcement of the forming of the new group. Eurofast ("Forestry and Agriculture with Satellite Technologies") is expected to improve European potentials for assisting various parts of the world in dealing with problems of land-use inventories, estimates of agricultural and forestry areas, forecasting of harvests, etc. The group will also be able to develop its activity in related domains such as the environment, and the study or measurement of the impact that large-scale projects may have on natural resources. It is thus expected to "open up new possibilities for developing operational tools for use by rural land administrators, land-use planners, and agricultural and forestry policy makers," says Sotema. Actually, the four firms are already jointly providing satellite remote-sensing services to the European Community, particularly under the European MARS pilot project on the use of remote sensing for the development of agricultural statistics.
