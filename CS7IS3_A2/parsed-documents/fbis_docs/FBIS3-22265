The meeting stretched into the night as European Affairs ministers prepared for negotiations Tuesday [22 February] with counterparts from the applicant countries -- Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Monday's meeting was dominated by Austria's attempts to curb polluting truck traffic over the Alps, and Spain's efforts to extract a high price for Norway's integration into EU fisheries affairs. ``We are not the ones doing the asking. The union is warning that applicants must accept EU rules,'' Belgium's European Affairs Minister Robert Urbain said. Hanging over the meeting was a decision by Swiss voters on Sunday [20 February] that all truck traffic across the Swiss Alps must be switched to rail, for environmetal reasons. Switzerland is not among the current applicants for EU membership, but diplomats pointed out that Austrians might follow the Swiss example by also taking a hardline environmental stand in the Austrian Alps. Austria is insisting on maintaining strict limits on truck traffic across the Alps until 2004, seven years later than accepted by Brussels. As a member of the EU, however, Austria would be expected to accept its fair share of the huge truck traffic flow across the EU's single market, which might be unacceptable to its voters. The diplomats warned that the traffic flow across Austria could increase because of trucks diverted from Switzerland, adding fuel to the environmentalist anti-EU movement in Austria. In the fish dispute, Spain was insisting at Monday's meeting that its fishing fleet, the biggest in the EU, be given access to Norway's fishing waters as part of a membership deal. France and Ireland were also pushing for protection from cheap Norwegian fish exports. And the EU countries were battling with another important consequence of taking Austria, Finland and Norway into the union -- the need to cut their high agricultural prices down to EU levels. Prices in these countries are inflated by hefty subsidies needed for the survival of farmers in harsh Arctic and Alpine conditions. The two sides are split over how to cushion the effect of price equalisation, and the EU's demands that the applicant countries should bear the full cost. Adding pressure to the negotiations is a deadline of February 28 for finishing them so that the applicants can join the EU by January 1 next year. The EU's Greek presidency has pencilled in February 25-28 for a final four-day negotiating bid to reach agreement before March 1.
