What is your comment right now? [Kanda] The use of collective defensive rights is not allowed in Japan, and the Defense Agency should stick to the government's current stand on constitutional affairs. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you mean your remarks at the news conference were just your personal opinions? [Kanda] No, I do not. At that time, I probably misled some of you by using inappropriate words. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also said he thinks the government should review its interpretation of the Constitution... [Kanda interrupting] Everybody has his or her opinion on the Constitution because Japan is a democratic nation. Even in the future, various opinions will surface. Yet, the prime minister, the foreign minister, and other cabinet members met on 10 May to reconfirm the Hata administration's stance not to change the government's stance toward constitutional issues. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you think the Japanese Government can adequately deal with future problems within the current interpretation of the Constitution? [Kanda] That is right. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Kazuo Aichi, former Defense Agency director general, once said the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] Law may be revised within the framework of the Constitution. Do you have a definite plan for that? [Kanda] I am not determined yet. Basically, we think it is preferable to seek a peaceful settlement by patiently persuading North Korea to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Some quarters say, in the post-Cold War world, Japan should contribute more to the United States to ensure security in the Far East based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. What is your opinion on that point? [Kanda] Some people actually say the nature of the Japan-U.S. security alliance should be changed to catch up with trends in the post-Cold War period; however, it is still uncertain what the global framework for the post-Cold War period will be. In this sense, I still attach importance to the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Are you going to promote the "arms reduction" policy advocated by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa? [Kanda] The future direction of Japan's defense policy is being discussed at the government's advisory Defense Affairs Council, and I would like to hear the advisory panel's opinion. While the trend of disarmament is spreading over the world, Japan is still under certain military pressures in North East Asia. I would like to composedly deal with my tasks in view of various circumstances, rather than blindly going for arms increase or reduction policies. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] In 1995, the government should review the UN Peace Cooperation Law. Do you want to unfreeze a ban on SDF participation in UN peace enforcement forces? [Kanda] Japan's participation in UN peace enforcement forces should be discussed as a long-term goal, but Japan must avoid use of military forces overseas. I personally take a prudent stance toward the issue. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Hata administration was inaugurated as a minority government. What are the possible impacts on the defense policies? [Kanda] To seek the Social Democratic Party of Japan's return to the coalition, I would like to leave room for negotiations.
