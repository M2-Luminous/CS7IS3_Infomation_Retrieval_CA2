Levin: ``Cosmic Horizons of Russian Communications''] [Text] At the center of attention of organizers and guests of the press conference held in February at the press center of the RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs were questions of satellite communications, its present and future. Journalists talked about this topic (heretofore largely ``closed'' to the mass media) with the leaders of legislative bodies, industries, agencies and, of course, scientists whose efforts are largely responsible for the fame of our engineering work in space, including satellite communications. The reason for the meeting was launching of the ``Rossiya'' Program of Development of Satellite Communications and Broadcasting approved by our nation's government last year. Speedy updating of communication facilities has recently come to be one of the main concerns of the Russian Government. It has become abundantly clear that without up-to-date telecommunications, we cannot set up an effective mechanism of economic reform and integrate ourselves into the international community. Reaching this goal over the great expanse of our nation is no easy matter, and therefore organization of communications via satellite with many remote regions is not only more advantageous than building relay lines or laying cables, but at times is the only way to get information ``cargo'' to and from these places. Of course, this is not just a matter of telephone calls or data transmission, but also of television broadcasting of local and national programs. However, as witnessed by RF Minister of Communications V. B. Bulgak, the current level of development of communications cannot be considered satisfactory. The communication satellites now in use were developed in the seventies, and therefore are not up to today's world level in throughput and performance. Moreover, there is a shortage not only of the satellites themselves, but also of ground stations, which is slowing down the development of communications and television broadcasting in many regions of the Russian ``boondocks.'' Last year, the fraction of satellite communication lines was only 6 percent of the total volume of international channels in the nation, while actual demand was at least 20 percent. Many reasons have been named for such a sad situation, among which one of the main ones is the disproportion evolved in the past between the number of military and civilian satellites. Figures have even been cited: to 140 of the former there have been only 36 of the latter, and of those 36 only 10 were designed for communications and broadcasting. So one of the main goals of Russian communication satellite doctrine is conversion of defense satellites. Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to assume that mere launching of new satellites or defense conversion of old ones is a panacea. Dozens of satellites may be placed in orbit, but nothing would be accomplished. We need a developed reception network, as otherwise we will be throwing money ``into space''in a real sense. We must uniformly develop the satellite and ground segments, making a much greater investment in the latter than is now the case. And incidentally, even without launching new satellites, we could cover all of Siberia today with TV broadcasts; however, the ``satellite potential'' is not being completely used because of a lack of ground stations. To correct the situation that has evolved, a Program of Development of Satellite Communications and Broadcasting has been approved; implementation of this Program will enable us to provide telephone service to inaccessible and remote regions of Russia, to set up new main networks, to organize mobile satellite communication, to considerably increase the volume of data transmission and the number of international channels, and also to provide multiple-program television broadcasting over the entire territory of the nation. In accordance with the intention of the developers of the Program (Scientific Production Association of Applied Mechanics, Scientific Research Institute of Radio, Central Scientific Research Institute of Communications, ``Avtomatika'' Production Association and ``Iskra'' Production Association), the entire satellite communication system will consist of three subsystems: fixed satellite service, mobile communications, and direct television broadcasting. Within the scope of the first subsystem, trunk and international communication lines will be organized, as well as lines of intrazonal and rural communications, business communications and data networks. Priority will be given to zonal and local communications, particularly in regions of the Far North, Siberia and the Far East, where communication is possible generally only via satellite. The subsystem of mobile communications will connect subscribers of mobile and remote facilities: ships and aircraft, railroad transport and the like situated not only on the territory of Russia, but also beyond its borders. Finally, direct television broadcasting will be the base for organizing universal coverage by two national TV programs and also local (regional) programs. To handle these tasks, new advanced satellites are to be developed as outlined by Academician M. F. Reshetnov, general designer and director general of the Scientific Production Association of Applied Mechanics. Incidentally, not many of us had ever even heard of the SPA of AM. Situated in the formerly classified city of Krasnoyarsk-23, this enterprise for several decades has been the center of realization of nearly all our space programs, both military and civilian. But, of course, defense purposes predominated. The SPA of AM is now ``beating swords into plowshares,'' and to that end a joint-stock company of the same name has already been set up within the scope of the Association, dealing with the business of bringing life to the Program of development of Russian satellite communications, mainly on a commercial basis. Work is in progress today at the SPA of AM on new satellites: ``Gals,'' ``Ekspress,'' ``Arkos,'' ``Gonets,'' ``Sovkanstar'' and ``Mayak.'' These will not just replace their predecessors in orbit, but will take on some new functions as well. For example, the well known ``Gorizont'' satellites will be gradually replaced by ``Ekspress'' satellites that will begin operating next year. The first ``Ekspress'' will be launched this year. The new satellites will support transmission of television programs, as well as telephony signals and data. For these satellites, the Scientific Research Institute of Radio is developing new ground stations with antennas 2.5-4 m in diameter. And in a few years, the ``Ekspress-M'' satellite is to be launched, which will need a ``dish'' only 0.9-1.5 m in diameter for signal reception. According to tentative estimates, introduction of ``Ekspress'' satellites will quadruple or quintuple the throughput of the satellite communication system, and the lifetime of the satellite itself will be more than doubled. The increased throughput of the ``Ekspress'' trunks will be made possible by the use of new multiple access equipment with FDM and TDM, high-speed modems in ground stations, and the use of statistical multiplexing equipment in the latter. Quite promising is the prospect of introducing low-orbit ``Gonets'' satellites that will be used to transmit various kinds of information, including signals for E-mail service. The whole world is showing interest in low-orbit satellites, though we have been using them for decades, strictly for military purposes, of course. The principal advantages of communication systems with such satellites are low cost, and the capability of using simple and inexpensive terminals. The SPA of AM is now working on the first civilian low-orbit satellite, which last year was granted a ``visa'' for the radio band of 300/400 MHz by the World Administrative Conference on Radio Frequencies (WACR-92). Plans call for launching 36 ``Gonets'' satellites into circular orbit at an altitude of about 1500 km. The low-orbit satellite system should begin working in 1994-1995. Another new thing learned by those attending the press conference: ``Gals'' satellites with three-band on-board relay, and ``Gals-R'' satellites with four-band relay. This equipment can be used to organize regional television broadcasting to individual small-sized receiver stations. Five sets will be integrated into a group to provide relay broadcasting to five two-hour time zones of as many as four television and radio programs. For signal reception from ``Gals,'' the Scientific Research Institute of Radio has developed ground stations with antennas 2.5 and 1.5 m in diameter (professional) and 0.9 m in diameter (individual). Nor did speakers fail to give attention to the ``Marafon'' mobile satellite system, which has been a topic of discussion for several years. It turns out that it will be introduced in the not very distant future. ``Arkos'' satellites are to be launched into geostationary orbit next year, and ``Mayak'' satellites will be put into highly elliptical orbit in 1995-1996. Five ``Arkoses'' and four ``Mayaks'' will be the basis of the ``Marafon'' system that will begin to operate in full volume early next century. The throughput of the future system will be 1800-2000 telephone channels. Naturally, the expense of implementing such an ambitious Program will be enormous. The handouts at the press conference gave a figure of 13 billion rubles for the period from 1992 through the year 2000 in 1991 prices. Where do we intend to get this money? It was explained that only 9.8 percent of this sum will be taken from the federal budget. All the rest will come from monies outside the budget. It is proposed that interest be maximized on the part of Russian businessmen and foreign investors. The SPA of AM has already made good progress in accumulating experience in such business activity by offering to lease Russian satellites to foreign companies, including launching services and technical support. Another example of international cooperation in space is the Russian- Canadian project ``Sovkanstar,'' providing for setting up an international commercial satellite communication system to cover Russia and several other nations. Our specialists will design the satellite platform, and the Canadians will design the payload: a relay and antennas with minimum weight and energy consumption. Provisions also call for production of inexpensive Russian ground stations with antennas 2.5 and 1.5 m in diameter intended for business communications. In a word, our work in aeronautics and space, which has recently been on the brink of economic disaster, may now become a rather lucrative business.
