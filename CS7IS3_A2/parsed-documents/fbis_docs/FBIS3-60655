Andres Garcia de la Cruz, executive secretary of the Atomic Energy Commission of Cuba, said that the agency should demand that the known nuclear powers honor their commitment to end the nuclear arms race and to disarm, a commitment set 25 years ago. Garcia de la Cruz made these comments during a meeting of the agency's Board of Governors, and he insisted on the adoption of a new policy to strengthen the efficiency of the safeguard [salvaguardia] system. Garcia de la Cruz also pointed out that, before proceeding with the implementation of these programs, it is necessary to establish an adequate legal framework and to proceed with the programs without waiting for the results of the technical and economic evaluation to determine their implications from the legal standpoint.
