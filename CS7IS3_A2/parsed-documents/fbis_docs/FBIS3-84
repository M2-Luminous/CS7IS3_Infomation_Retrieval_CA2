Here is an excerpt of the communique issued at the end the deliberations. It is read by Gabonese Finance Minister Paul Toungui: [Begin recording] Concerning the consequences of the devaluation of the CFA franc, the heads of state noted that prices skyrocketed and this resulted in a substantial fall in purchasing power, as was predicted. They examined the backup measures taken for three different purposes. The measures were implemented through the Bank of Central African States, BEAC, to check rising inflation; the states in the subregion to minimize increases in prices of essential commodities; and through international financial institutions, including the IMF, with whom letters of intent were signed to ensure an influx of funds needed to reestablish financial balances and relaunch economic activities in our countries. Analyzing the effects of the monetary adjustment on the BEAC's balance-sheet, the heads of state noted the negative effects that the new exchange rate has had on their transaction accounts, all of which are now in debt. They therefore stressed the need to rapidly offset this loss. [end recording] This summit, which has just ended in Libreville, began 24 hours before the meeting of African finance ministers, which will examine a very important issue: problems related to the financing of development in Africa. This meeting, which is their fifth one, is held every two years.
