We must concentrate on implementing it from three aspects. [passage omitted] Firmly reaffirming the achievements made in this year's work, Chen Huanyou said: Since the beginning of this year, all localities in our province have earnestly implemented the guidelines in the important remarks made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his tour of southern China in early 1992 and the guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress, continued to seize opportunities, deepen reforms, open wider to the outside world, strengthen and improve our macroeconomic control, accelerate structural adjustments, speed up scientific and technological advances, and adhere to the principle of building a material civilization and a spiritual civilization simultaneously. As a result, the economy has been able to maintain its momentum of rapid growth. New progress has been made in building a spiritual civilization, in developing democracy and improving the legal system, and in strengthening the party organizationally. The general situation is good. The economy has been developing in a sustained and rapid way. The province's GNP this year is expected to increase by 18.5 percent over that of last year. New advances have been made in reform, and a new situation has developed in our export-oriented economy. According to estimates, our foreign exchange earnings made through exports this year are expected to rise 17.8 percent; the actual amount of utilized foreign capital has increased 69.5 percent; and about 9,000 joint-venture, foreign-funded, and cooperative enterprises have been approved. New achievements have been made in the development of science, technology, and education. New progress has been made in building a spiritual civilization. Party building has been strengthened. Chen Huanyou analyzed and explained the distinguishing features of this year's work as follows: First, we vigorously and comprehensively implemented the state's macroeconomic control measures, and took full advantage of the development opportunities. Under the circumstances of a tightened macroeconomic environment, we firmly and continuously fostered the thinking that "Development is the last word," and sought to develop as fast and efficiently as possible. Second, while maintaining a higher growth rate, we strove to improve the quality of economic operation. We notably strengthened our sense of the economy of scale in development, of bringing about coordinated development of various industries, and of relying on science and technology for progress. We also paid more attention to the substance of economic development and the quality of economic growth. Third, we found opportunities in the transition from the old to the new structure to further intensify reform and promote self-sustained economic growth. Fourth, we constantly upheld the policy of fostering both material and cultural and ideological progress, and attaching equal importance to both; we made overall plans and successfully arranged work in all fields; we mobilized the initiative of all cadres and the masses to create a favorable social environment in which the general situation was stable and everyone tried to make progress. Chen Huanyou pointed out that there are still difficulties and problems regarding capital, market, and commodity prices that should be taken seriously. He stressed the need to earnestly overcome these difficulties and resolve the problems in the course of conducting our work hereafter. Chen Huanyou pointed out: The year 1994 will be crucial to economic structural reform, and it will be a year of sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. The general requirements for next year's work are: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, we need to comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, further emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, and firmly seize the opportunity; we need to further intensify reform and accelerate the pace of building a new socialist market economic structure; we need to open wider to the outside world and accelerate the process of internationalizing Jiangsu's economy; further accelerate structural adjustment, raise economic standards and returns, and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy; we need to strengthen the building of socialist spiritual civilization and the work of combating corruption and building a clean government; and we need to strengthen party building and promote social progress in all fields.
