Feng Shibin, Chinese delegate and counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in Australia, made the remarks at a two-day informal regional consultation on illegal migration held here today. The consultation, hosted by the Australian Department of Immigration, offers a forum to exchange views and information on the problem of illegal migration in the region. Feng said that the Chinese Government has adopted a series of effective measures to prevent illegal migration, including the strengthening of legislation, the strict law enforcement, education and economic development. He described the illegal migration as an "international problem," which he said "can not be solved by any single country." "The Chinese Government is willing to cooperate with other countries in the effort to prevent illegal migration," he stressed. China, he said, maintains that all countries should further increase their cooperation on the basis of mutual respect and equal consultation. Feng concluded that "normal exchanges of personnel should be guaranteed" while cracking down on illegal migration and normal contacts between people in different countries should be encouraged and facilitated. The consultation was attended by delegates from 17 nations of the region and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
