Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, is leading the Palestinian side of this committee, while 'Uzi Dayan, head of the Israeli General Staff's Planning Branch, heads the Israeli side. The committee is discussing a timetable for the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho and the deployment of Palestinian forces there, including the number of Palestinian police to be stationed in the two areas, their tasks, and the equipment they will use. Official Palestinian sources told MENA that there are indications that Israel will accept the Palestinian demand for 10,000 Palestinian policemen. Formerly it insisted on limiting the number to only 6,000 policemen. They explained that this change in the Israeli position comes in the wake of the Hebron massacre of hundreds [as received] of Palestinian worshipers. Representatives of the international observers from Norway and Denmark who will be deployed in Hebron are expected to join the meeting of the Security Committee. It should be recalled that the observers team will consist of 160 members from Norway, Denmark, and Italy. The Palestinian delegation has held meetings in Cairo for the past two days to discuss the dispatch of Palestinian police officers to Gaza and Jericho. It has been decided that the first 300 police will enter these areas on Tuesday [5 April]. They will be followed by 1,500 more policemen on Thursday. Others will follow later. They will prepare for taking over control of the self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho in accordance with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. Israeli sources in Cairo said that General Amnon Shahaq will arrive Monday morning to participate in the negotiations regarding the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. [passage omitted] Other negotiations committees on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho self-rule agreement are scheduled to begin their meetings tomorrow. [passage omitted]
