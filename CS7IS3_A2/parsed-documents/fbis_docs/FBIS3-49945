Everything began this morning with the plenary session attended by all the delegations present in Geneva and the co-chairmen. The discussion in practice concerned talks between the Serbs and Croats, that is, their highest representatives and the co-chairmen as representatives of the international community, with the Muslim representatives, whose positions remain an enigma, and who are trying -- in one way or another -- to avoid accepting what is envisaged by the European Union's plan for solving the Bosnia- Herzegovina crisis. [passage omitted] During talks with the Muslims at the plenary session, all the issues pertaining to the European Union's peace plan were reviewed with the goal of determining the Muslims' position toward the proposals and a type of agreement reached between the Serbian and Croatian sides, which envisages the Muslims getting 33.3 percent of the territory for the Muslim republic in the former Bosnia- Herzegovina. As I have already mentioned, we have unofficially learned that the discussion was somber, primarily burdened by the conflicts between the Muslims and the Croats. President Izetbegovic again presented new territorial demands, which -- according to well- informed sources -- primarily pertain to certain towns in eastern and western Bosnia. President Milosevic intervened in the course of the discussion, prompted by the positions of the Muslim side and the positions presented by the representatives of the international community. He said that this peace conference had experienced evolution and continuity and that it could not keep reverting back to the beginning. The Serbian side, said Milosevic, has approached the demands of the European Union seriously and responsibly, because it presumed that the European Union had defined its proposal in the same way. The European Union's demands, embodied in the 33.3 percent of territory for the Muslim republic, a temporary UN protectorate for Sarajevo and Mostar, and the Muslim republic's access to the Sava River, have been fulfilled. The Serbian side, said Milosevic, had therefore accepted these demands. That is why, upon accepting the European Union's proposals, the Serbian side has come to Geneva this time to sign the peace plan. There can be no doubt, continued President Milosevic, that there can never be a perfect plan in all its details, but all the remaining issues can be successfully solved in mutual relations after establishing peace and in peace. President Milosevic said that he held the logical view that, by accepting the European Union's proposals, the conditions have been established for signing the peace plan and ending the war. Namely, the remaining remarks and adjustments cannot be a reason for continuing the war for any of the sides. That is why peace has to be immediately signed, while possible disagreements should be left to the interested parties' negotiations in the continuation of the talks. If the Muslim side should refuse to sign for peace, said Milosevic, in circumstances when the European Union's proposals have been accepted, I believe that the international community is under an obligation to clarify its positions toward its proposal with the Muslim side, while it should approach the Serbian side -- which has accepted its proposal -- in accordance with its obligation to lift the sanctions against the FRY and the Serbian people. This is its moral obligation, concluded Serbian President Milosevic at today's plenary session at which the Muslims' new demands were discussed, despite the fact that the Serbs, and even the Croats, have more or less fulfilled everything that has been asked of them in order to achieve -- in the European Union's view -- a just peace and future mutual life in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Jevdjovic] What does this [agreement with Croatia] mean in practice? Does it mean that the Republic of Croatia is still not recognized, or at least not within the present borders, the AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders? [FRY Foreign Minister Jovanovic] Certainly. This statement means neither recognition nor the establishment of diplomatic relations. Both issues call for a separate decision and the agreement of the two sides. As you can see from the contents [of the agreement signed today], this has not been achieved and this was not the objective. The objective was to establish communications embodied in permanent offices in Belgrade and Zagreb, which should facilitate mutual contacts and strengthen the orientation of the two sides [words indistinct] of peace and political solutions for the remaining controversial issues, which are not few, because their scope is considerable after the Yugoslav republics' secession from Yugoslavia [sentence as heard]. Therefore, there is no reason for any kind of speculation that this decision could mean prejudging any of the remaining political issues, least of all the issue of the Serbian Krajina, which needs to be solved according to the Vance plan in direct negotiations between the legitimate representatives of the Serbian people living there and the Croatian Government. [Jevdjovic] Does that mean that although the Croats have not as yet recognized Krajina, they have -- by accepting this document -- given up resolving the situation in the Krajina militarily? [Jovanovic] This statement means that as well, although we need to wait and see whether this will be strictly implemented in practice. However, [words indistinct] a guarantee for such a development, it is certain that (?we have made) a significant positive step toward strengthening this option toward the peaceful resolution of this issue through political negotiations with the legitimate representatives of the Krajina. This remains in the domain of the Krajina's legitimate representatives, and no one else has been authorized to solve this, nor do they wish to do so. [end recording]
