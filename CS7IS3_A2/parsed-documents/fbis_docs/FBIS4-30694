The estimate says deregulation will push the real annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate up by an average of 0.5 percent points, while 100 trillion yen in additional public investment will push the GDP growth rate up by 0.3 percent. However, deregulation is expected to result in 1.2 million less jobs, particularly in the distribution sector, and in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. The government's calculations considered four hypothetical cases: 1) Deregulation is not implemented and no additional public investment on top of the current public investment program (430 trillion yen over 10 years); 2) an additional 100 trillion yen in investment alone is implemented; 3) only deregulation is implemented; and 4) both additional public investment and deregulation are implemented. It proceeded to compute sector-by- sector production volume and demand for labor up to the year 2000 using the interindustry relations table. In this process, the effects of deregulation were considered difficult to quantify. Therefore, calculations were made on the assumption that through market liberalization and easing of the licensing and permit systems, the price gap with the major advanced nations is eliminated, and the productivity of primary industries and the distribution sector is raised to a level comparable to the European countries and United States by the year 2000. According to government calculations, in case 1) real GDP growth rate will be 2.3 percent. In terms of demand and supply in the labor market, while labor supply will be 67.79 million in 2000, according to the Management and Coordination Agency's estimate, demand will remain at 67.3 million, rendering 490,000 workers superfluous. In case 3) where deregulation is implemented, GDP will grow by 2.8 percent due to the expansion of personal consumption as a result of narrowing down the price gap between Japan and foreign countries. At the same time, increased efficiency in the primary industries and the distribution industry -- covering both retailers and wholesalers -- demand for labor will be 66.1 million, 1.2 million less than in the case of non-implementation of deregulation. On the other hand, if additional public investment alone is implemented, an annual economic growth rate of 2.6 percent can be attained, and demand for labor will be 68.76 million. However, the government's analysis says that in this case, policies to protect industries with low productivity will remain, and the trade surplus will not be reduced substantially. Therefore, the government's analysis stresses that both deregulation and public investment should be implemented to enable stable growth at an annual rate of 3 percent. In terms of labor demand and supply, the labor force will move from industries which are inefficient, compared to other countries, to industries with growth potentials. The estimate places labor demand at 67.56 million, roughly on par with labor supply (67.79 million).
