"President Kim gave me a message to give to President Clinton. It will be in his hands tomorrow (Friday) morning," said Graham, talking for the first time about his trip last week to Pyongyang. The message was being carried to Washington by one of Graham's aides. The globe-travelling preacher, who arrived in Pyongyang last Thursday for his second visit in as many years, said he was "not free" to say what was in either message. But he revealed that Kim was "very interested" in what Clinton had asked Graham to convey to him. Graham, 75, said he discussed a wide range of subjects over lunch with Kim, 81, whose Stalinist state is suspected of developing nuclear weapons, upsetting East Asia's strategic balance. "He appeared to be vigorous and in good health. My strong impression was that he continues to be the dominant figure in North Korean political and social life," he said.
