They said the quarrel emerged when one of the two Duma members wanted to jump the line for food, but could not say exactly whether it was Zhirinovskiy or Goryachev. Anyway Goryachev, a prominent businessmen from St. Petersurg, hit Zhirinovskiy in the face leaving a bleeding scratch on it. Police were called in and doctors rendered first aid to Zhirinovskiy. The Russian Nationalist leader promised that Goryachev will be the first to get jailed in the notorious Lefortovo Prison, which used to belong to the KGB. Zhirinovskiy, evidently meant this would happen when he becomes the Russian president of which he is dreaming. However, Goryachev is not the first man to receive such a threat from Zhirinovskiy. Right after the Decemeber 12 elections Zhirinovskiy promised the same fate to Gennadiy khazanov, a famous comic who often mocks him. Khazanov responded by appearing in a show dressed as a convict with the number "001" sign on his shirt. This is not the first case that Zhirinovskiy got beaten up. Before December elections bodyguards of popular singer Sofi Rotaru beat him up at a concert.
