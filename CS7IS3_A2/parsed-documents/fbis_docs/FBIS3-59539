Its present capital is 3.96 billion francs [Fr]. The operation will reduce the nominal value of the stock, pending a capital contribution of Fr8.6 billion by the state, that is to be effected in two transfers of funds, one at the end of this year and the other during 1994. Technically, its capital will first be reduced by Fr3.5 billion in two stages. The first stage will consist of a consolidation: Ten Fr20 shares will become one Fr200 share. In the second stage, the value of this share will be divided by 10, reducing it to Fr20. This reduction, combined with the withdrawal of Fr3.4 billion from the "issues, mergers, and contributions" reserve account, will lower Bull's (still) negative balance brought forward, from Fr9.44 billion to Fr2.44 billion. Bull's capital stock is owned to the extent of 72 percent by the state, 16 percent by France Telecom, 5.6 percent by IBM, 4.4 percent by NEC, and 1.7 percent by the public. Over the past nine months, Bull's revenue has declined by 8.6 percent (Fr18.24 billion).
