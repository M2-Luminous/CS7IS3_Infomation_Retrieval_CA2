So far Albania has rejected both dialogue at the ministerial level and bilateral contacts of the two countries' experts, even in spheres such as environmental issues. Albania supports the separatist ethnic Albanian movement in Serbia's Kosovo province whose leaders have illegally proclaimed the "Kosovo Republic" and advocate its secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia and annexation with Albania. Albania is the only country to recognize the "Kosovo Republic."
