Other groups, until recently willing to appeal to the peasant tradition, today renounce the "class character" and prefer to call themselves nationwide parties. In seeking their place rather in the center or on the right of the political spectrum, they place themselves within broader alliances as their "peasant legs." Kaczynski's Peasant Activists PSL-Peasant Accord (PSL-PL), the group led by Gabriel Janowski, entered the center right bloc called forth by Center Accord (PC) and the Christian-National Union (ZChN). The right-wing tendencies of the PSL-PL do not, however, apply to its economic program. Janowski's group is against the "overly strong" competition in Polish agriculture. The president of this party maintains that "our farmer is sufficiently innovative, and it is not necessary to flog him with the whip of competition." Also for this reason, Gabriel Janowski, former minister of agriculture (in the Olszewski and Suchocka governments), strived to introduce measures to protect the peasants against foreign competition, favoring the introduction of compensatory payments, fighting for minimum prices and for establishing the Fund for Farm Restructuring and Debt Reduction (FRiOR). The PSL-PL leader, on the other hand, is against "the ideological privatization of the PGR's (the state farms)." He thinks that the land should not end up in the hands of people with no connection to agriculture. The right-wing tendencies of the PL manifests itself in the ideological sphere. The PL is closely tied to the Catholic Church and was even viewed as the "peasant leg of the ZChN," although, despite attempts by both parties, it did not result in the formation of an electoral coalition of these parties before 19 September [the date of the parliamentary elections of 1993]. Janowski's party, underscoring its ties to Catholicism, supported the introduction into legal acts of the obligation to comply with Christian values and today resists the proposed compromises to the abortion law. The right-wingedness of the PSL-PL also is based on its relationship to communism--the party leaders are advocates of decommunization, and the party deputies voted in favor of the lustration resolution. Those among the PL's politicians who found themselves on Macierewicz's list [Antoni Macierewicz, minister of internal affairs in the Olszewski government, who produced a list of people he claimed had cooperated with the secret police in the communist government], even if, like Antoni Furtak, they won their suit against the Ministry of Internal Affairs, were not among the candidates for Sejm deputy in the September elections. The position of the PSL-PL in the alliance called forth by the PC and the ZChN is rather weak. It became further weakened when the "tripartite accord" was transformed into a "quaternary accord" (Romuald Szeremietiew of the RDR [Movement for the Republic] entered). Today the PL fulfills the rolls of the "peasant leg" of the future federation of right-wing parties, which want to be open also to rural centers. Even though its leaders claim that the PL has about 20,000 members (hence a rather large party), the election results of 2.37 percent do not testify to its strength. Waldemar Pawlak's Polish Peasant Party is not, according to PSL-PL activists, an authentic peasant party but, rather, a group that emerged from the rural nomenklatura. In the best case, Pawlak's PSL is described as a leftist party, in opposition to the rightist or centrist Solidarity-based peasant parties. Former PSL-PL Senator Janusz Woznica thinks "the PSL is a leftist party with a ZSL [United Peasant Party, the peasant party allowed under communism, hence considered compromised] lineage, the PL has a center lineage, and the SLCh (Peasant-Christian Party) has a rather rightist countenance." Korwin's Peasant Activists The other right-wing bloc--the "11 November Accord," established by UPR (Union for Real Politics), the PChD (Party of Christian Democrats), and the PK (Conservative Party)--also has its "peasant leg"--namely, the very same SLCh of Jozef Slisz and Artur Balazs mentioned by Woznica [UPR is headed by Janusz Korwin Mikke, hence the name in the subtitle]. In its program, the SLCh clearly states, however, that it is not a peasant party but a "nationwide" party. "The problems of the functioning of the state are for us more important than the defense of the interests of career farmers," states SLCh deputy chairman Artur Balazs. He does not, however, hide the fact that his party emerged from the countryside, that it was formed as an alternative to the ZSL, and that it continues to maintain this formula. Slisz's and Balazs's party from the very beginning saw itself on the right side of the political scene and came out for procapitalist changes and integration with the EC. The SLCh is the only party with a rural lineage that cites Leszek Balcerowicz [former minister of finance and deputy premier, whose economic program set the reform in motion]. The party even published a lecture by the former minister given at a seminar dealing with the future of the Polish countryside. The party's ties to the Catholic Ghurch are strong (as underscored by the adjective "Christian" in its name), but Balazs states that he understands Christianity to mean a catalogue of moral principles. "The PSL is a group with a leftist lineage, and it also implements that kind of program," says Artur Balazs, when asked to evaluate other peasant parties. "The PL is found on the right side of the political scene, but its program clearly differs from ours in that it is directed primarily toward the defense of peasant interests." The influences of the SLCh in the countryside are not the greatest, even though the party admits to having about 20,000 members (like the PL). "We do not propose easy solutions, and we do not promise universal, preferential, 10-percent credits. We think that the process of economic transformation must equally involve the countryside. This pertains to changes in agrarian structures and technical infrastructures--we are in favor of a modern countryside, simply stated, a European one," explains Balazs, who maintains that time will verify the electoral promises of the SLCh's opposition and that rural support for the SLCh will increase in two or perhaps three years.
