Liu Sung-fan, president of the ROC Legislative Yuan, accompanied by Yuan Vice President Wang Ching-ping and legislator Pan Wei-kang, is the most senior parliamentary leader from Taiwan to visit Australia since Canberra switched its recognition to Beijing in 1972, TECO representative Francias Li said. Li said Liu met Steven Martin, speaker of the Australian House of Representatives, in Canberra. Liu told Martin that Taiwan wanted to rejoin the UN because it is the world's 14th largest trading nation and its foreign exchange reserves are among the world's largest. "Our country wants to play a role in the world community and it's unfair that we are barred from the UN," Liu said. Martin said he fully understood Taiwan's stance. Liu and his party also met Senator Steven Loosley, chairman of the joint committee of foreign affairs, defense and trade. Liu asked Loosley to support Taiwan membership in the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum (APPF), he said in an interview. Loosley and 10 members of parliament of the Australian Labour Party and the opposition told Liu they support Taiwan's APPF membership bid and understand its aspirations to enter the UN, Li said. "The visit by President Liu will certainly help cement our substantive ties with Australia," Li noted. The delegation will leave for New Zealand on Thursday to meet their New Zealand counterparts before returning to Taipei on February 6.
