Prices were set for the goodwill, trademarks, and products of six Chinese and foreign enterprises. Great Wall Hotel's goodwill value is 260 million yuan; Beijing's Yeguangbei Distillery's goodwill value is over 53 million yuan; Hainan Provincial Airlines' goodwill value is 202.9 million yuan; Hainan's Pisike [0572 2448 0344] International Air Sightseeing Club's goodwill value is 107 million yuan. Sun Yuehuan, general manager of the Beijing Jiacheng Assets Appraisal Company, which announced the aforementioned results, told this reporter that the so-called intangible assets refer to copyright, patent rights, service trademarks, trademark rights, goodwill, and other nonmaterial assets. He said: The value of the intangible assets of many world-renowned enterprises is much higher than the value of their tangible assets and annual sales volumes. In China, people currently have not placed adequate importance on intangible assets. The value of the intangible assets of some enterprises with high goodwill, famous trademarks, and well-known brand names is very high; if their intangible assets are neglected in property right transactions and in other economic activities, their economic losses will be enormous. Some experts have said: As China opens its doors wider to the outside world, as enterprises strive to develop modern management systems, and as market competition becomes fiercer, increasing numbers of enterprises will place greater importance on their intangible assets. Intangible assets are an important factor for making investment in foreign countries, for reorganizing enterprises into joint stock companies, for protecting enterprises' own interests, and for expanding enterprises' influence. When an enterprise's property rights are transferred due to making joint investment or to merger, reorgnization, or sale of the enterprise, its intangible assets, which do not appear on its account, must not be overlooked if the value of its property is to be correctly estimated.
