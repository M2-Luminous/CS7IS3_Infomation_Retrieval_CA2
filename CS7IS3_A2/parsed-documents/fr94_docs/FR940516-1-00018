FR940516-1-00018 FR940516-1-00001 A legend indicating that ``PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE'' would be required to precede any performance presentation, whether required or given voluntarily. 42 42 Numerous studies have shown the general lack of predictive value of past performance. See, e.g., Irwin, The Predictability of Managed Futures Returns: Evidence from Multiple CTA Public Commodity Pools, Working Paper Version, Ohio State University, Department of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology (April 1992) (unpublished). See also Futures Pools' Returns Are a Far Cry From Their Brochures and Prospectuses Wall St. J., Oct 2, 1992. 12. Order of Disclosures For pools with an operating history shorter than three years, the performance of the pool offered would be required to be the first performance record presented in the disclosure document. Performance data for pools of the same category as the pool offered would be required to appear after the performance history of the pool offered and to be presented on a pool-by-pool, that is non-composite, basis. Pools of a different category from the pool offered would be required to follow the performance of pools of the same category as the pool offered. As discussed above, for purposes of applying the requirement that composite presentations be used only for pools of the same category, the rule would identify a number of categories of pools. The Commission believes that the streamlined past performance disclosure requirements should substantially increase the clarity and readability of past performance disclosures. The Commission requests comment on all aspects of Rule 4.25 and, in particular, on the adequacy of the summary performance format to provide a basis upon which a prospective pool participant may make an informed judgment with respect to past performance results; whether a three-year history is a sufficient basis for eliminating any requirement for disclosure of past performance other than that of the pool offered; and whether the ten percent allocation thresholds for major CTAs and investee pools, below which no performance disclosures would be required, is appropriate. The Commission also requests comment as to whether past performance presentations would provide more meaningful information if they were required to include rates of return on a risk-adjusted basis, that is, reduced by the relevant Treasury Bill rate or comparable interest figure, or to break out trading results from passive interest income. B. Section 4.24_Required General Disclosures Under the proposal, non-performance disclosure requirements would be set forth in Rule 4.24. 1. Table of Contents and Order of Required Information As noted above, a primary objective of this proposal is to foster clarity and comprehensibility in the disclosure of relevant information to prospective pool participants. To this end, in addition to eliminating certain required disclosures, the Commission is proposing that certain information be presented in a required sequence which would be specified in proposed Rules 4.24(a) through (d). Like current Rule 4.21, proposed Rule 4.24 would require that a cautionary statement, i.e., a statement that the CFTC has not passed upon the merits of the pool investment or the adequacy of the disclosure document, and any other information required under any other applicable federal or state laws and regulations, appear on the cover page of the disclosure document. The risk disclosure statement specified in Rule 4.24(b) would be required to be set forth immediately after these disclosures. The next item in the disclosure document would be a table of contents. 43 Prior to any detailed disclosures with respect to the pool and persons involved in operating and trading the assets of the pool, in what would constitute the ``forepart'' of the disclosure document, a prospective participant would find very basic information concerning the pool. 44 This information would include the name and address of the pool and CPO; the type of pool being offered, i.e., whether the pool is privately offered pursuant to section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, a multi-advisor pool 45 , or a limited risk pool 46 ; a statement whether the pool is continuously offered or the closing date of the offering; the date of the disclosure document; and the ``break-even point'' for the pool, that is, the trading profit that the pool must realize in its first year for a participant to recoup its initial investment. The break-even point would provide a simple illustration of the costs of investing in the pool and facilitate comparisons among pools. 47 43 Rule 4.21 currently does not require a table of contents. However, most disclosure documents reviewed by the Division contain such a table. Further, Form S&hyph;1, the form most frequently used to register pool offerings with the SEC, requires ``a reasonably detailed table of contents showing the subject matter of the various sections or subdivisions of the prospectus and the page number on which each section or subdivision begins.'' See Item 502(g) of Regulation S&hyph;K, 17 CFR 229.502(g), incorporated by reference into Item 2 of Form S&hyph;1, 17 CFR 239.11. The Commission believes that a table of contents should contribute to making the disclosure document ``user-friendly''. 44 The cover page and forepart of CTA disclosure documents would be organized in a similar fashion and a table of contents would also be required. 45 Proposed Rule 4.10(h) would define a ``multi-advisor pool'' as a pool in which no CTA is allocated twenty-five percent or more of the pool's aggregate initial futures margins and commodity option premiums and no investee pool is allocated twenty-five percent or more of the pool's total assets. 46 Proposed ยง4.10(i) would define the term ``limited risk pool'' as a pool designed to limit the loss of the initial investment of its participants. 47 The break-even point is discussed in greater detail in the fees and expense section, infra. The break-even point would be required to account for hidden costs such as costs associated with investments in investee pools. In multi-advisor pools the potential consequences of incentive fees being calculated advisor-by-advisor should also be a disclosed risk. The Commission considered whether a particular order for all required information should be mandated in order to ``standardize'' the entire format of disclosure documents but determined to propose only the limited sequence requirements discussed above at this time. However, the Commission requests comment on the appropriateness and desirability of mandating that all required information be presented in a specified order to foster clarity in and comparability of disclosure documents, ease of regulatory review, and development of compliance guidance or instructions.
