Since that time more than 100 types and modifications of aircraft of different classes and purposes have been built. Apparently there was no one in the USSR and there is now no one in the CIS who has not flown in AN aircraft at least once in his life. Transport aircraft such as the "Ruslan" or "Mriya," passenger aircraft, specialized aircraft for agriculture, aerial photography, and forest firefighting, polar aircraft, and other AN's are being exported to 42 countries of the world. The disintegration of the Union may have hit the aerospace industry of the once united country hardest of all. The "Antonov" ANTK was afflicted with the same problems as other enterprises of the branch that suddenly found themselves on different sides of borders and customhouses. Difficulties with component parts, nonpayments, low wages, cutbacks, the loss of specialists, and spasmodic searches for new partners -- all this is also happening at "Antonov." Nevertheless, the aviation scientific-technical complex is continuing to develop new aircraft and to modify models that were built earlier. The following aircraft are in the stage of research, project planning, or production: AN-218, AN-180, AN-140, AN-138, AN-70T, AN-74T-200, AN-74TK-200, AN-72P (patrol aircraft), AN-32 (polar aircraft), and other heavy, superheavy, and multipurpose models. Is it possible for the aerospace complex divided between the countries of the CIS to work for the good of the new states or are Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and the other republics of the former USSR destined to become "aviation boondocks"? "This must not be allowed, otherwise our competitors will immediately replace us in the world and domestic markets," thinks Genrikh Ongirskiy, deputy general designer at the "Antonov" ANTK. [Kozlov] Genrikh Genrikhovich, you must agree that only a superpower can afford to have and develop an aerospace industry. At one time the USSR was such a superpower. Now there is no USSR. What is the state of its aerospace industry? [Ongirskiy] I think that despite all the political and economic difficulties Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan -- the largest aviation plant in the former Union is located there -- are successfully preserving the scientific-technical potential of the recently united complex. Although, of course, young specialists are leaving us. [Kozlov] Are you trying to say that the complex remains alive because of the veterans who have nowhere to go? [Ongirskiy] Everywhere in the world it is above all the people who have worked for many years in the aviation and aerospace industry who are most appreciated there. Their knowledge and experience are considered to be national property. When such a specialist in the United States, for example, leaves a firm, he is obliged to leave his address and telephone number so that at any moment they can find him and hire him or invite him for consultation. Here, let us say in the CIS, it is dedicated people who work in aviation. There are practically no random people. I, for example, joined an air club at the age of 12 and took the traditional route: I built models, was the champion of the Union in the sport of model airplane building, did parachute jumping, and flew on a glider. I have nowhere to go from aviation and will remain there until the end. And there are many people like me. For this reason, a core work force has remained at practically all aviation firms. [Kozlov] The organizational will has disappeared, as has the state that spared no budgetary funds for the development of aviation firms. [Ongirskiy] I cannot agree that this will no longer exists. We just received an invitation to a meeting in Moscow, where the problems in the aviation industry will be discussed. And such meetings are held regularly. The Russian aircraft TU-334 has been included in the program for Ukraine. Nor is Russia refusing our aircraft. We have very close ties with Omsk, Novosibirsk, Arsenyev, and Samara. The branch will not perish. The political storms will die down. And world practice indicates that aviation firms combine their efforts. Today, hardly anyone can accomplish anything alone at an economic advantage for himself -- project planning, construction, and testing of new aircraft. The world has the American, European, and former Soviet aerospace complexes. To destroy our complex would mean not only to lag behind for decades but also to create insoluble economic difficulties for Russia and for Ukraine. [Kozlov] How would you characterize Ukraine's aviation industry? [Ongirskiy] Today it is 300,000 people and 30 enterprises of different kinds. I am not talking about space but only about aviation. The world's largest plant for the series production of aircraft engines is located in Zaporozhye. It produces 5,000 aircraft engines a year! Naturally, some of the engines are sent to Russia. High-quality materials come from Russia. How can one destroy this? [Kozlov] There is probably no need to ask about the economic state of the "Antonov" firm. I understand that it is bad. So how bad is it? Can you see light at the end of the tunnel? [Ongirskiy] Most of the workers here are graduates of the Kharkov Aviation Institute. Those from my class are also working for Tupolev, Mikoyan, and Ilyushin. The economic situation is about the same in all aviation firms. As Reagan said, the water is up to our chin but we are still breathing. [Kozlov] Probably some are not pleased about this. Yes, there are specialists who are dedicated to aviation but there are also simply qualified workers and engineers who are doing their work well. It is easy to lose them but to hire and train others.... [Ongirskiy] I know from my own friends what it is to shut down a plant for two or three months and then to start it up again. People pilfer everything, they break window shutters and cut wires, and they carry off telephones and disassemble machine tools. Later on it is very difficult to restore everything. And the equipment is designed in such a way that the more it works they better it works. It must not be stopped. Everything must keep turning, be lubricated, and wear. The human system is very complex and specific. People lose their skills quickly. I worked as a lathe hand before being trained at the institute. You come back from vacation and you have to regain your skills. Engineering and production have a concept called school. It is the continual transfer of experience and knowledge. The most important task for us today is to preserve the school. Because of the financial difficulties, we have to separate ourselves from our pensioners, people with good health, clear minds, and a strong spirit. They ought to be teaching the young people. By the way, the so-called tutorship came to us from the West. They leave pensioners in the firms and pay them money to come see what is going on, give advice, explain things, and help. Today young specialists do not have the opportunity to go the way that the patriarchs of aviation went. They know how to use computers and they know a lot about their speciality but they lack experience. And experience is the most valuable thing in aviation. That is what they tell us at Boeing and Lockheed. If we lose the school, then entire generations of specialists will "fall out" of aviation. [Kozlov] Today the prestige of the former Soviet aviation has been substantially undermined. Accidents happen and aircraft crash and people have begun to discriminate against our technology. What is the explanation for this? Is it our general collapse or have we already begun to fall hopelessly behind in aviation? [Ongirskiy] I would not agree with this. I regularly read information about my specialty. Here is an example: 700 aircraft of the Boeing Company have to be returned for reworking because some defects have been discovered in the tightening of the bolts fastening the engines. It turns out that they were tightened too much on some aircraft and not enough on others. Or remember the recent accident in the skies over Holland. No, our aircraft and especially military aircraft are by no means the worst in the world. It is no accident that there is so much interest in us at all kinds of exhibitions, air parades, and air shows. As for the accidents, they happen not just in the sky. Nuclear reactors blow up, ships and trains collide, and oil pipelines burn. This has to do with the general decline of discipline and the spiritual malaise in the country. Technology requires constant attention and servicing. For the time being, we are able to maintain the level of safety and airworthiness at the necessary level in aviation. [Kozlov] Still, aircraft are crashing. [Ongirskiy] Today some strange commercial structures are being established that are buying some depreciated aircraft and hiring pilots who have been dismissed from aviation and have no right to fly. Dispatchers, technicians, engineers, and ground flight support personnel are all living people who have to earn a wage. Their labor is very stressful. If a person at work is thinking about how to feed his family rather than about his work, then naturally there will be breakdowns. [Kozlov] Many think that the economic policy of the Ukrainian Government is changing in the direction of more realism, if we can put it this way. Is there a mutual understanding between your firm and the government? [Ongirskiy] There is. I personally, for example, am worried about the upcoming elections for the Supreme Soviet. If those who come to power are people who think that Ukraine should be an agrarian country and that it has no need for aircraft and space, then this will be a disaster. [Kozlov] What, in your view, must be done so that the economic reforms in Ukraine will take place with fewer losses? [Ongirskiy] It is hard to say. Sometimes we put it this way: "It will be good just if they do not interfere with us." I do not like people who have to destroy things: industry, economic ties, and relationships between nations. People must create and not destroy.
