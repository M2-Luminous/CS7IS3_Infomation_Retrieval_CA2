Zhirinovskiy, leader of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] faction in the State Duma, announced after the close of the 23 February session of the lower chamber of parliament that this day could be regarded as a new Russian national holiday -- a sort of Day of General Reconciliation. For his part, S. Yushenkov, one of the leaders of the "Russia's Choice" faction, expressed the belief that this day could signal the start of civil war. Such polarized opinions regarding the decree adopted by the Duma on an amnesty for those who took part in the August [1991] and October [1993] events in Moscow must, obviously, be put down to understandable emotions. The assessment given in the Duma lobbies by one of the leaders of the "intransigents" seems more accurate: The amnesty act was adopted in order to give a fillip to the country's domestic political situation which has become somewhat static since last October. It must be admitted that the attempt was entirely successful. The domestic political situation in the country has livened up noticeably. But this fact yet again demonstrates quite graphically that the State Duma has focused exclusively on politics, and there are currently no grounds for hoping that it will get down to lawmaking. To confirm this conclusion, it suffices to analyze the progress of the Duma debates 23 February. Virtually all those present, that is to say the leaders of the factions and deputies' groups, paid little heed to the topic of the day -- the amnesty itself -- mainly devoting their speeches to expounding political programs. It was therefore hard to shake off the impression that you were attending the launch of a presidential election campaign. Indeed, the time is already ripe for this campaign to begin, and it can be assumed that it was this fact which impelled a number of Duma factions to be so persistent in bringing to a successful conclusion the solution to the problem of an amnesty for people who hold the same views as they do. The organizers' main target, judging by information provided by factions on the left, is not the president and the government, although, needless to say, they will not be left in peace. The same G. Zyuganov who called for civil peace demanded a change of government. The main objective, however odd it may seem if we bear in mind the LDPR faction's initiative proposing the combination of a political and economic amnesty in a single decree (this formula consequently became one of the main reasons for the triumph of the amnesty's supporters), was to knock one of the favorites -- V. Zhirinovskiy -- out of the presidential elections, which are just beginning. The united opposition has acquired the chance to have a popular leader and can correspondingly count on the support of a significant proportion of LDPR supporters. It seems that V. Zhirinovskiy himself is perfectly well aware of this fact, but he is obliged to go for broke, so to speak. Thus, in the opinion of most observers, if the leaders of the defenders of the White House were to be released, a desperate leadership struggle would unfold on the political left wing. And this could not fail to have an impact on the unity and strength of the ranks of Communists and patriots. Consequently there is every reason to think that the same factors will encourage concentration on the right wing of the political spectrum. And Gaydar's embryonic party has the opportunity to become much more than an ephemeral political structure. At the same time, as the course of the 23 February Duma session showed, the niche in the center between the two wings which has remained vacant for some time has apparently already been filled. There is every reason for thinking that the package of documents adopted by the Duma, which includes the decree on the political amnesty, was passed mainly with the assistance of the PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction. It was the rapid departure of this faction from the right wing which guaranteed the supporters of the amnesty the necessary advantage of just over 33 votes. Moreover, the obvious harmony between the Memorandum on Accord adopted by the Duma, which acted as pretty packaging for the decree on the political amnesty, and the PRUA faction's announcement published a few days previously on its civil reconciliation initiative, gives cause to suggest that S. Shakhray actively participated in the preparation of that very package of documents which included the decree on the political amnesty. In the opinion of a number of observers, this proves that S. Shakhray has finally broken away from the presidential team and that he was unsuited for the prime minister's political team, which he has been ardently seeking to join of late. Obviously, the quest for new political allies led S. Shakhray to the Duma, where his rapid rapprochement with Speaker of the House I. Rybkin, who has switched to centrist stances, is not going unnoticed. It is sufficient to cite the example of the appointment of Shakray's close friend A. Boykov as leader of the Duma apparatus despite severe resistance from the Communists, the agrarians, and Zhirinovskiy's supporters. Thus it is difficult to shake off the impression that the leader of the PRUA faction intends to embark on the path taken by R. Khasbulatov in order to implement his political aims: Namely, with the speaker's help, to seize control of the Duma apparatus and, using it, to form on the basis of factions gravitating toward the center if not a majority, then a strong and, most importantly, manageable group of deputies. All of this ultimately leads to the conclusion that the majority of Duma politicians will continue exclusively to resolve their own political issues, to fight for victory in the presidential races, for instance. Work on laws in this situation has every chance of being consigned to oblivion. And this, in turn, means that the Memorandum on Accord, the need for whose adoption was accepted by the Duma majority by dint of its support for the political amnesty, is unlikely to function. At any rate, the speeches by a number of faction leaders gave no cause to conclude that they intend to implement the ideas expounded in the memorandum.
