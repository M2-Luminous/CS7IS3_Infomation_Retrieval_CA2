FR940419-0-00075 FR940419-0-00019 (1) These paragraphs have been rewritten to emphasize that all that is required is that contractors obtain approval prior to entering into a contract with respect to the type of work identified. This gives EPA the opportunity to evaluate such requests on a case-by-case basis and limit its contractors from performing work which would jeopardize work performed for EPA or ongoing enforcement actions. This change was made in response to public concern that this paragraph absolutely prohibited the nature of work described. (2) In further response to public comment on these paragraphs, ``other than EPA'' has been added after ``any party'' to clarify that this clause does not cover future work a contractor may enter into for EPA. _Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraphs (c) and (d), and parallel paragraphs (c) of Alternates I (TCRR) and II (TAT) and (d) of Alternate IV (TES) have also been modified in response to comments questioning the scope of the limitation. We have clarified that all that is required is reporting of: ``(1) Any work relating to CERCLA activities which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for the EPA under this contract.'' We are concerned with evaluating future contractor work related to Superfund work performed for EPA on a site to ensure it does not jeopardize ongoing EPA Superfund work or enforcement action. _Alternate VI (Site Specific) paragraph (c), which contains similar language addressing Site Specific contracts, has also been modified in response to comments questioning its scope. We have clarified that all that is required is reporting of: ``(1) Any work relating to CERCLA activities which pertain to the site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to the site where the Contractor previously performed work for the EPA under this contract.'' We are concerned with evaluating future contractor work related to Superfund work performed for EPA on the site covered by its contract to ensure it does not jeopardize ongoing EPA Superfund work or enforcement action. _Alternate I (TCRR) paragraph (c) and parallel paragraphs (c) of Alternate II (TAT) and (d) of Alternate IV (TES) have further been revised. The language ``during the life of the contract'' and ``after completion of the contract'' has been changed to be consistent with the basic LOFC clause (ARCS), which tracks by tasking document, not by contract. This change is made in response to commenters' recommendations. It substantially minimizes the burden to contractors by reducing the time period for which the contractor must request approval for future work. The new language in paragraph (c) of Alternate I (TCRR) is ``during the life of the delivery order or tasking document'' and ``after the completion of the delivery order or tasking document''. The new language in paragraph (c) of Alternate II (TAT) is ``during the life of the technical direction document'' and ``after the completion of the technical direction document''. The language in paragraph (d) of Alternate IV (TES) is now ``during the life of the work assignment'' and ``after completion of the work assignment''. _Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraph (f) and identical paragraphs (f) of Alternates I (TCRR), II (TAT), IV (TES), VI (Site Specific), (c) of Alternate III (ESAT) and (e) of Alternate V (Headquarters Support) have been modified. The language ``agrees not to use it to compete with such companies'' is removed. This change was made to clarify that it is not EPA's intent to restrict its contractors from using their experience gained in working on EPA contracts from competing with other companies. _Alternate I (TCRR) paragraph (d)(3), Alternate II (TAT) paragraph (d)(3), and Alternate VI (Site Specific) paragraph (d)(2) have been revised to include ``CERCLA administrative order''. This modification is made in response to public comment that we cover contracts let prior to final issuance of a CERCLA or Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) consent decree or court order. _Alternate I (TCRR) paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) language describing TAT work is changed from ``Technical Assistance Team activities (TAT contracts)'' to ``Technical Assistance Team (TAT) type activities (e.g., TAT contracts)''. This change clarifies that this provision applies to TAT type activities and that ``TAT contracts'' is an example of such work. _Alternate VI (Site Specific) paragraph (d)(1) language is also changed from ``Technical Assistance Team activities (TAT contracts)'' to ``Technical Assistance Team (TAT) type activities (e.g., TAT contracts)''. This change clarifies that this provision applies to TAT type activities and that ``TAT contracts'' is an example of such work. _In Alternate I (TCRR), paragraph (g), ``treatability studies'' has been added to the flow down exemptions to make this Alternate clause consistent with all other LOFC clauses in the rule. In addition, because the term ``treatability studies'' is not routinely used in TCRR contracts, we have noted in the prescription that this term includes ``TCRR pilot scale studies.'' _In Alternate IV (TES), we have retained the clause's paragraph (b) language instead of choosing the proposed rule's option to paragraph (b). This responds to public comment that the initial paragraph (b) is more cost effective and that implementing the other proposed option would be extremely cumbersome and expensive. In addition, we have added ``during the performance period of this contract'' at the beginning of the paragraph in response to comments requesting we clarify the period of applicability.
