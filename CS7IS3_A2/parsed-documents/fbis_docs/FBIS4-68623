Kuznechikov, LESNAYA GAZETA correspondent: "The Hryvnya Will Replace the Karbovanets"] [Text] Printing of the hryvnya, the Ukrainian national currency, has commenced in Kiev. President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyahilskyy, National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko, and representatives of various ministries and agencies attended the opening of the Kiev money-printing plant. The hryvnya was issued, as the national currency, in Kievan Rus as early as the 10th century; so, one may say that it has been reissued in Kiev after quite a considerable interval. The Ukrainian president personally opened the ceremony which started the technological line. "Only a country with its own national currency can be truly independent. Otherwise it becomes a branch of some other 'bank,'" the president said during the ceremony. It is rather obvious which "bank" Leonid Makarovich had in mind. It is also obvious that nobody wants to attract Ukraine into the ruble zone even with its new money instead of the old, valueless coupons and its state of hyperinflation. So, even if Ukraine becomes a branch of another bank, it is not going to be the Russian one and no hryvnya will help there. Basically, we are talking about replacing, under the conditions of the current economic crisis, one piece of paper with another, even though it has 20 levels of protection.
