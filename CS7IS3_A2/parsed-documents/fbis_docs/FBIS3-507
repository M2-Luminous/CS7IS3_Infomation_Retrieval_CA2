By late afernoon live rounds were being used in attempts to defuse a swell of action that started at the weekend when workers at the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] joined the homeland civil servant strike. On Tuesday the workers took over the BBC offices and held hostage Telecommunications and Broadcasting Minister Zebulon Masilo and BBC Chairman Eddie Mangope, son of the Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope. Attempts to defuse the situation at the BBC led to a meeting between South African ambassador to the homeland, Prof Tjaart van der Walt, and President Mangope and his cabinet, who asked him to refrain from interfering. The Bophuthatswana government also accused SA [South Africa] Foreign Minister Pik Botha of meddling and inciting violence. The offices of the BBC were occupied early on Tuesday and Prof van der Walt arrived shortly after 9am to try and negotiate to defuse the situation. He was allowed to enter the sealed building and met Mr Mangope who said he would try and sort out the situation himself. Prof van der Walt told SAPA on Tuesday evening he had suggested to the Bophuthatswana government that it try and mediate with the host of disgruntled civil servants and try to reach am amicable solution. The siege at the the BBC ended shortly after noon when homeland police entered the building and fired tear gas into areas where alproximately 300 staff members were holding a meeting. Beween 10 and 20 members of a workers' committee were arrested. Both radio and television broadcasts were blacked out for the whole day. Teachers at most schools in the homeland joined the strike and pupils who gathered at schools were tear gassed. Health services also suffered labour setbacks in most of Bophuthatswana on Tuesday and more work stoppages in the public sector are expected on Wednesday. A rally at Rooigrond outside the town did not get underway and people returning from the area entered Mafikeng in cars, taxis, trucks and buses singing, shouting and whistling. This led to Bophutatswana police and the demonstrators running up and down one of the town's main thoroughfares, Station Street, for most of the afternoon. By late Tuesday station street resembled a war zone with garbage littering the streets as large, cylindical cement dirt bins were rolled into streets, upended and used as barricades. At least one scratchcard kiosk was used for the same purpose. The area around the station, in the vicinity of the ANC [African National Congress] offices, was also the scene of a number of fires -- mainly of garbage and tyres. According to ANC organiser Nathaniel Ngakantsi the police were asked to stop "provoking violence" downtown. "The police provoked people by chasing them up and down the street. "We asked the police to leave them alone but they kept on coming back," he said. At one stage in the late afternoon reporters and ANC workers saw police firing a volley of live ammunition outside the ANC offices. Police also fired live ammunition on the University of Bophuthatswana campus when they went there to stop a student protest in which the national flag was burnt. Bophuthatswana government spokesman Alwyn Viljoen denied that police used live ammuniion or that the flag was burnt, despite a large number of witnesses confirming the events. The situation in Mafikeng and Mmabatho was tense on Tuesday evening wih a pall of black smoke hanging over Mafikeng. Burning barricades of rubbish were placed across the road in streets in Monstshiwa township where groups of youths, armed with rocks, stood on street corners. There is fear of a rightwing backlash against the protesters and some reporters were mistaken for white rightwingers. A source close to the Bophuthatswana government told SAPA that members of the Freedom Alliance had already offered "to help out" in Bophuthatswana. This could not be independently confirmed. A number of journalists were manhandled by police and at least two camera teams had their film confiscated. The government spokesman would also not confirm these incidents nor would he confirm the high incidence of tear gassing that took place throughout the day.
