The draft foresees that nominations for the new delegation would come from the parliament speaker's office within five days after adoption of the decision by the legislative body. The same draft proposes to the government to recall the current governmental delegation for the Russian talks after the setup of the new delegation is approved. Centrist faction members say their move was called by the talks between Estonia and Russia having run into a deadlock, which, they say, is caused by the Estonian delegation's unclearly determined status, lack of authority and of flexible tactics, as well as by insufficient preparedness. The opposition politicians point at what they call dangerous tendencies for Estonia at the talks, where the border issue is being resolved by ignoring Estonia's interests, concessions are made as to the fate of the retired Russian military, and that the agreements already signed may "provide for the remaining of a part of the Russian army in Estonia for another three years." The Centrist faction says the new delegation should receive its powers from the parliament. It must include people who "know Russia," today's statement says. Centrist Party member Hardo Aasmae in his comments to BNS called the tactics used by the current delegation wrong. He said the delegations at the talks should start from decisions over which a compromise is possible. A moratorium should be imposed on other issues so far, Aasmae added. He said it is most important at present to reach an accord with Russia on the troop withdrawal, establish the status of Paldiski without letting it be declared a special area, as well as to resolve a number of economic issues. Aasmae suggested that Endel Lippmaa, a minister for Eastern relations without portfolio in the government of the country's former Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar, should be appointed the head of the delegation. Savisaar is the leader of the Centrist Party. "A situation has emerged currently at the Estonian-Russian talks when virtually no political delegation exists; there are only work groups. This provides to Russia the possibility to use protraction diplomacy. If we manage to set up a broad-based political delegation, it must above all make changes happen in the Russian delegation and its powers," Aasmae said. He said a breakthrough at the talks will come when one of the parties is put in a situation when it is no longer possible to postpone decision.
