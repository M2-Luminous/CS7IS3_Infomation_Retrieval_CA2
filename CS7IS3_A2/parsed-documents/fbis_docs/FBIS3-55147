The decision was reached during the Russian-Belarusian talks in Moscow which were attended by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Belarusian Premier Vyacheslav Kebich. The participants signed a joint statement on the integration of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems. The statement said that the integration will take place after the prime ministers of the two republics have signed a package of more than ten agreements specifying the mechanism of integration in Minsk in the second half of January. Kebich told ITAR-TASS after the three-hour talks that the sides have also agreed the exchange rate of the Russian rouble and the Belarusian coupon under which one coupon will be exchanged for one rouble. Kebich also said that Yeltsin expressed the hope that the agreements to be signed in Minsk will come into force as soon as possible. "This would fully meet the interests of the heads of government," he added. The Belarusian premier believes that the process of Belarus's transition to the Russian rouble will be long and may take three to six months. This is caused mostly by technical problems of cash supplies to Belarus. Kebich said some other CIS states may also join the rouble zone. "But for this to happen, a certain mechanism should be worked out," he concluded.
