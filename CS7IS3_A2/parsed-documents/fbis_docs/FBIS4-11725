Speaking at a press conference upon his return from an OPEC ministerial meeting in Geneva, Aqazadeh regretted that political issues always affected the decisions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). He did not rule out the possibility that Saudi Arabia's decision might be linked with Iran's position on the number of Iranian pilgrims for this year's Hajj pilgrimage. Saudi Arabia has decided to cut the number of Iranian pilgrims from 115,000 to 60,000. On the sideline of the OPEC meeting, he said, some Saudi Arabian delegates raised the issue concerning the quota of Iranian pilgrims and criticized the Iranian press for their stance on the matter. According to Aqazadeh if the OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers had agreed to cut their output ceiling, it would have pushed up the price of oil up to three to four dollars per barrel.
