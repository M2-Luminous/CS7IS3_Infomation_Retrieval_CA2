He told the Federation Council that he had adopted the final decision to resign because "the president and his entourage have shown once again that they are not going to abide by the constitution, law, the resolutions of the State Duma and the Federation council". "Open dictatorship is coming", he said and expressed conviction that Russia "will get a true president and an independent prosecutor general in the coming years". He praised the legislature by saying that "Russia took pains and received an independent parliament which respects the constitution". Kazannik said that he is resigning "in order to unite all progressive forces of Russia". "I did not want to become a source of confrontation between different political forces", he told reporters and added that "the president and his administration would not have allowed him to work because they do not need an independent prosecutor". He denied claims that he simply wanted to return to his high-ranking post. "I strived to preserve the Office of the Prosecutor General as a single system, to avert political repressions, ensure the supremacy of law, protect the rights of citizens", he said. Kazannik added that now he intends to create a mighty "party of unity and national progress" and will begin organising it in the regions because, as he said, he "enjoys great support there".
