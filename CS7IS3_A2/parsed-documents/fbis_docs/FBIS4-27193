"We should not allow prime minister Hata to go and sign agreements (at the summit)," the veteran politician of the no. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party said. Watanabe appealed to non-LDP politicians with political ideals similar to those of the LDP to form a "grand alliance" with the LDP in order to oust the current ruling coalition from power. "Some forces in the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Socialist Party and Komeito have similar political ideas to those of the conservative forces," he said. The remark was a clear departure from his previous statements, with which he warned the political community against forming a coalition with SDP politicians. Watanabe has repeatedly warned that the presence of SDP forces in the ruling coalition would undercut Japan's national interests by barring Japan from reforming its tax system or taking a tough line in the face of the suspected North Korean nuclear arms program.
