In January alone, among the 35 cities, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Hefei, Xiamen, Nanchang, and Chongqing saw prices for fresh vegetables rise by 50 percent. Surveys have identified the following as the main causes of the price hikes: Reduced vegetable farmland -- urban development and rapid increases in development zones have taken up much of the suburban vegetable farmland; a sharp contradiction between demand and supply -- there has been a noticeable increase in urban consumers and migrant populations, generating an enormous demand for vegetables; increases in the cost of growing vegetables -- there have been steep prices increases for products that are essential for vegetable production; and insufficient regulation and control over state-owned vegetable markets. Residents now obtain 98 percent of their vegetables from markets. With the transformation of operational mechanisms slow in coming, state-owned vegetable markets are lagging behind market demand. Overall, the effort to achieve stable macro-regulation and control over vegetable prices has run into considerable difficulty.
