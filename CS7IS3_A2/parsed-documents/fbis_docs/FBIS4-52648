Korean Puppets' Nuclear Development" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- "The South Korean puppets would face a stern judgement by history, if they persist in the development of nuclear weapons, going against the aspirations of the times and the nation, warned Kang Yong-sop, chairman of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Korean Christians Federation [KCF]. In a statement on Wednesday he denounced the despicable criminal acts of the South Korean puppet clique in stepping up nuclear development on a full scale while spreading a rumour of "nuclear suspicion" against the North. The statement says: The Kim Yong-sam clique's groundless slanders on us over the fictitious "nuclear problem" are nothing but a cunning and brazen trick to divert elsewhere the public attention at home and abroad and step up the development of nuclear arms behind the scene. This is well illustrated by the fact that the traitor Kim Yong-sam told a "press conference" some time ago that "the North has no nukes", thus admitting of his own accord that his clique's row hitherto over the "nuclear development" of the North was a plot to do harm to the fellow countrymen and conceal the truth behind their own development of nuclear arms. It is because of the partiality of the International Atomic Energy Agency that the South Korean puppets' nuclear arms development has long been out of the world people's concern, the statement notes, adding: The agency must draw a serious lesson from such grave consequences of the double standard which it has applied under the baton of the United States, losing independence, and restore impartiality, though belatedly. The South Korean puppets must ponder over catastrophic consequences to be entailed by their criminal nuclear arms development, eliminate at once the heavy water reactor and multipurpose research reactor which have been confirmed to be reactors for developing nuclear weapons, stop the development of a fast breeder reactor and nuclear arms development, the statement stresses.
