A Nordic industrial project is aimed at resistance-free electricity transmission in 1995. "It looks promising," said Ove Albertsson of ABB Corporate Research. The 7-centimeter long superconducting fragment is found at the research center of the NKT (Nordic Cable and Wire) company in Copenhagen. The wire handles a current density of 70,000 amperes (A) per square centimeter, 70 times more than an ordinary copper cable. According to the creators this is a world record. There are longer superconducting cables in Japan, it is true, but there the current density is only 10 times greater than it is in traditional electric cables. Sometime in 1995 NKT promises to demonstrate 100 meters of superconducting cable that can transmit 50,000 A/cm<sup> 2</sup> without loss. "We will see various application possibilities emerge in time, but direct current transmission over short distances may be one of the first applications," said project leader Torsten Freltoft. The joint development project is backed by not only NKT but also ABB, Norsk Hydro, Chalmers Institute of Technology and the technical institutes in Copenhagen, Tammerfors and Trondheim. Ove Albertsson of ABB's research division said that nitrogen-cooled superconductors can be used in many electric power contexts. "It will probably involve more than simply replacing copper cables. Superconductors will also give us entirely new properties. But we will not know what these may be until we have the cables." "ABB's official position has been that Japanese and American companies are in the lead. But I have become increasingly convinced that NKT is in the top echelon. Their work looks promising," he said. The development of ceramic superconductors accelerated in the mid-1980s. They came to be called high-temperature conductors where high means warmer than absolute zero and preferably over -196Â°C., the limit for using liquid nitrogen as a cooling medium. Although a number of different alloys have proved to be superconductive the industrial breakthrough has been a long time coming. The alloy that the Nordic cable developers are working with consists of bismuth, lead, strontium, calcium and copper oxide. The production process is called the powder in tube method. Powder is packed into a silver tube with a diameter of 5-7 mm. The tube is stretched to a thread and rolled out to a 0.1-mm thick band that is then sintered in an oven. "Now and then there are reports of new usable alloys in the literature. We test them too, but we expect to continue working with the method and the material we have now," Freltoft said. The Nordic industrial project, based in Copenhagen, has a budget of around 40 million kronor, half of which is supplied by industry. The Nordic industrial fund contributes 15 percent. The rest is financed with various national grants.
