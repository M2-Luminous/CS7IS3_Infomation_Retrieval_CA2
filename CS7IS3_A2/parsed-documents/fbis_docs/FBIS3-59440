There were 245 deputies for the adoption, 16 against, and four abstaining. During the debate it was stressed that the present law ameliorates the eternal conflict between the need to extract the resources of the earth and the obligation to protect the environment. The law specifies a new method of exploring for and obtaining natural resources from the earth. The provisions of the previous law were determined for the needs of the former economic system (the mining law in 1953 and the geological law in 1960). It, among other things, regulates the principles for the extraction of minerals, the granting of concessions, issues of work safety underground, and responsibility for damage from subsidence. The law reserves the ownership of mineral deposits to the state treasury. Minerals such as sand or coal that are to be found on the territory of someone's property do belong to him, except if he wishes to sell them, in which case a concession is required. The new law, among other things, changes the method of collecting the dues for mining subsidence. Hitherto this took place on administrative lines, whereas it now finds itself at the disposal of the courts, where the basis for claims is the civil code. The law has abolished the provision whereby the entity responsible for the damage was obliged to cover the costs only up to a level equal to the cost of building a single-family house, irrespective of the level of damage caused. Currently, compensation is to cover the full value of the damage. Those extracting "the riches of the earth" will be forced to take into account in extraction costs the payments for environmental protection that have so far been omitted. The geological and mining law regulates in detail the principles for the granting of concessions to foreign entities for the search for and extraction of minerals. Payments for concessions are henceforth to be negotiated with every entity separately. The draft geological and mining law had been in parliament for a year and a half. The Sejm adopted the new law on 29 May of last year, but the dissolution of parliament made impossible the continuation of the legislative process. The government of Waldemar Pawlak directed the draft for renewed consideration by the Sejm as a matter of urgency.
