The seminar is being held from 30 May to 1 June. The agenda consists of three topics: the local topic, the pan-Arab topic, and the international topic. The local topic is focussed on work for further improving production capacity, practicing self-reliance, and fortifying the coast. The pan-Arab topic consists of boosting the morale of the Arab masses, exposing the aims of colonialism, sticking to the pan-Arab spirit, working for destroying the artificial borders, and forging alliance with the active forces in the Arab homeland. As for the international topic, it consists in working for broadening the international front, forging alliance with the small peoples which struggle for their freedom, and standing with the peoples that love peace based on justice and respect of freedom, sovereignty, and the options of peoples. The meeting of the 16th seminar of the revolutionary committees movement comes at a time when the Arab Libyan people have declared their historic resolution of defiance and preparedness for confrontation, as shown by the great defiance manifestations in which the masses took to the streets to receive the brother of the revolution everywhere in the Arab Libyan territory.
