"We repeatedly offered to organize joint protection of the gas main, the bridges and other objects on the territory of Georgia which are vital for Armenia. But each time we were rejected", said the minister. He added that the Georgian Government doesn't want another state's military units to be located on the territory of Georgia. "And this position does make sense" noted Vano Siradegyan.
