The member of the Parliamentary Commission on Human Rights Agasi Arshakyan reported that many meetings took place in Armenia. The participants of those meetings adopted a resolution condemning the unacceptable round-ups in public places, violence and arbitrariness applied during the military assembly. The parents of those taken to the assembly quite often have no idea about the further fate and location of their children, declared the Head of the National Library of Armenia, Deputy Rafayel Ishkhanyan. He noted that such methods, inadmissible even during World War 2, were used only in Osmanian [Ottoman] Empire. Ishkhanyan warned that such actions of law enforcement bodies may have negative consequences -- decomposition of the Army, demoralization of the young generation, cessation of humanitarian aid, because of the violations of human rights in Armenia.
