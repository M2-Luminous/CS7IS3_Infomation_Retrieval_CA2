FR940830-1-00108 FR940830-1-00015 Improving Access To Employment and Training Activities Under 7 CFR 273.9(d)(4), households are allowed to deduct from their income their actual dependent care expenses up to a maximum amount of $160 per month per dependent. These dependent care expenses must be necessary for a household member: (1) to accept or continue employment, (2) to participate in the Food Stamp Program's Employment and Training (E&T) Program or an equivalent effort by those not subject to E&T, or (3) to attend training or receive education or training which is preparatory to employment. Section 404 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;435 (HPA), amended section 5(e) of the Act to increase the dependent care deduction for certain households and to provide that other households would not be entitled to the dependent care deduction. The HPA provided that households eligible for the dependent care deduction can deduct up to $160 a month per dependent rather than $160 per household, and specified that the dependent care deduction cannot be taken for dependent care expenses which are reimbursed under an employment and training program as specified in section 6(d)(4)(I) of the Act. Accordingly, the Department amended 7 CFR 273.9(d)(4) and 7 CFR 273.10(e)(1)(i)(E) to implement HPA changes. On October 13, 1988, the Family Support Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;485, (Family Support Act) was enacted. Section 302 of Title III of the Family Support Act provides for Transitional Child Care (TCC) for eligible families which have ceased to receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Program benefits as a result of increased hours or increased income from employment. Section 301 of Title III also specifies that any money received as payment for child care or any reimbursement for costs incurred for child care shall not be treated as income for purposes of any other Federal or federally assisted program that bases eligibility or the amount of benefits upon need. In response to Title III, the Department amended 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to allow a deduction for only the portion of child care expense which is not reimbursed or not paid for by the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program under Title IV&hyph;F of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 681, et seq.) or the Transitional Child Care (TCC) program. (Provisions of the Family Support Act authorizing TCC are found in section 402(g)(1) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 602(g)(1).) With the enactment of the Leland Act, additional modifications to Food Stamp Program regulations are required in the areas of the dependent care deduction and the amount allowed for E&T dependent care and other work-related reimbursements. Dependent Care Deduction Section 13922 of the Leland Act amended section 5(e) of the Act by replacing the $160 a month maximum dependent care deduction with a two-tier maximum dependent care deduction. For each child under the age of two, the maximum monthly dependent care deduction is $200; for all other dependents, the maximum monthly dependent care deduction is $175. Implementation of the two-tier maximum dependent care deduction shall take effect and shall be implemented on September 1, 1994. In its discussion on implementing the two-tier maximum dependent care deduction, Congress urged that implementation be conducted in ways that will minimize administrative burdens on State agencies. For example, when a child reaches his or her second birthday before the end of a certification period, the State agency should not be required to reduce the maximum monthly dependent care deduction from $200 to $175 until the household's next recertification (House Conference Report No. 213, 103rd Congress, 1st Session (1993), p. 926). Therefore, the Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.9(d)(4) and 7 CFR 273.10(e) by replacing the $160 a month maximum dependent care deduction with the $200 a month maximum dependent care deduction for each child under two years of age and $175 a month maximum dependent care deduction for each other dependent. The Department is also adding a requirement that whenever a child reaches his or her birthday during the certification period, the maximum dependent care deduction shall be adjusted no later than the next regularly scheduled recertification. Additionally, the Department is proposing a conforming change to 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to replace the term ``child care expense'' with the term ``dependent care expense'' in order to clarify that it is dependent care expenses reimbursed by the JOBS or TCC programs which are not deductible for food stamp households, not just child care expenses. Dependent Care Reimbursement for the Food Stamp Employment and Training Program Since 1971, individuals who are not specifically exempted by the Act have been required to register for work at the time of application as a condition of eligibility for food stamp benefits. Currently, 7 CFR 273.7(a) requires that they register at application and once every 12 months thereafter. In April 1987, State agencies began operating the Food Stamp Employment and Training (E&T) Program, a program aimed specifically at improving food stamp recipients' ability to gain employment, increase earnings and reduce their dependency on public assistance. State agencies operate a variety of employment and training activities, including job search and job search training, self-employment efforts, and vocational and education activities. Work registrants are the most job ready of the food stamp population and comprise approximately 8 percent of all food stamp recipients. Of those food stamp recipients who register for work, about 70 percent are subject to the E&T requirements.
