Li Tieying went to Guizhou to conduct investigation and study from 12 to 15 January. He went down to such grass-roots units as plants, rural areas, grain depots, and development zones in Zunyi, Anshun, Guiyang, and other places to understand conditions there. He also held discussion meetings with responsible persons of provincial party committee, government, and departments concerned. He fully affirmed the results achieved by Guizhuo province since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPCCentral Committee. He said: Tremendous changes have occurred in Guizhou over the past 15 year of reform. In 1987, it doubled its industrial and agricultural output value. It is expected that the province will redouble its industrial and agricultural output in 1996 so as to enable it, an inland province with protracted backwardness in economy, to make remarkable progress. This is a result of long-term struggle of 34 million people of all nationalities under the leadership of provincial party committee and government. He expressed his hopes that Guizhou will continue to emancipate the mind, undertake bold exploration, and further accelerate the pace of reform and opening to the outside world. After reviewing the course of China's reform and opening up to the outside world in the past 15 years and also summing up China's experiences in this respect, Li Tieying pointed out: Whenever a locality has done a good job in emancipating its mind, it will do well in reform and development. There may be differences in geographical environment, natural resources, and the pace of economic development between the hinterland provinces and the coastal areas, but there should not be differences in matters of emancipating the mind, changing old concepts, and seeking truth from facts. He who has emancipated his mind will be able to proceed from reality to understand the conditions in a province and a region, as well as the conditions of the masses, will cast away many ideological shackles and conventions, will draw on the experiences of developed areas, and create new experiences in line with reality, thereby fundamentally reforming the old system that has prevented the development of the productive forces and promoting local economic development. Various major reform measures will be introduced this year. I hope the provincial party committee and the provincial government will study them carefully and ensure their meticulous and smooth implementation. Li Tieying stressed: Our reform tasks are extremely arduous. They will not only bring pressure but also provide us with opportunities. The hinterland provinces should be good at seizing the opportunities, make good use of their advantages, deepen the reform, open wider to the outside world, and accelerate economic development. He said: Although Guizhou is not situated along the Chang Jiang, the coast, and the border, it has, what Premier Zhou Enlai used to praise, beautiful mountains and rivers, pleasant weather, rich natural resources, and hard working people. Although Guizhou is the only agricultural province without a plain, 97 percent of its hilly areas possess rich resources. It should make great efforts to exploit resources from its hilly areas. Li Tieying expressed great interest in Guizhou's rich mineral and energy resources and its unique tourism resources formed by its beautiful typical karst landform and strong ethnic flavor. After inspecting the Anshun Wax Printing General Plant, he spoke highly of wax printing, a manual printing technology employed by the ethnic minorities since ancient times. In a happy mood he wrote an inscription which reads: "The flower of art has lasted thousands of years, while the ethnic treasure is still surprisingly beautiful." He expressed the hope that Guizhou's wax printing will be quickly made into colorful serial products to be marketed domestically and internationally. In discussing the reform of the administrative system for grain, Li Tiying said: It is necessary to pay close attention to and be cautious in the reform of this system. This reform should be regarded as a major reform and should be carefully studied. At present, what is most important is to do everything possible to stabilize grain prices and to make concerted efforts to ensure a bumper harvest this year. As the Spring Festival is approaching, Li Tiying expressed the hope that the governments and departments at all levels will carefully make arrangements for market supply in order to enable the masses, particularly those in poor areas, to enjoy a happy Spring Festival.
