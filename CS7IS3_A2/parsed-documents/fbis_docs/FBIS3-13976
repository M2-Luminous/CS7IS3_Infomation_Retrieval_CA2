Noting that the remarks recently made in Washington by the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs, Ms. Robin Raphel, a spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs today said the comparison was grossly misplaced as the Afghan situation was a by-product of the Cold War whereas Jammu and Kashmir has been facing a massive campaign of terrorism aided and abetted by Pakistan. The only link between the two was that the weapons and mercenaries were moved from both Afghanistan and Pakistan to foment trouble in Kashmir, the spokesman said. [passage omitted] *
