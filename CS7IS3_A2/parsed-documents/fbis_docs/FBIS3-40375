As a result, protein design and modelling has become a strategic science, with important implications for the understanding of cell receptor function and rational drug design. The Biotechnology Directorate recently supported a joint N+N meeting with the German GBF [Biotechnological Research Association] in Braunschweig, to discuss the potential for collaboration and envisage future research needs and directions. One of the key conclusions to emerge from the meeting was that many of the groups present were independently examining the three-dimensional structure of proteins, comparing structures and substructures and investigating protein alignment to define protein families. For example, Paul Barlow, of the Department of Biochemistry at Oxford University, described work on the structure of protein "modules". Recombinant DNA [desoxyribonucleic acid] technology permits the expression of protein segments that have autonomous folds and functions, whose structure can then be solved by multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Others are predicting structure from sequence. At the European Molecular Biology Laboratory [EMBL], in Heidelberg, 700 protein families have been identified, based on their common primary structure. Using aligned families to train neural networks, it is now possible to predict secondary structure with an average accuracy of 70 percent. Christine Orengo, of the Biomolecular Structure and Modelling Unit at UCL [University College London] reported on analysis of data in the Brookhaven Protein Database (PDB). She has identified 150 unique folds, and is developing fast automatic methods for comparing structures. Uta Lessel, from the host organisation, the Gesellschaft fuer Biotechnologische Forschung [GBF] in Braunschweig, described similar work based on calculating intramolecular C distances. This too isolates structural families from the PDB. Tim Hubbard, of the Cambridge Centre for Protein Engineering at Hills Road, takes this predictive approach in a different direction. He pointed out that the increased number of structures in the PDB allows one to use pair-wise interactions and H-bonding patterns to build potential tables for the topology of Beta-strand alignment, a technique that is sufficiently powerful to distinguish correct from incorrect alignments. Beta-strands are extended conformations of polypeptide chains. In modelling, it is essential to obtain the correct register and alignment of adjacent Beta-strands, which remains a difficult problem for anyone who wants to predict structure from sequence. Gerald Boehm, of the University of Regensburg, is developing techniques to assess the quality and reliability of model structures. These include correlation functions, derived from non-redundant protein structures, that put statistical limits on the accuracy of a structure. The technique has been validated against deliberately misfolded models, and is now being used to investigate proteins from extremophiles to identify their individual sources of stability. Although more nucleic acid data, from more diverse sources, is being collected every year, Rainer Fuchs of the EMBL Data Library cautioned that the quality of these data is probably lower. There are more than 100 types of database available today, and Fuchs called for more logical data structures, with better relational links between databases, in the future. Some of this development will take place during the next 18 months, as the Data Library moves to its new site in Cambridge. Peter Artymiuk, of the Krebs Institute at Sheffield University, spoke about the development of two programs, POSSUM and PROTEP, that ease the comparison of 3-D structures, detecting new folds and identifying relationships between structure and function. The programs work at either main chain or side chain level, and have discovered previously unrecognised structural relationships between proteins in the PDB. Paul Wrede, of the Free University in Berlin, has developed pattern recognitions programs using neural networks, which are particularly useful for protein design. PROFI, for example, extracts useful features such as signal peptide sequences, while PROSID simulates molecular evolution and can be used to design new cleavage sites. Another approach is to generate artificial structures by modifying the course of the main chain of a known structure. Frieder Kaden, of the German National Centre for Computer Science, explained how this generates a new topology with the same space-filling characteristics, which can then be used to create an enhanced database for the development of folding algorithms. Putting the proteins and programs together to design new functions remains a challenge. Dietmar Schomburg explained how the interdisciplinary group at CAPE in Braunschweig has designed some very specific proteins, including an elastase inhibitor and a new dehydrogenase that is designed to work on chiral amino acids and keto-acids. Jan Pedersen, of the University of Bath, reported on the development of software tools for protein design, especially of antibodies and antigens. Docking algorithms and molecular modelling and simulation allow the group to target mutagenesis of specific regions of antibodies. Taking design forward into specific drugs, Ed Hodgkin described how his company, British Biotechnology Ltd. in Oxford, chases peptide "leads," small regions that play an active part in biomolecular interactions, and constructs specific mimetics based on them. Peptide libraries are increasingly guiding people to those leads, which have so far been used to design receptor antagonists and enzyme inhibitors. Hans-Joachim Boehm, of BASF in Ludwigshafen, uses a similar approach, positioning new molecules and substituents on a known lead structure. He called for more research into methods for "annealing" these new ligands and receptors. The final session concerned the forces and dynamics of proteins. Jim Warwicker, of the AFRC Institute of Food Research, in Reading, outlined methods of estimating and depicting the electrostatic surface of proteins, which give insights into protein function and may, in future, be used to asses the accuracy of estimates of stability and pH response. Manfred Sippl, of the University of Salzburg in Austria, explained how his work uses the frequency of occurrence of secondary structures to calculate force fields for particular protein structures. Like Warwicker, Sippl foresees using this kind of information to assess and validate protein structures. Rod Hubbard, of York University, is trying to speed up computation for modelling, for example by simplifying the depiction of side chains. Protein 3D co-ordinates can be extracted from published stereo pair images of main chains, and many other tools are being developed to make it easier to determine structure and to model interactions. In all, the meeting was judged a success. It put scientists in touch, within and across national borders. It also identified a major area for future collaboration: the use of comparison and alignment studies to identify protein families. There is, however, a need for more exchange of software, and as a result of this meeting a directory of available programs will probably be made available. One useful suggestion is that the various programs be put to work on a small number of common structures, to allow an objective assessment of their relative capabilities. This may be a project that the SERC's [Science and Engineering Research Council] EMBnet node at Daresbury could undertake, in collaboration with the EMBL Data Library. More post-doctoral visits and exchanges will probably take place within the groups, and collaborations will be forged to create partnerships for the forthcoming EC Framework programme.
