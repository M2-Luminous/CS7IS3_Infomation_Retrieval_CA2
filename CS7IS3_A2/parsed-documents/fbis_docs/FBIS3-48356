FBIS3-48356 "dreas016_c_94020" FBIS-EAS-94-016 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 North Korea KCNA Denounces Adviser's Remarks SK2201052194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0430 GMT 22 Jan 94 SK2201052194 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- An advisor to the Japanese Defence Agency, Sakuma, in a recent lecture reportedly let loose a bellicose blast, saying that "Japan cannot sit idle in an event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula and "mode of Japan's cooperation with the U.S. Forces must be examined." These grave utterances of Sakuma getting on the nerve of the DPRK are an unpardonable, undisguised challenge to it. He fully revealed the criminal scheme of the Japanese reactionaries to stage a comeback to Korea. Maximizing the fiction of "nuclear issue" and "missile threat" of the DPRK, the Japanese rightwing reactionaries have of late let out a string of bellicose outbursts, threatening a "preemptive attack" and "Japan's participation in a war on the Korean peninsula", having designated the DPRK as "imaginary enemy No.1". What is grave in this reinvasion scheme of the Japanese reactionaries is that they intend to make Japan a shock force with the backing of the United States in "an event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula. This is evidenced by Sakuma's words about "cooperation with the U.S. Forces" and "Japan's support to the U.S. Forces." When a prospect has been opened for a fundamental solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through DPRK-U.S. contact, Japan is threatening an attack on the DPRK with the backing of its dialogue partner. Can there be such folly in other parts of the world? The Japanese reactionaries are making a mistake. They must not act rashly, deeply mindful of the terrible consequences to be entailed by their rash act.
