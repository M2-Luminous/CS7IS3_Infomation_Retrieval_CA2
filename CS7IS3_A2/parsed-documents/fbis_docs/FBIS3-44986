Harbin Bearing Plant was swept very clean to greet the arrival of a distinguished guest. At about 0930 that morning, Comrade Li Ruihuan, standing committee member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, got off a van at a half step and walked to Harbin Bearing Plant. After looking at the operation situation of workers one after another, he stopped beside Yang Jingyu, a young female worker, and cordially asked: How many years have you worked for this plant? Yang Jingyu answered: Three years. Li Ruihuan asked again: How much do you earn per month? Yang answered: One hundred and six yuan. If bonuses and subsidies are added, it totals 190 yuan. At the maximum, it had reached 370 to 380 yuan. At the plant's meeting room, when Comrade Li Ruihuan again mentioned the issue of wages, workers realized that Li Ruihuan was not casual in asking about the questions concerning wages, and he was always concerned with the livelihood of the masses. Ma Jibo, director of the plant, told Li Ruihuan bluntly: The average annual income of workers is 4,000 yuan. Li Ruihuan nodded and said: It is not much. The workers' income is connected with the development of enterprises and with the stability of the society and public feeling. What attracted the interests of Comrade Li Ruihuan was how state-owned enterprises, large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in particular, should strive for development under the new historical condition. Ma Jibo gave Li Ruihuan a detailed briefing of the plant's situation in importing funds and technology and in carrying out renovation through grafting. Then, Li Ruihuan said happily: I agree with your method. This is a way out for large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. The three major power plants in Harbin can also be like that after renovation. Li Ruihuan added: Your products occupy a certain place and have a sort of monopoly on domestic markets. The state precisely wants to foster a number of enterprises like you to develop major fine and highly sophisticated products. There are only several big plants producing power generating and boiler facilities in the world. Our special technology and installations cannot be compared with others. These remarks inspired the workers of the plant. At 1010, Comrade Li Ruihuan arrived at Harbin Engineering College. The way to the meeting room was filled with teachers, staff members, and workers. Yang Shiqin, president of Harbin Engineering Plant, briefed Comrade Li Ruihuan on the situation of the scientific and technological park zone of Harbin Engineering College. Yang said: At the scientific and technological park zone, that was established a year ago, dozens of scientific research results have already been industrialized, and another group of scientific research results are under rapid transformation. After hearing this, Comrade Li Ruihuan was very satisfied with it, and discussed with college teachers and staff on how to combine education and scientific research with production. Li Ruihuan said: How good is the phrase [words indistinct]. But, it is useless because nobody follows it. There are no such phrases in foreign countries, but they work in good order. It will not do to shout slogans. These remarks set college teachers and staff roaring with laughter. After laughing, they pondered over what Li Ruihuan said. With regard to the questions of combining education and scientific research with production and in many other questions, we should not offer questions merely but should also strive to find out answers. It will not do to shout empty slogans. What is important is to deal with concrete matters. During the discussion, some comrades also pointed out: The things will be better if enterprises can join hands with universities and colleges in the fields of tackling technological difficulties and improving the technology content of products. Comrade Li Ruihuan was much interested in this suggestion. Then, he encouraged college teachers and staff to exert great efforts in working out a system of combining education, science, technology, and production. After this, Comrade Li Ruihuan visited the scientific hall of the college with great interest. He said: Here is the world of robots. When a robot wrote welcome with its machinery hand on the spot, Comrade Li Ruihuan nodded and praised it repeatedly. At the scientific and technological market that was about to start business at the scientific and technological park zone, President Yang Shiqin walked to Comrade Li Ruihuan with a gilding certificate on his hand, and invited Li Ruihuan as honorary adviser to the scientific and technological park zone of Harbin Engineering College. Comrade Li Ruihuan happily accepted the invitation, and this garnered warm applause of college teachers, staff, and workers.
