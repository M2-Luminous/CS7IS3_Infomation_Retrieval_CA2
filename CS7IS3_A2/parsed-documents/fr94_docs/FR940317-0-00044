ACTION: Technical amendment. SUMMARY: This document contains corrections to regulations published on February 17, 1993 (58 FR 8884). That Interim Final Rule changed the length categories of recreational vessels subject to the recreational vessel fee (RVF) for calendar years 1993 and 1994, as required by Section 501 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act of 1992. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 1, 1992. ADDRESSES: Unless otherwise indicated, documents referenced in this preamble are available for inspection or copying at the office of the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA/3406), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001 between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

A copy of this technical amendment may be obtained by calling the Coast Guard's toll-free Boating Safety Hotline, 1&hyph;800&hyph;368&hyph;5647. In Washington, DC, call 267&hyph;0780. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Interim Final Rule, as published in the Federal Register (58 FR 8884; February 17, 1993), provided amendatory language revising the categories of vessels, by length, that were subject to the Recreational Vessel Fee for calendar years 1993 and 1994. However, the Interim Final Rule also contained incorrect amendatory language revising section 1.30&hyph;1 which caused the text of former paragraph (c) and the introductory text of paragraph (d) of that section to be mistakenly deleted. Since the purpose of the rulemaking was only to implement Section 501 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;587, the amendatory language should have redesignated paragraphs (c) and (d) of ยง1.30&hyph;1 as paragraphs (d) and (e), respectively, rather than causing them to be deleted. This document revises 33 CFR 1.30&hyph;1 to redesignate and restore the deleted text as it formerly appeared in the CFR. Need for Correction As published, the Interim Final Rule omitted information on applicability of the fees to vessels operated on navigable waters of the United States.
