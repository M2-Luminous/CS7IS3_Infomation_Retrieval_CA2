It has been learned that the sides decided on a series of measures to protect the Palestinians and increase their sense of security in the wake of the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs. These are the understandings reached so far: -- An international presence in Hebron, apparently a unit made up of a few dozen observers from Norway. -- The establishment of a Palestinian police unit consisting of several hundred troops which would deploy in Hebron and would be under joint Israeli-Palestinian command. -- Joint patrols to be conducted by Israel, the Palestinians, and the foreign observers. Palestinian observers in Tunis report on the following understandings which have not yet been confirmed by Israel: -- Seven days after the delegations reach a final agreement, an armed Palestinian police force will enter the West Bank and begin its operations to impose order. -- The trailer neighborhood in the Jericho area will be evacuated at once. Three months later, Jewish settlers will be evacuated from the heart of Hebron and relocated elsewhere, apparently in Qiryat Arba'. Israel has categorically denied that it agreed to evacuate the settlers from Hebron. -- All Palestinian deportees will be allowed to return to Jericho. -- The PLO leadership will arrive in Jericho a month after the deployment of the Palestinian police force. PLO administrative personnel and a task force would arrive in the area earlier to make all the arrangements for the arrival of the leadership. [passage omitted]
