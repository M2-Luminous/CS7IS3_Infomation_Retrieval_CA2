"That is now up to the bosses," Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, of the Christian Democratic Union, said on Friday [11 March] in Berlin at the conclusion of a three-day visit to Germany by his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev. The Russian defense minister said that the Russians want to be sent off as partners and friends. On Friday, Grachev visited a Bundeswehr unit in Brandenburg. Accompanied by Minister Ruehe, he was observing an exercise of soldiers of an armored infantry battalion and a motorized infantry battalion at the Lehnin training area. Afterwards the two ministers laid wreaths at the Soviet memorial and the 20 July 1944 memorial. Thus, for the first time a Russian politician has honored the heroes of the German resistance of 20 July 1944 by laying a wreath. The Bundeswehr and the Russian Army intend to cooperate more closely in the future in the areas of environmental protection at the level of Armed Forces and the exchange of officers. Agreements to this effect were signed by the two ministers on Friday. In a first stage, three Russian officers should study at the Bundeswehr's command and control academy in Hamburg and one German colonel at the Moscow military academy. In addition, joint navy exercises were agreed for this year in the Baltic Sea. Plans for 1995 include the participation of German soldiers in an exercise in Russia.
