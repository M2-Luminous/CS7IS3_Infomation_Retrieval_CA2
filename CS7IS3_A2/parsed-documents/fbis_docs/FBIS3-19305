Howard Davies director-general of the CBI set out a catalogue of reforms which called into question the fabric of decision-making in Britain. Local government was at the head of what he described as "a menu of modest proposals" which would require an overhauling of the way that the public sector was run at regional and local level. Mr Davies, speaking to the European Policy Forum, an independent think tank, demanded that central government should allow local councils greater flexibility over their own functions, particularly through greater control of their own money. Wider sources of revenue, such as channelling vehicle excise duty to local councils, would help to make local authorities self-financing, while national services, such as education, should be taken out of local authority control. Mr Davies said that, although he respected the strengths of Parliament, there was widespread concern about whether it was effective in preparing legislation. His intervention comes at a sensitive time for the Government as it faces criticism for its handling of local government. Voicing the concerns of the business community, Mr Davies said there was a need for a regional dimension for handling transport and planning needs. Many local authorities were "small-minded, grotesquely inefficient and generally awful," and were "in desperate need of reform." However, even after 144 pieces of legislation under the Tory Government, Mr Davies insisted last night that "we are left with much confusion and conflict." He called for more extensive consultation with outside bodies before Bills were drafted, and said that interested parties should be called to give evidence to MPs scrutinising new legislation. There should also be periodic review of the operation of legislation, which would allow input from outside bodies. His pressure for change will strike a chord with many MPs of all parties who are concerned that the relationship between local and central government has become increasingly strained.
