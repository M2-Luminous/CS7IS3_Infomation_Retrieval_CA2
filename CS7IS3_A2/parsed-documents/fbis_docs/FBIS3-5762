Change may be forthcoming given that Pyongyang appointed Hong Sok-hyong and Kong Chin-tae as State Planning Commission chairman and vice premier, respectively, about two months ago, according to NAEWOE. Four ministers were also replaced recently -- the forestry minister, Academy of Sciences president, mining industry minister and chairman of the State Commission of Science and Technology -- by unknown figures, NAEWOE said. North Korea established a new Commission on Protection of the Environment last February, but its Chairman Yi Kon-il was replaced by Hwang Sang-chun recently. The exact reason for the ministerial changes is not known, NAEWOE said.
