Do you believe the battle will continue and what are its objectives? [Bin-Husaynun] The direct objective of the battle has actually been foiled after one week of fighting thanks to our forces' steadfastness. Today, the 15th of May, the forces of 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih who ignited the war are in a difficult position. All their supply lines are being cut from the rear. These forces will be besieged and will be forced to either surrender, or be destroyed. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's dream of occupying Aden and the southern and eastern governorates are sick dreams. He knows more than anyone else that this will not take place during his time, and that the logic of annexation and occupation is rejected even if this will cost us our lives. The question is not confined to within the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] but is a general popular feeling. The people are ready for sacrifices to shake off hegemony and despotism and to defend their interests. The battles show that his forces which tried to reach Aden have been routed. The forces are now intermingling in the [former] border areas. Salih's forces are now in a position that is not to be envied. He and the military from the Al-Ahmar family are fully responsible for the military and civilian casualties because they were the ones to launch a war on the Yemeni people on 4 May. The people will not forgive this gang and it will be taken to account sooner or later. [Al-Bakr] But the communiques Sanaa continues to issue still speak about military victories and about trying the YSP leaders. What do you have to say to this? [Bin-Husaynun] As the military offensive has failed in attaining its objectives, the psychological war and the military communiques will also not serve the operations room that runs the war. If we review the military communiques issued over one week and the statements made by the civilian generals like Basindwah and al-Iryani, we find that they have captured Aden more than 20 times. I will reveal a secret. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the gang that launched the war are preparing to escape from Yemen. However, we will not permit them to do so. He will have to pay for what he has committed. We will stalk him wherever he goes. [Al-Bakr] Does this mean you are preparing to enter Sanaa? [Bin-Husaynun] Sanaa is a must even if the journey is a long one because it is the capital of Yemen and cannot be given up. [Al-Bakr] And do you view this as a victory if it takes place? What is the use of entering Sanaa? The president says that his objective is to enter Aden and you answer him with the same logic while the war destroys the country's economy and kills people? [Bin-Husaynun] We do not claim victories. From the first day of the war that was launched on us, we said we will exercise positive self-defense. What can we do when we find ourselves facing a bloodthirsty suicidal gang? The only solution is to eradicate this gang which obstructs development, prevents stability, and makes the people go backward. This war was imposed on us and on all the good forces. That's why confrontation is inevitable. We have to admit that the people pay a prohibitive price for this, but what can we do? [Al-Bakr] You toured the United Arab Emirates [UAE], Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. What was the objective of this tour? What are the positions of the Arab leaders whom you met on the ongoing war in Yemen? [Bin-Husaynun] We met with [UAE President] His Highness Shaykh Zayid, who cares for Yemeni unity, and with His Excellency President Husni Mubarak, who, along with us, worked to prevent the war option. We also met with His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad, who is known for his unionist positions, and with His Majesty King Husayn, who sponsored the signing of the document of pledge and accord, and also with His Majesty King Fahd, a neighbor and a brother who cares for sparing Yemeni blood. We briefed the brothers on the ongoing unfair war which is spilling Yemeni blood and threatening Yemen's unity and stability. We also conveyed messages from brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, deputy chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of the YSP. These messages cautioned against the serious regrettable events planned and carried out by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the military clique of the al-Ahmar family. We also carried an initiative by the brother secretary general to spare blood. We sensed both a response and care for sparing blood, for halting the destructive war, and for safeguarding Yemen's unity and people. [Al-Bakr] What are the points of the initiative you carried to the Arab leaders? [Bin-Husaynun] In brief, the initiative calls for an immediate cease-fire and the return to the negotiating table in order to resolve all problems. Our Arab brothers promised us to provide everything needed to stop the bleeding and help the Yemeni people circumvent their ordeal. We now express the YSP leadership's satisfaction with this attitude and these genuine and responsible positions. [Al-Bakr] It is noted that you were received at the highest level. Does this mean the Arab brothers do not recognize the decisions made by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, which ousted you from the government? [Bin-Husaynun] You may come to this conclusion. I would like to point out that all Arab leaders, whom we met, felt that there is a real crisis which cannot be summed up in such terms as legitimacy and outlaws, terms which Salih used as the themes of his war. The Arab leaders believe that dialogue is necessary and that the decisions made should be canceled, so the two sides could resolve the problem. I would like to pose a question to 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih: If the southern leaders are secessionists and outlaws, then with whom was the unity achieved? Is unity not concluded between two parties? Moreover, what is meant by legitimacy? Does legitimacy mean the legitimate cancellation of one party in favor of another party? [Al-Bakr] What is your comment on a statement made by [Yemeni Planning and Development Minister] Dr. al-Iryani that the north would continue the war to finish off the YSP, even if it takes 100 years to do so? [Bin-Husaynun] If he can do so, let him do it. However, I would like to tell al-Iryani that our ability is twice his ability and we will defend our ideas, principles, and the Yemeni people in the south and north for 200 years. Furthermore, I would like to blame al-Iryani because we wanted him in the ranks of modernization and peace in view of his known high culture. We, however, find al-Iryani today wearing a military suit and making conflicting and shaky statements. [Al-Bakr] Has oil been affected by the war? [Bin-Husaynun] The oil installations have not yet been affected by the military operations, and the oil production and exportation are continuing as before in the oil fields of Ma'rib, Shabwah, and Hadhramaut. However, the exploration and survey operations came to a halt, and a large number of experts departed. [Al-Bakr] If we assume that fighting stopped today and that you returned to dialogue, what project would you propose? Would you continue the unity or search for a new formula? [Bin-Husaynun] Our direct objective is a cease-fire. This would facilitate the search for appropriate options. We demand an unconditional cease-fire and a return to dialogue. When we made an initiative in this regard we were careful and governed by a sense of responsibility toward our people. We did not make this initiative out of fear or weakness. [Al-Bakr] Thus, the opportunity for dialogue with President Salih still exists, despite everything? [Bin-Husaynun] Dialogue is necessary, whether with Salih or others. This is because Yemen does not lack the forces of good will.
