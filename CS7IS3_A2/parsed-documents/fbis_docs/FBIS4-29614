The annual land white paper for 1993 argues that the myth added much fuel to the speculative demand for land at that time. Land speculation first hit the market amid growing expectations of higher prices stemming from various economic factors, such as rising corporate earnings, lower interest rates and surging demand for office space, the report said. In its first analysis of the speculation bubbles, the report says land prices eventually took a downturn mainly due to government emergency measures to cap them, including monetary and taxation curbs on speculation. The experiences over the speculation frenzy and its demise, as well as the following recession, have changed the people's mind-set concerning land and deflated perennial expectations of ever-higher land prices. But the boom leaves some unwelcome remnants, the report says. Land price inflation, for instance, has made house ownership in large cities out of reach for average workers, thereby dampening their labor incentives. Moreover, the sharp downswing after the burst of the bubbles leaves many companies that climbed on the speculation bandwagon with devastating balance sheets. In 1993, land prices fell for the third consecutive year, albeit at a slower rate than the previous two years, in particular in commercial districts of major cities. The average price of a new condominium in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area that was put on the market in 1993 was 49 million yen for a 70-square-meter unit, still 5.8 times the average annual income of workers in the region, the report says.
