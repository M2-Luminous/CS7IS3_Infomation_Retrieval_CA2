FR940810-2-00108 FR940810-2-00072 (a) In the case of a foreign broker/dealer or bank which is participating in the distribution as an underwriter, the agreement among underwriters contains a provision which obligates the said foreign broker/dealer or bank not to sell any of the securities which it receives as a participant in the distribution to persons enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (5) above, or in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph (6) hereof; or (b) In the case of sales to a foreign broker/dealer or bank which is not participating in the distribution as an underwriter, the selling member: (i) Makes an affirmative inquiry of such foreign broker/dealer or bank as to whether the ultimate purchasers would be persons enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (5) hereof and receives satisfactory assurance that the ultimate purchasers of the securities so purchased would not be such persons, and that the securities would not be sold in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph (6) hereof; (ii) A recording is made on the order ticket, or its equivalent, or upon some other supporting document, of the name of the person to whom the inquiry was made at the foreign broker/dealer or bank as well as the substance of what was said by that person and what was done as a result thereof; and (iii) The order ticket, or its equivalent, is initialed by a registered principal of the member. The obligations imposed upon members in their dealings with foreign broker/dealers or banks by this paragraph 8(b) can be fulfilled by having the foreign broker/dealer or bank to which sales falling within the scope of this Interpretation are made execute Form RF&hyph;1, or a reasonable facsimile thereof. This form, which gives a blanket assurance from the foreign broker/dealer or bank that no sales will be made in contravention of the provisions of this Interpretation, can be obtained at any District Office of the Association or at the Executive Office. The acceptance of an executed Form FR&hyph;1, or other written assurance, by a member must in all instances be made in good faith. Thus, if a member knows or should have known of facts which are inconsistent with the representations received, such will not operate to satisfy the obligations imposed upon him by this paragraph. Scope and Intent of Interpretation In addition to the obvious scope and intent of the above provisions, the intent of the Board of Governors in the following specific situations is outlined for the guidance of members. Limited Business Broker/Dealer The restrictions placed on associated persons pursuant to Paragraph 2 of the Interpretation shall not apply to persons associated with NASD members engaged solely in the purchase or sale of either investment company/variable contracts securities or direct participation program securities. Issuer Directed Securities This Interpretation shall apply to securities which are part of a public offering notwithstanding that some or all of those securities are specifically directed by the issuer to accounts which are included within the scope of paragraphs (3) through (8) above. Therefore, if a person within the scope of those paragraphs to whom securities were directed did not have the required [an] investment history [with the member or registered representative from whom they were to be purchased], the member would not be permitted to sell him such securities. Also, the ``disproportionate'' and ``insubstantial'' tests would apply as in all other situations. Thus, the directing of a substantial number of securities to any one person would be prohibited as would the directing of securities to such accounts in amounts which would be disproportionate as compared to sales to members of the public. If such issuer-directed securities are sold to the issuer's employees or directors or potential employees or directors resulting from an intended merger, acquisition, or other business combination, such securities may be sold without limitation as to amount and regardless of whether such employees have an investment history as required by the Interpretation; provided, however, that in the case of an offering of securities for which a bona fide independent market does not exist, such securities shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or hypothecated for a period of three months following the effective date of the offering. This Interpretation shall also apply to securities which are part of a public offering notwithstanding that some of those securities are specifically directed by the issuer on a non-underwritten basis. In such cases, the managing underwriter of the offering shall be responsible for insuring compliance with this Interpretation in respect to those securities. Notwithstanding the above, sales of issuer directed securities may be made to non-employee/director restricted persons without the required investment history after receiving permission from the Board of Governors. Permission will be given only if there is a demonstration of valid business reasons for such sales (such as sales to distributors and suppliers [or key employees], who are in each case incidentally restricted persons), and the member seeking permission is prepared to demonstrate that the aggregate amount of securities so sold is insubstantial and not disproportionate as compared to sales to members of the public, and that the amount sold to any one of such persons is insubstantial in amount ; provided, however, that such securities shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or hypothecated for a period of three months following the effective date of the offering. Stand-By Purchasers Securities purchased pursuant to a stand-by arrangement shall not be subject to the provisions of the Interpretation if the following conditions are met: 1. The stand-by agreement is disclosed in the prospectus. 2. The stand-by arrangement is the subject of a formal written agreement. 3. The managing underwriter represents in writing that it was unable to find any other purchasers for the securities. 4. The securities purchased shall be restricted from sale or transfer for a period of three months. 2 2 When the securities are sold by stand-by purchasers, the stand-by purchasers would need to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements including prospectus delivery pursuant to Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''). Investment Partnerships and Corporations A member may not sell [securities of a public offering which trade at a premium in the secondary market whenever such secondary market begins (``hot issue''),] a hot issue to the account of any investment partnership or corporation, domestic or foreign (except companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940) including but not limited to, hedge funds, investment clubs, and other like accounts unless the member complies with either of the following alternatives: (A) prior to the execution of the transaction, the member has received from the account a current list of the names and business connections of all persons having any beneficial interest in the account, and if such information discloses that any person [enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (4) hereof] restricted under this Interpretation has a beneficial interest in such account, any sale of securities to such account must be consistent with the provisions of this Interpretation, or (B) prior to the execution of the transaction, the member has obtained a copy of a written representation [current opinion] from counsel admitted to practice law before the highest court of any state or the account's independent certified public accountant stating that such counsel or accountant reasonably believes that no person with a beneficial interest in the account is a restricted person under this Interpretation and stating that, in providing such [opinion] representation, counsel or accountant : (1) Has reviewed and is familiar with this Interpretation; (2) Has reviewed a current list of all persons with a beneficial interest in the account supplied by the account manager; (3) Has reviewed information supplied by the account manager with respect to each person with a beneficial interest in the account, including the identity, the nature of employment, and any other business connections of such persons; and (4) has requested and reviewed other documents and other pertinent information and made inquiries of the account manager and received responses thereto, if counsel or the accountant determines that such further review and inquiry are necessary and relevant to determine the correct status of such persons under the Interpretation.
