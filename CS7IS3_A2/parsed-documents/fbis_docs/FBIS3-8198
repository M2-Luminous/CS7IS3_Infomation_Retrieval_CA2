The merger took place at a two-day congress that ended in Bratislava today. The Democratic Party unites the former membership base of the Civic Democratic Union, the Democratic Party, the Civic Democratic Party of Slovakia, Democrats 92, the Czech-Slovak Understanding, and the Green League. Pavol Hagyari has become chairman of the Party. We asked him what the merger means: [Begin Hagyari recording] The merger of the civic right wing that is taking place today and the early parliamentary elections will make it possible for the civic right wing to get into parliament and, possibly, even into the government. [passage omitted] We are interested in solving the economic crisis. We are interested in solving the political crisis as soon as possible. Politics must return to where it belongs--to the citizens. We are interested in solving the actual problems of real citizens, and our policies are like those of the West European countries, like those of parties similar to ours. The basic thing is a fast and thorough transformation--clean and clear privatization, the creation of resources, and the consequent solving of the problems of unemployment, living standards, criminality, health care, and education.
