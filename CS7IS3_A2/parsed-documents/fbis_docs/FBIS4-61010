Delayed negotiations have a negative feature of making the delegations concentrate on details and forcing them to forget the strategic directions, Meri said. He hoped that a meeting with the Russian president might give new life to the negotiations. The president admitted that his contacts with Boris Yeltsin have been limited to letters so far. "Obviously, the relations with the Baltic states are not a central issue of the Russian foreign policy and the negotiations have been slowed down accordingly," he said. Meri welcomed the idea of finding an international mediator, for example, the president of Finland. He also said that the freezing of the Estonian-Russian border issue for 5-10 years could be possible in order to enable to find a correct solution to the issue. [passage omitted]
