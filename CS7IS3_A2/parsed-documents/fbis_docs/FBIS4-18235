During the first five months of the 1993-94 (30 September) business year, the corporation achieved a yield of 55 million German marks [DM] before taxes; the year before the yield was DM3.4 billion. The operational result has also improved, Kajo Neukirchen, chairman of the board of directors, stressed at the shareholders' meeting. The operational loss declined to DM50 million (the year before DM80 million). These figures, however, do not include the losses of DM1.5 billion suffered by the U.S. subsidiary, MG Corporation, which caused the financial disaster of Metallgesellschaft AG. During the first months of this year the turnover was DM7.1 (7.2) billion. The number of employees in the corporation declined to 41,357 (43,988) employees. The cleaning-up and restructuring work at MG is also documented by numerous sales. After the sale of Kolbenschmidt, Korf, and Methanex, a 65-percent share of Metal Mining Corporation is obviously to be sold soon. "The necessary investments in the raw material production far exceed the financial capacity of the Metallgesellschaft corporation," Neukirchen said. Solving the mining problem is also pursued with "high priority." Yesterday the shareholders' meeting had to decide on the second part of the recovery measures, which were adopted at the extraordinary shareholders' meeting on 24 February. The focal item was the issuing of convertible participation rights, with which claims by the banks are converted.
