The president said he was surprised by attempts of the six-seat Social Democratic faction to oust the government. Brazauskas said the social democrats are either trying to gain popularity or to clear the way for other political forces. In his view, the Social Democratic Party can hardly expect wider representation in government structures. Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the parliament's rightist opposition, said the initiative can be discussed only when the social democrats will show how many members of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDLP] faction have signed under a petition demanding to take a no confidence vote in the government. "Otherwise, these are only senseless games or attempts to score political points," Landsbergis said at a press conference Monday. The opposition leader said "the replacement of one LDLP government by a different LDLP government" would be an advantage only to the party in power, which, possibly uses the social democrats for the purpose. Landsbergis said the ruling party would get an opportunity to say that nothing should be expected from a new government for at least six months. This would be a new possibility for the LDLP to defend itself against criticism, he said. Last week, the social democrats proposed to take a no confidence vote in the government and urged other political forces to back their initiative.
