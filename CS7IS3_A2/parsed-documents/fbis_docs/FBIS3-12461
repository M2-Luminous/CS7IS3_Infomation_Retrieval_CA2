The summit included Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Butrus Sfayr; Shaykh Muhammad Rashid Qabbani, acting mufti of the Republic; and Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, deputy chairman of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council. The latter two visited Bkirki to offer condolences to the victims of yesterday's explosion. The heads of the Muslim community informed Patriarch Sfayr that Druze spiritual leader Shaykh Bahjat Ghayth will not be able to come for health reasons and that they were asked to speak on his behalf and extend his condolences. Shaykh Shams-al-Din clarified that a small committee consisting of the Islamic-Christian dialogue group has been commissioned to hold contacts with officials and urge them to take the necessary measures to uncover this crime and its criminals. After leaving Bkirki, Shams-al-Din said the target of the crime is not the church or the worshipers, but the heart and unity of Lebanon and the government's projects. He affirmed that the criminal hand is not Lebanese. It is certainly a foreign hand. He noted that this crime has not been committed against the Maronite community alone, nor against the Muslims alone, but against all Lebanese. Shaykh Qabbani said that the fingerprints on the church and Hebron Mosque massacres are the same. He called on the Lebanese to arm themselves with comprehensive national unity. He affirmed that the Lebanese will never be dragged into sectarian sedition and that there is no justification for what happened, no matter what the reasons. A Hizballah delegation was one of the most prominent visitors at the Patriarchate today and it took part in the service for the victims of the church bomb. A delegation from the National Liberal Party also visited Bkirki today to express their condemnation and pain over the crime. The Amal Movement condemned the massacre at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church and saw it as an extension of the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. The General Labor Federation also condemned the crime and asked the state to track down the criminals and punish them as severely as possible so that they would be an example to others.
