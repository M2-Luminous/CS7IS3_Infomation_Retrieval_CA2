He confirmed once again that Hungary is not going to initiate the lifting of the UN embargo. Peter Gyuricza reports from the Committee's meeting. [Gyuricza] Events of the following months will prove whether changes in Belgrade politics -- which also made possible Foreign Minister Jeszenszky's visit -- have indeed taken place. The foreign minister said that these changes include the diminishing of psychological pressure on ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina, reducing extremist manifestations, easing the tone of the Belgrade press, and decreasing the frequency of call-ups. Geza Jeszenszky favorably viewed the fact that negotiations are under way between the Democratic Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina and the Serbian Government with regard to autonomy and its institutions. Geza Jeszenszky said that Hungary will not initiate lifting the UN Security Council embargo. At the same time, however, as a sovereign state guided by its national interests, it may believe that the time has come to hold talks about this with its partners and allies, especially since no way out can be seen. [passage omitted] Hungary is observing the UN Security Council resolution, stressed Geza Jeszenszky. [passage omitted]
