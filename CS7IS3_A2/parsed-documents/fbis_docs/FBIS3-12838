This problem requires a radical solution because the developments over the past two years have shown that such a solution is in the best interests of all parties. In an editorial today, the paper says that it is insufficient to disarm the extremists in settlements or even to impose international protection of the Palestinians as a temporary measure until the issue of settlements has been resolved, noting that a basic solution lies in deporting the settlers and extremists from the occupied land. AL-AHRAM states that the Israeli views of keeping the settlements in the occupied territories have become old-fashioned given the new realities of Jewish extremism. The paper says that certain facts about Jewish extremism that emerged after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre showed that there are training camps and command posts that extend to the United States. In addition, these realities demonstrated the American Jews' support for the Jewish extremists in Israel and inside the occupied territories, a fact that has made the U.S. Administration express its concern.
