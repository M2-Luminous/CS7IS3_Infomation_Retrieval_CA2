What are the trends? [Kracun] In some fields there was still a decline in 1993. However, according to the calculations made so far, there has been an upswing in the economy as a whole. [Guggenberger] What is your explanation for that? [Kracun] For our economy, which exports more than 60 percent of its production, the worldwide recession and above all the recession in Europe was a major obstacle. Now the situation is more favorable. It was possible to open up new markets, and we have changed some general conditions in our country. [Guggenberger] What do you mean by that? [Kracun] For some time, a new law on enterprises has been in force in our country. The next step was tax reform, as a result of which the taxation of profits decreased to 25 percent. Compared to other countries, this is very low. Foreign investors can import machines and plants without paying duties. We resolved privatization as one of the most important reform steps. It concerns the field of the previous social property -- these were firms that were formally in the hands of the employees, who, however, did not have any right to sell them; enterprises owned by development funds and bank reorganization funds, and actual state property such as steel works, the postal service, and railroads. [Guggenberger] How far has the privatization process advanced? [Kracun] Some years will pass before it is concluded. Some enterprises have to get out of the deficit zone. [Guggenberger] That is to say, the state will hardly act as an entrepreneur in the future? [Kracun] Yes, in this way we are following Western developments. [Guggenberger] There are plans to develop the infrastructure. [Kracun] In the next five years, we will build 300 km of superhighways, above all in the southwest-northeast direction from the port of Koper to Lendava at the Hungarian border and the connection between Maribor and Spielfeld. The railroads will also be modernized. [Guggenberger] Economic relations with the European states are of utmost importance for Slovenia. What are they to be like in the future? [Kracun] Several agreements with the EU and the European Free Trade Association [EFTA] are already in force now. The trade and cooperation agreement with Hungary guarantees us duty free trade for about 90 percent of all industrial goods. The trade agreement with the EFTA is not quite so favorable. At present, we are negotiating a free trade agreement with this group of countries. In this way, both EFTA and the EU will be relatively open markets for us, except for agricultural products. Moreover, there are bilateral free trade agreements with the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The same with Hungary and Poland will follow. We also have appropriate contacts with the Baltic states, Romania, and Bulgaria.
