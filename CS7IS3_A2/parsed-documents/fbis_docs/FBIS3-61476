Fateyev, NIKIMT Scientific Production Association; UDC 621.791.05:620.179] [Abstract] The association's achievements in the field of nondestructive testing, particularly the development of a broad range of both traditional and special-purpose skill-intensive processes, procedures, and facilities on the basis of radiation, acoustic, eddy current, magnetic, optical, and other types of inspection are reviewed, and it is noted that several institute departments are engaged in addressing other testing issues. A number of designs in the field of nondestructive testing realized on the basis of the institute's own unique developments is summarized. Attention is focused on developing methods and facilities for ultrasonic testing of austenite welds and procedures which would make it possible to classify the detected flaws. In recent years, more than 30 types of reactor vessel and primary circuit testing equipment have been developed by the institute. It is noted that the institute's work in this field is characterized by its comprehensive approach to solving problems. The outlook for further development in the field of nondestructive testing is discussed. Figures 7; references 3.
