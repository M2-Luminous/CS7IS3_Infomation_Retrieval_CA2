The SSB index showed that the added value of Chinese industries increased by 17.3 percent in May in comparison with the same month last year. Production of state-owned enterprises turned for the better -- up 5.6 percent on May last year, and 0,6 percent above the previous month. During the first five months of 1994, the total added value of industries amounted to 619.6 billion yuan, 16 percent more than in the same period of 1993. A bumper harvest of summer crops is expected by SSB officials, who cited favorable weather condition and farmers' growing enthusiasm. Effective macro-economic control measures clearly helped push down soaring investment in fixed assets in May. The index indicates that state-owned enterprises invested 67.6 billion yuan in the month, down 16.3 percent from April. Investment by state enterprises was 204.4 billion yuan for the first five months, up 34.2 percent over the same period last year. From January to May, the volume of retail sales totalled 590.7 billion yuan, a rise of 25.2 percent over last year in money terms, which means an actual increase of 4.5 percent if inflation is allowed for. In May alone, the figure was 121.4 billion yuan. Exports totalled 9.45 billion U.S. dollars in May, 31 percent up on the same month last year, while imports totalled 9.7 billion U.S. dollars, a rise of 11.2 percent. In the first five months of this year, China's imports were worth 39.28 billion U.S. dollars, 18.1 percent higher than in the same period of 1993, while exports jumped by 24.1 percent. The trade deficit in the first five months was 1.79 billion U.S. dollars. SSB officials said that in May, China's financial conditions were "basically normal". The government's revenue increased by 33.7 percent in May over the same month of last year, while expenditure rose 20.2 percent. New bank savings amounted to 113.4 billion yuan, 79.4 billion yuan more than in May 1993. A total of 8.5 billion yuan was withdrawn from circulation in the month. The SSB figures showed that pressure from soaring prices was slowly eased. Retail sale prices went up by 18.9 percent over May last year, with the increase rate down 0.6 percent from April. Economists pointed out that it is still very important to bring soaring prices under control. To maintain fast and healthy economic development, China should further implement macro-economic control policies, impose tighter control of prices and sustain proper economic growth.
