Chong Tong-ho returned home on Wednesday after staying in Taiwan for about 10 months. Chong bolted from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party and flew to Taiwan soon after a controversy developed over his alleged accumulation of an illicit fortune last April. "I am sorry for neglecting my legislative activities and for failing to represent my constituents properly in the past," Chong said upon his return. He said that in Taiwan he had studied Chinese at Taiwan political college and received treatment for his arthritis. Chong visited the national cemetery on Thursday and planned to call on National Assembly Speaker Yi Man-sop and the two vice speakers on Saturday. Regarding his fortune, Chong said he believed any suspicions had been fully swept aside following the Assembly Ethics Committee's investigation into the properties of assembly members. "It is fortunate that the properties of myself and my family were found to have been made through legal means," Chong said. Last week speaker Yi sent a message to Chong, telling him to return to the assembly forthwith or face disciplinary steps.
