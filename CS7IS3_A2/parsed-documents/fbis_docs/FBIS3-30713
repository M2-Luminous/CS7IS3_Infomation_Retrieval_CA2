[Petrov] The adoption of the Armed Forces and Defense Bill with a substantial majority is absolutely normal when one takes into consideration the fact that it guarantees the country's security structures -- the Bulgarian Army, the Border Troops, the Troops of the Ministry of Transportation, the Construction Troops.... The adoption of the bill was anticipated by all soldiers and our entire public. This is not a secret, narrow departmental bill, but a document of national importance that unites the ideas and visions of the Armed Forces' future. I was not surprised by the fact that the bill was adopted in an ostensibly rapid manner after constructive debate and discussion. This actually means that the people's representatives have deeply grasped the problems of our national security, skillfully dealt with the specific subject, and precisely and clearly expressed their positions. [Buchkov] What does the Army gain from the adoption of the Armed Forces and Defense Bill by parliament? [Petrov] First of all, the bill determines the Armed Forces' place and role as a stabilizing factor in the period of transition and in our democratic civil society. It also guarantees Bulgaria's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Second, the bill ensures the Armed Forces' functional character, structure, and development. It regulates legally the relations between the various organs of the Armed Forces' leadership and improves, to a large degree, the status of the military. Naturally, the mere act of adopting the bill will not ensure the high social status of the military. However, it is the legal guarantee of the military personnel's security. The military deserve their bill, because they, and indeed, all Bulgarian society, endured a lot until the bill was adopted. [Buchkov] How do you expect events to develop at the National Assembly during the second reading? [Petrov] Against the background of the deputies' statements during the first reading, I expect that some of the bill's postulates will significantly improve during the second reading. [Buchkov] Where do you see the "hazards" of the bill that was adopted at the first reading? [Petrov] This is a basic bill that determines the general tenets of the Armed Forces' construction. Additional bills will be adopted later on; for example, bills on alternative service, the military personnel's status, the Bulgarian Army, the economic foundations of defense, and so on. At present, the bill has no postulates about the status of military education establishments. This aspect must be clarified. In other words, more bills that spring from the Armed Forces and Defense Bill will be adopted. [Buchkov] Mr. Army General, is it time to open the champagne bottles? [Petrov] Not yet. Let it chill. If all goes well, we will soon clink glasses.
