Others, however, have chosen an ambitious answer to what sometimes seems an overwhelming problem. With producers in the area clamoring for subsidized environmental restructuring loans, those providing funding want to know where each dollar will have the greatest impact. Their tool is Project Silesia, an international study bringing together the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the World Bank, the U.S. Peace Corps and the Czech and Polish environmental ministries. The study seeks to set priorities for the region around Ostrava, northern Moravia, and Katowice, southern Poland. The EPA researchers found that air pollutants will probably cause cancer in 1.4 percent of the region's 5 million inhabitants. In areas with peak concentrations of toxins, more than half the residents could be afflicted. On the Czech side of the border alone, air-borne dust, sulfur dioxide and other atmospheric pollutants are estimated to kill 380 people annually. Cases of breathing paralysis and inflammations are also common. Almost 1,000 miners annually suffer from traumas caused by silicosis and physical stress. The researchers also found high levels of poisonous elements, including PCBs, in food produced in Silesia and dangerous levels of arsenic in the tap water. In response, Project Silesia's first task was to identify the main culprits. In this coal-mining and steel-producing region, the ax fell heavily on coke ovens. Ostrava-Karvina Coke Ovens (OKK) released 3,800 tons of pollutants into the atmosphere last year. Under pressure to cut pollution, the company has reduced its production by one-third since 1990. OKK's manager, Vitezslav Hladik, hopes to export his product, which is used to fire metallurgical and power plant furnaces. Environmentalists, however, would rather see his ovens completely shut down in the near future. "Exporting coke would be selling off our health, and depriving ourselves of a non-renewable resource," said Project Silesia's Czech coordinator, Helena Cizkova. Like Hladik, other industrial chiefs both fear the project and place their bets on it. The study's results will aid in directing World Bank funds. Still, "my biggest problem was `selling' the project," Cizkova said. "Many other studies are just gathering dust on ministerial shelves." Industry scientists typically state that they do not need expensive foreign auditors to tell them where their pollution is coming from. "We know our problems very well. Ninety percent of them we know how to deal with," said Jan Chovanec, a technical development worker at Nova Hut, the largest Czech steel producer. Metallurgical plants, which the project identified as the second-worst cause of pollution, want money, not advice. "Repairs and technological updating will cost us 20 billion Kc ($6.7 million)," Chovanec said. "We need long-term loans." Nova Hut registered 1.9 billion Kc in profits last year. The state has divested itself of its responsibility toward the companies, Chovanec said. Nova Hut's ailing Ostrava competitor, Vitkovice, has similar complaints. "The Ministry [of Environment] has decided: polluter, payer. But if we pay huge fees, we have nothing left to make ecological investments," said Vaclav Hettenberger, head of Vitkovice's environmental department. In 1993, the firm was charged 120 million Kc for improper waste storage alone. Industries point an accusing finger at overly stringent green regulations, saying that environmental protection laws passed by the Czech legislature after the revolution did not take into consideration the capacity of producers to adapt. "Our technology is 20 years out of date. And now we are suddenly expected to catch up with the European Community by 1997," Chovanec said. Project manager Cizkova, who is also an employee of the Ministry of Environment, says the laws and fees are necessary to coax industries into action. "Companies are interested in ecology when legislation forces them to be," she said. In fact, the fees are so low that it profits the companies to put off their clean-up investments, Cizkova said. She agreed, however, that polluters mainly need help and money to restructure. "Local loans are too expensive, and foreign banks want a go-ahead from well-known international consultants. Yet cheaper local technicians can do the job," she said. The EPA served mainly to put a prestigious label on the project, thus attracting foreign creditors, Cizkova said. The American agency also brought in new working principles. "The Czechs have been used to throwing money at problems for 40 years. The whole idea of risk prioritization is rather new to them," said Frank Wheeler of Hatch Associates, an engineering and management consulting firm. "When Project Silesia auditors first visited a company, the management would first always give them a shopping list," Wheeler explained. There was little attempt to assess the best destination for the limited funds. The question is now whether Project Silesia's specific proposals, expected later this year, will be heeded.
