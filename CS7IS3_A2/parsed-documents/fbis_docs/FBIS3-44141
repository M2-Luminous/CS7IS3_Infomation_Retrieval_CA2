The ADI, headed by Gabriel Costa, who is currently President Miguel Trovoada's adviser for legal and political affairs, had earlier participated in the 1992 municipal elections as an "independent group" and won in the Cantagalo district, south of the Sao Tome island. Cantagalo is an "area of influence" of the head of state. Mr. Costa's participation was challenged at the Supreme Court by the ruling the party, the Party of Democratic Convergence (PCD-GR) whose arguments were rejected by the Supreme Court. The People's Alliance was formed in Lisbon and its supporters are mainly Sao Tome immigrants in Portugal, as well as children of Portuguese nationals of Sao Tomean origin who left the archipelago at its independence in 1975. The AP is headed by Carlos Espirito Santo, who is currently living in Portugal. Multiparty politics was introduced in 1990. So far, the country has four political parties, three of which are presented in parliament.
