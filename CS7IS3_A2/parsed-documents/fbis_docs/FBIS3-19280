According to reports, Ocalan declared that the PKK is prepared to accept any formula for a dialogue with Ankara that aims at finding a peaceful political solution to the Kurdish issue, provided a general amnesty is issued to all PKK members and there is a recognition of the Kurdish identity in Turkey. He called on international and European organizations, such as the European Parliament, the European Union, and the United Nations, to play a mediation role and supervise the dialogue for a peaceful solution to the Kurdish issue. It is worth noting that Turkish Government officials have turned down this peaceful overture.
