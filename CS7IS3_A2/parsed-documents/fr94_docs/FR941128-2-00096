FR941128-2-00096 FR941128-2-00048 GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Information Collection Activities Under Office of Management and Budget Review agency: Office of Acquisition Policy, GSA. summary: The GSA hereby gives notice under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 that it is requesting the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to approve an extension for the information collection for Multiple Award Schedule Policy Statements (MAS)_Discount Schedule and Marketing Data (DSMD). Extension is requested through October 31, 1995. DSMD sheets are used to collect data about certain sales, discounts, and marketing. The data are used to determine the commerciality of items offered, set the Government's negotiation objective, and determine price reasonableness. The extension is necessary because recent enactment of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act is likely to have a significant impact on the conduct of Federal procurement especially those aspects relating to the acquisition of commercial items. The MAS Program, which is intended specifically for the acquisition of commercial items, will be affected by the legislation. However, specific impacts cannot be determined until the Federal Acquisition Regulation is revised to implement the new statute. Current plans call for those revisions to be effected during April, 1995. It is emphasized that this extension is an interim measure. Given the likelihood of significant changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation in the near future, the Agency has determined that it would be inappropriate to make any long term decision on the DSMD at this time. After regulations have been promulgated to implement the new statute, GSA will evaluate the impact on the MAS program and take action as appropriate. addresses: Send comments to Ed Springer, GSA Desk Officer, Room 3235, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, and to Mary L.
