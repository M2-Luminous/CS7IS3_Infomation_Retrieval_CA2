Ye Xuanping pointed out that at every important moment of the party's history when the party faces a major task, there is always an upsurge of study to review past work experience and correctly understand the situation and tasks. He urged the CPPCC to unify their thinking with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and successfully push CPPCC work forward. Ye Xuanping said: It is necessary to study CPPCC work and at the same time acquire a correct understanding of China's national conditions. Only by correctly understanding our national condition can the CPPCC find its place, successfully carry out its responsibilities, bring its strong points into play, and make its due contributions. He continued: The topics for research and discussion should be selective. They should have theoretical depth and at the same time provide guidance to CPPCC work. He said: It is necessary to implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend" in theoretical research and discussion, and everyone should be able to freely air their views so as to achieve unity in understanding and raise their standards to serve for the country's central task.
