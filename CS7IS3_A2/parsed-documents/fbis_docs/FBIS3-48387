Kim, 59, is wanted in South Korea for questioning in connection with irregularities in the Yulgok military buildup project. He fled to the United States shortly after authorities started to investigate people involved in the Yulgok project. Informed sources said that Kim submitted an application for permanent residentship in early December at a local office of the U.S. immigration and naturalization service through his lawyer. Details are not known, the sources said. There is a possibility that Kim is seeking permanent residency in the United States to avoid criminal prosecution in Seoul as his visa is expected to run out before a new president takes office. An official at the Korean Embassy said that although there were rumors that Kim was seeking political asylum in the United States, the reports were "exaggerated." "He is not qualified for political asylum since he is a criminal suspect in the Yulgok military project," the official said, requesting anonymity. The official said he could not confirm that Kim had applied for permanent U.S. residentship, but he may be allowed to live in the United States, depending on his qualifications.
