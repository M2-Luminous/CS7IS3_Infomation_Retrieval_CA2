FR940110-1-00118 FR940110-1-00013 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Highway Administration 49 CFR Parts 391, 392, and 396 [FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;93&hyph;32] RIN 2125&hyph;AD28 Removal of Obsolete and Redundant Regulations and Appendices AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: The FHWA is proposing to remove obsolete and redundant regulations and appendices from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). In addition, the FHWA is proposing minor technical changes in an effort to keep the FMCSRs current. The removal of obsolete and redundant regulations and appendices is one of the first actions taken by the FHWA following the Agency's Zero Base Regulatory Review public outreach sessions. The deletion of these regulations should result in the reduction of the paperwork burden on the industry without any reduction in safety benefits. DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written, signed comments to FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;93&hyph;32, room 4232, HCC&hyph;10, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. All comments received will be available for examination at the above address from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except legal Federal holidays. Those desiring notification of receipt of comments must include a self-addressed, stamped postcard. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. William Blount, Office of Motor Carrier Standards, (202) 366&hyph;4009, or Mr. Charles E. Medalen, Office of Chief Counsel, (202) 366&hyph;1354, Federal Highway Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except legal Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The primary focus of the FHWA's Motor Carrier Safety Program is to reduce commercial motor vehicle (CMV) accidents and the attendant fatalities, injuries, and property losses. To remain effective, regulations must reflect trends in State regulatory practices as well as technical and operational changes in the motor carrier industry. The motor carrier safety regulations were initially promulgated and enforced by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1937. In 1967 the Department of Transportation (DOT) was created by the Department of Transportation Act of 1966, (Pub. L. 89&hyph;670, 80 Stat. 931) and the regulatory and enforcement authority for motor carrier safety was transferred to the DOT. Today this authority is vested in the FHWA. Over the years, the FMCSRs have been modified incrementally, usually by addition of new provisions and often because of congressional mandates. Some sections, however, no longer correspond to current practices in the motor carrier industry, and others have been superseded by State or local initiatives. In September 1992, the Federal Highway Administration began a comprehensive multi-year effort to re-create a body of safety rules and regulations that are (1) understandable, (2) enforceable, (3) capable of being implemented by industry, and above all, (4) consistent with highway safety. The effort has been termed ``Zero Base Regulatory Review.'' The review will not edit the current regulations, but will start with the basic questions of who, what, and how do we regulate and what is essential to improve motor carrier safety. Concurrent with the Zero Base effort, the FHWA participated in a governmentwide review of regulations designed to identify regulations that were no longer required or unnecessarily hindered economic growth. The FHWA's proposed deletions were incorporated into an NPRM published by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) on May 20, 1992 (57 FR 21362). On December 22, 1992, the OST published a final rule but declined to take final action on the FHWA proposals. 57 FR 60725. Docket comments submitted in response to the May 20 NPRM, and other comments received in conjunction with the FHWA's Zero Base review effort, were evaluated by the FHWA in preparing the current NPRM. The FHWA has identified several requirements that are obsolete or redundant, i.e., which are repeated by State law or covered in another part of the FMCSRs or which could be reissued as non-regulatory guidance. Discussion Criteria Used for Regulation Review The objectives of the FHWA's regulatory review were to (1) eliminate requirements not needed to carry out the regulatory program; (2) ensure that rules are clear and succinct; (3) reduce lengthy and excessively detailed regulations whenever possible; (4) eliminate redundancy; (5) eliminate excessive reporting requirements; and (6) reduce or eliminate paperwork burdens wherever possible, without compromising safety. Section-by-Section Analysis Part 391_Qualifications of Drivers The primary function of part 391 is to ensure that operators of CMVs meet minimum physical standards and possess the knowledge, skills, and abilities to operate CMVs safely. The FHWA has reviewed the regulations in part 391 and has determined that all requirements pertaining to the written examination and record of violations are unnecessary, for the reasons set forth below.
