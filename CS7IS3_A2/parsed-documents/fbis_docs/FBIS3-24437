The present catastrophic situation in Russia and in the space of the former USSR naturally placed this argument at the center of endless discussions on the centuries-old Russian question: "What is to be done?" And it seems that it is already not so much these discussions as it is life itself that answers this question unambiguously: It is necessary with any measures, right up to extreme ones, to save the economy, and to restore and to develop production at a high tempo, which alone can now extricate the country from the slough of monstrous inflation. This crying voice of real life is heard by all, but in very different ways. And this does not at all depend on the extent of common sense, professionalism, and people's civic responsibility, but rather on their specific vital interests, which are determined by social position and social inclination. And, according to the letter of scientific truth, the ideology of different social forces and a policy that corresponds to it express these interests in a concentrated way. At all times those tendencies and processes dominate the economy in any country that responds most of all to the interests of the social stratum or class that has a decisive influence on the character of state authority and, consequently, on its policy. Of course, all of this is political science prescriptions. But, unfortunately, through the efforts of certain interested social circles during the years of perestroyka and reforms, such a chaos of ideas and categories was created that people now have difficulty distinguishing red from white and brown, and left from right. As for the usual "isms," they are anathematized and even declared nonexistent in the modern life of humanity. Meanwhile, the "civilized world," which is dear to the heart of our perestroyka supporters and reformers, persistently calls its society capitalistic (but the main thing is it considers it to be capitalistic), ignoring the lamentation of our Marxist-Leninists that somewhere just "over the hill" genuine socialism is blossoming. But God will be their judge. But this is not what the question is now. It is about something else--about the correlation of political and economic concerns of our Russian authorities. Only a blind person may not see that they are working most of all on problems of self-reinforcement. This is its highest and truly vital priority today. The economy as such and the distress of the people is of interest to them only to the extent they do not prevent them from concentrating efforts precisely on this priority. But its reliable guarantee consists first of all on a rapid expansion of social support of the authorities in the form of important entrepreneurs and numerous small and average knights of profit who will staunchly defend their just acquired "beautiful life" and a government that opens the way for them to such a life. Hence, the destructive pace and scales of privatization of the economy of the country, and hence the almost unlimited scope for the purchase and sale of all and everything for the enrichment of the leaders of the excessively growing bureaucratic apparatus. But, of course, in trying to entrench themselves forever, the current Russian authorities are trying in every possible way to develop friendship with the "fraternal" West. Reliance on its assistance and defense is so great that these authorities did not and will not spare the price. But the price here is well-known--economic and every other kind of dependence on it for a "reviving Russia." While perfecting the priceless moral-political support of the "civilized world," vividly and opportunely demonstrated by it in the tragic days of September-October 1993, the Russian powers that be are trying to impede the objectively necessary transformation of the CIS into a real union of states in every way possible, for such a prospect is interpreted in the West as "the worst nightmare of all possible nightmares" in this world, with the exception of a nuclear war. The proposals of Kazakhstan in the spirit of this prospect have long ago and openly been ignored by Moscow, and the decisive integrational initiative of Belarus was met with hostility by those influential figures who did everything to bury the idea of an "all-Union ruble space"; that is, to destroy one of the most important economic prerequisites for a political reintegration of the former Union republics. In the light of the aforementioned understanding of the priorities of today's ruling elite, at the very least the endless reproaches directed at it on the part of our multicolored opposition look naive in that it, this elite, was formed out of loonies and professionally incompetent people. The most urgent task of our reformers is to achieve the irreversibility of social processes in Russia and to bring it into the club of "democratic" states at any price. Only a bourgeois Russia can be brought into this club, but it is not entirely mandatory that it be independent and prosperous and, what is more, strong and possessing a powerful defense potential. With these kinds of parameters, Russia is not wanted in this club. And when "Russian opposition to its majesty" in the person of Skokov complains about the fact that "there has really not been any real reformation as such" and that, he said, as a result of the spontaneous process there has been some kind of restructuring of economic management "that still has not led to anything intelligible," then the impression is created that it will be difficult to free it, this opposition, from professional economic blindness. Does it really not see that the reforms, of which there did not seem to be any, changed the socioeconomic essence of Russian society and the state system of Russia in a radical way? There also were the kind that in their results were equivalent to a revolution or a counterrevolution. And now the whole problem is only whether the social upheaval in Russia will turn out to be bourgeois-nationalistic or openly colonial-comprador in the final analysis. It appears that Yuriy Skokov and his like-thinkers in the Federation of Commodity Producers they head were hoping for the first variant. But then he, in private, should more carefully weigh the real reasons for his dismissal from key posts in the government. If this variant would be necessary to those circles that now determine the domestic and foreign policy of the country, then it cannot be ruled out that he specifically, Skokov, would be sitting now in the chair of the prime minister, devoting all of his official time to the restoration and development of commodity production and the creation of hothouse conditions for an industrial bourgeoisie, and not for a more quickly maturing trade-money lending bourgeoisie. But he is not sitting in this chair, inasmuch as the political elite of the country does not now stand in need of patrons from the commodity producers. Generally speaking, the need for workers of such an orientation and such an economic mentality may not even surface in Russia in the foreseeable future. A majority of them are not capable of building a colonial-comprador model of the economy, a model which, as the most likely, shines through everything that is being done and is occurring in politics, in society, and in the economy of the country, and also in its relations with the near and far abroad. A genuinely creative stage in the development of the economy of Russia can arrive only when the question of authority, that is, the most important political question of contemporary Russian life, is finally and reliably resolved either in favor of the national-patriotic strata of the rapidly forming bourgeoisie, which, out of necessity, will push aside from the state helm the pioneers of bourgeois restoration who are too closely tied to the West, or in favor of the supporters of a socialist orientation who are now capable in an incomparably greater measure than before to combine it with the priority of national-state interests. (In the latter case, it is a question actually of the Chinese variant of implementing the socialist choice on the path of development of a market economy.) The appeals of the government and of the multifaceted opposition for reconciliation no matter what happens--and history indicates the nature of these appeals with the political amnesty in February of this year--undoubtedly make considerable social sense at the present time, when there is yet another regrouping of sociopolitical forces in the country. But the contradictions in society that were created by perestroyka and reforms are too deep for these appeals to play a substantial role in maintaining political stability in the country in the long term. Without significant adjustments in the positions of the government in the spirit of national-patriotic demands, or without a really meaningful personnel renewal of the authority structures in the very same spirit, social accord in Russia will be unthinkable. Any programs, even the most effective ones for getting the country out of the crisis, will hang in the air, if they run counter to the interests of strengthening the positions of the present authorities, to its sociopolitical objectives, and to its already insurmountable engagement with the West. Consequently, in the near foreseeable term, the main line of struggle for the revival of a powerful and prosperous Russian state, as previously, will lie in the political and by no means in the economic sphere. And the endless claims of officials and of the mass media close to the authorities that the people are tired of politics are called on precisely to disorient Russians with respect to the location of this main line.
