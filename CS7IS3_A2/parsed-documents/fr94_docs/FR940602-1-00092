FR940602-1-00092 FR940602-1-00014 The Agency would also like to solicit comments on ways to incorporate environmental justice concerns into the RCRA corrective action program. The OSWER Environmental Justice draft task force report recommends that the Agency examine the current priority-setting method for the cleanup of RCRA corrective action sites to determine whether this system adequately addresses environmental justice concerns. The task force has also recommended that environmental justice policy governing cleanup actions at RCRA corrective action facilities be consistent with the policy implemented under the Superfund program. The Agency would like to receive responses to these proposals as well as additional options under the RCRA corrective action program. a.2. The relationship of today's rule with Indian Policy. Currently, EPA has the responsibility for ensuring the implementation of the Subtitle C hazardous waste program on Indian lands. This includes the issuance of hazardous waste permits. However, consistent with EPA's Indian Policy of 1984, the Agency will look directly to, and work with, Tribal governments in determining the best way to implement these proposed public involvement requirements in Indian country. This Indian policy recognizes the sovereignty of Federally-recognized Tribes and commits EPA to a government-to-government relationship with these Tribes. b. Applicability of pre-application meeting. The requirements for the pre-application meeting would pertain only to new permit applications, i.e., the initial permit applications submitted by either new or interim status facilities. Therefore, the proposed pre-application meeting requirements would not affect facilities that are submitting a permit renewal application under §270.51 or applying for a permit modification under §270.42. The additional requirements would not apply to cases where a facility submits a permit renewal application, since information concerning the facility would have been previously available to the public throughout the life of its operation. The facility would have completed the permit process and conducted public involvement activities, usually through the permit modification requirements. For example, the public will have had access to the administrative record for the facility, and the permitting authority already would have developed a mailing list for the facility. Furthermore, EPA is proposing today in §124.32(a) that the permitting authority provide public notice when a renewal application is submitted. This will provide the public an opportunity to further review the state of operations at the facility, and be aware that the previously approved permit is expiring. The current opportunities for public involvement throughout the duration of a facility's permit should be sufficient to keep the public informed of the facility's activities. No change can occur to any permit without the public, at a minimum, being notified (see §270.42 modification procedures). EPA would like to request comments on whether these current opportunities are indeed sufficient, or whether the pre-application meeting requirements should apply to renewal permits. Similarly, EPA does not believe the addition of a pre-application meeting requirement is necessary for requested permit modifications. A facility proposing changes to its permit must apply for a permit modification under §270.42. Existing permit modification requirements have established public involvement procedures that must be followed by the permitting authority and the facility before the final decision. These requirements are comparable to those proposed today for permit applications submitted by new and interim status facilities. For example, significant permit modifications, called class 2 or class 3 modifications, require a public meeting at the initiation of the permit modification process to alert the public to changes the facility is proposing to make. Requiring an additional public meeting would be redundant. EPA conducted a preliminary overview of State regulations containing public involvement requirements that could potentially overlap with today's pre-application requirements. Approximately a dozen States have siting permit regulations that contain public participation requirements, apart from RCRA requirements. The state siting requirements could overlap with the pre-application meeting requirement proposed today. For example, the two permit processes, i.e., for siting and RCRA permits, could share similar public involvement mechanisms. EPA believes that it is important for the facility to host an informal and informational pre-application meeting with the public. This meeting should focus on the operating requirements for the permit, including (1) whether the facility should operate and (2) suggestions on how the facility should operate to protect human health and the environment. The informal atmosphere of the meeting should encourage dialogue between the public and the facility, addressing questions, such as the need for the facility, the proposed facility design, waste management practices, and safety considerations. On the other hand, the public meetings required by State siting regulations are more formal and may be hosted by the State rather than the facility (although state siting regulations differ regarding which party is responsible for conducting the siting meeting). The focus of the siting meeting is also different than a pre-application meeting, usually examining such factors as the physical location of the proposed facility, including local land-use issues, location sensitivity and suitability. In addition, there may be a large gap in time between the public siting meeting (for the dozen states with public involvement siting requirements) and the pre-application meeting. If a significant period of time were to elapse between the siting meeting and the actual commencement of the RCRA permitting process, then the issues raised at the siting meeting may not be fresh in the public's mind, or the public may not have the opportunity to raise new issues or potential solutions until later in the process. Because the goals of each meeting are typically different, i.e., a decision for whether a new facility is located at a particular site versus a decision on whether a facility should operate and how a facility could operate to protect human health and the environment, EPA is not proposing today to allow siting meetings to automatically substitute for the pre-application meeting. Some of the same issues may come up in either public meeting; however, this should not deter the public from providing input at both meetings. Of course, if a State's requirements for siting meetings meet the goal of today's proposal for a facility-led pre-application meeting, particularly in terms of opening a dialogue between the applicant and the community, then they would probably fulfill authorization requirements. In this case, the State would not have to require separate pre-application meetings. Refer to Section V, State Authority, of this preamble for further information on flexibility within the State authorization process.
