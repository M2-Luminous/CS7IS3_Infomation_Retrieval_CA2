By this decision, the court satisfied the suit against the regional election commission filed by a former candidate of the same constituency, head of the Moscow anti-trust committee, Doctor of Economics, Professor Oleg Novikov. In an interview with Interfax, Novikov said his action was caused by "numerous gross violations" of the regulations for the election of deputies to the State Duma approved by the Russian president. In particular, the candidate withdrawn by the election bloc "Yabloko" in favor of Novikov was not crossed out of the ballot paper. In its materials handed over to the mass media, the election commission described Novikov, who was nominated as an independent candidate and canvassed about 6,000 signatures in his support, as a candidate of "Russia's Choice." In addition, the commission failed to provide all candidates with equal access to television so that they could lay down their programs. According to Novikov, he was not even given a 10-minute televised statement envisioned by the election regulations. According to Russia's legislation, the court decision may be appealed against within a period of 10 days. Otherwise, it will be automatically enforced.
