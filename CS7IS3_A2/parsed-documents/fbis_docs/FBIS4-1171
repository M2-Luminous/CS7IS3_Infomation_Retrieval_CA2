The Arusha meeting between Rwandan Armed Forces and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has not yet started. The RPF has declared a unilateral cease-fire, which is to begin at 2100 on Monday [25 April]. The RPF is setting certain conditions. The second RPF Vice President Denis Polisi was interviewed by Muriel Pomponne: [Begin recording] [Polisi] This cease-fire can only begin when Rwandan soldiers and the militias of the MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development] and the CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] stop the killing of civilians. Either these soldiers and these militias stop the massacres themselves, or if they do not, I believe that the RPF, having a moral obligation to defend the Rwandans, will defend them. [Pomponne] Are you telling us that the announcement of this cease-fire is not certain? [Polisi] The cease-fire? We declared it in all sincerity. The other party must now accept the condition.
