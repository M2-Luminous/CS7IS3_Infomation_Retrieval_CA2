S.-IAEA North Korea Invites IAEA for Refueling, Sues for U.S. Talks North Korea Invites IAEA for Refueling, Sues for U.S. Talks SUMMARY Continuing its strategy of minimal accommodation, Pyongyang has invited the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to make limited observations of the refueling of the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon. At the same time, seeking to engage Washington in direct negotiations while circumventing Seoul on issues involving the security of the Korean peninsula, Pyongyang has proposed DPRK-U.S. talks on replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace accord. END SUMMARY In the first public acknowledgment of its invitation to the IAEA- - reported earlier in non-DPRK media (Yonhap, 21 April)--a Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on 27 April declared that "technical requirements" are compelling Pyongyang to replace nuclear fuel "soon" at the Yongbyon "experimental power station" (Pyongyang radio, 27 April). However, the spokesman made it clear that IAEA inspectors will be allowed only to "observe" the refueling process and to engage in related activities needed to "verify" non-diversion of the spent fuel. Specifically, the spokesman said, the inspectors will not be allowed ''sampling and other inspection activities" that have apparently been requested by the agency. He warned that if Washington and the IAEA Secretariat--the two entities the spokesman again accused of attempting to "crush" the DPRK--"rudely demand" such activities, which fall outside the province of ensuring "continuity of safeguards," it will lead to an unspecified "irrevocable complex situation." Pressing for bilateral nuclear talks with Washington, the spokesman said that any additional activities could be discussed at future DPRK-U.S. talks. Apparently as a further incentive for Washington to hold bilateral talks, the spokesman suggested that additional inspections requested by the IAEA following what the agency contended was an incomplete inspection of the reprocessing plant in March could also be accommodated The spokesman said that Pyongyang is "studying" this question "in close relation to the attitude of the United States and the IAEA Secretariat." Peace Accord The spokesman's pitch for bilateral talks with Washington on the nuclear issue was followed by a North Korean proposal for an apparently separate set of DPRK-U.S. talks on the broad issue of security on the peninsula. A 28 April Foreign Ministry statement--a vehicle a notch above a spokesman's statement in authority--formally proposed negotiations with Washington to seek a peace accord to replace the Armistice Agreement (Pyongyang radio, 28 April). Clearly seeking to distinguish the new initiative from old--and long discredited- -proposals for a DPRK-U.S. peace treaty, the carefully worded proposal called for "a new arrangement of peace." Uncompromising in tone, it went to great lengths to argue that the United States has in fact "completely destroyed and abandoned" the Armistice Agreement with a long history of violations, including introduction of prohibited new weapons in the South that culminated in the deployment of Patriot missiles. The statement reiterated Pyongyang's objection to the naming of a South Korean general to head the UN side of the Military Armistice Commission (MAC), an act that the statement claimed had rendered the commission "a structure with no proprietor, a name with no substance." Background The new proposal seems to be a step backward from the North-South nonaggression pact of 1991. In signing that accord, Pyongyang had agreed to treat the question of the 1953 armistice accord as an inter-Korean issue, abandoning its long- held position that the issue of replacing the armistice accord with a peace treaty should be resolved between Pyongyang and Washington, because the South was not a signatory to the accord. As recently as 29 March, Pyongyang had repeated its claim of recent weeks that the South, by virtue of a series of "provocative" actions, including the deployment of Patriot missiles, has "unilaterally nullified" the 1991 inter-Korean agreement (KCNA). Implications The 27 April Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement is consistent with Pyongyang's persistent attempt to engage Washington in nuclear talks. Pyongyang's transparent attempt to undermine the authority of the ROK government on the Armistice Agreement issue, as evident in the 28 Foreign Ministry statement, seems aimed--at least in part--at displaying contempt for the ROK government, which had recently yielded to the North and decided not to press for the exchange of special envoys. It is not clear why Pyongyang chose to resuscitate a discredited proposal at this time, thereby risking the possibility of complicating nuclear negotiations. (AUTHOR: YIM.
