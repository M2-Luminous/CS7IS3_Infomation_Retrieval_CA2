Saiget: "Emphasis on Stability Suggests Slower Pace of Reform"] [Text] Beijing, March 22 KYODO -- The National People's Congress (NPC) ended a two-week session Tuesday [22 March] with the Communist Party leadership calling for the thorough implementation of its central policies while noting the importance of maintaining social stability. This year's session, which many political analysts see as one of the most lackluster in recent memory, gave its routine approval to Premier Li Peng's work report which heralded the market-economic reforms adopted by a high-level party plenum last November. However the NPC's call for "the correct handling of the relationship between reform, development and stability" has apparently become the motto for what is likely to be a painstakingly slow reform process, analysts said. Zhou Zhengqing, a vice governor of the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, at a NPC-sponsored press conference last week gave an advance hint of this by saying banking reform would proceed in tandem with enterprise modernization and that these reforms would not occur "overnight." Despite the much-talked-about plan to divide policy and commercial functions in the five specialized banks, Dai Xianglong, also a vice governor of the central bank, said that loans to the loss-making state enterprise sector, a major area of policy concern, would make up 85 percent of national bank loans in 1994. Such a high percentage of policy loans would make it difficult for the banks to divide and establish commercial policies, "capable of being responsible for their own risks," analysts say. According to Chinese news reports in 1993, the loss-making state sector received up to 75 percent of all bank loans and fixed-asset investment while accounting for only 42 percent of the country's gross industrial value. Yang Qixian, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which ended its two-week annual session Sunday, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE he felt it would take at least until the year 2000 before state-run enterprises could be called truly modernized. According to Yang, vice president of the research institute on China's market economy, total assets of China's state enterprises amount to nearly 3 trillion yuan (about 350 billion dollars), while they owe banks nearly 2 trillion yuan, or up to 70 percent of their value. Dai refused to confirm the numbers, but a report by the State Economic and Trade Commission which surveyed state enterprises in 16 major cities found that such enterprises were in aggregate debt to the tune of 319.5 billion yuan, while their total assets only stood at 447.1 billion yuan. Yang put some of the debt burden on social costs, saying that between 20 to 30 percent of the work force at state enterprises were redundant while up to 20 percent of the people on state enterprise payrolls were actually retired. Fast-paced enterprise reform would lead to widespread layoffs, Yang said, so the reforms must go slowly and the enterprises must continue to depend on central bank loans if social stability is to be maintained. Besides the state sector, the government also must worry about the over 800 million rural workers, restless for a better life and already descending on cities looking for jobs with better pay. Yang said the government is depending on the service and private sectors of the economy to develop in such a way as to absorb excess labor from both the state and rural sectors of the economy. He called on the further establishment of a share-holding system at state enterprises and the sale and bankruptcy of enterprises deemed incapable of surviving without government aid.
