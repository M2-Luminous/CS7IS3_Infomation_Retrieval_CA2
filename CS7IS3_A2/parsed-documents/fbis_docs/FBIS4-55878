According to Macedonian radio, this was an unofficial visit, during which President Gligorov accepted an invitation to visit Albania officially in the near future. The two presidents held talks in private for half an hour and were later joined by their aides. After the talks, Gligorov and Berisha gave statements describing the talks as positive, which, though unofficial, enabled an exchange of opinions on all questions of interest to both states. Both presidents said that a great deal of mutual understanding was shown during the talks and that they agreed to resume dialogue. According to the Albanian president, they agreed to establish a Tirana-Skopje air link and gradually to relax the regime of visas and passports. Albania expressed readiness to provide special facilities for Macedonia to store 1.5 million tonnes of fuel and 1 million tonnes of other commodities in Albanian ports. Berisha expressed satisfaction over the adoption of the Macedonian law on the population census adopted last week and praised the government in Skopje for enabling the FLAKA E VELEZEREMIT daily to be published in Macedonia in Albanian. He also expressed support for the increased television and radio broadcasts in Macedonia in the Albanian language and for the opening of the teacher-training college in Skopje which uses Albanian as one of the official languages. Berisha voiced particular satisfaction over the participation of the ethnic Albanian party--the Party for Democratic Prosperity--in the coalition government. Gligorov stressed the open and friendly atmosphere in today's talks and said that both sides had an obligation to create conditions for ethnic Albanians in Macedonia and ethnic Macedonians in Albania to feel at home. The Macedonian president particularly stressed the importance of future population censuses, which would soon give precise figures on the number of Albanians and Macedonians in both countries. After the talks the two presidents and their wives briefly visited Ohrid and, according to Macedonian radio, took leave of each other with satisfaction.
