What typifies the current state of the defense complex? First and foremost, powerful shifts in the structure of production and conversion. The share of civilian products produced by defense enterprises has doubled over the last two or three years, and is almost 80 percent of their production today. The amounts of financing of orders for the delivery of arms have meanwhile decreased by almost nine times over 1992-93, and for military NIOKR [scientific research and experimental design] by more than eight times. Defense orders are today providing for the utilization of only 10--15 percent of specialized production capacity as a result. The small quantities of arms and military hardware being ordered are making their production economically disadvantageous. A real threat has arisen of the impossibility of the renewal, where necessary, of the production of some models of arms and military hardware, as well as the loss of a number of promising technologies. An outflow of skilled personnel (about two million people) from the defense sectors is underway owing to the sharp cutbacks in military orders, worsened financial state of the enterprises and the low wage levels (they are roughly 1.6 times lower than for the national economy as a whole), and enterprises are beginning to refuse defense production. A critical situation has taken shape where not only the defense security of the country, but its economic security as well, are threatened. Goskomoboronprom, taking this situation into account, has developed a conceptual framework for an industrial policy in the defense complex, and is implementing a program of actions to stabilize the situation in the defense sectors of industry. The following priorities have been delineated: --the creation of unsurpassable scientific work in progress, and the development and production of technically advanced and highly efficient systems and models of arms and military hardware; --the integration of military and civilian production, with an orientation toward the widespread utilization of dual-use technologies; --the formation of mobilization capacity and reserves based on contemporary principles; --the restoration and expansion of cooperative ties with the defense complexes of the CIS member nations, and improvement of interaction with the regions of Russia. The realization of 14 dedicated conversion programs has begun in accordance with the State Program of Conversion for 1993-95 that was adopted by the government. The work, including major NIOKR projects, is focused on such priority areas as transport and communications, the fuel-and-power complex, agriculture and the consumer market, medicine and ecology. The first results have been achieved in the reconfiguration of defense product lines for the output of civilian products. The defense complex demonstrated new types of such products at fairs at Nizhnyy Novgorod, Vladimir, Irkutsk and at an exhibition in Tula. Production volumes are also being increased. Tens of thousands of new jobs have been created. The impact could have been far more substantial if credits for conversion had been issued in the needed amounts and in a timely manner. The minimally necessary financing for the most important civilian types of NIOKR was able to be arranged after a long delay. An opportunity has appeared today of planning the innovation process with great confidence--first and foremost research and development on priority civilian topics, which was disastrously lacking in 1991-92. Goskomoboronprom is counting on the fact that industrial policy in the defense sectors will be pursued with the proper state support and budgetary financing for the research and development of dual-use (multisector) applications, as well as those types of NIOKR that are "breakthrough" types against the background of world scientific and technical development or are "critical" from the point of view of ensuring the defensive capabilities and economic security of the country. Goskomoboronprom is working today to clarify these key areas so as to provide for the most efficient utilization of the NIIs [scientific-research institutes] and KBs [design bureaus], as well as to manage the scientific and technical potential that is available in the defense sectors as efficiently as possible. One main area of economic reform is institutional transformation, which includes the conversion of ownership, privatization, the reform of state enterprises and organizations, support for entrepreneurship and the development of a market infrastructure, the demonopolization of the economy and the formation of a competitive environment, the development of a financial market, and the improvement of legislation. These transformations also fully affect the defense sectors of industry as well. Goskomoboronprom consistently carried out the state privatization program in 1992-92. Shares of stock in more than 500 state enterprises were planned to be sold by the end of 1993. The conversion of more than 1,000 enterprises in the defense complex--that is, more than 60 percent of the overall number of enterprises in the defense sectors of industry--was predicted in 1994. The State Privatization Program envisages the existence of a "core," consisting of 449 enterprises in the defense complex, where changes in the form of ownership would not be expedient. The specific sector features of the privatization of enterprises and organizations in the defense complex and the basic directions for improving the methods of privatizing them are reflected in the Edict of the President of Russia "Specific Features of Privatization and Additional Measures of State Regulation of the Activity of Enterprises in the Defense Sectors of Industry" (No. 1267, 19 August 1993). Goskomoboronprom, in accordance with a decree of the Russian government on a plan of actions for the realization of economic reform, is assisting the organization of joint-stock companies and financial-industrial groups in the defense sectors. The Vympel international joint-stock company, the Energiya NPO [Scientific-Production Association] imeni Academician S.P. Korolev Russian holding company and the Arsenal holding company (St. Petersburg), among a number of others, have already been created. A new form of interaction of Goskomoboronprom with the joint-stock companies being created, in the form of equal agreements between it and those companies regardless of their organizational and legal forms, has been devised in the process of issuing shares of stock in the enterprises and organizations of the defense sectors of industry. The enterprises of Goskomoboronprom can independently make far from all items without cooperative deliveries from the CIS countries, even though 80 percent of the capacity for the output of the most important types of products (first and foremost arms and military hardware) remained on the territory of Russia. The range of borrowed constituent items exceeds many thousands therein. It would seem preferable not to waste trillions of rubles on the sweeping transfer of the production of those items to Russia, but rather to restore the necessary ties with the CIS enterprises. Goskomoboronprom is devoting the most steadfast attention to this. Sixteen agreements and a resolution for cooperation with the corresponding bodies of those states were signed in 1993, and twelve intergovernmental agreements were prepared. Intergovernmental agreements are being prepared for signing on cooperation, the specialization of the defense enterprises and the list of mutual deliveries of constituent items. There is another acute problem as well--the mobilization preparation of enterprises and organizations in the defense sectors is still conducted according to outmoded targets. The necessity of cutting back the number of customer requisitions that tie up significant production floor space and equipment for the volumes of deliveries of arms and military hardware during emergency periods has become acute with the adoption of the military doctrine. All of this has naturally had an effect on the work results for 1993, when defense enterprises continued to work under conditions of the complex and multilevel process that is the sweeping conversion of military production. The unsurmounted consequences of the deep cutbacks in the production of arms that was undertaken in 1992 also had an effect. This largely explains the decline of 17.2 percent in the volume of industrial production in November of 1993 compared to the corresponding period for 1992, and of 18.3 percent from the start of 1993 through November compared to the same period for 1992. The defense enterprises that possess unique personnel and production potential, essentially a national treasure of the country, are actively seeking their place in the market economy. Goskomoboronprom is striving persistently in this regard to achieve an expansion of the capabilities of the enterprises and organizations in the realm of the export of products and services, as a condition for ensuring market competitiveness and obtaining additional funds for the structural restructuring of industrial enterprises and science. A conceptual framework for the development of the armed forces and a program for equipping them for the future--an arms program that is balanced with regard to the economic capabilities of the country and ensures its defensive capability and security--will have to be developed and approved with a regard for the provisions of the country's military doctrine. Clarity must be achieved in defense orders, along with their financing for at least two or three years ahead. A stable defense budget and indexing of defense appropriations suitable to the increase in expenditures are needed. A legislative basis in the realm of military-economic planning, along with the legislative codification of the status of the defense order and the status and rights of enterprises taking part in the fulfillment of the state order for the needs of defense, are necessary. The placement of defense orders should be by contract (aside from those cases stipulated by anti-monopoly legislation), which will rule out the forcing of an unprofitable order on an enterprise. The contract for the fulfillment of the defense order should unconditionally be advantageous for the enterprise, both through the establishment of a contract price and through the granting of certain tax, export-import or other concessions, which should also be legislatively codified. Any discrimination according to the forms of ownership should be impermissible with regard to the status of the enterprises taking part in the fulfillment of the defense order. The Law on Conversion--adopted but effectively not in force--is in need of a profound reworking in this regard, and it should envisage real compensatory guarantees for the cancellation or withdrawal of a defense order, including compensation for spending to refit production, the creation of jobs in the civilian sphere, the retraining of personnel, social assistance for laid-off workers and support for the regions most affected by conversion. A state program adopted at the federal level is necessary to support the structural re-orientation of the defense industry, to include direct financing for the creation of new jobs, assistance to regions, targeted subsidies for specific conversion programs, tax concessions for the enterprises being converted and social assistance. The enterprises in the defense complex have experienced a very difficult two years of very rapid conversion against a background of economic crisis and political instability. They have every opportunity not only to survive, but also to develop under market conditions. Assistance for that is therefore a most important task facing federal bodies and the new parliament. The state of the greater portion of the enterprises and organizations in the defense complex remains a difficult one, of course, and much could be said about that for a long time. Only one thing must be emphasized. The enterprises of the defense complex, albeit with great difficulty, are adapting to the new conditions nonetheless. This is finding support on the part of the government and other state administrative structures. The assurance of the steady operation of the defense complex under today's difficult conditions is considered to be one of the defining tasks in the cause of the country's security and the effectiveness of the functioning of the economy as a whole. The consideration of this issue by the Security Council of the Russian Federation testifies to the particular attention toward the situation. The President has issued edicts on the specific features of the privatization of enterprises in the defense sectors and the stabilization of the situation of enterprises and organizations in the defense complex along with measures to provide for state orders. These edicts envisage, in particular, changes in the fixed levels of profitability of various types of products and a doubling of the threshold level of expenses for wages, and regulate advance payments for work under state orders. A session of the presidium of the government was also held, and introduced clarity into the defense orders for 1994. The conversion programs, in light of the requirements of Edict No. 1850 of the President of the Russian Federation of 6 November 1993, should be reviewed in the near future proceeding from their economic efficiency. The shutdown of programs that have not justified themselves, the finding of additional opportunities for the financing of programs through local sources, the funds of enterprises and commercial structures and the provision of more profound substantiation of sales markets and the market competitiveness of products being created are what they have in mind therein. The defense enterprises, with their specific nature, are an inseparable part of the overall industrial complex of the regions. It is namely for that reason that Goskomoboronprom proceeds in its industrial policy from the unity of its sector and regional aspects, and from the necessity of ensuring full accounting and balance of both federal and regional or local goals and interests. The realization of these edicts of the President of the Russian Federation and the governmental decrees, along with the implementation of the basic guidelines that have been set forth and the provisions of the conceptual framework for industrial policy in the defense complex that have been devised, should facilitate the curtailment of crisis development, an increase in the controllability of this sector of the economy and the stabilization of its production activity.
