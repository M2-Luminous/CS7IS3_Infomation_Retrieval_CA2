The same sources believe the positive developments were triggered by the meeting of the U.S., Russian and E.U. foreign ministers and U.N. representatives in Geneva on May 13. The participants in the meeting called on the warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina to cease all hostilities and urged a negotiated settlement of the Bosnian war and gradual lifting of the sanctions against Yugoslavia imposed in late May of 1992. The latest statement by the Security Council president for the first time makes no reference to the Bosnian Serbs alone, but treats all warring sides equally, diplomats in Belgrade said. Furthermore, Butrus-Ghali made the first explicit reference to the lifting of the anti-Yugoslav sanctions, without making it conditional on a final and lasting settlement of the Bosnian crisis, they added. U.S. President Bill Clinton's statement that Washington's unilateral exemption of Bosnian Muslims from a U.N. embargo on arms deliveries to all of former Yugoslavia would kill the peace process fits perfectly into the latest positive developments. Bearing all that in mind, the impression is that some changes have nevertheless been made in the international community regarding its stands on the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is especially true of Europe, which is obviously in a hurry to close the `Bosnian file' before the infinitely more dangerous `Crimean file' has been opened. The positive developments would first be tested in the French town of Talloires, where the international `contact group' for Bosnia-Herzegovina on Thursday started a second round of talks with the Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats. There are some indications that the talks are progressing fine, which has also been confirmed by Speaker of the Bosnian Serb parliament Momcilo Krajisnik. There are also indications that Bosnian Muslims and Croats are willing to accept an internationally-brokered plan according to which they would get 51 per cent and the republic of Srpska 49 per cent of Bosnia's territory. The Muslim and Croat representatives first demanded 58 per cent of the territory for their binational federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
