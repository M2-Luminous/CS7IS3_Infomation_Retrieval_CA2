Once again it involved Russian deputies and once again it was "in connection with their emigration from the republic." This time some very well-known people are leaving Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan]. They include A. Yezhov, who had headed the major "Yuzhpolimetall" Association, V. Sergeyev, chief physician at the Osh Oblast Hospital.... President A. Akayev often says that the main reasons for emigration by the nonnative population are economic. That is probably so. But this clearly does not apply to V. Sergeyev, much less to A. Yezhov. The session, of course, did not hear from them or go into the reasons for their departure. It simply rubber-stamped the proposed resolution. But in the lobbies this latest emigration gave rise to a lot of discussion. And very heated discussion at that. The fact is that, on the initiative of President A. Akayev himself, a package of documents was recently drawn up aimed at halting this process which has already considerably damaged the young state. It includes proposals on the creation of joint ventures with Russia and interstate investment funds. There are also some draft documents on the full functioning of the Russian language and on a balanced cadre policy. Everything seems correct. But, on the other hand, it is no secret that in real life all non-Kirghiz continue to be pushed out of leading positions and are being discriminated against in commerce and the financial sphere. And here is one last fact. V. Verbkin, deputy leader of the president's press service, has tendered his resignation "in the light of persistent suggestions that I quit." He was one of the last non-Kirghiz on the upper floors of the "White House." He has spent his whole life here, his love for his homeland knows no bounds, and he even has a Kirghiz wife. As far as V. Verbkin's professional qualities are concerned, he was one of the organizers of the president's election campaign. He is rightly considered to be a "walking encyclopedia" on all aspects of the republic's political life. The process of elbowing out non-Kirghiz has already gone so far that, for instance, nobody even attempted to explain to V. Verbkin the reasons for his dismissal. "Let him go..." has been the indifferent comment on the decision.
