The secretary of the General People's Comvittee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation asserted that since the holding of the 10th summit conference in Jakarta in 1992, the world has been witnessing quick and successive developments and changes with long terms effects on international relations on both regional and international levels including the non-alignment movement as new economic and political trends emerge requiring our countries to study them thoroughly and take the necessary initiatives to deal with them. He pointed out that the changes which took place in he world did not end or lessen the validity of the fundamental principles and objectives of the movement. He added "the ideal international order as invisaged by the founder fathers of our movement is still far from achieving and that the aspirations of the non-alignment movement countries for real equality, genuine independence and limited development continue to clash with the forces who have been accustomed to achieve their intentions without any due regard for the opinion and desires of the international community and the U.N resolutions. He said against these challenges and the absence of international balance, the non-alignment movement continue to represent the appropriate framework for the coordination for the policy of its members so as to achieve their aspirations, common action to maintain their sovereign independence and confronting the tendencies of new domination and the imposition of the will of the major powers on the whole world. He added "our movement will not oe able to fulfil its whole role except through the enhancement of its unity, rejection of any attempt to marginalize the role of the movement in international affairs and to work actively to prevent the establishment of a descriminator of international order which would serve only the interest of the northern countries at the expense of the interest of the south. We are required to find the necessary means and ways to maintain the power of impetus within the non-alignment movement so as to fulfil its total role in formulating the new international relations and influence them in a manner commensurate with its size and its political and demographic weight and to contribute towards creating a new multilateral world free from domination and founded on cooperation, justice, equity, equality and respect for the sovereignty of other states. The secretary of the General People's Committe for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation made clear that during the 10th summit of the non-aligned movement, the delegation of the Great Jamahirya was given tpe opportunity to inform the head of states of the latest developments in the despute between herself and the United States of America, Britain and France. He said "my country expressed deep satisfaction towards the stance taken by the movement regarding this dispute as the summit welcomed Libya's acceptance of the Security Council Resolution 731 and requested the concerned parties to refrain from any escalation of the crisis and seek to find a peaceful and just settlement which may safeguard the interest and rights of all parties in accordance with the norms and principles of international law and the U.N. charter. Other organizations took a similar stance and I refer in this respect to the O.A.U. which adopted in its recent summit in Cairo a decision expressing her gratitude to the Libyan initiatives to settle the dispute in a manner which respects the sovereignty of Libya in accordance to internatinal norms and Libya's acceptance of the Security Council Resolution 731 and its request to the U.N Secretary General to set up a [word indistinct] for the implementation of the resolution. Also the heads of state expressed their gratitude to Libya's readiness to cooperate with judicial and legal parties. A similar decision was taken by the Islamic Conference Organization. The secretary added "in this respect I would like to refer the Arab League Resolution No 5373 on 27/3/1994 regarding the trial of the two suspects at the seat of the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The resolution urged the Security Council to take into consideration this new proposal which represents an approriate basis to finding a peaceful eolution which may satisfy all the varties and prevent any escalation of the situation which may highten tension in the region. The Secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation said "and here my country declares once again her acceptance the aforementioned proposal of the League of Arab States as a practical bases to finding a final solution to this dispute which is in our opinion enough to reach a solution if these countries had sicncere intentions and the firm desire for a solution to this issue. He added "we are confident that this conference will support the initiative of the Arab League and urge the Security Council to respond to it. We rely on the efforts and endeavours of the non-aligned movement to convience the concerned countries to accept the proposal of the Arab League and abandon efforts to impose further sanctions which will only add to the suffering to the Libyan Arab people and neighbouring peoples who suffered massive losses as a resultpof the unjust, sanctions of the Secuirty Council resolutions 748 and 883 and the lifting of abroagating of these sanctions. The U.N. is one of the biggest centers for coordinating international which the recent changes are reflected. However the dominatin of a given geographical area in the running of the affairs of the organization with the aim to impose its opinion in various important issues led to a further [word indistinct] of the developing countries spear-headed by the non-alignment movement. This emerged clearly during the debates of the security council on a number of issues. And there are moves which emerged indeed and warn of the desire to take similar measures at the U.N. General Assembly. This shows clearly the danger threatening the democratic character of the U.N. which has [word indistinct] since its establishment, safeguarded by the third world membership and its effective participation in its activities. These recent developments inside the U.N. are similar to the crisis facing the non-aligned movement countries. Our movement, being the biggest international grouping after the U.N., was able in the past thanks to the balanced democratic debates to pave the way for the U.N. to take important political, economic and social resolutions. The secretary asserted "the member states of the movement should make sure to play fundamental role in the formulation in the future U.N. and its restructuring instead of accepting to be on the fringe of events and for the movement to take all effective measures to confront the current challenges. The secretary added "to realize this objective, we have to seek to enhance the U.N. machinery and redirect its activities in an effective manner so that all countries will be able to participate in the process of the decisions taken by the organization and take part effectively in the multilateral diplomacy which the U.N. is considered to be its axis and for us to be able to create a new order founded on freedom, equality, justike, prosperity and the well being of all mankind. The secretary refered once again to the injustice of the so-called veto right within the security council enjoyed by five countries from a total of 184 member states of the U.N. He pointed out "unfortunately this privilage was abused in many circumstances to entrench aggression and terrorizing smaller nations and the application of double standards in dealing with many issues affecting the maintenance of peace and security. He added "in this respect I would like to stress Section 32 the decision of the Jakarta Summit which asserts the need for revising this right in conformity with reforming the U.N. and demand a review of the Security Council membership so as to reflect the increasing number of the U.N membership and help finding fairer and more balanced representation of the U.N. members also I would like to reiterate the report of the miniserial committee on policy submitted to Jakarta Summit stressing the need for effective coordination of the stances of the movement before and after the convening of the General Assembly especially regarding the issues on which the movement took decisions. Furthermore, it is necessary for the decisons taken by the summit and ministerial conferences to reflect their true effect by members of the movement within the security council so as to give it the necessary credibility.
