Doonan] [Text] Durban April 7 SAPA -- Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Vice-Chairman Dikgang Moseneke and Commissioner Glenn McDougall arrived in Port Shepstone on Thursday [7 April] morning on a two-day mission to assess the climate for free and fair elections in kwaZulu/Natal. They immediately met IEC officials at the Port Shepstone sub-regional office, before a planned meeting with local church, community, police and army representatives. IEC Spokesman Glenn McDougall said the two-day tour was a "fact-finding mission to report back to the IEC on the possibility of free and fair elections in kwaZulu/Natal." This comes after a working committee comprising representatives of the IEC, South African and kwaZulu governments concluded that free and fair elections in kwaZulu were impossible. Mr McDougall said the current mission would take IEC officials to the south, north and central regions of Natal to assess where problems were being experienced. "The idea is to see where IEC procedures are working and if not, to find other ways of doing our work," he said. The IEC officials would fly to Empangeni on the north coast on Thursday afternoon, before a trip to Newcastle and Howick in the Midlands. "Operation access" in kwaZulu/Natal would be launched in Howick, to take voter education to all in the region, Mr McDougall said. "We will have fleets of minibuses with loudhailers taking local leaders of different parties to neutral venues where they will be given a chance to speak to residents and where voter education can take place."
