FR940725-1-00064 FR940725-1-00010 Section 23.233␣Directional Stability and Control This proposal would make minor word changes to §23.233(a) to harmonize this section with the corresponding JAR section. Section 23.235␣Operation on Unpaved Surfaces This proposal would revise the heading of §23.235 and delete water operating requirements, which are moved to proposed new §23.237. Section 23.237␣Operation on Water Proposed new §23.237, for operation on water, is essentially the same as the current §23.235(b). Section 23.253␣High Speed Characteristics This proposal would delete the current paragraph (b)(1), since the requirement for piloting strength and skill is covered in §23.141. Section 23.562␣Emergency Landing Dynamic Conditions This proposal would change the one engine inoperative climb reference in §23.562(d) to §23.67(a)(1). Section 23.1325␣Static Pressure System This proposal would revise §23.1325(e) to clarify that the calibration must be conducted in flight, which is standard practice. The text of §23.1325(f) would be removed and the paragraph would be reserved. The text of paragraph (g) would be moved to paragraph (f) in a future rulemaking action. The results of the calibration would be required in the proposed §23.1587. Section 23.1511␣Flap Extended Speed This proposal would delete from §23.1511(a) references to §23.457 because §23.457 is proposed to be deleted from the FAR in a related NPRM on airframes, Notice No. 94&hyph;20 (59 FR 35196, July 8, 1994). Section 23.1521␣Powerplant Limitations This proposal would require, under §23.1521, maximum temperature to be established for takeoff operation and would require an ambient temperature limit for reciprocating engines in airplanes of more than 6,000 pounds. Proposed §23.1521(b)(5) would require the establishment of maximum cylinder head, liquid coolant, and oil temperature limits for takeoff operation without regard to the allowable time. Presently, temperature limits are required only if the takeoff power operation is permitted for more than two minutes. It is appropriate to require operating temperature limitations because most takeoff operations will exceed two minutes. Proposed §23.1521(e) would require an ambient temperature limit for turbine engine-powered airplanes and reciprocating engine-powered airplanes over 6,000 pounds. This change is proposed because these airplanes are subject to WAT limits and it will ensure that airplane engines will cool at the ambient temperature limit. Section 23.1543␣Instrument Markings: General Proposed new §23.1543(c) would require that all related instruments be calibrated in compatible units. This is considered essential for safe operation. Section 23.1545␣Airspeed Indicator Proposed revisions to §23.1545 would differentiate between WAT limited and non-WAT limited airplanes in §23.1545. Proposed §23.1545(b)(5) would delete any one-engine-inoperative best rate of climb speed marking requirements for WAT limited airplanes. These airplanes would already have scheduled speeds in case of an engine failure. Proposed paragraph (b)(5) would apply only to non-WAT airplanes for which the one-engine-inoperative best rate of climb speed marking has been simplified to sea level at maximum weight. Since the blue arc rule was promulgated in Amendment No. 23&hyph;23 (43 FR 50593, October 30, 1978), certification experience has shown that the marking of an arc is unnecessarily complicated. For many airplanes, the arc was so narrow that the arc was a line. Therefore, proposed paragraph (b)(5) would require a blue radial line instead of an arc. Proposed §23.1545(b)(6) would retain the same V MC requirement for non-WAT airplanes and delete any V MC markings for WAT airplanes since WAT airplanes already have scheduled speeds in case of engine failure. Section 23.1553␣Fuel Quantity Indicator This proposal would delete, from §23.1553, the use of an arc to show a quantity of unusable fuel. The proposed rule references the unusable fuel determination and requires only a red radial line, which would provide a clearer indication of fuel quantity for pilots.
