He urged the government to rescind its decision immediately. Nasrallah was addressing a memorial for Hajj 'Abdallah Mi'mah in Al-Laylaki Mosque yesterday. The service was attended by 'Ammar al- Musawi, Hizballah deputy Political Bureau chairman; Deputies Muhammad Ra'd, Muhammad Funaysh, and 'Ali 'Ammar; and some ulema. Nasrallah said: Government officials have repeatedly sought to oppress the media. We even hear dissonant voices today calling for additional controls on the printed media, which thought the publication law protected them from oppression. These voices are also demanding control over printing houses. He added: People in Lebanon feel annoyed and suffocated by this. The government was not wise in making this decision. Indeed, it was opportunistic because it used the political and security situation to pass the plan. Like all forces, trends, and all the Lebanese people, we call on the political authority to rescind this unfair and terrorist measure and to promptly pass the media law. [passage omitted]
