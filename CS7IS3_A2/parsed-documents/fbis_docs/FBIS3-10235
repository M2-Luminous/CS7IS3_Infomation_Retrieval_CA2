The action is part of the process to reincorporate the Socialist Renewal Movement [CRS] into society. At about noon today, the 60 men and women of the People's Militia of Aburra Valley were taken in two helicopters to the camp at Flor del Monte in Sucre where conversations are underway on the demobilization of the CRS. For the time being, these talks have not led to any significant agreement. [Begin unidentified CRS member recording] The CRS is an organization that operates mainly in the cities. Throughout the nation it has 3,000 members, of which only 300 are in arms. That is the part we are going to negotiate with the national government. [end recording] This is the third group of militias that has decided to go to negotiations in Medellin. Two other groups are conducting negotiations with the state in an area close to Medellin. The CRS, leader of these militias in the Aburra Valley, hopes that this example of urban disarmament will result in the release of 200 men who are imprisoned before 3 April when the negotiations conclude.
