In order to find the answer to this question, there are a few things that are clearly taking shape in the world today and that we should take into consideration. There are no barriers today, and radio waves are rapidly moving to every corner of the world. An expert in telecommunications technology spoke about the possibility of receiving more than 160 television channels in Iran that are beamed by three satellites from space. Information and intelligence barriers, too, have been breached and it is very difficult to keep anything a secret. To put it better, there is no such thing as confidential information and if information is kept secret in one society, another society somewhere else may come to know about it. Under such conditions, isolation is tantamount to gradual destruction. Japan has become active in Asia and has extended the hand of friendship to Korea, China, and other countries in East Asia. Why? Many reasons can be listed. While Japan is a member of the G-7, it is also thinking of joining other alliances with its neighbors so that it will not be alone. And even though it is a big economic and technological power, it nevertheless takes into consideration possible dangers in the future. There was a report in THE WASHINGTON POST, which is known to reflect the views of the White House, that: "America's war with Iran is imminent." Referring to remarks by a Pentagon official, the newspaper added: "For some time now, America has been making the necessary preparations for a possible war." The same Pentagon official also referred to America's stance on the expansion of Iran's influence in Muslim countries in Africa and Asia and said: "Iran's influence is so strong that Clinton had to apologize to the Muslims of the world for the few minutes that he met with Salman Rushdie." Their fear is because of the Islamic Republic's influence. If this influence is condensed and gathered into an alliance, will anyone in the world be able to entertain thoughts of a possible war? In forming the alliance, we should not be satisfied with slogans alone. There should be a clear and genuine political strategy. Thoughts and ideas can be put into action only when they conform to the realities of the world today. We can clearly see the sensitivity of the issue when we put the above news item next to the following news item: "The 20th Israeli-American session for military and political coordination in dealing with crises and in fighting terrorism opened in Jerusalem yesterday." Such sessions have been held every two years [as published] since the signing of the strategic agreement between Israel and America in 1983; and various issues such as the dispatching of American materiel, arms control in the Middle East, and stopping Iran's maneuvers are discussed and decisions are adopted. When such political-military processes are taken into consideration, the need to form an alliance in the Middle East becomes more and more obvious. We should look at the past, at the future, and at the coming centuries and adopt a policy that is effective and free from fanaticism, sloganeering, and contradiction. Solitude in the world today means gradual vulnerability.
