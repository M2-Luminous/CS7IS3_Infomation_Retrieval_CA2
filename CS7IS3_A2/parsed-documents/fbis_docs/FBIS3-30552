Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael Rose on Sunday said that analysis had been completed but it was impossible to say which of the warring sides had on Saturday fired a mortar shell on an open air market in Sarajevo, killing 68 people and wounding nearly 200. REUTER said that General Rose had visited the market on Sunday together with UNPROFOR Commander for the former Yugoslavia, Gen. Jean Cot, and civilian head of UNPROFOR Yasushi Akashi to inspect `the mortar crater and surrounding shrapnel holes.' The UNPROFOR officials were accompanied by Sarajevo's Muslim Mayor Muhamed Kresevljakovic and Bosnian Muslim Interior Minister Bakir Alispahic. Akashi was quoted by the AFP as saying there were some suspicions but it could not be said with certainty who was responsible for the tragedy. The Bosnian Serbs on Saturday categorically rejected the Bosnian Muslim accusations that Bosnian Serb troops were responsible for the crime, and it called for an urgent investigation to be carried out by a joint commission of representatives of UNPROFOR, the Bosnian Serb and the Muslim sides. The proposal was turned down by the Muslims. After visiting the market in Sarajevo, Akashi and General Cot went to meet with the Bosnian Muslim presidency, according to the AFP. The two officials are to leave Sarajevo on Sunday afternoon, according to the same source. Representative of the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sergio Mele on Sunday said the evacuation of the wounded had begun. Mele said that U.N. armoured personnel carriers were being used to take the wounded from city hospitals to the airport. He said 58 wounded were expected to be evacuated.
