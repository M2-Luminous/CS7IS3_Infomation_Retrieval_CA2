The delegation is made up of Sandor Lezsak, executive chairman of the governing MDF and the party's deputy chairmen -- Peter Nahimi and Tamas Szabo, who is also Hungarian privatization minister. In an interview with CTK Lezsak said that cooperation between Hungary and Slovakia could not be developed in a confrontational atmosphere. He said the current visit had been prepared for half a year and was taking place at the invitation of the chairman of the Egyutteles (Coexistence) Hungarian minority movement, Miklos Duray, who is also accompanying the delegation. The delegation met with representatives of the Hungarian minority living in the Mezibodrozi region in the morning. Later in the day its members visited Kosice to hold talks with Kosice Mayor Rudolf Bauer who acquainted them with a proposal for the future administrative division of Slovakia drawn up by the Club of Mayors. The proposal envisages the establishment of 16 historical counties. The MDF delegation expressed "sympathy" with the proposal. In the remaining days, the Hungarian guests will visit individual towns in southern Slovakia to meet with representatives of local administration and of political and civic organizations of the Hungarian minority. They are also expected to meet church representatives before travelling home on Sunday.
