If Croatia does the same....[pauses] However it should not use the same things as it has used in the past, such as not observing the Erdut Agreement, then I believe that we shall soon be able to establish all other relations. The next step would involve the demarcation line; therefore, UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] troops will be deployed along the entire border; in those of our villages where UNPROFOR is stationed we will have our police, our authority. Croatian villages will be under Croatian authority. The demarcation line will have a 1 km width. However, UNPROFOR also has the mandate to control 20 km of territory within Croatia, and this is very significant. It is very important that, in addition to the UNPROFOR forces, we also have the involvement of U.S. and Russian diplomacy, which is a guarantee that this agreement will be fully observed. [Koprivica] Since you have mentioned diplomacy, what does the Zagreb agreement mean for the Krajina in an international context? [Martic] It means a lot. The fact that two of the most powerful forces -- the United States and Russia -- are participating in it, constitutes, in a certain way, the recognition of the republic of Serbian Krajina, acceptance of us as a reality, a state with its territory, authorities, and population. What remains is international recognition, and I believe that in the next phase we will be able to achieve this. Therefore, it is no longer the case that we are being treated only as local authorities -- which has been the case in the past -- but as an equal party to a conflict, as in the case of two states.
