This practically means that accreditations will be withdrawn from the AFP and CNN correspondents and they will not be permitted to do any further work from tomorrow, 13 April. "Acreditations will also be withdrawn in the next few days from other foreign media correspondents who have been demonizing the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Serb people for months, and some of them for years," the statement says.
