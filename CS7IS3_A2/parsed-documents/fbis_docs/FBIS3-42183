Why? [Ciller] We have a problem of internal terrorism, and I will neither permit nor tolerate its continuing. We are the only secular democratic state in the Muslim world. We have invested more than 50 years in securing these achievements, and I do not plan to allow those who murder women and children to spoil things for us. [Peri] You have already pointed to the common enemy: Hizballah. [Ciller] Definitely. Hizballah not only threatens Israel's security but also that of Turkey. It is a real problem. I am opposed to terrorism in the name of fundamentalism, and Hizballah operates under that slogan. [Peri] As the prime minister of a Muslim state, did you not have reservations about announcing publicly that you are interested in intelligence, security, and strategic cooperation with Israel? Your neighboring states follow your every word. [Ciller] I do not care. I am very interested in any form of cooperation between us to uproot terrorism by Hizballah and others. I am against anybody who tries to harm stability and quiet. I do not care if they know that Israel and Turkey are cooperating against Hizballah. [Peri] What kind of strategic cooperation are you considering? [Ciller] In intelligence and security, and in any other field in which there can be cooperation between professional and experienced institutions and organizations. [Peri] With your permission, let us try to analyze President al-Asad's possible reaction to your remarks. Israel complains about Syria's aid to Hizballah, and you are now in fact proposing Israeli-Turkish cooperation against Syria. [Ciller] I definitely support the peace process and good relations with Israel. We are interested in assisting in the process. In my view, Syria is a key state in the process. The key to progress in the negotiations lies with al-Asad. That is why we must find a way to make it attractive to him and convince him that real peace pays. The Syrians, however, abet terror in Turkey, and they also bother you. We, for our part, are willing to do anything to encourage Syria to take the path of peace. I get the impression that Israel does not need to be encouraged in this. I suggest bilateral strategic cooperation. With your experience and expertise, it pays us to look for common points and pool our resources. [Peri] I am sure that Tehran is also interested in the plans for Israeli-Turkish intelligence cooperation. You have a large Iranian Embassy here. Have you tried to send out feelers about a dialogue with Israel? [Ciller] I do not believe I or my government should act as an intermediary between Israel and Iran, unless both sides ask for it. [Peri] Do you actually conduct a dialogue with the Iranians in Ankara? Do they not have reservations about the fact that a woman is prime minister? [Ciller] The main thing is that they do not interfere with us. We have 24 ethnic groups in Turkey, and the terrorists murder my citizens in cold blood. I am not prepared to accept such despicable murders. I will tell you something: Before each action, the terrorists make sure they rid the area of journalists so that there will be no witnesses or proof of their deeds. That was the case in southeast Anatolia. They want to take over by force and chip away chunks of Turkey for themselves, and they threaten to murder the women and children of those who hinder them. [Peri] And if you are prevented from selling water to Israel? [Ciller] I tell you: I will do whatever I decide with our water. We have the water sources, and we will sell water to whomever we like. Nobody will decide for me or dictate to me to whom to sell our water. I am not prepared to accept threats. We will sell water to Israel, and we are also prepared for activity with Israeli antiterror experts. [Peri] You are most likely following the reservations our decisionmakers are having about President al-Asad. Israel does not know what he really meant when he said "peace." Do you understand us? [Ciller] Definitely. I believe Syria could have helped in the struggle against terrorism, but it prefers not to. What I have just said is an understatement. I know that you complain about precisely the same thing. The solution will be found when we manage to convince al-Asad that he will be better off without terrorism and that he will lose if he does not cooperate. [passage omitted]
