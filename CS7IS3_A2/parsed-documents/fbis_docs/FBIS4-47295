Vavilov''; UDC 666.1.056:620.197] [Abstract] Studies made concerning protection of optical surfaces against detrimental biological agents, specifically defects caused by fungi, have revealed that conventional volatile fungicides and fungistats do inhibit mold formation on optical glasses, but also either form films of a less transparent condensates on the glass surface or corrode metal parts of the fixtures. A mixture of dimethyl diethoxysilane and antiseptic N- cyclohexyl dichloromaleate in acetone-alcohol solution was proposed in 1985, but later found to be inadequate and also to form a fine-polycrystalline layer rather than a desirable continuous condensate film when exposed to water vapor in the air. While new fungicidal thin coatings are being synthesized, a rational and comprehensive procedure for evaluating their effectiveness is being followed which includes measuring their fungicidal power, spectral characteristics of their optical properties, also their critical contact angle with water and thus their effect on the surface wettability in water. Included are further chemical analysis, mechanical tests, and environmental tests under conditions as severe as a humid subtropical climate. In this way have been and still are being developed bioactive organoelemental compounds for film-forming hydrophobic fungicidal coatings. They must not influence the performance characteristics of an optical device and not corrode its metal parts, they must remain stable during storage at room temperature, must be readily producible and not be a scarce commodity. They must also be ecologically harmless. A technology of producing them in a single process stage has been developed, high-molecular compounds being successfully used for surface modification of optical glasses. Addition of a film-forming YRSiX[.sub]3[/] monomer (Y- Hg,Sn, or substitute atom; R- alkyl group; X- hydrolyzable group) and mercury acetate or organostannosiloxane on top of a film-forming polymer of the polyorganosiloxane elastomer (synthetic caoutchoucs) group will ensure long lasting comprehensive protection, owing to cooperative action and effective hydrophobization. Enrichment caoutchouc with OH-groups prior to its deposition on glass will, moreover, strengthen its adhesion to the optical surface. Tables 2; references 9.
