Various social circles across the municipality should firmly foster the thinking of science and technology being the primary productive force; unite as one; double their efforts; further accelerate the development of high and new technologies; and accelerate the transfer of high and new technological results, the industrialization of high and new technologies, and the construction of new-tech industrial parks and zones in the municipality so as to bring into full play the scientific and technological strong points of the municipality. Participating in the investigation and study activities were Zheng Zhiying, member of the municipal party standing committee and secretary general of the municipal party committee, and responsible comrades from the districts of Nankai and Xiqing. Gao Dezhan and his entourage first looked into the enterprises located in the new-tech industrial park, including Tianjin Land-Seabed Oil-Drilling Equipment and Technology Development Company, Wantong Electronic Machine Company, Dongfang Electronic Development Company, Xinxing Electronic Company, and Tianjin Jinke Electronic Corporation Ltd. They also went deep into the workshops of production and sale departments to learn about the situation in technology, equipment, and the contingent of staff members and workers. They also heard the briefing given by the responsible comrade of the municipal science and technology commission with regard to the situation prevailing in the municipal new-tech industrial park. The present scope and high and new technologies of the municipal new-tech industrial park have achieved rapid development under the correct leadership of the municipal party committee and the municipal people's government and thanks to the support given by the State Science and Technology Commission and various social circles. At the end of March this year, the number of enterprises in the new- tech industrial park reached 1,140, which accommodated 30,000 employees. Total income earned by the enterprises of technology, industry, and trade in the park in 1993 topped the figure of 2.2 billion yuan and showed a 100 percent increase over 1992. The capital construction of the new-tech industrial park has entered the stage of overall-planned development. Construction has been carried out in the four fields of establishing industrial enterprises and the enterprises of bringing their function into play, implementing the state policies, and exerting influence. The park has also deepened its reform in various projects and created a relaxed environment for high-and-new tech enterprises to persistently enforcing the brand-new mechanism. The park's function of turning the high scientific and technological results into productive forces has been steadily enhanced and played a promoting role in industrializing and internationalizing high and new technologies. Over the past few years, the municipal industrial park has accumulated over 1,500 new products of high and new technologies. Of these new products, a large number of key products have reached the advanced standards at home and abroad and begun to enter international markets. During the forum, Gao Dezhan first acknowledged the obvious achievements scored by the municipal new-tech industrial park over the past few years. He pointed out: Tianjin is filled with talented science and technology personnel, has obvious strong points in science and technology, and should take greater steps in having science and technology make the municipality prosperous and strive to do something more worthwhile in this regard. Efforts should be made to bring into full play the municipal strong points in talented personnel, higher educational institutions, the state scientific research institutes, and in policies and industries. We should truly achieve in bringing the municipal scientific research strong points into play and enable the municipal program of industrializing high and new technologies to achieve faster and better progress. Gao Dezhan pointed out: The general demand set by the municipality for scientific and technological work is to accelerate the development of high and new technologies, the transfer of scientific and technological results, the industrialization of high and new technologies, and the construction of new-tech industrial parks and zones. By making full and good use of the conditions and policies granted by the state, the new-tech industrial park should do a good job in the following three aspects: 1) Accelerate the establishment of high-and-new tech enterprises. 2) Apply high and new technologies to rebuilding the out-dated enterprises and provide equal treatment devoid of prejudice to out-dated enterprises as long as they conform to the conditions of high and new technology. It means that we should not only grasp economic growing points but also apply high and new technologies to arming the enterprises based on the existing foundation. This is an important way to make the municipal economy prosperous. 3) Make full use of the laboratories and conditions of higher educational institutions and scientific research institutes throughout the municipality. Gao Dezhan pointed out: In accelerating the construction in the industrial park, we should proceed from reality; create new ideas; and make full use of existing conditions. Meanwhile, efforts should be made to straighten out the managerial systems; to manage what deserves to be managed; and to delegate rights that deserve to be delegated so as to enable various circles to be enthusiastic in development and to make contributions to accelerating the development of such industrial parks and zones by proceeding from the whole situation and taking coordinated action. Gao Dezhan emphatically pointed out: While accelerating the development of the new-tech industrial park, we should also attach great importance on scientific and technological work. We should create new ideas and measures and make a new breakthrough this year to integrate between the task of having science and technology be aimed at production and construction and that of having production and construction rely on science and technology. In particular, we should give priority to the following five key points in turning the scientific and technological results into practical productive forces: 1) High and new technologies should be industrialized; 2) Out-dated enterprises should be reformed with high and new technologies; 3) We should apply high and new technologies to increasing the variety of new products; 4) The technical progress of enterprises should be accelerated, the products' quality should be upgraded, and the cost and consumption of enterprises should be lowered; 5) The practical and advanced technologies of agriculture should be popularized so as to promote agricultural development. Gao Dezhan pointed out: Successfully integrating science and technology with production requires the common efforts made by several circles. The units of production, construction, and management should truly foster their sense of science and technology; upgrade their enthusiasm and initiative in applying the scientific and technological results; and foster the thinking of science and technology that mean funds, time, and benefits. Higher educational institutions and scientific research units should vigorously upgrade the quality of their scientific and technological results, increase the applied benefits of them, and do a good job in rendering services. We must integrate the appraisal of scientific research units with their practical results. As for those that have scored benefits in applying the scientific research results, we should give them a handsome reward if they deserve commendation. As for those who have long failed to turn out research results and whose results have not been applied for a long time, we should adopt measures to handle them. The departments of government and those in charge of the work should enhance macro readjustment and control, study the methods of encouragement and support, and give encouragement in policies to the applied scientific research results. Government departments, departments in charge of the work, as well as higher educational institutions and scientific research units should commonly make efforts to successfully conduct the work of turning the scientific research results into productive forces, to accelerate the program of having science and technology make the municipality prosperous, and to again create a splendid image of Tianjin.
