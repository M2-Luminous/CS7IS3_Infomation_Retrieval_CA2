The newspaper points out that the Ministry of Inner Affairs of Macedonia hasn't any Albanian official and only six of the 430 persons working in the Macedonian customs are Albanians. According to the newspaper, the situation is not better in the organs of jurisprudence. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, too, has no Albanian officials. This ministry organized recently a competition for the admission of new persons who are beginning to work in diplomacy. From four hundred people who participated in the competition, only four were Albanians. Some forty per cent of the population in FYROM are Albanians, although, the authorities of the country are trying to reduce this figure to the minimum saying that only twenty per cent of the population of the republic are Albanians.
