He added that, as a city, Serb Sarajevo was built on Serb areas and that Serbs have a right to it. Thanking everyone who helped Serb Sarajevo preserve freedom and remain Serb, Krajisnik stressed that the struggle is not over yet, and that Serb enemies are still claiming the right to that part of the Serb ethnic territory. Krajisnik repeated that Serbs will not enter any kind of federation with Croats and Muslims, and that they will decide where and with whom to live on the basis of their right to self-determination. "We allow others to do everything we want to do, and if we are to be blamed for that, then we are guilty," Krajisnik said. "Great pressure will be exerted on us to make further concessions. We can negotiate and find a compromise solution, but only so far as this will not threaten the minimum of our national interests. We cannot go below that, and we do not have the right to do that," Krajisnik said. The deputies in the Srpska assembly of the Novo Sarajevo municipality and guests at today's formal session paid tribute to more than 1,200 victims -- half of whom were civilians -- who have fallen in defense of that part of Serb Sarajevo.
