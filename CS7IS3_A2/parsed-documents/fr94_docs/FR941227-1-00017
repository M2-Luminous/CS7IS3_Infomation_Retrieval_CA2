FR941227-1-00017 FR941227-1-00005 Specifically, the amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 would amend question C of Item 17 to add paragraph (5), which would ask the associated person whether the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') has ever imposed a civil money penalty on the associated person, or ordered the associated person to cease and desist from any activity. The new inquiry would require a yes or no response, and if the response is yes, details must be provided, as is currently required for any affirmative response in Item 17. The disclosure of this additional information would correspond to the SEC's expanded administrative and civil enforcement authorities under the Remedies Act. The amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 would also add a definition of ``foreign financial regulatory authority'' to Item 17, and would add this term to question 17.D. Thus, question 17.D would now inquire whether any federal regulatory agency, any state regulatory agency or ``foreign financial regulatory authority'' has ever found the associated person to have: made a false statement or omission or been dishonest, unfair or unethical; been involved in a violation of investment regulations or statutes; been the cause of an investment-related business having its authorization to do business denied, suspended, revoked or restricted; been subject to an order concerning investment-related activity; had its registration or license denied, suspended, or revoked, or otherwise been prevented from associating with an investment-related business, or been disciplined by the restriction of its activities; or had its license as an attorney, accountant or federal contractor suspended. The definition of ``foreign financial regulatory authority'' which would be added to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 is essentially the definition the ISECA added to section 3(a)(52) of the Exchange Act. Questions 17.A and 17.B would be amended to clarify that the inquiries now apply to information related to foreign as well as domestic courts. The amendments would modify Item 5 to reflect the Office of Thrift Supervision as the successor to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Thus, the ``Director, Office of Thrift Supervision'' would now be listed as one of the appropriate regulatory agencies with which the financial institutions may be required to file the form. In light of the technical changes made by the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993 to the definition of ``appropriate regulatory agency'', 7 these amendments would also make corresponding changes to Item 3 of the general instructions for Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4. 7 Pub. L. 103&hyph;202, 107 Stat. 2344 (1993). These amendments would ensure that Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 will provide a more complete description of the associated person's disciplinary history. The amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 would also conform to similar changes made by the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') to Form U&hyph;4 in November, 1991, 8 and by the SEC to Form BD (Uniform Application for Broker-Dealer Registration) in July, 1992. 9 The Treasury was unable to propose amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 at the same time the NASD and SEC made changes to their respective forms since its rulemaking authority under the GSA expired on October 1, 1991, and was not reauthorized until December 17, 1993. 10 8 National Association of Securities Dealers Notice to Members No. 91&hyph;73 (November, 1991). 9 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30958 (July 27, 1992), 57 FR 34028 (July 31, 1992). 10 See supra note 7. If the Department adopts the amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 as proposed, associated persons of financial institutions that are government securities brokers or dealers would need to file amendments to their existing Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 to the extent that any information is inaccurate or incomplete. Associated persons would need to review their current Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 filings to determine whether the forms contain all the information required by these amendments, and if not, the associated person would need to file an amendment to their G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 with the updated information. An appropriate transition period would be provided for associated persons to file any required updates. II. Special Analysis Based on the very limited impact of the proposed amendments, it is the Department's view that the proposed changes to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 are not a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes of Executive Order 12866.
