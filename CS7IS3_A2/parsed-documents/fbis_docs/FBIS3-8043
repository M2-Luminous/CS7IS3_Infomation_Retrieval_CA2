"...surveillance by the State Intelligence Service [ShIK]"... Courageous denunciations in the press, complaints of telephone bugging, the Probati and Ngjela cases with the grim interpellations with Mr. Sigurimi, banished three years ago, at least in one of its functions: the harassment of party opponents, or of critics of reality in general and of the president in particular. Of course, data on what citizens think in private cannot be compiled without an information network. No intelligence service so far has ever worked solely with its permanent staff and without collaborators. During the reform of the ShIK, 90 percent of the former Sigurimi staff were removed from their posts and replaced with new people. However, what has happened to the former secret information network, which had its own invisible threads, its hangers-on, its internal organization, and its autonomous operation? Have these structures been dismantled and their members laid off, or have they simply been left to decay? Where today are the Sigurimi collaborators, the underwater portion of the intelligence iceberg? And -- who are the ShIK's informers? Has a new network been created from scratch, or have old connections been partially maintained? We have reason to believe that the latter is true, when we see today, as in days of yore, certain "curious" individuals at whom people point their fingers as "provocateurs." This intertwining of two networks, this interference of old connections with new, could be very dangerous for Albanian politics, and even for the country's security. The indecisive attitude of parliamentary deputies to the question of the files of former Sigurimi collaborators further muddies the issue. They all say they favor opening the files, especially when they relate to people involved in politics and holding important state offices. However, when the time comes for a decision, such a decision is always postponed for no convincing reasons. There has not even been the kind of broad discussion and debate as took place in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, and elsewhere. It seems that the files will be a blackmail weapon for a long time, and that politicians will unhesitatingly use them against each other. Opening the files would eliminate suspicious, yet there are certain persons who have decided to keep suspicions alive. They need these suspicions in order to attack each other, to denigrate whoever is next in line, to eliminate those who are no longer useful, etc. The latest example has been the fragment of some kind of file that RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE winkled out from who knows where, concerning the deputy Petrit Kalakula, the most recent rebel within the ranks of the Democratic Party. How quietly the Pobrati affair blew over. The ShIK chairman was called to an interpellation in parliament, was asked questions, and that was the end of it. Information on well-known intellectuals had been sought, but the intellectuals made no murmur. Information had been sought on deputies, but they, even ministers, forgot everything after a verbal protest in parliament.... It seems that everything is just a simple show, an ordinary game in which everybody has his own role and is conscious of the roles of the others. Students of political history consider the involvement of secret services in political power games to make the most interesting and mysterious chapters in history books. Such a thing is credible, because there is a moral to it. How moral is the role of the ShIK in Albanian politics?
