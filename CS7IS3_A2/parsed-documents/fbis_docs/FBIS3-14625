The statement says that Algeria, its representation, and consulates are today, more than at any other time, keen to hear the concerns of the Algerian expatriate community. The embassy views the expulsion order by absolute necessity to be a measure which will lead to confusion in peoples' minds. In the same statement, our embassy in Paris renews Algeria's commitment to protect its subjects. It believes it is necessary to recall ties of cooperation and interests between it and those countries close to it. The statement says that any attempt which is likely to lead to the belief that the dignity of citizens could be the subject of a misunderstanding is simply unacceptable. [passage omitted]
