FBIS4-23289 "drafr106_c_94013" FBIS-AFR-94-106 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Justice Minister: Amnesty Unlikely for Hani Killers Justice Minister: Amnesty Unlikely for Hani Killers MB0106180194 Johannesburg THE STAR in English 1 Jun 94 p 1 MB0106180194 Johannesburg THE STAR English BFN [By political correspondent Chris Whitfield] [Text] Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus -- sentenced to death for the assassination of SA Communist Party chief Chris Hani -- are unlikely to qualify for amnesty in terms of new legislation being drafted. Justice Minister Dullah Omar told THE STAR yesterday: "I don't think it should be assumed that the definition (of politically motivated crimes) will cover them." Justice Ministry sources indicated that the new amnesty legislation should be put before Parliament when it begins sitting again on June 20. In terms of the Interim Constitution, the cut-off date for legislation which will free those convicted of or being responsible for politically motivated crimes should be December 6 1993. It is understood midnight on December 5 has been pencilled into the legislation being prepared. Although Hani was assassinated on April 10 last year, Omar's comments appear to confirm that the definition of a "politically motivated crime" will be drafted in such a way that Derby-Lewis and Walus will not qualify. There was no indication whether it will include others involved in notorious cases such as the killing of Amy Biehl and those responsible for various massacres -- such as Boipatong, Bisho and the St James Church slaughters -- before December 5. This week there were indications after talks between President Mandela and CP [Conservative Party] leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg that the right wing could benefit from amnesty for politically related crimes. It was not clear whether this would include the 32 men who allegedly carried out a spate of pre-election bomb attacks as this would require a change to the Interim Constitution by extending the cut-off date, which appears unlikely. After meeting Hartzenberg on Monday, Mandela said the Government would apply the same criteria for amnesty to rightwingers who committed offences of a political nature between October 8 1990 -- the cut-off date in existing legislation -- and December 5 last year. Hartzenberg and Omar are to hold talks on the amnesty issue. Deputy President de Klerk had allegedly seen the draft legislation and approved it.
