FR940224-0-00052 FR940224-0-00006 Note 4: ``CTP'' values are not to be aggregated for ``CE''-combinations (inter)connected by ``Local Area Networks'', Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by software. Note 5: ``CTP'' values must be aggregated for multiple ``CEs'' specially designed to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory-, or multiple memory/``CE''- combinations operating simultaneously utilizing specially designed hardware. This aggregation does not apply to ``assemblies'' controlled by 4A03.d. ``CTP''=TP 1 +C 2 *TP 2 +.␣.␣.+C n *TP n , where the TPs are ordered by value, with TP 1 being the highest, TP 2 being the second highest,␣*␣*␣* and TP n being the lowest. C i is a coefficient determined by the strength of the interconnection between ``CEs'', as follows: For multiple ``CEs'' operating simultaneously and sharing memory: E:GraphicsER24FE94.030 Note 1: When the ``CTP'' calculated by the above method does not exceed 194 Mtops, the following formula may be used to calculate C i : E:GraphicsER24FE94.031 Where m equals the number of ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'' sharing access.
