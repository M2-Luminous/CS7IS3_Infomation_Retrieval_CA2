In this connection, the government will make an official announcement on the issue Tuesday morning after convening a committee to coordinate national unification and security policy. The meeting is chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku, who is also national unification minister. The government will likely urge North Korea to rejoin the IAEA and support international efforts to halt nuclear proliferation, in the judgement that Pyongyang's withdrawal from the agency is a direct refusal of international demands for nuclear transparency. A government official said Pyongyang's announcement of its withdrawal from the IAEA could not be justified for any reason, stressing that "North Korea could not avoid the corresponding disadvantage unless it would abide by its duties as a member of the international community."
