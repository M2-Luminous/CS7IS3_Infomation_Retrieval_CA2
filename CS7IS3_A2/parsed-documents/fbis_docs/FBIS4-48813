It had been thought that President Bakili Muluzi, who leads the United Democratic Front [UDF], would have offered some important cabinet posts to Mr. Chakufwa Chihana's Aford [Alliance for Democracy] party who did not do as well as expected in the polls. But so far all the positions have gone only to Mr. Muluzi's UDF party, but the UDF did not secure a working majority in the elections. So, they will have to form a coalition and it had been widely anticipated that this will be with Aford. Mary Gregory asked Aford's secretary for legal and constitutional affairs, Mr. Bazuka Muhango, how the party felt about the cabinet appointments. [Begin recording] [Muhango] It is very disappointing because the question about the seats we are talking about was something that was to arise after some negotiations for a coalition had been struck. We made certain demands, that is, the team from Aford made certain demands for a coalition participation. It looks like the UDF government was not interested in a coalition arrangement. They only wanted Aford to participate in government. [Gregory] What demands did you make? [Muhango] Well, we did make a demand of eight ministerial seats and we did make preferences taking into account, you know, the real effectiveness of participation in the coalition. [Gregory] Negotiations between Aford and the UDF broke down on Tuesday [24 May]. So, what are you planning to do next? [Muhango] We are assembling over the weekend -- I am talking about Aford now -- in order to reflect on the aftermath of this and a decision will be made when the assembly made up of elected members and the council members of Aford will have to assemble and deliberate on this matter. [Gregory] There are still three seats vacant in the cabinet that haven't been allocated to anybody. So, if you are offered those three seats, will you accept them and will you be happy with just those three? [Muhango] Well, I cannot decide for the council meeting, but obviously if you look at the ministries that are (?to be) filled, they are [words indistinct] type of ministries with very little consequences on governmental performance, and we think that it's really a joke that [words indistinct] reserving them in order to offer them to Aford. It can only show that they were not seriously [words indistinct] in any coalition arrangement with Aford. It would depend on what the council decides, but my personal feeling is that perhaps Aford would not really enter on an arrangement on the basis of that offer. [Gregory] So, what solution do you see to this problem? [Muhango] Well, our view was that given the results of the election the matter would have been resolved by actually getting consultations with all the parties that took part in the election and had some positive results because the split in the vote is such that you really can go across the country and see that each of the major parties have won in one of the regions. So, to avoid the fragmentation of the country, our view is that maybe we should proceed on the basis that we are to reconcile the different sections and regions of the country. Malawi requires to have a kind of a government of national unity, at least for some period. [end recording]
