Certain students reported that five professors managed to escape after breaking a window. The medical students said that the conflict worsened when professors claimed they had been kidnapped. The students denied this. One thousand students are inside the M-4 Building of the USAC Medical School. They cannot leave because the building's two metal doors are locked with several padlocks. The negotiations continue but there as yet is no solution to the student conflict that broke out on 1 March, three weeks after the professors of the USAC Medical School first stopped teaching any classes, the affected students said. This was a report for our listeners. Back to the studios. [Announcer] Thank you very much, Armando Perez. We have a question for you. The Roda family wants to know whether you and Lucia Dubon could look into the status of Dr. Judith Garcia de Roda. I repeat her name, Dr. Judith Garcia de Roda, who is among the professors who is being held. Her family in Zone Seven is worried. Do you know anything about the professors who are currently being held? Go ahead, Armando. [Perez] There was an assembly on 1 March of Medical School students and professors, however, given that no solution was reached, the students occupied the Medical School's M-4 building. So far no one has been allowed inside this building because it is locked. Students and professors are negotiating in an attempt to solve the conflict that started on 1 March. The students reported that five professors managed to escape from the building after breaking a window and about 130 professors are still inside. Negotiations continue and the situation is rather calm. It is expected, however, that there could be a solution to the conflict at a given time, as I said before, because the professors have not taught classes for more than three weeks, and the students decided to adopt this measure, because USAC authorities failed to react to this situation.
