The visit became part of a plan to invigorate trade and economic relations with the former CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] member countries, which the minister announced a long time ago. As Oleg Davydov said in a conversation with a KOMMERSANT correspondent, they succeeded in signing two protocols in the course of negotiations with Deputy Prime Minister of Bulgaria Valentin Karabashev: on trade and economic relations between Bulgaria and Russia for 1994 and on the continuation of cooperation in the area of development of the gas industry (the Yamburg field). Building on the agreements achieved, it is planned that negotiations will be held in January concerning the creation of a free-trade system between Russia and Bulgaria (a special working group was already established during the visit). The "gas" topic was dominant in the course of discussions in Sofia. This is not surprising. A special role is assigned to Bulgaria in Russia's gas exports: It is precisely with the help of Bulgaria's transit gas pipelines that Moscow is planning to expand deliveries of what is now its main exported product to Greece, Macedonia, and Turkey, and in the long run, possibly Yugoslavia. As far as gas deliveries to Bulgaria itself are concerned, they will obviously become possible after the gas received is paid for in construction services provided by the Bulgarians to develop Yamburg (to this day, Bulgaria owes Russia for previous deliveries, and the overall positive balance of settlements in favor of Russia comes to 700 million transferable rubles). Besides, Gazprom representative Yuriy Zaytsev discussed the issue of Russia's participation in the conversion of Bulgarian gas transportation routes to joint-stock operations (this project has long been proposed as a scenario for settlement of the Bulgarian debt). Other results of the negotiations in Bulgaria include the finally reached agreement on effecting mutual transactions in national currencies. If mutual relations with other former CEMA partners develop along these paths, this will certainly help to overcome the current crisis in bilateral relations caused by switching to settlements in freely convertible currencies only. To be sure, the issues of deadlines for the repayment of the debt denominated in transferable rubles and of the payment of the Bulgarian debt to Russian commercial banks denominated in foreign exchange remain unresolved. Negotiations on these issues will be continued on 24 January in Moscow and Sofia. Unlike in Sofia, no breakthrough occurred in Budapest, and yet, according to Mr. Davydov, they still achieved some movement on the issue of debts. The deadline for the payment of the second segment of the Russian debt (totalling $1.6 billion) was resolved in negotiations with Minister of Trade Bela Kadar. The payment of this segment will be effected after 1994, whereas the first segment will be paid through military deliveries in 1993 and 1994. The issue of participation by Russian companies in the construction of a subway in Budapest toward the repayment of the debt was also discussed. This project will be considered in greater detail at a meeting of the intergovernmental Russian-Hungarian commission on 24 January in Moscow. The Hungarian proposal to establish a Hungarian-Russian bank for trade and economic cooperation (with the participation of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) will also be discussed at the meeting. The signing of a protocol for cooperation in 1994 is also scheduled for January. The last four days of the visit were devoted to negotiations with representatives of the German BASF concern. [begin boxed item] Trade and Economic Relations Between Russia and Bulgaria In 1993 commodity trade between Russia and Bulgaria increased on account of Russian exports, amounting to $1.7 billion.
