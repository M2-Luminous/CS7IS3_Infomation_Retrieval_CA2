FR940913-0-00014 FR940913-0-00003 Maturity Requirements (Nectarines) Section 916.356 specifies maturity guides for fresh nectarines in paragraph (a)(1)(i), including Table I, for fruit being inspected and certified as meeting the maturity requirements for ``well matured'' fruit. Such maturity guides (e.g., color chips) are specified in Table I of §916.356 for nectarines. The first interim final rule revised Table I of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of §916.356 for nectarines to add maturity guides for 18 nectarine varieties and to change the maturity guide for two nectarine varieties. The NAC recommended these maturity guide changes for these nectarine varieties based on a continuing review of their individual maturity characteristics, and the identification of the appropriate color chip corresponding to the ``well matured'' level of maturity for such varieties. Size Requirements (Nectarines) Section 916.356 specifies size requirements for fresh nectarines in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(9). The first interim final rule revised §916.356 to establish variety-specific size requirements for seven nectarine varieties that were produced in commercially significant quantities of more than 10,000 packages for the first time during the 1993 season. Paragraph (a)(3) was revised to include the May Kist variety; and paragraph (a)(6) of §916.356 was revised to include the Arctic Rose, Del Rio Rey, Kay Diamond, Late Red Jim, Prima Diamond, and Red Glen varieties. The first interim final rule also revised §916.356 to remove five nectarine varieties from the variety-specific size requirements specified in the section, because less than 5,000 packages of each of these varieties were produced during the 1993 season. Paragraph (a)(4) of that section was revised to remove the Apache and Early May Grande nectarine varieties; and paragraph (a)(6) was revised to remove the Nectarine # 4, Tasty Free, and 9&hyph;86&hyph;04&hyph;87 nectarine varieties. The nectarine varieties removed from the nectarine variety-specific list became subject to the non-listed variety size requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(7), (a)(8), and (a)(9) of §916.356. The first interim final rule also lowered the minimum size requirement for the Zee Grand variety by permitting as many as 88 nectarines to be packed in a lug box rather than 84 nectarines, and as many as 83 nectarines when packed otherwise rather than 75 nectarines. This was accomplished by reassigning that variety to paragraph (a)(4) from paragraph (a)(5) in §916.356. The NAC recommended this change based on a more accurate evaluation of this variety's sizing and maturity characteristics. Further, in §916.356, paragraphs (a)(6)(i) and (a)(9)(i) were revised to permit as many as 84 nectarines to be packed in a No. 22D standard lug box if they are ``well matured'', and paragraphs (a)(6)(ii) and (a)(9)(ii) were revised to permit as many as 75 nectarines in a 16-pound sample if they are ``well matured''. These changes permit late-season nectarine varieties to be shipped to the fresh market at a slightly smaller size than in past seasons, if they meet the higher ``well matured'' maturity standard. The higher maturity standard is important for such smaller size fruit, because it will assure that the smaller fruit is of acceptable maturity and quality to be shipped to the fresh market in the interest of growers, handlers, and consumers. In addition, the first interim final rule changed the minimum size requirements for several varieties of nectarines packed in loose-filled and tight-filled containers by revising the count-size for nectarines specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(3)(ii), (a)(4)(ii), (a)(5)(ii), (a)(7)(ii), and (a)(8)(ii). These size changes correspond to the weight-count changes made in column 2 of both Table I for early-season and mid-season nectarine varieties, and Table 2 for late-season nectarine varieties cited in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of §916.350. The NAC recommended these changes in the minimum size requirements based on a continuing review of the sizing and maturity relationships for these nectarine varieties, and consumer acceptance levels for various sizes of fruit. The first interim final rule was designed to establish minimum size requirements for fresh nectarines consistent with expected crop and market conditions.
