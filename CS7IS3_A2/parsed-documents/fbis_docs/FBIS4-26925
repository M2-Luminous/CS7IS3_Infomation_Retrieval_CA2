The margin between success or failure for Mr Patten's push for greater democracy in Hong Kong narrowed yesterday with independent legislator Eric Li confirming he would support the Liberal Party's alternative amendments. Mr Li, spokesman for the Breakfast Club--a group of 10 conservative independent legislators--said he would give his first preference vote to the Liberal Party package. He stressed he was not speaking on behalf of other non-aligned legislators but admitted there was some "peer group pressure amongst these few legislators who commonly come together". The vote, which will determine Hong Kong's political future and end the two-year-old Sino-British row over electoral reform, now hinges on the decision of a handful of pro-China legislators. If they abstain from voting Mr Patten's package is expected to pass by a narrow vote, with latest estimates predicting Mr Patten has 26 votes of support and 23 against. Legislator Tam Yiu-chung, of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, whose vote is expected to be followed by other pro-China members, gave no clues as to whether he would vote for the Liberals. On Sunday he said he would consider supporting any amendments in line with the Basic Law but last night refused to comment on individual amendments. Legislators said privately yesterday the Liberal Party had a "fifty-fifty" chance of success. "Chris Patten must be shivering in his pants," one legislator said.
