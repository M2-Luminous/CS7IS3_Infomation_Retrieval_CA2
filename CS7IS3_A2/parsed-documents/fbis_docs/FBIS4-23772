In its 10 June verdict, the constitutional chamber said that the National Assembly's 23 April Resolution No. 004AN on the lifting of some deputies's immunity is unconstitutional. This is because it is not in conformity with Article 70, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Constitution as well as Articles 43 and 44 of the National Assembly's rules of procedure. The chamber also said that the way the National Assembly's request was made was in defiance of the Constitution's Articles 79 and 89. It, therefore, declared the resolution null and void.
