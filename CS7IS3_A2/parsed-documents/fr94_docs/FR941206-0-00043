FR941206-0-00043 FR941206-0-00008 Rule 3.03.2(1)(b) (30 CFR 800.40(a)(2)), concerning the content of the public notice which the permittee must advertise when requesting bond release; Rule 3.03.2(2) (30 CFR 800.40(b) (1) and (2)), concerning (1) the determination regarding the probability of future pollution of surface or subsurface water during the Division's evaluation of a bond release request and (2) arrangements with the permittee to allow access to the permit area upon request by any person with an interest in bond release, for the purpose of gathering information relevant to the proceeding. Because these proposed Colorado rules are substantively identical to the corresponding provisions of the Federal regulations, the Director finds that they are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director approves these proposed rules. 2. Rules 1.04(25), 3.02.4(1)(b), and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix), Collateral Bonds a. Rule 1.04(25), Requirements for Cash and Government Bonds Used as Forms of Collateral Bond Colorado proposed to revise the definition of ``collateral bond'' at Rule 1.04(25) to require that (1) cash be deposited in a Federally insured or equivalently protected account and (2) negotiable government bonds be endorsed to the order of the State. The Federal definition of ``collateral bond'' requires (1) at 30 CFR 800.5(b)(1) that cash be deposited in a Federally insured or equivalently protected account and (2) at 30 CFR 800.5(b)(2) that government bonds be endorsed to the order of the regulatory authority. Because the revisions pertaining to cash and government bonds in Colorado's definition of ``collateral bond'' at Rule 1.04(25) are substantively identical to the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.5(b) (1) and (2), the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rule 1.04(25) is no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.5(b). Therefore, the Director approves the revisions pertaining to cash and government bonds as forms of collateral bond at Rule 1.04(25). b. Rules 1.04(25), 3.02.4(1)(b), and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix), Disallowance of the Use of Real Property as a Form of Collateral Bond Colorado proposed to revise the definition of ``collateral bond'' at Rule 1.04(25) and the conditions applicable to collateral bonds at Rules 3.02.4(1)(b) and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix) by deleting language referring to a perfected first-lien security interest in real property located in Colorado. The effect of these deletions is to disallow real property as an allowable form of collateral bond in the Colorado program. The Federal definition of ``collateral bond'' at 30 CFR 800.5(b)(5) provides that a perfected, first-lien security interest in real property, in favor of the regulatory authority, may be used to support a collateral bond. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.21(c) set forth the conditions applicable to the use of real property as collateral bond. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11(b) also provide, however, that State laws and regulations may be more stringent and environmentally protective than the corresponding Federal regulations. In this case, Colorado's proposed deletion, at Rules 1.04(25), 3.02.4(1)(b), and 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix), of the use of real property to support a collateral bond would make these proposed rules more stringent than the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.5(b)(5) and 800.21(c) because Colorado would allow only cash and other financial instruments that have a fairly constant and readily ascertainable value to be used to support a collateral bond.
