He said that there is no new developments from what the Police Department director general has said. Police officers will follow up the case closely in accordance with their preliminary assumption, which is based on the evidence. Further information will be sought. Although preventive measures have been regularly reviewed and implemented, there are still some loopholes, he noted. Commenting on the same incident, Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasathian said the National Security Council has followed up the issue. He admitted that it is fortunate that the explosives were discovered before a serious incident occurred. Regarding this, he believes it will not be difficult to find the culprits. To prevent such an event from happening is difficult, he went on to say. For example, in other countries, despite stringent preventive measures, these sorts of incidents are still possible. On the question of whether stringent measures will be imposed on incoming and outgoing passengers at Bangkok International Airport, Bunchu said officials are prepared to catch the suspects there and he believes the offenders are still in Thailand. Judging from the purposes of the offenders, no Thais are believed to be involved in the operations, but the offenders may have some connection in Thailand.
