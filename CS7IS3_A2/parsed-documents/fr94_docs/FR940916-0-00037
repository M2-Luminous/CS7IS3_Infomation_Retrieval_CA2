ACTION: Interim final rule. SUMMARY: Elsewhere in today's Federal Register EPA has published a direct final rulemaking fully approving revisions to the California State Implementation Plan. The revisions concern Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) Rules 442, Architectural Coatings; 443, Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing; 446, Storage of Petroleum Products; 447, Organic liquid loading, and 452, Can Coating. EPA has also published a proposed rulemaking to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on EPA's action. If a person submits adverse comments on EPA's proposed action within 30 days of publication of the proposed and direct final actions, EPA will withdraw its direct final action and will consider any comments received before taking final action on the State's submittal. Based on the proposed full approval, EPA is making an interim final determination by this action that the State has corrected the deficiency for which a sanctions clock began on March 17, 1993. This action will defer the application of the offset sanction and defer the application of the highway sanction. Although this action is effective upon publication, EPA will take comment. If no comments are received on EPA's proposed approval of the State's submittal, the direct final action published in today's Federal Register will also finalize EPA's determination that the State has corrected the deficiency that started the sanctions clock. If comments are received on EPA's proposed approval and this interim final action, EPA will publish a final action taking into consideration any comments received. DATES: This interim final rule is effective on September 16, 1994. Comments must be received by October 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to: Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.

On May 13, 1991, the State submitted SMAQMD's Rule 442, Architectural Coatings, and Rule 446, Storage of Petroleum Products.

The State subsequently submitted revised rules on March 29, 1994. EPA has taken direct final action on this submittal pursuant to its modified direct final policy set forth at 59 FR 24054 (May 10, 1994). In the rules section of today's Federal Register , EPA has issued a direct final full approval of the State of California's submittal of SMAQMD's Rule 442, Architectural Coatings; Rule 443, Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing; Rule 446, Storage of Petroleum Products; Rule 447, Organic Liquid Loading, and Rule 452, Can Coating.
