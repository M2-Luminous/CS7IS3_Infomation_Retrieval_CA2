The article reports that despite Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi's fury at the Economic Planning Agency's [EPA] 7 January report, entitled "Overwork and Health Hazards," which indirectly criticizes the Labor Ministry's failure to implement adequate measures to reduce working hours, the ministry chose not to protest to the EPA for fear of rekindling a controversy between labor and management on the issue. Suzuki writes that the cornerstone of the Labor Ministry's postwar labor policy is to maintain political neutrality between labor and management, although, admittedly, the labor minister sometimes works behind the scenes to bring about agreement between the two sides during the spring labor offensives. As a result, spring offensives over the years have always agreed on a wage level commensurate to obtaining economic conditions. However, Suzuki observes that under the current coalition government, labor has gained more influence -- for instance, a rule limiting weekly working hours to 46 was passed in December despite protests from management. Moreover, with the present pressing labor issues, such as unemployment and reduced working hours amid the economic recession, the Labor Ministry's stance of complete political neutrality is now being questioned. The ministry is now being asked to exercise leadership in labor issues, which it hesitates to do for fear of provoking the promanagement Liberal Democratic Party.
