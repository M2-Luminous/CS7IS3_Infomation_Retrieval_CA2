The Ukrainian Prime Minister Has Arrived in Moscow, and a Delegation of Simferopol Parliamentarians, in Kiev"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The thesis that a Crimean war would benefit all three sides has become so commonplace that is no longer a subject of discussion. Everybody wants it. Meanwhile "everybody" wants a war of nerves, not a real shooting conflict. It is hardly likely that war is sought by President Meshkov who has long been unable to find a common language with his former associates in the Russian Democratic Congress who now sit in parliament. Furthermore, Crimea's inexperienced president would immediately become hostage to the retired GRU [Main Intelligence Directorate] officers he befriended "incautiously" or such people as newly appointed Internal Affairs Minister General Kuznetov who in his time was piqued by the suggestion that he could fight with Russia but appeared quite capable of fighting Ukraine. Neither is war not needed to Saburov, his Moscow team and generally all Muscovites who have arrived in Simferopol to take part in the reform and therefore in privatization: what kind of reform could there be now? When guns speak, banks are silent.... The Crimean parliament might want war as a collective body but each individual deputy in particular.... The same in Kiev. One can talk about President Kravchuk's wish to aggravate the situation to the limit in order to cancel presidential elections, but if the limit is overstepped, Kravchuk will lose one of his main trumps: the image of a person who could keep Ukraine peaceful after its independence was proclaimed. The Ukrainian government could also lose a great deal in the event of a serious conflict: The Ukrainian political elite does not need a war. Just as, incidentally, the Russian elite: A conflict with Ukraine is not confrontation with Georgia or Moldova; it is hard to calculate not only all the possible military or economic consequences involved here but also the international reaction. Russia and Ukraine in the event of such a conflict run the risk of losing their image as normal members of the international community. After all, whereas in a similar Serbo-Croat conflict in former Yugoslavia there were at least some, even if wild, historical justifications and explanations, here no one will be able to find any. Society itself will not understand or accept this war: Politicians will begin to be viewed simply as regular madmen. This notwithstanding, it cannot but be recognized that the sides stand to gain greatly from a war of nerves, in the course of which it is possible to resolve some separate internal political tasks and demonstrate commitment to principle without an extensive expenditure of efforts or resources. It is only important that those involved in the high-level quarrel understand very well the limits of the boundary that they must not cross no matter what.
