FR940224-2-00030 FR940224-2-00014 Today the Navy faces the necessity of downsizing the fleet to an extent that was not envisioned before the end of the Cold War. Over the next few years a number of major surface combatants, including nuclear powered cruisers, will be removed from service. Some LOS ANGELES Class submarines are scheduled for removal from service. Eventually, the Navy will also need to decommission OHIO Class submarines. These classes of nuclear powered ships were not considered in the 1984 Environmental Impact Statement. The total number of cruiser, OHIO, and LOS ANGELES Class reactor compartments is approximately 100. The purpose of this Environmental Impact Statement will be to assess the potential environmental impact of disposing of defueled reactor compartments from nuclear powered cruisers and the LOS ANGELES and OHIO Class submarines. Preliminary Description of Alternatives 1. Preferred Alternative Because of the common design characteristics of the reactor plants and their reactor compartments, the method currently being used by Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington to dispose of submarine reactor compartments is the preferred alternative for disposal of the defueled cruiser, OHIO and LOS ANGELES Class reactor plants. Briefly, this alternative would involve draining the piping systems, tanks, vessels, and other components to the maximum extent practical, sealing the radioactive systems, removing the reactor compartment and sealing it to provide a high integrity welded steel package, and transporting the package first by barge up the Columbia River and then a short distance over land to the Department of Energy's low level radioactive waste burial grounds at Hanford, Washington. The reactor compartment packages would be placed in a trench, backfilled with earth, and covered by an engineered cap to minimize future water infiltration.
