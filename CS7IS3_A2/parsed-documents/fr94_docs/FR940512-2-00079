FR940512-2-00079 FR940512-2-00052 1. Elimination of ATM processing competition. EPS requires its member banks to purchase ATM processing services from EPS or provide it themselves as intercept processors. 4 The effect of this rule is that small banks, thrifts, and credit unions_banks that cannot economically become intercept processors_are forced to purchase ATM processing from EPS. This rule has foreclosed third party processors from competing for banks' ATM processing business within the MAC regional ATM network. 4 Under MAC's rules, only those banks which have previously been intercept processors can obtain ATM processing from third party processors. EPS's exclusion of third party processor competition from the MAC network has allowed EPS to exact very high profits from small banks, thrifts and credit unions. EPS has done so via two sorts of fees. First , and most directly, EPS charges much more per ATM for ATM processing than third party processors typically charge. Second , EPS increases its own switching volume and revenues by prohibiting third party processing. Where EPS drives a bank's ATMs, every transaction at those ATMs passes through the MAC switch and is charged to the bank as a switched transaction, including those transactions by the bank's own depositors (its ``on-us'' transactions). In contrast, intercept processors and banks that use third party processors do not send on-us transactions to a network switch. If banks could use third party processors, MAC would not process, or collect switch fees, for those on-us transactions. Without third party processors, EPS's switch volume and switch fee revenues are commensurately higher. EPS's switch fees hit hardest those MAC banks with the fewest ATM processing options. EPS banks large enough to be intercept processors escape the EPS charge for ``on-us'' transactions, and only pay MAC switch fees when their depositors use other banks' ATMs. The smaller banks that cannot afford to be intercept processors pay switch fees for a much higher proportion of their depositors' transactions. EPS takes advantage of this by imposing on its membership the steepest switch fee schedule in the industry. 5 The result is that the small banks that are forced_by EPS's third party processing restriction_to send all their ATM transactions to the MAC switch must also pay very high fees for the switching of those transactions. 5 MAC switch fees range from a low of 5¢ (what large member banks with a large number of ATMs and transactions pay) to a high of 25¢ (what the smaller banks with fewer ATMs and transactions_the ones effected by EPS's third party processing restriction_usually must pay). No other major regional ATM network excludes third party processors, and all have much flatter switch fee schedules: e.g. Star, 3.5¢ to 8¢; NYCE, 6¢ to 13¢; Honor, 2¢ to 10¢; Most, 3.5¢ to 14¢; Pulse 6¢; Accel/Exchange, 12¢; Yankee 24, 12¢; and Magic Line, 12¢. ``EFT Switch Fee Slide May Be Nearing Its End,'' Bank Network News (Jan. 27, 1993). 2. Deterrence of entry by competitor regional ATM networks. The complaint alleges that a further anticompetitive effect of the illegal tying arrangement is to maintain EPS's market power in the market for regional ATM network access in the affected states. EPS's third party processor prohibition has insulated the MAC regional ATM network from the competitive influences of third party processors. This subsection gives a history of the MAC network's largely successful efforts to keep competitors out of its core areas, and explains how EPS's current practice of excluding third party processors from the MAC network deters entry today. a. A History of anticompetitive practices. For most of its existence and until 1992, the MAC network explicitly prohibited its bank customers from belonging to other regional ATM networks. MAC combined this practice with a number of strategic purchases of adjacent regional ATM networks. These acquisitions, the prohibition on multiple regional ATM network affiliation, and the third party processor prohibition together proved to be a formidable force for keeping the affected states free from competition. b. Effect of the third party processor prohibition. EPS's third party processing prohibition forces small banks that cannot economically provide their own ATM processing to purchase the service from EPS. Because EPS effectively controls the communications links of their ATMs, these banks cannot connect their ATMs to other regional ATM networks without the assistance_and approval_of EPS. EPS therefore exercises an effective veto over these banks' access to other networks in the affected states, and conversely, other networks' access to these banks. Third party processors, on the other hand, often offer access to several regional ATM networks. If these banks were able to utilize third party processors, other regional networks would be much more likely to seek and obtain their business. EPS's control over access to other regional ATM networks prevents these networks from entering the affected states. 6 6 EPS offers its members``gateways'' through MAC to a few regional ATM networks, but controls the price and terms of this route of access. EPS does not offer gateways to most regional ATM networks operating in areas adjacent to the affected states, which would offer the greatest competition to MAC. Gateways therefore do not remove the entry barrier to regional ATM networks created by EPS's restrictions on third party processing. EPS's exclusion of third party processors also prevents the establishment of new networks. As discussed above, if third party processing were allowed in the affected states, a third party processor could almost instantly form a new network simply by placing a new ``brand'' on the ATMs and cards of its customer banks. The third party processor would then switch these banks' transactions itself. The MAC network would switch transactions in only two cases: (1) When a depositor of a bank connected to the third party processor used an ATM owned by a bank not connected to the third party processor; or (2) when a depositor of a bank not connected to the third party processor used an ATM owned by a bank connected to the third party processor. While EPS excludes third party processors from the MAC network, would-be entrant regional ATM networks are substantially unable to enter. The small banks that wish to join another network (which might offer ATM network access at lower prices) will not be able to do so unless the other network has enough of a presence to provide small banks' depositors with sufficient ubiquity and convenience. The entrant network, of course, cannot achieve the critical mass necessary to attract banks. Accordingly, EPS's third party processing restriction creates what economists call a ``collective action problem,'' and EPS's monopoly persists. C. The Alleged Violations 1. First claim for relief_tying. The actions and policies of EPS described above constitute a tying arrangement that is per se unlawful under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. An unlawful tying arrangement is one in which two separate products are sold together, the seller forces buyers to purchase these products together, the seller has market power in the tying product, and the tying arrangement prevents what would otherwise be a substantial amount of commerce in the tied product. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 112 S.Ct. 2072 (1992); Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2 (1984). The two products in this case are regional ATM network access and ATM processing, which outside of MAC can be, and often are, purchased separately. As described above, however, EPS's practices force banks wishing to obtain membership in MAC, and thereby access to its regional ATM network, to also purchase ATM processing from MAC. Because MAC is the only ubiquitous regional ATM network in the affected states and banks will not forego access to such a network, EPS has market power in this tying product. Evidence gathered in the investigation indicates that there is substantial commerce in the tied product.
