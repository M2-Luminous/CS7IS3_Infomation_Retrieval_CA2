He is now confronting the Drug Police, and he has his own figures and balance. With the following figures Prosecutor General Gustavo De Greiff summarized, point by point, his own balance. [Begin De Greiff recording] Marijuana consumption has skyrocketed, while cocaine and heroin consumption has suddenly increased. What kind of success is this? Not even 10 percent of the drugs that reach the markets or are even meant to reach the international markets are seized. What kind of success is this? The public force in Colombia killed Mr. Rodriguez Gacha, killed Mr. Pablo Escobar, extradited Mr. Ledher, imprisoned several drug traffickers. However, none of these events has led to any variations in the illegal drug market. What kind of success is this? [end recording] De Greiff has used these figures to support once again his proposal for studying the legalization of drugs in Colombia. [Begin De Greiff recording] I am not becoming an advocate for the legalization of drugs. Nonetheless, I believe it is a weapon that will destroy the wealth of drug traffickers. [end recording] Predicting the United States will probably unleash a storm against him as a result of these statements, De Greiff warned that he is ill. [Begin De Greiff recording] I have a strange disease in my spine that does not allow me to bend over before those who are powerful. [end recording]
