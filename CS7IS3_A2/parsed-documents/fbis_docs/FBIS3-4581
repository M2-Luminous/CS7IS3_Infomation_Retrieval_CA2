Hideo Den, a former journalist who was expelled from the United Social Democratic Party (USDP), joined with Masao Kunihiro, formerly of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] to establish it, they said. The group, in the House of Councillors, is called Goken Liberal No Kai (Liberal Group for the Protection of the Constitution). Both Den and Kunihiro had defied orders by their former parties -- members of the ruling coalition -- and voted against a package of political reform legislation that cleared the Diet on January 29. The two, who now sit in the upper house as independents, said the reforms for the House of Representatives, featuring an electoral system of 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional representation seats, will deny voters the chance to support those with minority views. Besides the new group, the lineup in the upper house includes 95 members of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, 71 from the SDPJ, 37 from ruling coalition Shin-Ryokufu-Kai, formed in early February, 24 from Komeito, 11 from the opposition Japanese Communist Party (JCP), five from Niin Club and seven independents.
