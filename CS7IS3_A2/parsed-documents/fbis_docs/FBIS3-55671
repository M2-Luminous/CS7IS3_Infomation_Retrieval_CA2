Meri also said he had "no intention to sign the ruling," the president's spokesman said. The spokesman confirmed reports that the president was going to address the parliament 10 a.m. Tuesday. The president also confirmed the reports that he had talked with the parliament's Deputy Speaker Tunne Kelam on the telephone, but denied having told Kelam that he was going to approve the minister candidates. The president's statement came after the prime minister less than two hours earlier had quoted Kelam as saying that the president had promised to approve all four minister candidates. Kelam conveyed the president's words at a meeting with the ruling coalition MPs at the government and parliament residence at Toompea today, Laar said. The prime minister said the government coalition at the meeting had ruled to offer to the president the possibility to meet all the coalition's MPs at a time and conditions convenient for the president. "I am glad that the problem got a solution. This provides us with the possibility to continue our work confidently and with constructiveness. There are things to learn for all of us in the recent developments. The things that happened show that we have to adopt a number of laws to establish more exactly how things have to proceed. That sparks strike every now and then from contacts between the institutions of the president, the State Court and the chancellor of law unfortunately cannot be avoided in the first year following the adoption of the constitution, since we are a young democracy," Laar said. The prime minister said a constitutional dispute was no sign of the constitution's weakness. "The same provisions also exist in the German constitution, for instance, and our legal system in many aspects is based on that system. In Germany the democratic tradition quite simply is so long that problems like this never come up," Laar said. Ain Saarna, spokesman to the prime minister, said the government was expecting the document from the president and was going to abstain from comment for the time being. The presidential press office in the latest report said Prime Minister Mart Laar on Sunday, Jan. 9 had presented to the president the new ministerial candidates and submitted a new proposal to approve the ministerial nominations. The president is going to make his decision Tuesday and read it to the parliament at 10 a.m. the same day.
