Speaking yesterday to the Gudauta radio Ardzinba said that Abkhazia will never be the part of Georgia. Abkhazia won the war, that's why Abkhazia should determine the conditions at the negotiations. Meanwhile, Aleksandr Kavsadze, Shevardnadze's representative in the conflict zones, told SNARK the war was without the victors and vanquished. He is of the opinion that Ardzinba is being supported by the concrete political forces who are deeply interested in the tension in the region.
