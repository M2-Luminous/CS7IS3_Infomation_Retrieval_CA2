BRAZIL At least five areas of the country, totalling more than 115,000 square kilometers, are experiencing desertification. According to Sao Paulo University Professor Jose Bueno Conti, the most critical areas are in the northeastern part of the country. The largest area, which includes Bahia, Piaui, Ceara, Pernambuco, Alagoas, and Sergipe States, is nearly 100,000 square kilometers, almost two and a half times the area of Rio de Janeiro. The desertification also affects the municipality of Alegrete, in the southern part of Rio Grande do Sul State, the municipality of Paranavai, Parana State, and Roraima State. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 13 Feb 94 p 7) Brazil and the African countries are vying for attention in the international convention on desertification that will be signed in Paris in June. This so-called convention of the poor alludes to those conventions on climate changes and biodiversity agreed on during the Rio 92 environmental conference. The convention on desertification involves international financial aid and technological support. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 6 Mar 94 p 21)
