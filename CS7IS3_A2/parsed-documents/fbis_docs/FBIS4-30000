Of the fatalities, 20 were bandits and six were Marines of the Philippines Armed Forces. The fierce gun battle took place as government troops assaulted the camp of the Abu Sayyaf on top of a hill in Isabela, Basilan. Marine officials said the bandits, who were positioned on the hill, opened fire at the soldiers pinned below. The Marines decided to launch an assault on the Abu Sayyaf camp to free Catholic priest Father Cirilo Nacorda, being held hostage by the bandits. Negotiations for the release of Father Nacorda had broken down. The bandits held on to the priest after killing 15 people earlier this month. They released 57 other hostages last week during the negotiations. Church officials fear that the bandits have already killed Nacorda following the bombardment of the Abu Sayyaf camp. The bandits have threatened to kill the priest if their camp was attacked. In Manila, Armed Forces of the Philippines chief Arturo Enrile gave the Marines 48 hours to capture the Abu Sayyaf camp. Enrile brushed aside criticisms that the military was making an overkill by deploying about 2,000 troops backed by heavy artillery and aerial attack. He said superior force was needed to overcome the advantage of the Abu Sayyaf, who had been well entrenched and were familiar with the rugged terrain.
