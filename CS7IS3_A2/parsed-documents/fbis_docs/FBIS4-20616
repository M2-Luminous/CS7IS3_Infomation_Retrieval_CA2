Horizon's lead battery consists of a glass filament coating woven in a mesh. In such points as durability, recharging time, and running time, it is superior to ordinary lead batteries. The company, in opening its representative office, is searching for business opportunities in Japan, where EV development is moving ahead. For now, Horizon will sell the batteries for EV use but is planning for the future to develop them for large-scale use in power generation. The company's battery consists of layers of glass filament mesh alternating with material permeated with sulfuric acid. The battery's features are that there is no leakage due to vibrations, the material is resistant to corrosion, and the battery requires no adding of water or other maintenance. The recharging rate in rapid recharging is 50 percent in eight minutes and 99 percent in 30 minutes. Moreover, the battery lasts through over 900 rechargings, making it superior to ordinary batteries in cost and durability. In the United States, the company has had an inquiry from Chrysler, which is investigating the possibility of using its battery in electric vehicles. Horizon, judging that there is demand in Japan, where the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has been at the center of planning to popularize electric vehicles, has established a representative office here and decided to contact Japanese car makers. Horizon is a battery manufacturer established in June 1993 as a joint venture between BDM Technologies Inc., a company offering such engineering services as production technology and transportation systems, and Electrosource Inc., a venture firm that develops batteries. Horizon has been engaged in limited production of EV batteries. Moreover, having also been planning licensed production on a global scale, the company has been investigating the possibility of advancing into Japan.
