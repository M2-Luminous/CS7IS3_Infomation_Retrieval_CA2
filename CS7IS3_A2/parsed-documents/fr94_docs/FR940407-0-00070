FR940407-0-00070 FR940407-0-00014 However, today's rules authorize emissions trading between RACT and non-RACT sources at less than the offset ratios if exceptional environmental benefits are otherwise demonstrated, such as, for example, an emissions trade that promoted the market penetration of emissions reduction measures for non-RACT sources, such that future emissions reductions from the universe of non-RACT sources would be expected to increase over time. Such measures could include new vehicle technologies that utilize alternative fuels, provided that such technologies meet all relevant EPA standards and guidelines. Where a lower trading ratio is authorized in order to promote the market penetration of an environmentally-beneficial, new control measure, a lower bound for the trading ratio of 1.1 to 1 will assure that in all events some additional benefit will accrue to the environment. In setting the appropriate ratio for trades between RACT and non-RACT sources, States may also take into account additional State and federally-enforceable emissions reductions that are achieved as a result of other exceptional environmental features of an EIP (such as a separate ``environmental bonus'' provision, as discussed in EPA's Interim Guidance on the Generation of Mobile Source Emissions Reduction Credits). In no case, however, can a trading ratio be lower than 1 to 1, and in no case can the effective trading ratio be less than the appropriate offset ratio (or such ratio, as low as 1.1 to 1.0, as may be authorized to promote the market penetration of environmentally-beneficial, new control measures). Offsets. Credits for emissions reductions generated by stationary, mobile, or area sources may be used for purposes of meeting the offset requirement for major new and modified sources in nonattainment areas so long as they meet the restrictions imposed on offsets by section 173 of the Act and the EPA's new source review regulations (40 CFR 51.165 and part 51, appendix S). Under the nonattainment provisions, new or modified major stationary sources may not receive permits for construction and operation in a nonattainment area unless, among other things, their new emissions are offset by reductions from other sources in the area (section 172(c)(5), 173(a)(1)(A)). For O 3 nonattainment areas, minimum offset ratios range from 1.1 to 1 for marginal areas to 1.5 to 1 for extreme areas (section 182(a)(4), 182(b)(5), 182(c)(10), 182(d)(2), 182(e)(1)). However, the Act does not require that offsets be secured by the new source. Rather, any portion of the necessary offsets may be generated by the local air quality district or by the State. In other words, a jurisdiction may set up an offset ``bank'' to supply new sources with sufficient emissions reductions to satisfy their offset obligations. To satisfy the requirements set forth in section 173, each time a new source commences operations, the jurisdiction must have already generated the necessary emissions reductions to offset the new emissions. This means that the jurisdiction must be able to demonstrate that the program has secured sufficient excess emissions reductions to offset all new emissions at the proper ratio. If the source itself is only held responsible for securing emissions reductions in an amount equal to its new emissions (i.e., a 1 to 1 ratio), the SIP must generate sufficient reductions to cover the extra reductions required (e.g., 1.2 to 1 in serious O 3 nonattainment areas). The Act limits offsets to emission reductions not ``otherwise required by this Act.'' As part of the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,'' the EPA described certain circumstances under which reductions would not be creditable for offset purposes because those reductions are required by other provisions of the Act (57 FR 13498, 13553 (April 16, 1992)). In addition, the EPA intends to provide additional guidance regarding offsets in the near future.
