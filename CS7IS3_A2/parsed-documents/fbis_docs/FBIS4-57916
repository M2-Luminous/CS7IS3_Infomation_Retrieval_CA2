Headed by Francisco Martinez Luzardo, a forestry expert and chemist by profession who holds a doctorate degree in the sciences of the use of residues, the department groups radiochemists, nuclear physicists, and technologists whose interests and research findings are related to the idea of sustainable development. Martinez Luzardo told PRENSA LATINA the department will promote environmental projects with stress placed on their economic feasibility. In addition to conducting a nuclear analysis of the industrial waste and atmospheric pollution, the department seeks to develop and apply technologies to treat residual and natural waters and waters muddied with the waste of contaminating metals, as well as to lower the risks of human error in operating industrial processes, he explained. The researchers discussed the main achievements in using the residues of salt plants, sawmills, and nickel factories and referred to the virtues of the products obtained: additives for fuel, anticorrosive products, purifying resins, and others. At present, the department is conducting a joint program with Rio de Janeiro and Roraima Universities in Brazil on the protection of the environment, specifically on the use of radiotracers [radiotrazadores] to analyze residuals polluted by mercury.
