It appears that more signatures than required have been obtained and that all of the documents still have to be checked. But time is seemingly against this endeavor. Prime Minister, you have proposed 25-26 June as the date of the election. But this means that the elections will have to be officially called on 2 April at the latest. With regard to the demanding nature of the measures that will have to be implemented, this date appears to be virtually unrealistic. Do you still think that elections can take place on this date? [Meciar] Yes, I do. First, Mr. President does not have to wait the whole 30 days. He could speed up his decision. Equally, there is always a chance that the political entities represented in the National Council [of the Slovak Republic] might reach an agreement on holding elections earlier. After all, opposition parties have been calling for early elections the entire year, and now, when they have a chance, they scream that they are not ready. There are two criteria that should be considered. The basic criterion is what is the interest of the state. The interest of the state is to resolve this parliamentary crisis as soon as possible because the economic and social effect of this crisis on citizens and on the state is very serious. If we consider the interest of the state to be a priority issue, nobody should hesitate as to whether elections should or should not be held in June. If, on the other hand, we take into consideration the interests of political parties, the elections will take place as late as possible. We would act irresponsibly toward our state if we were to subordinate the interests of the state to people like Mr. Knazko, the chairman of the Alliance of Democrats, Mr. Cernak, the chairman of the national democratic faction in the Slovak National Party, and former Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac until they have built up their parties. We would act irresponsibly if we were to let the economy and the social sphere be tossed around in uncertainty, if we let the name of our state be questioned abroad. Here we can see a line dividing us from those who apply their past attitude toward the state to current conditions. No matter what the election result, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia will have to lend its support to the interests of the state and to give utmost priority to this interest, while the movement's election results and interests should take second place. Others should do the same thing, and this would then clarify the election date issue. [passage omitted] [Bartisek] I do not think we have reached any significant positive turning point since our last interview, when we agreed that the internal political crisis had deepened in a certain way. The failure to fill two ministerial posts in your Cabinet continues to be alarming and, for the present Slovakia--I will put this openly--it is to a certain degree disadvantageous. You have said that somebody who is good enough to be a deputy prime minister is good enough to be entrusted with the post of a foreign minister. Can you clarify your statement a little? [Meciar] To put it clearly, I would be at fault if my failure to put forward proposals resulted in not having ministerial posts filled. However, in fact, we have to share responsibility also with the person who failed to accept my proposals, without giving any reason for doing so. The fact that President Michal Kovac expressed a lack of confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Prokes, supporter of European integration, whom he had considered acceptable [as a deputy prime minister] and whom he refuses now to consider acceptable as a foreign minister, is a matter of political and ethical dimension. It is not restricted to a legal dimension--the field where the law does not oblige the president to give any reasons for his actions. The selection of a new foreign minister is now being discussed in our talks with other political subjects. The issue is whether, in the period until the elections, the Cabinet should be joined by members of other parties. Talks are under way. We should be clear about the fundamental stance on 7 March. Once we are clear about our stance, we can take further decisions to solve this burning problem. I am alarmed by the fact that, after having a crisis introduced in the parliament, the failure to meet each other halfway on personnel issues is also being introduced in the Cabinet. However, we will not allow this to have an impact on the way the Cabinet functions. This will not happen. The Cabinet functions and works as responsibly as possible. [Bartisek] New candidates should emerge following coalition talks between the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak National Party. [passage omitted] [Meciar] I would wait before drawing any conclusions. There is no doubt that, as far as the privatization post is concerned, the candidate will be generally acceptable. As far as foreign affairs are concerned, I will take into account not only the coalition talks between the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak National Party because one or two other partners are being considered, too. Perhaps the Foreign Affairs Ministry will be the post where we reach an agreement to widen [the range of the Cabinet]. [passage omitted] [Bartisek] Coexistence Chairman Mikulas Duray made a rather important statement addressed to Slovak political parties when he said: Some government coalition statements have created a political configuration that might be described as representing fascism with a human face. This image literally creates fear. Therefore, I would ask you for clarification coming from you as the coalition representative. [Meciar] Mr. Duray should own up to responsibility for his statements. He has already called the government fascist. This is nothing new in his vocabulary. He repeats such statements. Following the first accusation, the authorities began criminal proceedings, but, because he is a deputy of the [former Czechoslovak] Federal Assembly, it is not clear who has the power to strip him of parliamentary immunity. If this is done by the Slovak National Council, it would mean that by doing so they accept all deputies of the Federal Assembly as full members of the representative body. This is why the affair came to a standstill and they have asked the Constitutional Court for interpretation. This is preventing the bodies that are responsible for dealing with such statements and that are drawing conclusions regarding personal responsibility from concluding the matter. Let me present some facts. No one can doubt the fact that the Slovak Republic has been recognized abroad. The signing of the association agreement means the recognition of the Slovak Republic's democratic regime. The fact that we have gained access to the Council of Europe means recognition of our democratic regime. We have joined Partnership for Peace--without the recognition of a democratic regime there is no partnership. We have to stop this self-damaging, self-degrading, and self-destructing carried out by Slovak Republic citizens, regardless of their nationality. Elections have to take place, among other reasons, to give our citizens a chance to tell those who are engaged in this self-destruction, who are tearing our society apart: We have had enough of you; we do not want you anymore; go somewhere else--do not do these things from inside the parliament. This is why I think that a purification through elections will also help regarding this aspect. [passage omitted]
