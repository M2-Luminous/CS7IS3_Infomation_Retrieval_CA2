[Begin Dembri recording] In theory this is an easy option for us. However, when it comes to practice it is necessary to first build the Maghreb bloc up as a strong economic group, a matter which has yet to be achieved. The European Community has had 30 years of experience behind it before it was possible to realize a strong economy and abolish borders between European countries. As far as we are concerned we are still at the beginning; it is necessary for us now to examine all aspects of trade: individual movement and everything else. We have to build the Maghreb house first before one can talk as a bloc with any other bloc in the world. [end recording]
