The planes will fly to the (?Incirlik) air base, and will not carry ammunition on board. They will be used to patrol the no-fly zone in northern Iraq. The Bulgarian Army General Staff finds no reasons to object to the requests, but as a result of a vote by the individual ministers, the government unanimously decided to refer the request to the National Assembly. The National Assembly is also expected to make a decision on another problem submitted by the cabinet. Three hours ago Valentin Karabashev, deputy prime minister and trade minister, submitted his resignation from both his posts. He asked for space to be made on the agenda for him to present his statement. The statement mentions serious differences within the government that have developed since mid-1993 regarding the amendments to the Privatization Act, the military-industrial complex, the energy industry, and the privatization of hotels. The statement also refers to the lack of confidence and the administrational chaos created by the combining of the deputy prime ministers' functions since the fall of 1993. Among the motives pointed out, the statement mentions the prime minister's attempts to circumvent government decisions and to promote his own personal ideas about privatization, and the major attacks in his statement yesterday, which Karabashev regards as unfounded. He considers the assessment of the work of the Trade Ministry as based on intrigues and denunciations. The Alternative Social Liberal Party [ASP] backs Valentin Karabashev's decision and, as the members of its leadership stated, if the decision is made for the ASP to withdraw from the cabinet, they will recommend that Minister Bikov resign as well.
