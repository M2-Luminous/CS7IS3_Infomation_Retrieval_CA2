Addressing hundreds of kwaZulu Police recruits at a graduation ceremony in Ulundi as the homeland's minister of police, Mr Buthelezi said "we may as well brace ourselves for the long and hard road ahead of us". Referring to trilateral talks in Johannesburg on Wednesday night, which delegates said were fruitful, Mr Buthelezi said: "I am not at all optimistic that anything concrete is going to come out of these negotiations." He alleged chief government negotiator Roelf Meyer "virtually told" television audiences after the talks that the interim constitution would not be amended, "or if at all, not substantially to accommodate the concerns of his majesty the king (Goodwill Zwelithini), and also members of the FA". "I am afraid I must state that while I was pleased with the way these talks went, I am very pessimistic about the outcome of these negotiations. We have suffered a lot of blood and tears all these years of oppression, and it may well be that we will not be out of that dark dungeon of suffering even after the elections," Mr Buthelezi said.
