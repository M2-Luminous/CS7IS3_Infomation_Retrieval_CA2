The statement reads in full: The process of a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has recently run up against a grave challenge. The United States has created a momentous crisis that is likely to develop into catastrophe, at this crucial juncture when prospects are in sight for saving the DPRK-USA talks from the current deadlock and striking a package solution to the nuclear issue. As is already known, toward the end of the last year the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States agreed on the immediate future measures aimed at holding a third round of the DPRK-USA talks and reaching a package solution to the nuclear issue, under which the United States will cancel its "Team Spirit" joint military exercises for 1994 and the DPRK will accept inspection of limited scope on its nuclear facilities required to ensure the continuity of the safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Accordingly, it is within the framework of the DPRK-USA agreement and with our extraordinary patience and maximum tolerance that we have so far discussed with the IAEA Secretariat the scope of the inspection intended to provide the continuity of the safeguards. The IAEA Secretariat, however, has deliberately ignored the unique status of the DPRK, which set moratorium on its declared withdrawal from the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and tried stupidly to force full-scope inspections equivalent to the DPRK's de facto return to the treaty, inspections on which the DPRK and the United States could reach an accord at their future talks, instead of the inspection designed for the continuity of the safeguards. The demand for full-scope inspection clearly goes against the spirit of the DPRK-USA agreement and it is absolutely beyond discussion at all at this point of time when the U.S. nuclear threat remains yet to be removed, the IAEA's partiality and injustice remain yet to be redressed -- factors that have triggered off the DPRK's withdrawal from the treaty. This notwithstanding, the United States, a party to the DPRK-USA talks, has never tried to help straighten out the IAEA Secretariat's misconduct but completely reversed the bilateral agreement on the inspection designed exclusively for the continuity of the safeguards and officially urged the DPRK to accept the demand of the IAEA Secretariat for the full-scope inspections. The United States has gone the length of imposing a deadline for this and issued an ultimatum that it will not agree to hold a third round of the DPRK-USA talks but seek "sanctions", unless the DPRK accepts the IAEA's demand. What should be noted seriously is that the United States has again broached the "special inspection" of the DPRK's two military sites, which have no relevance at all to its nuclear activities, and taken the lead in the ruckus for international pressure on the DPRK. This is a shameless perfidy against the other party to the dialogue. All the facts clearly prove that the so far stated U.S. preference for a negotiated resolution of the issue and its busy come-and-go are, in the final analysis, simply a stratagem aimed at devising a pretense for strangling the DPRK and at stalling for time needed to this end. The U.S. machinations of strangling the DPRK have been proven self-evidently by the new war manoeuvres the United States has been pursuing behind the screen of the DPRK-USA talks. In violation of its repeated commitment to the principle of assurances against the threat and use of force, including nuclear weapons, the United States plans to defiantly go ahead with its large-scale nuclear war exercises against the DPRK, including the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises. U.S. officials say that they plan to continue other joint military exercises if they cannot conduct the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises now, and they even say openly that these exercises should be held in Hawaii, if not in South Korea. When we proposed the U.S. cancellation of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises as a major agenda for the DPRK-USA talks, our objective was to eliminate the U.S. nuclear threat against the DPRK once and for all, not just to dename the military exercises. The arrogant U.S. posture for "resolving" the nuclear issue with its nuclear war exercises going on against the other party to the dialogue is a mockery against the DPRK and negation of the dialogue itself. What we cannot overlook is the fact that the U.S. hardline and conservative forces are pressing ahead on a full scale with the deployment of the "Patriot" missiles in South Korea, as part of their attempts to overpower the DPRK militarily. Nobody in the world will believe that the United States has the intention to resolve the issue, as the United States launches smile diplomacy at the negotiating table, as if it were interested in the withdrawal of its nuclear weapons, while frantically engaged in the deployment of its missiles to be trained on the other dialogue party from behind the scenes. This notwithstanding, the U.S. State Department spokesman's sophistry that the deployment of the U.S. missiles can in no way be considered provocative to the DPRK is really the height of impudence. The U.S. reckless new war machinations do not stop here. The U.S. Administration sent the director of the Central Intelligence Agency to South Korea in the early days of the new year for a huddle on the "greater intelligence activities vis-a-vis North Korea," a strong indication of the full-scale stage of the war preparations. It is not difficult now to guess that the United States will move to contrive pretexts for a shift to real military actions. In the light of this, it has become clear to anyone that the IAEA Secretariat has intentionally delayed consultations with the DPRK, until the films and batteries of the surveillance cameras installed at the DPRK's nuclear facilities will have run out, and now begun attempting full-scope inspections in an intriguing manner, and that these moves have been made in pursuit of the calculated stratagem of the United States. All the facts clearly show that the United States has no intention at all to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula peacefully but still remains unchanged as ever in its ulterior objectives to strangle the DPRK by force at any cost. With regard to the current crisis due to the despicable and dangerous actions of perfidy on the part of the United States, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea solemnly declares its position as follows: First, if the United States defiantly goes ahead and reverses the promise it has made to the DPRK, the DPRK will no longer be bound by the promise it has made to the United States. The DPRK's promise to the United States includes all the goodwill measures and commitments it has taken so far unilaterally for the continued DPRK-USA talks and for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue, such as the suspension of the effectuation of its announced withdrawal from the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the freeze of all the nuclear activities, and the declared intention to renounce the graphite-moderated reactor system. Second, if the United States has no intention to hold any further round of talks, the DPRK, too, will have no intention to do so. It will be a gross miscalculation, if the United States considers the DPRK-USA talks as an offering to the DPRK. The DPRK has consistently called for negotiations with the United States since the first days of the origination of the nuclear issue, in order to peacefully resolve the issue, not to seek any benefit from the United States. We have so far lived on our own without any relations with the United States, we can live well on our own in the future, too, and we have become constitutionally adapted to such life. Third, if the United States decides to take other options, we will also take our own countermeasures. In no way does the right of choice belong to big countries only. The U.S. hardliners and conservatives must be held totally responsible for the catastrophic consequences arising therefrom, and the South Korean authorities, indiscreetly following their lead, can never extricate themselves from this responsibility.
