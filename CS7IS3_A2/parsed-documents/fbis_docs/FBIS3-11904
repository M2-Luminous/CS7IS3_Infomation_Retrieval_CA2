This is not a symbolic fact. Robaina, Cuba's foreign minister, is a frontrunner. He speaks in a fresh language and has a very personal style he calls "impromptu diplomacy." Playing with words and exhibiting his permanent good sense of humor, Robaina says he is not a "career diplomat." He was appointed to the post approximately a year ago at a time of very serious economic difficulties in Cuba. Since then he has tested his capabilities, "immediately aware of the importance of a duty by which we open the world's doors to become part of a new international political format, in particular, to tell our truth in our own voice." I followed him through Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, and finally, in what was supposed to be a relaxing interview but what became a maze of ideas by an interlocutor impressively ready for a dialogue. Discussing many matters at the end of his tour through eight Asian countries was the reward he gave me for my tenacious effort to secure an exclusive interview for PRENSA LATINA. Cuba's economic crisis looked to me as the best option for the first question. [Robaina] It is true the situation is still difficult and that it will take big efforts to find adequate solutions to our project, but I am pleased to say the worst is over. The crisis hit rock bottom and we are now in a launch phase. We see the light at the end of the tunnel. We are moving with greater security. [Triana] In this new light, what economic options does the Cuban Government have? [Robaina] A group of measures have been adopted and other measures are being discussed to revitalize the economy without renouncing the fundamental achievements of the Revolution. Openings to foreign investments have developed, our foreign relations have been diversified, and we continue developing, in spite of the huge pressure from the U.S. blockade, which also boycotts every effort Cuba makes to initiate negotiations and pressures those who want to invest in our island. [Triana] Is there any change of attitude in the current U.S. Administration with regard to Cuba? [Robaina] The United States is now using a less aggressive language, but we know that internal mechanisms will keep Washington from changing its attitude toward our country even if it has this intention. Therefore we do not see, for example, any surprise lifting of the embargo. We are prepared to negotiate, as we have often said, on the basis of respect for our independence and sovereignty, and the right our 35-year-old Revolution gave us to speak out. [Triana] Ever since you became foreign minister, you have worked on a very intense diplomatic offensive throughout the world. What is the object of this policy? [Robaina] To explain the truth of our plan, to listen to the economic experiences of many other countries that have had successful results in that field, and to explore all the cooperation possibilities. Latin America and the Caribbean are a priority. This is the setting from which we were removed and the setting we are recovering. We are talking now in terms of a diplomatic offensive because we are tired of sitting on the defendant's bench. [Triana] What does your tour through Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam mean? [Robaina] In this region of the world, there have been significant economic transformations, and we are interested in analyzing and learning from them to apply in Cuba whatever may be applicable. We want to directly report on our openings to foreign investments and announce our aspirations to have mutually beneficial cooperation and exchanges in all possible fields. [Triana] Any comment on your Asian tour? [Robaina] It was successful because we found respect and understanding, unanimous condemnation of the U.S. blockade against Cuba, and the possibilities of economic cooperation. Vietnam deserves special mention. This is a dear country that after going through big sacrifices and challenges was able to build a road to development without renouncing its socialist principles. We applaud what Vietnam is doing and its achievements encourage us tremendously. We also celebrate the end of the economic embargo to which it was unjustly subjected by the United States. We are closely following the Vietnamese process and once again thank this heroic people for their specific solidarity with Cuba and their decision to comply with this year's trade agreement. [Triana] You return to Havana and almost immediately begin another tour through Latin America including Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, after the 22-24 April meeting with representatives of the Cuban community abroad, and this is followed by a tour of Arabian countries. Is it your youth which allows you to tackle so many tasks in a row? [Robaina] Fortunately, in Cuba we work with a group spirit. It is a great responsibility to be foreign minister right now, and success mostly depends on the officials who accompany me. We have a large group that is very well prepared, technically speaking, and personally speaking, since I am young I am compelled to try to represent the new generations as best I can. [Triana] The international media said the call for "The Nation and the Immigrant Community" meeting in Cuba is an audacious step taken by the island's government. What is the purpose of that meeting? [Robaina] We invited Cubans who live in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, the Caribbean, and other places and who are willing to participate in a dialogue with their homeland. We did not invite hysteria or aggressiveness, but some of those who were not invited to the meeting hastened to reject an invitation that was not extended. Our goal is to normalize relations with the Cuban community abroad, as is done by all countries in the world. [Triana] People in Cuba and abroad talk about Robaina's youth. You greatly impressed your Cambodian counterpart, Prince Norodom Sirivuth, during your Far East tour. In Cambodia like in the rest of the countries he visited, the head of Havana's diplomacy made an unusual request for this kind of trip: a bicycle. The Cambodian prince was so enthusiastic that he went an early morning ride through Phnom Penh with the Cuban envoy. "In barely 24 hours, we got to know each other so well that I felt duty bound to visit Havana this year," Sirivuth commented. [Robaina] The most important news in my country is not a young minister, but the essential role young Cubans have in the country's economic, political, and social development. In other words, the place they have earned. As far as I am concerned, my goal is to constantly hold consultations on a wider scale with the people I represent. [Triana] What advise would you give your generation? [Robaina] I do not believe I am in a position to give advise. I believe each generation has to face -- in its place and under its own conditions -- the role it has to play. Nevertheless, if you insist on asking that question, I would tell the young people: The most important thing is not to resign yourself to what has been done. New generations should not settle for what has been done and they should not talk only about history and what was done; they should make their own history, a contemporary history. [Triana] How can you possibly take on so many tasks and still have time for the family? [Robaina] It requires a personal effort to find time during the day so I can, for example, take time in the morning to get my son ready to go to school or to take him bicycle riding on the weekend, and talk with him. My family has its own responsibilities. A housewife's tasks are as difficult as a minister's tasks in Cuba.
