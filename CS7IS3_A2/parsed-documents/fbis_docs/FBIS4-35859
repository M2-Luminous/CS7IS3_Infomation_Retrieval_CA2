Peres said he undertook to allow Palestinian institutions which were in Jerusalem before the signing of the autonomy agreement last September to remain. "The letter does not given any commitment about Palestinian institutions established in the city after the signing," Peres told reporters. He stressed that the new Palestinian self-rule authority would have to set up all its bodies in the autonomous areas of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. The full text would be published later Monday. "It's a letter which has been blown out of proportion," said Peres, who has previously denied the existence of such a missive. A senior foreign ministry official said the letter was sent to his Norwegian counterpart Johan Jorgen Holst last October 13 and it was passed to 'Arafat. Peres wrote that Israel would "refrain from any action which would restrict freedom of religion or restrict access to the holy sites," said the official who refused to be named. "The undertaking concerns those who live in the city and visitors of the holy sites," the official added. The letter clearly opens the way for 'Arafat to pray at the Dome of the Rock, which Moslems consider their third holiest site. Peres also underlined that Jerusalem would be one of the subjects for negotiations when talks on a permanent settlement for the Palestinians start after two years of autonomy. "Israel has always understood the importance and religious significance of Jerusalem for the monotheistic beliefs and will continue to respect the unique value of the city for Jews, Christians and Moslems," Peres wrote. The official said the missive was intended to remain secret but after 'Arafat and other Palestinians alluded to written pledges on Jerusalem the decision was taken to release the contents. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin last month strenuously denied such a letter existed when 'Arafat declared he had received a written undertaking on Jerusalem. "There is no secret agreement. There is no document which has not been published. Everything has been made public," Rabin told parliament on May 12. The right-wing opposition charged he was lying during a bitter debate. On May 30, Rabin appeared to climb down, telling a parliamentary committee: "According to my information, 'Arafat has received only a piece of a speech by Peres on the freedom of religion and access to Moslem holy places in Jerusalem." Amid growing controversy over Jerusalem, which both Israel and the Palestinians claim as capital, Faysal al-Husayni, the PLO leader on the West Bank, confirmed the existence of secret Israeli undertakings. Al-Husayni said: "There is a letter from Israel and the question of Jerusalem and the PLO institutions in the city and on other subjects. I cannot say any more." A close aide to Peres told AFP: "He has committed two errors. First he denied this letter existed when it does exist and he should have published it when it was sent. "At that time no would have paid it any attention." "Now it will pour oil on the flames and the right will use the story against us." Right-wingers are preparing a major campaign to keep 'Arafat out of Jerusalem and intend to throw a human cordon around the city. The PLO leader was expected to visit the autonomous enclave of Jericho in the middle of this month. However at the weekend he suggested further delays unless donor countries came up with money for autonomy. Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordanian rule in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it. In 1980, Israel declared the holy city its united and eternal capital, but foreign countries do not recognize the annexation and maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv.
