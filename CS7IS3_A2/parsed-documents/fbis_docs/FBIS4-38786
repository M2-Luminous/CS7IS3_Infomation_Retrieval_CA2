The session of the Lvov Oblast Council of people's deputies is alarmed by the fact that the current political situation in Ukraine poses a serious threat to the processes of developing the state. The June elections of the president of Ukraine and of local bodies of power, which are to be held under the constitutional crisis, were further exacerbated by the absence of an appropriate legal basis and society's distinct stance with regard to the state structure and the bodies of power. Presuming that the people of Ukraine are the sole and superior representatives of power on Ukraine's territory, the elections should be held only after all citizens-electors and candidates to the elected bodies fully comprehend both the functions and powers of the newly elected administration. Otherwise, such elections will not guarantee the full scope of civil rights, while the electors will become the victims of political fraud and manipulations and guinea pigs for endless exhausting political experiments. Attempts to introduce the federative-oblast territorial structure of the state during the June elections, while no appropriate constitutional basis yet exists, may initiate a broad expansion of separatist processes, a dismembering of Ukraine, and antistate activities, which have recently been vividly demonstrated in Crimea. We, the deputies of the Lvov Oblast Council of People's Deputies, demand that both the elections of the president and of local bodies of power be postponed by the period necessary for the Supreme Council to adopt the law on the structure and powers of administration.
