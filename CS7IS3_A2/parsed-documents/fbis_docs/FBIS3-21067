Inspection of bearings in electric motor drives: After having recorded and evaluated the diagnostic data with the aid of a computer, we submitted the results to the operators with recommendation as to necessary steps to be taken. By repeating the measurements periodically, we monitored the steps taken and their effects. Our software also contained data on the location of machine sets, on the kind of drives, on the operating conditions, on prior disturbances, and on typical worn parts. 2. Generator and motor windings: By measurements made during partial load dumping, we determined the state of the insulation of individual coils. Depending on the results of diagnosis, it was decided whether a new complete winding should be installed or replacement of the damaged coil will suffice. 3. Transformers in industrial plants and electric public-utility networks: In oil-filled and thus high-cost transformers, for instance, electric and thermal anomalies during their still harmless early stage already produce small amounts of noxious gases which dissolve in the insulating oil. Using the appropriate methods, we extracted these gases from the oil and analyzed them by gas chromatography. The examinations were performed systematically, without considering the course of operation, whereupon we evaluated the results using a special computer program. In this way faults were detected already in the initial stage. 4. Switchgear components: Besides mechanical loads also and above all electrical loads can produce weak spots in the insulation, whether under the applied voltage or during fast short events such as switching, ground fault, short circuit, or lightning stroke. Using the appropriate methods and instruments, we have checked the state of the insulation during operation. From the results one can learn not only about just the switchgear alone, however. With a sufficiently sensitive method of diagnosis and with enough experience on hand, it is even possible to extract from the main switchgear of an industrial network ideas about the state of the insulation of equipment operating in substations tied into that network.
