A few moments ago we heard him talking about the deterioration of the situation on the ground today. Now Philippe Gaillard speaks first of all about the successful evacuation of 350 Rwandan orphans to Zaire yesterday. He spoke to Catherine Nina: [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Nina] Mr. Gaillard, the ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] is also working in the rest of the country. What is the current situation? [Gaillard] There is no region, no village, in Rwanda which has escaped the violence. It was known that 220,000 to 250,000 people have fled the southwest of Rwanda to take refuge in Tanzania. The day before yesterday, thanks to remarkable cooperation from the Tanzanian and Rwandan Red Cross, we managed to distribute four days' worth of food, so that they can survive, at least for the next four days. We carried out this distribution in one day, for 220,000 people. That is one thing. Today we are starting to evaluate the situation of the civilian populations in the southeast of Rwanda, the regions of Kibungo, Rusomo, the Tanzanian frontier -- but on the Rwandan side -- because there are all sorts of rumors going round as to the fate of the civilian populations that have stayed inside the country. I think we shall have a reasonably clear picture tomorrow morning, or tomorrow evening at the latest, I think. [Nina] What is the situation in Gitarama? [Gaillard] You know, the Rwandan Government is in Gitarama. There is a huge number of displaced persons in Gitarama. They are mainly people who fled Kigali and who are completely destitute. Yesterday morning I received a formal invitation from the Rwandan Government to transform -- with the agreement of the nuns -- the religious center of Kabgayi, which is the biggest religious center in Rwanda, into an ICRC hospital. I think we shall be able to start on an initial distribution of food to the displaced persons in the regions of Gitarama and Kabgayi at the beginning of next week at the latest. I am not at all optimistic. It seems to me that there is no longer any hope of dialogue, that in spite of international pressure of various kinds it will be extremely difficult to stop this infernal machine which has been set in motion in Rwanda. I don't know if I should say it was 6 April [death of Habyarimana], three and a half years ago, in 1959 [dates of clashes in Rwanda] -- I don't know, it'll be analyzed later -- but it is very recent that the despair has been so great on both sides that they are ready to push the exercise through to the end, and I think we haven't seen the end of the horror.
