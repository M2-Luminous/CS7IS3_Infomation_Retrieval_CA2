"We have no intention of increasing the defence budget in real terms. This should not be taken to mean that we do not take the country's defence requirements seriously but we cannot afford to be irresponsible with our finance," these sources said. Experts were expecting a heavy raise in Pakistan's defence budget this year, after India increased its defence spending by a whooping 29 per cent in its budget for fiscal 1994-95, starting April 1, 1994. "The extraordinary increase by India is basically a strategy to preserve a deterrent. However, unlike India we do not have the kind of resources to give such a massive raise in the defence budget," noted the source. Islamabad has been applying a cut in real terms, that is after discounting inflation, on defence spending for the last three years. In the Federal Budget for fiscal 1993-94, defence spending claimed Rs 89.1 billion [rupees] or about a third of the total budgeted expenditure. This was about two per cent increase over the previous year's revised estimate of Rs 87.4 billion.
