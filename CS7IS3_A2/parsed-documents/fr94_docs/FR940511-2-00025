FR940511-2-00025 FR940511-2-00015 [Docket No.: 920521&hyph;4095] National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program agency: National Institute of Standards and Technology, Commerce. action: Notice of establishment of a Laboratory Accreditation Program (LAP)_NVLAP Calibration Laboratories Accreditation Program. summary: The National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), will accept applications from laboratories seeking accreditation under the Calibration Laboratories Accreditation Program. The program is in accord with the intent of the original request by the National Conference of Standards Laboratories as announced previously in the Federal Register . Due to the large number of anticipated responses to this program, applications will be processed in order of the date received. Accreditation will be offered to all applicant laboratories that fulfill the requirements of the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). for further information contact: Persons desiring to obtain an application package or further information concerning the Calibration Laboratories Accreditation Program should contact the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program by mail at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Building 411, room A162, Gaithersburg, MD 20899; or by telephone (301&hyph;975&hyph;4016) or FAX (301&hyph;926&hyph;2884). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This notice is issued in accordance with NVLAP Procedures (15 CFR part 7). In a Federal Register Notice dated May 18, 1992, (57 FR 21073), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the decision to develop the program, ``Accreditation for Calibration Laboratories,'' requested from the National Conference of Standards Laboratories in a letter dated June 13, 1991, announced in the Federal Register of August 21, 1991, (56 FR 41526). Administrative and general technical criteria have been developed and incorporated into a Procedure and General Requirements Handbook (NIST Handbook 150). A companion draft Calibration Laboratories Technical Guide (NIST Handbook 150&hyph;2) contains amplifying technical information for each of the eight fields of calibration. Technical experts, selected and trained by NVLAP, will use the NIST Handbook 150 and the Technical Handbook to conduct the on-site assessment. They will present their findings to the applicant calibration laboratory at the time of assessment; however, the final evaluation will be made by NVLAP-selected panels. Proficiency testing will be used, along with an on-site assessment, to determine the competence of the applicant calibration laboratories to perform calibrations at the claimed levels of uncertainty. Proficiency testing will be conducted annually in at least one parameter for each field of calibration for which a laboratory applies. An application package consisting of the NIST Handbook 150, Technical Guide, application forms (OMB Control No. 0693&hyph;003) and fee schedule will be provided on request. Fees are charged to laboratories seeking accreditation in two stages. The Stage I fee is standard and is charged to all applicant laboratories. It covers the cost of initial review of the application, quality manual, and related documentation. The Stage II fee is variable, based on the scope of accreditation desired by the applicant laboratory. After the laboratory has successfully fulfilled Stage I, the fees for Stage II will be established to include administrative/technical support, on-site assessment, and proficiency testing costs. NVLAP will publish a directory of all accredited calibration laboratories and the accreditation will be renewable annually. Dated: May 5, 1994. Samuel Kramer, Associate Director.
