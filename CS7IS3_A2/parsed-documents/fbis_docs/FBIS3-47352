In the final day of the party's two-day convention, delegates including party legislators and representatives from local chapters in 47 prefectures, approved the action program as drawn up by the leadership. About 400 delegates have registered with the convention. At the closing of the convention, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama presented the political outline and said that the party will realign political forces and rally liberal and social democratic forces. The convention results put the party in alignment toward pushing political reform bills into law, on which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his premiership. Discrepancies among party members, however, were made much more clear over the political reform process and the party's relations with the coalition, SDP sources said. On the back stage, those members mounted a fierce tug of war over resolutions of their own on such issues. A group chiefly made up of representatives from local chapters submitted a resolution which calls for firstly legislating a law designed to prevent corruption without sticking to enacting political reform bills as a package. The resolution also urges the party to leave the alliance if the coalition government takes policies which contravene the party's basic stance. They have expressed dissatisfaction toward leadership, saying the party made "too many concessions" on important issues such as political reform and the partial opening of the country's rice market. The newly-formed interparty policy study group "Democrats," on the other hand, counterproposed a resolution which urges the party to stay in the coalition and leave the discretion for negotiation and political judgment on the government's crucial policies to the party leadership. Murayama, however, dissuaded [as received] the two groups to retract the resolutions, saying that if the convention is forced to vote for either of the resolutions the party's disarray will be doomed, party officials said. In exchange for their conformity to Murayama's request, the chairman accepted their demands that the party will do its utmost to get political reform bills into law without amending the basic points of the bills during the current extraordinary Diet session set to end on January 29. The government's package of four political reform bills is in the House of Councillors for further deliberation after it passed in the more powerful House of Representatives last November. The bills call for replacing the current multiseat constituencies of the lower house with a combination of single-seat districts and proportional representation, as well as tightening curbs on political fund-raising activities. The ratio of single-seat constituencies in the dual system and electoral unit for proportional representation are the key points over which both the government and the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have been haggling to seek a compromise. The LDP wants a bigger ratio for single-seat districts because the system is advantageous for a large party like the LDP, while the SDP is reluctant to increasing the figure out of fear that the party's existence could be at risk. The government bills aim to introduce 274 for single-seat districts and 226 for proportional representation. Murayama also said that the party will not agree to a hike in the consumption tax from the current 3 percent level to finance cuts in income tax expected as part of anticipated economic stimulus measures. The SDP chairman also vowed to try to revamp the country's agriculture following the acceptance of a GATT proposal asking the country to partially lift the blanket ban on imports of rice. The SDP, with many legislators from farming areas like the LDP, had opposed the GATT proposal but ultimately compromised to approve the government decision to partially open the rice market as the Uruguay Round of global trade talks reached the deadline on last December 15.
