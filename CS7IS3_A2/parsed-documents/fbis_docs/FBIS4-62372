What are its particular features at the moment? [Yerin] Recently ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA published an Internal Affairs Ministry report to the citizens of Russia. It described in some detail both the main, very complex trends in the development of crime and the measures that the internal affairs organs are adopting to counter it. We ourselves are seeking to convey to citizens our worries about the way some socioeconomic processes are going. Why? Well, because they are leading to the appearance of dangerous new criminal phenomena. For example, the illegal trade in firearms. When they fall into the hands of criminals, they become a threat to the lives of thousands of citizens. The credit and banking sphere is being criminalized and thefts of many billions of rubles have been identified. The same is happening in export-import deals. Every day we stop attempts to export raw materials and supplies that constitute Russian national assets. Serious problems are also arising in the privatization process and the development of the gambling business.... The list goes on. Unfortunately the social danger of crimes of this kind is not always correctly reflected in the media. They are presented merely as another sensation. But the most important things -- the causes and conditions of crimes that jeopardize our state's national security and the results of the hard work to detect them -- escape public attention. [Klimov] Contract killings have become more frequent of late. What are the statistics, and what do the figures tell us? [Yerin] Before the mid-eighties we did not really encounter this phenomenon (aside from individual instances of the contract killing of a wife ordered by a husband or vice versa). It became a reality, in the first place, with the emergence of clients capable of paying considerable sums for the implementation of the criminal plan, and, second, the appearance of people (often with the essential combat experience) mentally prepared to carry out any contract, however dirty, for money. An analysis shows that murders by hired killers have become more frequent in the past two years. In 1992 around 100 were recorded; in 1993 there were 2.5 times more. As a rule, each of them captures public attention because the victims are people who are pretty well known in their own milieu. Increasingly we are encountering cases where violence is used as a means of pressuring representatives of the authorities, or as a means of intimidating or removing business rivals. Militia officers prevent a large number of these crimes at the planning or preparation stage. Nonetheless, bloody clashes between criminal formations, attacks on competitors, and the killing of people working in commerical structures are almost daily events. Militia officers are hard at work all the time, often risking their lives. I sincerely regret that the results of their dangerous work are of little interest to journalists. It occurs to me that it might be to someone's advantage to give the public the impression that the militia is not detecting this kind of crime, that it is not doing its duty. Far from it. In St. Petersburg, in February, militia officers arrested two hired killers from Tajikistan. They had been hired by an entrepreneur who was being plagued by racketeers in order to deal with his tormentors. The killers shot seven people, using submachineguns. The murderers were arrested, but the entrepreneur who ordered the punishment was a criminal too. Some days ago officers from Moscow Main Internal Affairs Administration organized crime and criminal investigation components arrested six members of an established criminal gang who were providing a contract killing service. They would go all over Russia to commit the crimes. Believe me, it is very difficult tracking down and neutralizing gangs like these. But criminal militia officers have now accumulated considerable experience, mastered new methods, and are achieving decent results. Sure, unfortunately we are not yet managing to solve every murder. But we are trying to do so. [Klimov] What specific cases of contract killings can you tell us about? [Yerin] First of all I want to say that in the process of detecting and investigating a crime such as a contract killing militia officers and Prosecutor's Office staff usually encounter a very experienced, brutal, and shrewd opponent, who takes care to cover his tracks. So we cannot expect this kind of crime to be cleared up quickly -- in, say, a few hours. It is a long and painstaking job. For instance, the Udmurt Republic Internal Affairs Ministry organized crime administration found that a certain B. had been involved in more than 30 contract killings. He was referred to the criminal investigation department. But the numerous clients heard about it and, fearing exposure, dealt with him themselves. He was found in the woods with a bullet in the back of his head, together with the pistol that shot him. The deputy administration chief of D. city was killed in Tver by a bullet from a revolver. The investigation team that analyzed the motivational aspect of the case established that there had been a difference of opinion between the victim and a group of local businessmen and dealers from neighboring countries over an order for the construction of a prestige development and the right to preferential use of the plot of land allocated for that purpose. All the criminals could come up with was the idea of hiring a killer, who removed the "obstacle" in the person of the leader. Criminal investigation officers in Moscow exposed the deputy general director of a joint venture who, in an effort to conceal some illegal financial transactions, hired a killer, who shot one of his business partners. Then another strangled the perpetrator of the first murder, thus removing a damgerous witness. I could continue to give examples of this kind, but there is something more important. Analysis shows that the bulk of the contract killings are committed because of conflicts in the sphere of commercial and financial activity arising in the struggle for markets, for spheres of influence, and for other mercenary motives. [Klimov] Figures have appeared in the press that some 30,000 murders have been committed in three months. The Internal Affairs Ministry is accused of doing nothing about it. What have you to say about this? [Yerin] Accusing the Internal Affairs Ministry is a familiar ploy, and the normal thing to do for many people. Although it is forgotten that it is not the Internal Affairs Ministry system that causes crime. It is a product of relationships in society, of its diseases. As for the figures you cited, I would say that they are untrue. In the first quarter 7,581 murders or attempted murders were recorded. Some 4,659 or 75 percent of them were solved through the militia's efforts. Three-fourths of the killers were arrested. A substantial and tangible result. But we still have a great deal to do to improve this work. But let us consider something else. Last year internal affairs organs for the first time had to identify and solve murders committed in order to obtain privatized housing. In Moscow alone it was established that more than 20 people had been killed after sales contracts had been drawn up. Killings masquerading as cases where citizens have disappeared without trace are also becoming widespread. Why is it that those who establish and adopt the procedure for legal arrangements relating to privatization and inheritance fail to rectify these things immediately in order to prevent further tragedies? Weapons have become an independent and constant factor in the deteriorating operational situation. In 1992 and 1993 the number of crimes in which firearms were used doubled. The full-scale "Signal" and "Arsenal" operations that the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry is conducting are producing definite results. We have seized a large quantity of weapons and ammunition, thus preventing a number of dangerous crimes. But these weapons come from the enterprises that made them and from militarized components. Are their leaders thinking about ways to keep their extremely dangerous property safe? Have they done all they can to rule out any possibility of thefts or losses and illegal sales of weapons? Militia operational services and the investigative apparatus have been under extreme pressure for a long time, facing two-to-four times as much work as normal. The physical, mental, intellectual, and emotional capacity of the officer is being tested to the limit. Recently they have succeeded in neutralizing a whole series of bandit gangs. For instance, a gang headed by S., a former convict, was arrested for committing 15 or so assaults and murders of heavy truck drivers in Moscow and Moscow Oblast in order to seize the truck and its load. Similar gangs have been detained in Krasnodar and Maritime Krays and Khakasia. Dangerous maniac killers have even been identified and exposed in Moscow and Khabarovsk. Our most skilled cadres are always sent in to solve crimes like these and arrest and neutralize the criminals. We expect officers to be tough and uncompromising in these extreme situations and use weapons and special facilities on a legitimate basis. Last year the militia used weapons on 2,739 occasions; 1,561 criminals were wounded and 376 were killed. In 1993 the murder rate increased by around 50 percent, this year it has increased by less than nine percent. For the first time in some years the number of killings fell in 28 regions. In three months the ongoing investigations of more than 4,700 murder cases were completed as a result of measures adopted in conjunction with the Prosecutor's Office investigative components. In 29 percent of the remaining cases we now have defendants, and the files on them will be passed to the courts. [Klimov] What and who is hindering the militia's fight against crime? [Yerin] Briefly, first and foremost, shortcomings in the existing legal base and elements of inconsistency in the implementation of a unified legal policy. Criminal laws must be hard-hitting -- not savage, but capable of effectively neutralizing criminal activity. Their observance and unfailing execution will make it possible not only to curb but also to suppress crime. The increase in crime requires a further strengthening of the staffs of operational, investigation, criminal expert, and other services, the improvement of vocational training and retention of cadres, and the provision of better equipment. And we are talking about not only Internal Affairs Ministry organs but the Prosecutor's Office, the courts, forensic medicine, and judicial administration. Our work on solving murders is bound up with investigations by the Prosecutor's Office, where the situation is rapidly deteriorating. For example, in a number of rayons of Khabarovsk Kray there are no Prosecutor's Office investigators at all any more. You have a similar situation in Irkutsk and a number of other oblasts. The existing principle of merging minor with greater penalties looks archaic in present-day circumstances. Because of it defendants will be in the same position whether they have committed one or dozens of dangerous crimes. In recent decades a liberal attitude to the application of the law has been gaining a foothold in investigation and judicial practice. I am not bloodthirsty but, if society is really concerned about the problem of crime, then it must ensure that those who break the law, especially those who do it deliberately, are severely punished. The militia is tired of waiting for new laws reflecting the realities of social relations today. It is no accident that components of the Federation have lately begun issuing their own legal acts. The practice of applying them in Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, and Mordovia has not only demonstrated their effectiveness but has also revealed a curious phenomenon: Criminals have started actively "emigrating" from the republics on sensing the changes in the legal climate. The Internal Affairs Ministry collegium, the leaders of the Internal Affairs Ministry, internal affairs admnistrations, transport internal affairs administrations, and other subunits and the vast majority of personnel are working hard to protect Russians from offenders. This is not an attempt to protect our reputation. We give no quarter to those internal affairs organs' officers who fall short of the high requirements of the job, who betray the interests of the service, or who are in cahoots with the criminal element. We have a great deal to do to increase the professionalism of the personnel and general standards. At the same time, I believe that without a united front in the fight against crime we will not prevail. Everyone must do his bit to fight it: militia officer and journalist, moviemaker and pedagogue, deputy and scholar. It is a common cause.
