Political power in Slovakia is going through a period of severe crisis, ensuing from the gradual loss of a reliable government base in parliament and in the ranks of the governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Kovac said. Many voices, he said, pointed to the autocratic methods of the premier's government, adding that "Whoever expresses an opinion or standpoint different from that of Vladimir Meciar is gradually branded disloyal, unreliable and finally a traitor." Some unethical practices such as slander and not speaking the truth were being carried over into the whole of society, and not even workers in the president's office or the president himself were immune to the premier's lunges, Kovac said. "As soon as the premier discovered that I intended to perform the function of head of state with sovereignty in the spirit of the Constitution, he gradually began to ignore me, cast doubt on my work and finally set out to influence and discredit, which was to result in my being prematurely removed from the post of president," he said. "I am not against the HZDS, nor am I against the government. I do however have serious reservations about the ethics and style of Mr. Meciar's political work, about the methods of his government and about the practices which create an atmosphere of confrontation in political life," the president stressed. He gave a number of examples of Meciar putting pressure on him to carry out state policy in the most immediate interest of the HZDS, and that after he refused to do so, Meciar attacked him sharply. Also relevant here, he said, was Meciar's opposition to Kovac's attempts to meet the heads of district authorities. This climaxed in the premier's announcement that he would "immediately dismiss those functionaries who accepted the invitation. Kovac also recalled Meciar's pressure on him to appoint his faithful follower Ivan Lexa privatization minister last year. "The premier insisted on the appointment of Lexa, saying that the HZDS needed money and it had no other means of obtaining it. He also promised that he would then dismiss Lexa as soon as he had fulfilled his task," Kovac said. He also pointed to the dispute concerning the filling of the post of foreign minister, the offensive breaking of state protocol concerning the president and other clashes. In general, Meciar's approach was an "unheard-of limitation of the constitutional rights of the head of state," he said. Kovac denied the accusation that he would try to destabilize the HZDS or create a new government with the help of behind-the-scenes negotiation, and that "he behaved like an enemy the whole time." "The chief guilty party on the unstable domestic political scene in Slovakia is not the president," Kovac stressed. He then said expressly that he was not calling for the dismissal of the current government, and called on Meciar to think "seriously and dispassionately" about the criticisms which he had made about the premier. He also called on parliamentary deputies and all the components of the political spectrum in Slovakia to cooperate and bring about national reconciliation in the interest of the general welfare of the state.
