Classification This notice of availability of financial assistance is issued under the authority of Public Law 102&hyph;368. This notice has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866. The requirements of section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5. U.S.C. 553) including having to give notice and an opportunity for comment do not apply to this notice because the notice relates to grants, benefits, or contracts. Since notice and an opportunity to comment is not required under any other statute, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and was not prepared. The Department has determined that the Federal assistance covered by this notice will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Therefore, no draft or final Environmental Impact Statement has been or will be prepared. This notice does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. The standard forms referenced in this notice are cleared under OMB Control No. 0348&hyph;0043, 0348&hyph;0044, 0348&hyph;0040, and 0348&hyph;0046 pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act.
