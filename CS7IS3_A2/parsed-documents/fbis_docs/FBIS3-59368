But, amid the declines, there have been great fluctuations and marked differences between different stages. In recent years there has occurred a tendency to grow again, and such a tendency should arouse sufficient attention. There have been marked differences between different stages with regard to changes in the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products: The first stage: After the founding of the state, the party and government adopted the policies of stabilizing the rural retail prices for industrial products, gradually raising the procurement prices for agricultural and sideline products, and gradually reducing the exchange price ratio between industrial and agricultural products. In 1951-1979 the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products was reduced by 49.6 percent on a cumulative basis, and the reduction in the scissors difference manifested itself in the form of "static reduction." The second stage: After the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, our country began price reform. Price reform started with reforming prices for agricultural products, and the focus of price reform in 1979-1988 was the reforming of the system of prices for agricultural products and the system governing the management of those prices. The state substantially raised the procurement prices for 18 major agricultural and sideline products including grain, cotton, and oil crops; the average increase was 25.7 percent. The procurement prices for most agricultural products were decontrolled. Because of demand, the decontrolled prices for agricultural products rose rapidly, resulting in an increase in the general level of procurement prices for agricultural and sideline products. Consequently the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products decreased substantially. The general level of procurement prices for agricultural and sideline products rose by 145 percent in 1979-1988, but the rural retail prices for industrial products rose by only 38.9 percent in the same period. The scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products decreased markedly, falling by 43.3 percent from 1978 on a cumulative basis. That is, the amount of industrial products that the peasants were able to exchange a definite amount of agricultural products for increased by 76 percent. The scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products decreased at an average annual rate of 4.6 percent. Compared with the 28 years before the reform, the amount of reduction was much larger and the speed of reduction was much higher. All this gave the peasants a great deal of benefits, and promoted the development of agricultural production. The third stage: In 1989-1991 the state cooled down the "overheated economy" in a comprehensive way; that is, that there was a period of improvement and rectification. During this period, the focus of price reform was shifted onto industry. The state adopted measures to alleviate the problems in the prices of industrial products and agricultural production materials which had been accumulated over a long time; especially, large steps were taken in the last two years of the Seventh Five-Year Plan period. At the same time, because the market for agricultural products was weak, because there were constraints on demand for agricultural products, and because the procurement prices for agricultural products were low, the rate of increase in the rural retail prices for industrial products (27.9 percent) was much higher than the rate of increase in the procurement prices for agricultural and sideline products (9.8 percent); as a result the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products grew for three years in a row, leading to a cumulative growth of 16.5 percent; that is, that the amount of industrial products that a definite amount of agricultural products could be exchanged for decreased by 14.2 percent from 1989. The fourth stage: In 1992, after Comrade Deng Xiaoping made his southern inspection remarks, price reform was accelerated. The state substantially raised the forward procurement prices for grain, and many regions decontrolled the procurement and selling prices for grain. Procurement grain prices left the fluctuating situation that had existed over the previous two years, and got out of the trough; the procurement prices for agricultural products rose by 3.4 percent, while the rural prices for industrial products rose by only 3.1 percent. The scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products decreased, falling by 0.3 percent from the year before. This was the first time that the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products had been reduced after three consecutive years' of growth in the scissors difference which had started in early 1989. The fifth stage: Since the middle of 1992, our national economy has entered the period of rapid growth, and our country has intensified price reform, focusing on transportation, energy, and basic raw and other materials. In the first quarter of 1993 the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products began to grow again. In the first half of 1993 the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products grew by 1.8 percent, and the rate of growth is likely to increase gradually. This will inevitably produce adverse impact on agricultural production, and thus should arouse attention. The reasons for the continued growth in the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products in the first half of 1993: The first was that agriculture was a backward and risk-rife industry. Agricultural labor productivity grew slowly and agriculture's economic returns were not high, The second was that as the state adopted measures to alleviate the remaining problems in the prices of industrial consumer goods and agricultural production materials, carrying out intensified reform operations, the rate of increase in the procurement prices for agricultural and sideline products (8.1 percent) was lower than the rate of increase in the prices for industrial products (10 percent). The structural adjustment of prices for industrial products was substantial and extensive. Toward the end of 1992, because of the effects of the state's decontrolling the prices of over 500 industrial products, the state's policy-based price adjustments, and the expansion of investment and consumption demand, prices for industrial products rose rapidly, In the first half of the year the rural retail prices for industrial products rose by 10 percent. In this respect the rural prices for industrial consumer goods rose by 9.3 percent, and prices for agricultural production materials rose by 12.3 percent. The rate of increase in the prices for agricultural products got ever higher on a quarterly basis. The first quarter saw an increase of 8.5 percent, while the second quarter saw a double-digit increase (15 percent). The reasons for the ever higher rate of increase in the prices for agricultural production materials: 1) Because of the propelling effects of the abovementioned reform measures, production costs rose, while prices continued to be high. 2) The industry producing agricultural production materials contracted and imports decreased; demand pushed the prices to rise. Compared with the same period last year, in the first half of the year the production of chemical fertilizer declined by 2.6 percent cumulatively, farm pesticide declined by 10.1 percent, farm-use films declined by 31.8 percent; and small tractors declined by 42.1 percent. At the same time imports of chemical fertilizer fell, resulting in a cumulative January-May reduction of 42.3 percent. 3) The state abolished monopoly trading in agricultural production materials; the operating mechanisms became flexible and the circulating channel was broadened. The continued growth in the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products has led to a decline in the comparative returns on agricultural products as well as an increase in the hidden burdens on the peasants. According to calculations, the 8.1 percent increase in the procurement prices for agricultural and sideline products in the first half of 1993 led to an increase of 6.86 billion yuan in the peasants' income. As there was an increase of 8.1 percent in prices on rural trading markets, the peasants' income from selling agricultural products to the nonagricultural population increased by 680 million yuan. The two things resulted in a combined increase of 7.54 billion yuan in the peasants' income. The 10 percent increase in the rural retail prices for industrial products led to an increase of 28.42 billion yuan in the peasants' expenditures (in this respect: the 9.3 percent increase in the rural prices for industrial consumer goods led to an increase of 21.67 billion yuan in the peasants' expenditures; the 12.3 percent increase in the retail prices for agricultural production materials led to an increase of 6.75 billion yuan in the peasants' expenditures). Overall calculations of the above-listed factors, having incomes compared with expenditures, would show that the growth in the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products in the first half of 1993 led to an increase of 20.88 billion yuan in the peasants' expenditures, that is, 26.1 yuan per person or 6.2 percent of the peasants' per capita cash income. The continued growth in the prices of agricultural production materials and the resumed expansion of the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products have led to a decline in peasants' investment in agricultural production. In terms of physical input, in the first half of 1993, nationwide the total sales of agricultural production materials, if adjusted for inflation, decreased by around 10 percent in real terms. The ever growing gap between the urban and rural areas has not only hampered the development of agricultural production, but also weakened the economically mutually complementary and mutually promoting relationships between the urban and rural areas that were established in the early years of economic reform. This situation is certain to adversely affect the long-term development of agricultural production and result in agricultural production being unable to develop in a sustained manner. In order to reverse the trend toward resumed expansion of the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products, it is necessary to adopt measures involving many spheres. Particularly important, it is necessary to vigorously develop high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture, carry out large-scale economic operations, and accelerate the improvement of agricultural labor productivity. Clear circulation channels and enhance the exchanging of materials between urban and rural areas, so as to facilitate the smooth circulation of goods. Continue to proceed with the reform of prices for agricultural products. At the same time it is necessary to enhance the regulation and supervision of prices for agricultural production materials, and gradually reduce the scissors difference between the prices of industrial and agricultural products, so as to enable the peasants to increase income through increasing output, thereby promoting the steady development of agricultural production.
