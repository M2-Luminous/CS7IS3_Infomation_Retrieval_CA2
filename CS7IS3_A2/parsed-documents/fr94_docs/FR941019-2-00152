FR941019-2-00152 FR941019-2-00081 Notwithstanding the Final Judgment and in the absence of an assignment or sublicense of rights under a License Agreement with a member of the Pilkington Group, a prospective entrant into the Float Glass industry will have to engage Patent lawyer(s) to understand each of the unexpired Patents and determine what Float Technology cannot be practiced. The review of hundreds of unexpired Patents promises significant costs to parties who cannot obtain rights by assignment or sublicensing. Commenting Party believes that changes must be made in the Final Judgment if DOJ's goal is to be achieved. Commenting Party believes that without modification of the Final Judgment no prospective entrant will be able to provide the assurances that commercial lenders and institutional investors require on the serious issues raised by the express, literal provisions of the Pilkington License Agreements. ␣␣␣Sincerely yours, John A. Grimstad. Judiciary Center Building, 555 4th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001. October 6, 1994. John A. Grimstad, Esq., Fredrikson & Byron, P.A., 1100 International Centre, 900 Second Avenue South, Minneapolis, MN 55402&hyph;3397 Re: U.S. v. Pilkington plc et al. (D. Ariz., filed May 25, 1994), Civ 94&hyph;345 TUC WDB Dear Mr. Grimstad: This letter responds to your letter of August 10, 1994, commenting on and proposing changes in the proposed Final Judgment (``Judgment'') in the above-captioned matter. You complained that (i) the Judgment rests on several ``flawed assumptions'' listed in your letter that you said ``have led to a flawed result''; (ii) contrary to the Department of Justice's conclusion, the relief the Judgment provides does not eliminate the residual anticompetitive effects of the challenged agreements or behavior; and (iii) the Judgment is ``too narrow in application to encompass [the] rights'' of a domestic glass manufacturer you represent but declined to identify. In trying to support those complaints, you applied the precise provisions of the proposed Judgment to your anonymous client's vaguely and ambiguously described licensing arrangements, and then concluded there are gaps in the Judgment's coverage that do not in fact exist. We have addressed separately below each of the changes you recommended to the proposed Judgment. For the reason indicated, we believe there is no basis for modifying the Judgment. The standard applied in assessing your specific proposals is whether it is in the public interest to enter the Judgment submitted by stipulation. Entry is in the public interest if the Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint. 1. You proposed expanding the definition ``Pilkington'' to include the two named defendants' ``past, present and future predecessors, affiliates and subsidiaries,'' so that the ``named licensees (AFG, Ford, Guardian, PPG, and LOF) ``are in fact encompassed by the definition of `Licensee'.'' This change is necessary, you said, because your client is ``an assignee and/or sublicensee of two license agreements *␣*␣* between [i] a subsidiary and/or predecessor of one of the defendants'' and (ii) one of the ``named licensees,'' and because the Judgment's definition of Licensee requires contractual privity with Pilkington itself. We believe the change is unnecessary to achieve your stated objective since each of the ``named licensees'' already is clearly a Licensee as defined in the proposed Judgment. All five of those companies entered into float licensee agreements with defendant Pilkington, not with a predecessor, affiliate, or subsidiary of Pilkington. Since execution of those agreements, only Pilkington's corporate name has been changed from ``Pilkington Brothers Limited'' to ``Pilkington plc.'' Thus, Pilkington plc is the same corporate entity as, not a successor of, Pilkington Brothers Limited. 2. You also proposed expanding the definition of ``Licensee'' to include not only anyone who has entered into a license agreement with Pilkington, but also anyone who is ``an assignee and/or sublicensee'' under a license agreement with either Pilkington or any of the ``named licensees.'' That is necessary, you said, so that anyone ``who derive[s] rights from any chain of agreements that extend ultimately to a license agreement with [Pilkington]'' will get the benefits of such a license agreement with Pilkington as ``prospective assignees/sublicensees of U.S. Licensees'' under the proposed Judgment. But this change, too, is unnecessary. Subparagraph IV.A.1. of the proposed Judgment, subject to a narrow exception and certain conditions relating to maintaining the confidentiality of legitimate trade secrets, expressly permits any U.S. Licensee (including each of the five ``named licensees'') to sublicense anywhere in the world (including the U.S.) the float glass technology Pilkington disclosed and licensed to it, free of any license restrictions or limitations and without payment of any royalties, lump sum, or line fees for such sublicensing. Clearly then, for that provision of Subparagraph IV.A.1. to have any meaningful effect, anyone acquiring rights to use such technology under such a sublicense must be as free to use it anywhere without restriction or limitation by Pilkington or payment of royalties or fees to Pilkington, subject to the same conditions concerning confidentiality, as the U.S. Licensee from whom such rights were obtained. The same would be true too for any further sublicensing by such a sublicensee. Anything less than that, if the result of any action taken by Pilkington, would be a clear violation of the proposed Judgment, with which Pilkington is required by stipulation to comply pending its approval by the court. It seems clear to us that the result would be the same, insofar as Pilkington is concerned, whether such a sublicense agreement were executed before or after entry of the proposed Judgment. As for assignments, the result should be the same, assuming, as a matter of law, the assignee effectively stands in the shoes of or is substituted for the assignor, and the rights involved are assignable. However, the proposed Judgment does not purport to address specifically the consequences of such assignments since they were not the principal focus of the challenged agreements or conduct involved here. Moreover, we cannot be any more definitive on their implications for your client because you have not provided enough information about its current licensing arrangements. 3. You proposed changing the definition of ``Non-Licensee'' from anyone who has not entered into a license agreement with Pilkington to anyone who is not a Licensee, because, you said, the current definition ``contains the overly restrictive concept of privity of contract *␣*␣*.'' But since anyone who is not in contractual privity with Pilkington is not a Licensee, your proposal is the equivalent of the current definition. Moreover, since a Licensee is anyone who is in contractual privity with Pilkington, the proposed Judgment's definitions of ``Licensee'' and ``Non-Licensee'' together cover the entire universe of persons entitled to the benefits of the Judgment, without any gap between them. For purposes of the proposed Judgment, your client is either a ``Licensee'' or a ``Non-Licensee,'' whatever else it may be (assignee, sublicensee, etc.) by reason of its current licensing arrangements. Thus, no need for the proposed change has been shown. 4. The change proposed in the definition of ``Limitations'' is to include references to sublicensing and assignment so as to permit those activities. But including such references in the definition of ``Limitations'' does not provided the authorization you seek and confuses the concept of ``Limitations,'' which are restrictions on the exercise (e.g., in certain territories or for certain uses) of rights already granted. Whether the separate right of sublicense or to make assignments also is authorized is, as noted above, already controlled by Subparagraph IV.A.1. of the proposed Judgment in the case of sublicensing and by operation of law for assignments.
