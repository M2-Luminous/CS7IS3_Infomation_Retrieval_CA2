Ho, who took up the post in June last year, handed in his resignation at a board meeting with Managing Director Yi Chang-u to act on his behalf until a replacement is named. Korea Exchange Bank, commissioned by KT to receive bids for its shares, nevertheless took part in the two-day public bidding from Monday and allegedly used inside information to match the lowest offer. Just before the application deadline, the Exchange Bank bid for 900,000 shares at 34,800 won per share with a deposit of 3.13 billion won. The price reportedly matched the successful lowest bid. Rumors then spread fast that the bank, taking advantage of inside information, knew in advance about the bidding price by examining the offers of investors. Amidst public criticism, the bank withdrew on Thursday after falsely claiming it had lost the bid by pledging 34,600 won, 200 won off its actual bid price. It announced that the successful figure was 34,700 won and that it lost because it offered a lower price, despite its application to the Bank of Korea showing a bid price of 34,800 won. Ho explained the situation to reporters Friday and again lied while admitting the false announcement. He showed reporters the manipulated computer data stating 34,600 won as the bank's bid.
