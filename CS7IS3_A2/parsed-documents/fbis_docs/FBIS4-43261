To mark the occasion the Icelandic finance minister assesses the country's economic development and its relationship to economic and political cooperation in Europe. Even though Iceland is involved in the economic cooperation between the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] and EU [European Union] countries -- so-called EEA [European Economic Area] cooperation -- Iceland is the only Nordic country not to have sought EU membership. If one were to describe Iceland's economy from World War II up to only a few years ago, the key word is instability. This is due first and foremost to the uniformity of industrial and commercial life where fishing has been the decisive factor for the population. This has often led to violent turbulence and the situation in times of recession has often been aggravated further by the intervention of the authorities in dubious rescue attempts. This instability led among other things to massive inflation and major economic swings generally. It almost became a reflex action to blame the authorities every time problems reared their heads in which people were expecting the politicians to intervene. As a result as time passed the authorities' involvement in the economy grew steadily. However, the situation has not been as gloomy as this the whole time. In the 1960's, for example, major economic reforms aiming at greater liberalization were implemented. But it was not long before people resorted to the old solutions again. People moved away from the path of liberalization, and the authorities' intervention in the economy increased again. There was hardly an area in which the authorities did not have their fingers in the pie. In the wake of growing inflation, which reached its peak in the mid-1980's when it topped the 100-percent barrier, saving was abandoned completely. People preferred instead to take loans on a similar scale. Society's system of values became totally distorted. It was a case of spending money as soon as it appeared on the horizon -- and ideally a little more money than you actually had. The best thing was to borrow money at the negative interest rates that burned up on the bonfire of inflation in the course of only a few years. These were good times for those who owed money, while those people who had saved money were badly hit and some of them lost everything they had. It goes without saying that those who controlled large amounts of capital had great power in Icelandic society. In a society where the majority of the financial institutions were state owned these had of necessity to lead to a situation in which the politicians felt tempted by this power. This was what Iceland was like. In the past few years Iceland's economic policy has been revolutionized. The Icelandic coalition government consisting of the Independence Party and the Social Democrats that came to power in 1991 has made it a point of honor to combat the problems of the past. We have endeavored to decrease state intervention. The public sector has been rationalized and been the target of spending cuts. At the same time the government has begun to sell off state-owned companies. The taxation system has been completely reorganized with lower levels of tax relief and fewer deductions. Domestic and foreign trade, the service sector, and the activities of the stock exchange have been liberalized to an appreciable extent. The door has been opened up to foreign investments. In particular the present government has made every effort to bring inflation down to the level of our neighbors. This has naturally required close consultation between the government and the two sides of industry. And now we are beginning to see the light. The economy has largely been stabilized. Inflation is down to below the OECD average, which at present is around 2 percent. Interest rate levels have fallen dramatically, and we are now in line with the majority of our trading partners, particularly the Nordic countries. From a large deficit in foreign trade in 1991 we achieved a surplus in 1993. As a result we have been able to deal with an accelerating foreign debt. The shortfall in the state's coffers and public debt are also smaller in Iceland than in many other places. Finally, there is the prospect that economic growth will get under way next year. These have to be described as impressive results, especially when we remember that since 1987 the Icelandic economy has experienced seven lean years. GNP has remained static -- this means that economic growth has been nil. This stagnation has been first and foremost due to the cuts in the fishing quotas that it was necessary to adopt to protect fish stocks in the ocean. In addition fish prices have fallen by 25 percent as a result of the wave of recession that has swept through the foreign countries closest to us. This stagnation brings with it growing unemployment, for example, and for the first time in more than 25 years we are able to record an appreciable level of unemployment in Iceland. The government has moved to tackle this unemployment through the construction of new roads, for example, and lower taxes for companies. Unemployment is now at 5.5 percent -- a figure that is somewhat lower than unemployment in the rest of Europe. Its historical legacy and its newly won independence have of course set their stamp on the young Icelandic Republic's links with international cooperation. Geographically Iceland finds itself on the boundary between the America and Europe. Like Denmark and Norway, Iceland was swift to choose to ally itself with the Western Hemisphere in security policy cooperation. Our country has no army, but because of our island's strategic location we were able to contribute by making available land for U.S.-manned NATO bases. A few years later -- in the mid-1950's -- Iceland became an active partner in Nordic cooperation that came into being in the context of the founding of the Nordic Council in 1952. Nordic cooperation has always been of great importance to Iceland. The advantages to be gained from Nordic cooperation are obvious, especially when there are things that can better be done together than by each small country individually. This importance will not decrease now that Iceland is facing the prospect of -- perhaps -- being the only Nordic country outside the EU. Attitudes to international cooperation have gradually changed over the years. We have increasingly made efforts to promote trading cooperation, at the same time as foreign trade has been liberalized. We have done this through the GATT agreement, for example, EFTA cooperation, free trade agreements with the EU, and now most recently the EEA agreement. European cooperation is particularly important in that the largest part of Iceland's foreign trade is with Europe, but there is also a cultural and political belonging. We have, however, chosen to take cautious steps. There are various explanations for this decision. Iceland is a relatively young Republic; the principle of independence is therefore high on the agenda. Another reason is the country's dependence on fish. We want to control our fish stocks ourselves. This was a realistic view to take at the time when the Icelandic Government decided that the time was not ripe to seek EU membership alongside the other Nordic countries. The colossal changes which the Icelandic economy has experienced have brought Iceland closer to the rest of Europe. In the years to come Iceland will attach importance to opening up even more to the rest of the world and to improving conditions for foreign investors. The cautious, but above all viable fisheries policy where cuts have been made in fish quotas will show itself to be a profitable investment which will bring increased fish catches in years to come which will help to put the Icelandic economy back on its feet. In addition we have at our disposal huge amounts of energy in our waterfalls which make it easier for us to offer foreign investors favorable terms for investment in Icelandic industry and commerce. This is why we are taking a rosy view of the future. We note that the world scene is changing rapidly, even viewed through Icelandic eyes. I am thinking here first and foremost of the other Nordic countries' possible future membership of the EU. This will naturally have an effect on Nordic cooperation, particularly as far as Iceland is concerned. The Icelanders are a Nordic people in Europe, and we wish to continue to be so. That is why we are attaching great importance to continued close cooperation with the other Nordic countries -- either in the framework of the EEA or in the EU context. This fact requires a reassessment of the situation. We will look these changes in the face and make our arrangements accordingly. The capacity for adjustment of Icelandic society knows no bounds.
