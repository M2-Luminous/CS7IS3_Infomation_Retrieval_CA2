FR940112-2-00107 FR940112-2-00074 [Investigation No. 332&hyph;350] Monitoring of U.S. Imports of Tomatoes AGENCY: United States International Trade Commission. ACTION: Notice of institution of investigation. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 30, 1993. SUMMARY: The North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Public Law 103&hyph;182, directs the Commission to monitor imports of fresh or chilled tomatoes (HTS heading 0702.00), until January 1, 2009, as if a proper request for such monitoring had been made under section 202(d) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252(d)), for purposes of expediting an investigation concerning provisional relief under section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974. As a result, the Commission instituted investigation No. 332&hyph;350, under section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1332(g)), for the purpose of monitoring imports of fresh or chilled tomatoes. In the course of the investigation, the Commission will monitor U.S. imports of fresh or chilled tomatoes from all foreign suppliers. In addition, the Commission will investigate and gather data, to the extent possible, on U.S. growers in such areas as shipments, prices, market share, employment levels, profit-or-loss, and efforts to compete. Wherever possible, the Commission will rely on existing data from other government agencies. Although section 316 does not require that the Commission publish reports summarizing the information obtained as a result of such monitoring, the Commission plans to publish annual statistical reports of certain trade data through the year 2008.
