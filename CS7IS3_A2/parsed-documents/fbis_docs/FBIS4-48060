General Francisco Furtado, commander of the Southern Military Front, has said that those forces have been moved from Huambo and are now engaging in operations in the north of the province, where the military situation has deteriorated since 2 May. Gen. Furtado had this to say: [Begin Furtado recording] On the Southern Military Front, the situation has been deteriorating in the northern part of Huila Province over the last few days. Our forces have been coming under attack from UNITA troops estimated to total up to four battalions. Those forces have come from Huambo and areas north of Caconda, and they have been carrying out those operations since 2 May. Fighting is continuing in the area of Quilengues. This has necessitated major efforts by our forces to defend the people in the area. The Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, have also been efficiently annihilating those UNITA forces that have attacked that position. By 1500, when we contacted the commander in the area, some 81 UNITA soldiers had been confirmed killed on the ground and our forces had also made three prisoners. The first thing those prisoners said was that they had come from Huambo and that their mission was to take Quilengues before the government and UNITA had signed any accord at the Lusaka peace talks.
