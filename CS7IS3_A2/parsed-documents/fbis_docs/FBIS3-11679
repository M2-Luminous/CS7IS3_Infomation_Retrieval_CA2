[Granillo Ocampo] The importance of the Argentine role is increasing. In the reformulation of the international scenario and in President Clinton's concept, Latin America is beginning to occupy a more important place, because it is growing as a trade partner. Latin America is the region where U.S. exports are increasing faster, nearly 18 percent per year, while in other areas they are paralyzed or decreasing. We must add to that the fact that principles supported by the U.S. Administration, such as democracy, the market economy, and the peaceful solution of conflicts, are becoming stronger here. The U.S. people are very sparing in their praise. This is why if they say that the Argentine transition process is taking place very quickly, and that its results are spectacular, it is because they believe this to be the case. Our bilateral relations are also improving as a result of the fundamental objectives shared by the two countries: respect for democratic institutions, environmental protection, defense of human rights, and the peace and security concept defended by the United Nations. [Crivelli] For decades Brazil played the role of a preferential U.S. partner in this region, but recently a deterioration has been noticed in Brasilia-Washington ties. Could Argentina take the place left vacant by the Brazilians? [Granillo Ocampo] It definitely already is taking it. [Crivelli] You have traveled with U.S. Vice President Al Gore. Before his arrival in our country there was information that his agenda included, among other issues, corruption and drug trafficking. Were the problems encountered by U.S. companies in participating in the privatizations discussed? [Granillo Ocampo] It would be appropriate to make clear that there was a real agenda -- following talks between the two sides -- and another agenda concocted by the press on the basis of isolated reports. The issues of corruption, drug trafficking, or independent courts were never included in the real agenda. These issues were also not discussed during the two visits that Gore paid to President Menem. It is true that there are some companies that complain about problems in entering our country over what we may describe as the practice of corruption, but this does not seem to be the rule. During the past two years almost all the privatizations have been awarded to U.S. companies. If they were not successful bidders during the first two years it was because they did not participate. During that period, they actually did not believe in the privatization process. [Crivelli] There is one inevitable issue, either on the real agenda or on that of the newspapers: the patents law. Does it have a deadline? Is it 30 April? What is the situation right now? [Granillo Ocampo] From the correct perspective, the issue is like this: We made an international commitment, the GATT agreement, and therefore we must at least promulgate a law. In addition to that, there is a commitment marked by our interest in joining NAFTA. If we want to harmonize our policy with the United States in that field, it is necessary to accept some rules. It is not a question of giving in to a big stick policy. The members of NAFTA -- Mexico, Canada, and the United States -- have defined a minimum level for the patents law, and this is what is being negotiated. What would be best for us, reject NAFTA and not have a patents law, or have a patents law with some limitations and join NAFTA? President Carlos Menem decided for the second option. There is a 1 May deadline to prepare a report on the countries with which there is an interest in starting negotiations. Based on that report the president will submit his final proposal to Congress on 1 July indicating the countries with which it is suggested that negotiations be started. [Crivelli] Will Senate approval be enough to avoid a conflict, or will it be necessary to have the approval of both chambers? [Granillo Ocampo] I don't believe it will be necessary to have the approval of both chambers. They know it involves different powers, and what must be shown is progress in the right direction. [Crivelli] The Whitewater affair affecting President Clinton had wide press coverage in Argentina. What is its real impact on the American people? [Granillo Ocampo] This affair is obviously overblown. The latest U.S. poll shows that 16 percent of the American people believe the president could have done something wrong, and 84 percent believe he did not. Also, there is nothing against Clinton. No accusation against him has been made, and he is not under investigation. The accusations published by the press are only possibilities, and have been greatly exaggerated. [Crivelli] What is the objective of the summit of presidents to be held in December in Miami? [Granillo Ocampo] The objective is to prepare a work agenda for the region, including issues that interest President Clinton and the Latin American presidents. In other words, the definition of regional policies is a multilateral issue; it will emerge from the talks among all parties involved. The idea is also to emphasize the importance of Latin America for the Democratic administration. The meeting could also be interpreted as an equivalent to the Americas Initiative of the Republican administration. Argentina is an important spokesman for the region. We have been previously consulted, and helped create the idea, the agenda, and the site for the summit.
