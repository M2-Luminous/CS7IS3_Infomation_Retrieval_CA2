FR940110-1-00101 FR940110-1-00006 (ii) The applicant shall have in place either: (A) A legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable mechanism that permits it to recover from the sponsor or owner the full amount of the AHP subsidy provided to the project in the event of a sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect to the requirements of this part; or (B) If the Bank agrees and such an agreement is legally enforceable, a three-party agreement that includes the Bank, the sponsor or owner and the applicant that permits the Bank to recover from the sponsor or owner the full amount of the AHP subsidy provided to the project in the event of a sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect to the requirements of this part. (4) The Board in its discretion may grant a waiver of any required remedial actions under this paragraph (a) upon written request by the Bank, applicant, sponsor or owner. (b) Other types of non-compliance. In the event of an applicant's, sponsor's or owner's non-compliance with the requirements of this part that is not willful, such as due to inadvertent errors by such party or changes in circumstances that are outside such party's control, the Bank shall provide the party a reasonable period of time in which to take reasonable efforts, pursuant to a compliance plan approved by the Bank, to remedy the non-compliance. The Bank in its discretion may exclude the applicant, sponsor or owner from participation in the AHP while such party is under a compliance plan, or in its discretion may require the applicant to increase the long-term period committed to in its AHP application for the project by the amount of time the project has been in non-compliance. If the applicant, sponsor or owner takes no reasonable efforts to comply with the compliance plan, then such party is in willful non-compliance with the requirements of this part and is subject to the remedial actions contained in paragraph (a) of this section. If the applicant, sponsor or owner takes reasonable efforts pursuant to the compliance plan to remedy the non-compliance under this paragraph (b) and such efforts are unsuccessful, the applicant, sponsor or owner would be subject to the remedial actions contained in paragraph (a) of this section, but may apply to the Bank for a waiver of any such required remedial actions. The Bank shall report to the Board in writing on any waivers approved pursuant to this paragraph (b) within 30 calendar days of such approval. (c) Sale of AHP-assisted owner-occupied housing unit to income-ineligible household. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, in the event that a household sells its AHP-assisted owner-occupied housing unit to a household whose income exceeds the level committed to in the AHP application prior to the end of the required long-term period, then the provisions of either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section shall apply. (1) If the Bank provided a direct subsidy to the applicant which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the Bank shall require the seller to repay a pro rata share, except for de minimis amounts, of the grant received by such seller, reduced for every year the seller owned the unit, to be repaid from any net gain from the sale of the unit after deduction for sales expenses, and to be returned to the Bank, except that the Bank in its discretion may waive such requirement if the imposition of such requirement will cause undue hardship on the seller, as defined by the Bank in its AHP implementation plan. (2) If the Bank provided a subsidized advance to the applicant and the applicant provided a below market rate loan to the seller, the applicant shall either repay to the Bank that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller or the Bank shall convert that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller to a market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the market rate of interest at the time the advance was made, and any unused AHP subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to subsidize that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller shall be made available by the Bank for additional AHP projects. (3) The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section shall not apply provided the sponsor, pursuant to a legally binding agreement with the Bank, assists another household with an income at or below the level committed to in the AHP application in the manner originally committed to in the AHP application. (d) Sale of AHP-assisted rental housing project. In the event that the owner of an AHP-assisted rental housing project sells the project prior to the end of the long-term period during which the project's rental units, or portion thereof, must remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application, and the purchaser does not agree to maintain the project according to such commitments and to be subject to the same restrictions on resale that applied to the seller, then the provisions of either paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section shall apply. (1) If the Bank provided a direct subsidy to the applicant which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the Bank shall require the seller to repay a pro rata share, except for de minimis amounts, of the grant received by such seller, reduced for every year the seller owned the unit, to be repaid from any net gain from the sale of the project after deduction for sales expenses, and to be returned to the Bank, except that the Bank in its discretion may waive such requirement if the imposition of such requirement will cause undue hardship on the seller, as defined by the Bank in its AHP implementation plan; or (2) If the Bank provided a subsidized advance to the applicant and the applicant provided a below market rate loan to the seller, the applicant shall either repay the advance to the Bank or the Bank shall convert the advance to a market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the market rate of interest at the time the advance was made, and any unused AHP subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to subsidize the advance shall be made available by the Bank for additional AHP projects.
