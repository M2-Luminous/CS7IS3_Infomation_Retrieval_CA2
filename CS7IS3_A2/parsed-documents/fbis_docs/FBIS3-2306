They have pointed out that the introduction of a British-type "democratic" election system is disadvantageous to Hong Kong. Qiu Liben, an associate research fellow at the World History Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said: Whenever Britain was about to withdraw from a colony, it tried to change the system in which the executive branch dominates the legislative branch, under the camouflage of democracy. The British typically would foster and manipulate forces within the legislative council, vigorously introduce "democratic" elections, and thus sow the seeds of turmoil. If the outcome of the elections did not conform with British interests, they would wipe it out. This type of hypocritical democratic "direct elections" must be exposed immediately. Professor Liu Wenzong of the International Law Research Center of the Institute of Diplomacy, pointed out even more bluntly: By introducing overall direct elections in Hong Kong, the British side actually intends to launch a series of "reforms" to confront the Basic Law and thus create chaos. Chris Patten once revealed: "The executive branch must be made accountable to the legislative organ around 1997." In a "report by missions to Hong Kong" written in 1991, the British side said that it is necessary to have the chief executive directly elected by the public, and suggested that the chief executive be accountable to the legislative organ of the special administrative region rather than to the Chinese Government. These remarks and views have all exposed the British side's intention of disrupting the stable transition process in Hong Kong. Zhang Shunhong of the World History Research Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences maintained that Britain's ultimate purpose in "bestowing" its "democratic system" on its colonies is to facilitate its infiltration and safeguard its economic privileges and interests.
