The dailies of the two major political forces frontpage stories headlined: "NATO Planes Bomb Eastern Herzegovina on Two Consecutive Days" (DUMA, the daily of the Bulgarian Socialist Party) and "Russia Wants No More Air Strikes on Bosnia" (DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces). "NATO's air strikes showed that the Serbs had obviously misjudged the patience of the international community. After what happened, there is hope that they will rethink their position and will return to serious negotiations," says ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME, the daily of the most influential extraparliamentary Agrarian Party. A signed commentary in the trade union TRUD daily says: "Clearly, the bombs came too late and no one will rise from the 250,000 dead lying in graves across the former Yugoslav Republic." The author asks whether there is an international conspiracy against the former Yugoslavia, the Balkans and European unification and whether it was pure chance that Washington and Moscow actually gave Belgrade the signal to start the war with their declarations that they "are firmly in favour of Yugoslavia's unity." "If we survive, we will come to the age-old truth that it is all a matter of division of labour: the big ones make a mess and the small ones do the clean- up," the author of the TRUD commentary says in conclusion. A signed article in 24 CHASA, headlined "NATO Brings Us Closer to New Balkan War," says: "Three rockets won't scare the Serbs who fought Islam for centuries." According to STANDART NEWS, Russian President Boris Yeltsin in "an angry telephone conversation" with U.S. President Bill Clinton protested that the United States had not consulted Russia before the attack; "this was another way of saying that Russia dreams of being a factor in the Balkans but that's all it was." "Recent references to Malta and Yalta are not a coincidence," says a signed commentary in OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK. The author says the outcome of the latest developments is "likely to be reached through secret diplomacy, as it has always been." A story in KONTINENT headlined "Bomb-happy Love of Peace" recalls that there have been dozens of cases when the Serbs were much more deserving of air strikes. The author asks "whether (the reason for the air strikes is that) the time had come to show the world that NATO exists and works, that it still is under Washington's command, that NATO commands the United Nations and involves the world organization in a civil war?" "What are the Balkans supposed to become in the future: a new Vietnam or a new Afghanistan?" The KONTINENT commentary says in conclusion.
