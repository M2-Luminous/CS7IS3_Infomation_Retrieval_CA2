The paper quoted a source in Beijing as saying that China, which had earlier invited Kim, accepted the notification as a refusal of its invitation. The source was quoted as saying that North Korea is worried about giving the impression that it fell under China's sway if the nuclear problem had been resolved after Kim's visit. Kim is especially conscious of South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's trip to China and might have decided not to visit Beijing in order to show that Chinese influence on North Korea has its limits, the source said. China, through a Communist party delegation which visited Pyongyang late last month, invited Kim Il-song to come for discussions on the nuclear issue as well as reform and opening, according to the paper. Given the close relationship between the two countries, China's announcement on the invitation was exceptional, according to the source. ASAHI said China judged that Kim Il-song had come to the conclusion that if he visited Beijing before the nuclear problem was resolved, other countries would have the impression that North Korea yielded to Chinese pressure. Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said at a press conference that Kim Il-song does not plan to visit China in the near future. China opposes economic sanctions against North Korea because if such strong action was taken, the North might attack the South in a final bid to survive, the Chinese source explained.
