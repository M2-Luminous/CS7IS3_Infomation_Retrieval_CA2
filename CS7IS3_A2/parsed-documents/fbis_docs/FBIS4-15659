Gerashchenko has made a sensational statement in the State Duma to the effect that in the very near future he will reduce commercial banks' credit rates. The exact figure is not yet known and the Central Bank of Russia is not interested in making it public, to avoid destabilizing the interbank credit market. But experts are citing a figure between 180 and 200 percent per annum by the end of April. Let us recall that the present rate is 210 percent According to Gerashchenko this is being done because inflation rates have declined considerably. And if the government keeps its word and brings its average monthly rates down to 7-9 percent by the end of the year then the Central Bank will correspondingly lower the bank rate to 110-120 percent per annum. We have found out from competent sources in the Central Bank of Russia that this has been talked about for a long time. But there is a long way from talk to implementing that intention. It will all depend on how far the cabinet of ministers succeeds in keeping the budget deficit within the calculated limits and also on whether the government approves the monetary and credit policy concept sent to it by the Central Bank. Its thrust, according to V. Smenkovskiy, chief of the Central Bank research and information department, is that the Bank of Russia has set limits and volumes for the credits granted, which must be sent to specific enterprises and for specific projects. But which projects these will be is to be determined by the government program of "targeted" support for industry. It is entirely possible that the Central Bank of Russia's decision to embark on reducing the base rate was influenced by the results of auctions to which centralized credits were submitted. The feeble activity of the banks at the auctions showed that loans have become excessively expensive and the market has been saturated and the time has come to reduce the cost of money, so to speak.
