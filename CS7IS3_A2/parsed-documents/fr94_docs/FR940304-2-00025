If the Committee approves the proposed additions, all entities of the Federal Government (except as otherwise indicated) will be required to procure the commodity, military resale commodities and services listed below from nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodity, military resale commodities and services to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodity, military resale commodities and services. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodity, military resale commodities and services to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodity, military resale commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement List.
