The republic of Srpska's press office has announced that the delegation is to present to representatives of the international community and cochairmen Owen and Stoltenberg the Serb side's stance on the possible resumption of the peace talks, stressing the establishment of a lasting cease-fire in all parts of that former Yugoslav republic and the equal treatment of all sides in the conflict. This is in line with the conclusions of the republic of Srpska assembly adopted at a recent session in Brcko. The Serbian side will warn of the Muslim offensive that has been going on with unabated intensity, and will insist that the unfair and inadequate behavior of the Muslim side hampers any resumption of talks, a statement says. The republic of Srpska's delegation is expected to take part in consultative meetings with important personalities from the international community who are interested in the speedy creation of conditions necessary for the resumption of talks. Immediately before departure, Krajisnik said that there were considerable problems in creating conditions for the resumption of talks. The statement stresses that the contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina has ignored the solving of these problems, underestimating their importance.
