Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, at the conclusion of the second round of sessions with her Ibero-American colleagues, said the following: [Begin recording] [Sanin] We have already reached an agreement on the final document. [Unidentified reporter] What does it consist of? [Sanin] Integration, trade, investment, and the parallel social-type processes that must be implemented. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] what priority did it have? [Sanin] It was not included on the agenda. [Reporter] Did Spain and Portugal have a real commitment to represent Latin America at the EU? [Sanin] They are the natural bridge to represent us at the EU. [Reporter] Did they sign a written commitment? [Sanin] Of course, since the first summit. [Reporter] How would you describe the development of the summit so far? [Sanin] Totally satisfactory. [Reporter] Would Colombia support military intervention in Haiti? Would the Ibero-American countries support it as the United States would like? [Sanin] We have not talked about the topic of Haiti and Cuba in this summit. We are going to see if the presidents, during the informal meetings, bring it up, but up to now the foreign ministers have not talked about it. [end recording] These were the most relevant aspects of the meeting with the media at the Americano Hotel a few minutes ago where the foreign ministers have finished drafting the document that will be reviewed by the presidents. There is no doubt that they will discuss the topic of Haiti and Cuba, the two central topics that are not officially on the agenda but will be brought up by some of the countries that believe they are topics that Latin America cannot avoid at this time.
