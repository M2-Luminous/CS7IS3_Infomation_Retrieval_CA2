The Small Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;366) extended the demonstration program until September 1996 and made certain changes in the procedures for operation of the demonstration program. The law designated four (4) industry groups for testing whether the competitive capabilities of the specified industry groups will enable them to successfully compete on an unrestricted basis. The four (4) industry groups are: Construction (except dredging); architectural and engineering (A&E) services (including surveying and mapping); refuse systems and related services (limited to trash/garbage collection); and non-nuclear ship repair. Under the program, when a participating agency misses its small business participation goal, restricted competition is reinstituted only for those contracting activities that failed to attain the goal. The small business goal is 40 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for construction, trash/garbage collection services, and non-nuclear ship repair and 35 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for architect-engineer services.
