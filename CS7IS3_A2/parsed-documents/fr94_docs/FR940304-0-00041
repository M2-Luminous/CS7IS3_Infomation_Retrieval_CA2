FR940304-0-00041 FR940304-0-00015 Response: The cost projections in the proposed rule for electronically processed claims are the expected costs for physicians to comply with the requirement for diagnostic coding on all bills and requests for payment rather than the costs of the carriers in processing the bills and requests for payment. Comment: One association asked the implied meaning of the statement ``*␣*␣* (diagnostic coding) could be used for prepayment screens'' (54 FR 30559, July 21, 1989). The commenter asked where the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM and CPT&hyph;4 information is being collected and what future plans are being implemented for the use of the information. The association was informed by its carrier that the carrier does not believe the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM and CPT&hyph;4 codes will eventually be used for a prospective payment system for physicians. Response: Billing information is compiled by each carrier and then electronically transmitted to HCFA's Bureau of Data Management and Strategy in Baltimore, Maryland. This Bureau is largely responsible for performing HCFA's mathematical and statistical programming and for managing HCFA's statistical data bases to support program decisions by various HCFA components. Current and possible applications for the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM and CPT&hyph;4 coding information include answering research queries from private sources, development of quality assurance monitoring mechanisms, assessment of the impact of proposals that affect health care financing programs, or special research and evaluation studies. The Bureau uses diagnostic coding information to design and develop periodic statistical tabulations to assess the characteristics of beneficiaries and the utilization and cost of program benefits. The CPT&hyph;4 codes also are now used for payment purposes under the fee schedule for physician services. Comment: One commenter was concerned about the increased costs for manpower and the reformatting of her billing system associated with implementation of the diagnostic coding requirement. Response: We cannot predict the increased costs or manpower that an individual office would incur as a result of the diagnostic coding requirement. However, in the impact analysis to this final rule, we discuss our estimate of the aggregate costs associated with coding training and ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM coding books. Also, as discussed in the impact analysis, we now estimate that about 90 percent of physicians included diagnostic coding on bills before it was required by section 1842(p) of the Act. These physicians may not have experienced as significant an increase in costs as physicians who did not code before the requirement was established. Comment: One commenter stated that since general practitioners care for the whole patient, it is sometimes difficult to find an applicable diagnosis even after looking through 2,000 pages of codes. The physician recommended that we allow three digit codes to be used for procedures for which physicians routinely charge less than $200. Response: We are aware that general practitioners are responsible for coding a wide range of diagnoses. To determine the correct code, Volume 2, Index, must be consulted first. After the correct code has been determined, Volume 1 is then referenced to determine if there are other coding conventions that apply, such as ``Includes'' or ``Excludes'' notes. We cannot accept the recommendation to allow the use of three digit codes in any circumstance where an applicable four or five digit code exists. Codes must be used to their highest level of specificity; this may include some three digit codes. If diagnoses are coded to the highest level, using the same data base for all bills and requests for payment will permit meaningful trend analysis and data comparisons. Comment: Several commenters stated that the estimate of 1 minute to code a bill or request for payment is too short. The estimate does not consider the time a physician spends with office staff to select the correct diagnosis code.
