FR940504-0-00015 FR940504-0-00006 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;25] Amendment to Class E Airspace; Rifle, CO AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action amends the Class E airspace at Rifle, CO. Establishment of a new instrument approach procedure requires additional controlled airspace for the procedure. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing it with the designation ``Class E airspace'' The Class E airspace will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference when the new approach procedures become effective. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ted Melland, ANM&hyph;536, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;25, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; Telephone: (206) 227&hyph;2536. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On February 18, 1994, the FAA proposed to amended part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the Class E airspace for the Rifle Garfield County Airport, Rifle, CO (59 FR 8147). Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking process by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they desired. No comments were received. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the term ``transition area,'' and airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level is now designated as Class E airspace. Class E airspace designations for airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The coordinates in this final rule are in North American Datum 83. The Rule This amendment of part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class E airspace to Rifle, Colorado. It will provide controlled airspace for a new instrument approach procedure at the airport. Amendment of the Class E airspace will result in greater safety and efficiency at, and in the vicinity of, the airport. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
