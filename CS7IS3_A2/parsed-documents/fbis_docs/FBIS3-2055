By giving cards to non-residents, these areas hope to attract more investors and workers. Shanghai has issued a Blue Seal Card to investors and a Labour Permit Card to rural residents. A county in Beijing has also issued the Blue Seal Card. A Blue Seal Card carrier enjoys the same benefits that a permanent resident, or a Red Seal Card holder, receives in housing and education. Meanwhile, Shandong Province has allowed some farmers to change their census title from "peasant" to urban dweller," aiming to attract more farmers to work in factories and businesses in small cities. The change gives them all the entitlements of a city resident. Many towns in provinces such as Shaanxi in North China, have also introduced similar measures. The policies are aimed at reforming the country's old census system, rigidly enforced since the 1950s, that divides people into "farmers" and "urbanites" to strictly control the population flow into cities. Farmers who are not city residents are not eligible for subsidized housing and school fees. But China's fast economic growth in the past decade has lured many farmers into cities to seek more money. And when cities began eliminating grain coupons last years farmers began flocking to urban centres. Incomplete statistics show that more than 50 million rural workers seek jobs in cities or towns each year, a sign many think is conducive to China's booming economy. Shanghai has 2.5 million migrant workers that account for a seventh of its population. This population pressure has pushed city governments to reform their census systems. Shanghai and Beijing's Pinggu County took the lead by introducing Blue Seal Cards to foreign and domestic investors. Shanghai's Blue Seal Card system started on February 1. Those qualified for the card include: -- foreigners who operate enterprises for two or more years with an investment of more than $200,000; -- foreigners who buy commercial apartments larger than 100 square metres: -- domestic investors who pump at least 1 million yuan ($115,000) into the city over a two-year span; -- technical workers from the inland who have worked in the city for more than three years. Blue Seal Card holders can eventually apply to be a permanent resident, giving them the additional right to vote in city elections. In Beijing, eastern Pinggu County has the same policies, although investment requirements are lower. The card is given to foreign investors who inject $150,000, residents from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan who invest 200,000 yuan ($22,988) and domestic investors who pour in 100,000 yuan ($11,494). In another development, an official from the Public Security Ministry said over the weekend that several ministries under the State Counci] are drafting a plan to reform the country's census. The plan is expected to be released during the first half of the year. The official declined to give further details. Many analysts say the census changes will encourage farmers seeking more money to settle in small cities and townships rather than big cities. Mainly because of the closer proximity townships are to their hometowns.
