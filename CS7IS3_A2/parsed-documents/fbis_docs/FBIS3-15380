Russian Federation Foreign Affairs Ministry Has Held a Conference on Problems of the Commonwealth's Russophones"] [Text] The range of opinions (including in Russia's state structures) on how Moscow's relations with the newly independent neighboring countries should develop is very wide -- from isolationism to unification at any price. But in this context the problem of "ethnic Russians" in the CIS countries is perennial. In an attempt to define their legal status, the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry has proposed a draft bilateral treaty between the Russian Federation and a corresponding state related to "Russian Federation citizens permanently residing on its territory." The treaty proposes that a status be established for them close to the legal status of that country's citizens in as much as refers to political, economic, and other rights. With very few exceptions -- for instance the right to elect and be elected to supreme bodies of state power, participate in referendums, and hold diplomatic or state security posts -- the "permanent residents" have equal rights with the country's citizens and the restrictions imposed on foreigners do not extend to them. The appearance of such a draft, in the opinion of Moscow diplomats, is due to the fact that a different status -- say, dual citizenship -- creates more problems than its solves. At the same time the special citizenship status proposed by them is not based on ethnic principles, but enables anyone having any even very remote roots in Russia to register his citizenship according to a simplified procedure. In particular this setup is designed to remove certain problems for re-emigres from the CIS countries who are often treated in Russia as foreigners. Without recognizing dual citizenship juridically, the Russian authorities may do this de facto. True, this agreement, speakers at the conference noted, leaves out people who move from the "inner neighboring states" [vnutrenneye zarubezhye], in particular Russians who leave the Russian Federation's ethnic republics. One of the acute issues is still the character of influence on Russian communities in the newly independent states by numerous public organizations created in Russia to maintain links with compatriots abroad. To politicize the public life of the Russian diaspora and to turn the community into a conduit of Russian policy abroad would mean, as was stressed at the conference, to subject it to additional danger, leading to extreme situations -- "knowing some traditions that can reemerge in certain regions." At present, social problems in Russia for compatriots from the neighboring states have been alleviated somewhat after the free circulation of foreign exchange, which they often had to pay for their presence in their "historical motherland," was banned here. It was also proposed to allow them to enroll in Russian colleges and universities on a general competitive basis and to promote the dissemination of Russian newspapers and books in the Commonwealth countries. At the interstate level, that the extension of credits to CIS countries be made contingent on which proportion thereof will be used to support and promote the Russian diaspora, also taking into account the number of Russians leaving the country.
