It is not certain that they will take place on the date scheduled, however, because Yerevan and Baku have not yet made a final decision. Tofik Abbasov, head of the Azerbaijan presidential apparatus press service, told SEGODNYA's correspondent that the meeting depends on whether the expert commission formed with representatives of Russian, Armenian, and Azerbaijan Foreign Ministries will complete its work. Furthermore, Mr. Abbasov noted that the president will come to the meeting if he has the time. Baku, however, welcomes Russia's initiative and will soon make its final decision known. Yerevan's attitude to the scheduled Moscow meeting is essentially the same. The press service of the Armenian presidential apparatus told SEGODNYA's correspondent that "this question will be decided in the very near future." Such a position by Yerevan and Baku suggests that the meeting between presidents Ter-Petrosyan and Aliyev set for 25 January may not take place or may be moved to a later date. At present both warring sides understand the impossibility of resolving the Karabakh conflict militarily. The upcoming meeting, however, even if it does take place, will be hardly capable of putting an end to the Karabakh issue because Baku will never agree to the loss of part of its territory, while the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic will not want to lose its unrecognized independence. At present there is no compromise option that would suit both sides. Therefore, chances are that no peace agreement will be concluded between Armenia and Azerbaijan any time soon.
