Worth over 200 million new pesos on the black market, it would have been used to process more than 2 million doses. The operation was carried out in the town of Ensenada, Baja California, where the agents also captured four Thai, two Mexicans, and a Lao belonging to an international drug trafficking ring. In this connection, the PGR reported: "One of the most severe blows recorded in the history of this effort was dealt to the heroin dealers. Therefore, the investigations will be continued, so as to capture all the members of the criminal group." Through its representative in Baja California State, Arturo Ochoa Palacios, and the Federal Judicial Police deputy commissioner, Raul Loza Parra, the PGR announced that the following were captured during the operation: Seachao Vern Chieng, a native of Laos and resident of the United States; Phan Saeng Vern, a Thai naturalized as a U.S. citizen; Vang Yao Fow, Seaphan Sou On, and Seaphan Aecho (also from Thailand, but residents of the neighboring country to the north); and the Mexican women, Maricruz Barrera and Armida Aldaco. The officials stressed that those arrested admitted their guilt of all the charges of crimes against health brought against them. Consequently, within the next few hours they will be remanded to the pertinent federal authorities. As for the manner in which the arrests were made, the officials noted that a surveillance operation was implemented for several weeks, after the detection of two cardboard boxes containing heroin that had been transported by the Postal Service delivery unit. They had originally been sent to Thailand, and later returned to Mexico, for no apparent reason. The sources indicated that the mailing and return operation took place on several occasions, attracting the detectives' attention. They added: "At the fourth postal administrative office, Federal Judicial Police agents located a third cardboard box holding 18 bars of toilet soap. When the shipment was inspected in the presence of the federal public prosecutor, eight packets were found containing pure heroin with a gross weight of one kg and 726 grams." "Furthermore, at the administrative office of the Mexican Postal Service's Francisco Zarco Branch, the Federal Judicial Police found two boxes with similar features that had been sent from Thailand. They contained several packages wrapped in plastic, holding heroin with a gross weight of 9.706 kg." Ochoa Palacios added that the probe was continued and, as a result, PJF personnel, backed by the Federal Highway Police, intercepted the drivers of a Chevrolet sedan with Baja California plates. They were identified as Phan Saeng Vern, Vang Yao Fow, Seaphan Sou On, Seachao Vern Chieng, and Seaphan Aecho. A few days earlier, these individuals had attempted to retrieve the boxes containing the drugs at the Postal Service offices in Ensenada. Addressing the federal public prosecutor, who opened preliminary investigation 19/94, the subjects stated, with the aid of a translator, that they had already managed to move large heroin shipments to the United States, using a "bridge" established between Asia and Mexico. They revealed that they were sending boxes containing soap and shampoo to Thailand, and that the containers were emptied in that country and filled with heroin, for subsequent return to Mexico by air, using the "merchandise returns" service. On Mexican territory, they arranged to have the shipments picked up in the parcel post area, assigning other persons to do this, in order to avoid arousing suspicion. With the information that they provided, the federal agents captured Maricruz Barrera who, upon her arrest, informed them that three suitcases containing drugs were at the residence of her friend, Armida Aldaco, located in the second section of Ensenada's Colonia Francisco Villa. After searching the site, the agents found the bags in a closet, and turned them over to the public prosecutor, Luis Ibanez Cornejo, who found 42 kg of heroin inside. The PGR representative reported that the narcotics were to be sold in the towns of Visalia, Santa Ana, and Fresno, California. He also noted that Alfonso Romero Verdugo, employed as head of the MexPost department of the Mexican Postal Service, at the No. 1 main post office in Ensenada, was arrested. The presumed drug traffickers claimed that they had given him money for his cooperation in receiving and sending the packages containing heroin.
