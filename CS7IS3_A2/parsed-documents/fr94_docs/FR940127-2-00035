Take notice that on December 17, 1993, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National) petitioned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) for a waiver of certain of the requirements of Order Nos. 497 et al. 1 1 Order No. 497, 53 FR 22139 (June 14, 1988), III FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶30,820 (1988); Order No. 497-A, order on rehearing, 54 FR 52781 (December 22, 1989), III FERC Stats. & Regs. 30,868 (1989); Order No. 497-B, order on extending sunset date, 55 FR 53291 (December 28, 1990), III FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶30,908 (1990); Order No. 497-C, order extending sunset date, 57 FR 9 (January 2, 1992); III FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶30,934 (1991), rehearing denied, 57 FR 5815 (February 18, 1992), 58 FERC ¶61,139 (1992); Tenneco Gas v. FERC (affirmed in part and remanded in part), 969 F. 2d 1187 (D.C. Cir. 1992), Order No. 497-D, order on remand and extending sunset date, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles ¶30,958 (December 4, 1992), 57 FR 58978 (December 14, 1992); Order No. 497-E, order on rehearing and extending sunset date, 59 FR 243 (January 4, 1994), 65 FERC ¶61,381 (December 23, 1993). National requests that the Commission waive the requirements of Order Nos. 497 et al. with respect to National's relationship with National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (Distribution), an affiliated local distribution company. National claims that since its restructuring plan became effective on August 1, 1993, Distribution is no longer a sales customer of National. Distribution, which is National's largest single transportation customer, can make off-system sales without triggering the marketing affiliate rules, so long as the gas sold is not transported on National's pipeline system. National requests that the Commission allow Distribution to move gas through National's facilities to a newly created Hug, without triggering the requirements of Order Nos. 497 et al . National further states that copies of this filing were served upon its jurisdictional customers and the Regulatory Commissions of the states of New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC, 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 or 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 or 385.214). All such motions to intervene or protest should be filed on or before February 4, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1658 Filed 1&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
