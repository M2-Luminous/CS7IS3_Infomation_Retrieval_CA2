The assurance by a senior Daihatsu Motor Co. official followed Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed's complaint Monday that Mitsubishi Motors Corp. has been slow in transferring its engine and transmission technology to its Malaysian partners in Proton. Daihatsu is scheduled to begin producing 660cc minicars modeled on the Mira in July, initially procuring about 50 percent of parts locally for the "Perodua Kancil" model. Perodua derives from the second national car maker's Malay name while kancil (mouse deer) is the car's pet name. "We hope to achieve the 75 percent local content target in the Perodua Kancil earlier than the 1997 schedule," Daihatsu general manager Kentaro Shimizu was quoted as saying by the national BERNAMA NEWS AGENCY. "We will increase the transfer of technology from the production of engines, machinery, parts and transmission systems gradually to plant construction and the sales area," he said.
