It comes to mind over and over again specifically today, on the day of a more than modest anniversary. It has been one year since OBSHCHAYA GAZETA renewed its publication. To those two issues which appeared in the days of the putsch, when the unification of the printed word and the people which had been growing since '85 reached its highest point, 39 more issues have been added. They began their journey as of April of '93, in the time of opposition and tragic discord. All these issues were conceived to be more interesting than they turned out. They were conceived as a dream and, like a dream, they were not fully realized. I cannot restrain myself from saying the most banal thing: How quickly this year has flown! And we really did not have a chance to talk: Only an inconsequential part of what we wanted to say when we first met at the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial office has been realized. We began by adopting three precepts. Not a single intelligent person shall be left aside. The newspaper prides itself on its authors. But their circle could have been broader. There is an abundance of intelligent people in Russia. To create without destroying. We strived to analyze the current without breaking the ties of the times, without depriving the readers of their greatest valuable--their life experience. After all, how much can be achieved in a place where, for the sake of a career, they are ready to divest themselves of the past?! To get to know ourselves and the times. And here we were not overly successful. It still remains in question: What kind of society are we creating, and how will each of us live in it? Then again, there is still plenty time to sigh about what we did not have time to do. On the day of the anniversary, we should speak about that which has been accomplished. The newspaper is being published! For our times, that in itself is a significant achievement. The editorial staff consists of people who are devoted to the newspaper and friendly with each other. This too is a rarity nowadays. The newspaper has a readership, and people write to us. I can testify to the fact that, in 40 years of working on newspapers, this is the first time I have encountered such well-prepared readers, who formulate precisely and with ease that which concerns them. No, we cannot brag about our circulation--alas!, nor about the fact that we shout louder than anyone else. The most important thing is that we have been able to foresee, to sense the attitudes in society which have become ever more obvious in the course of the year. We publish reflective articles to counterweigh the political prattle which is intolerable for people engaged in important matters. We suggest that we not waste time waiting for ideal heroes to come to power. It is more useful to judge about what is going on from moral positions, for all to hear, without hiding the truth about the leading persons and executors. In returning the name "Obshchaya" [common] to the newspaper, we understood that the greatest deficit of our times is the deficit of commonality with the states surrounding Russia, and within it--commonality between people. The current general propensity toward reunification, toward accord, which is being raised up by the popular wave in spite of the calculations of various politicians, confirms the fact: Here too, we were not wrong.
