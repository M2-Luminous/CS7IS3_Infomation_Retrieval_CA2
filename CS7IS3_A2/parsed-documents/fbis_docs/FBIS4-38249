From this place, we extend our thanks and great appreciation for the Arab people everywhere, who are siding with our Yemeni people in this grave ordeal that erupted on 4 May, led by the traitor, agent and renegade 'Ali Salim al-Bid. O dear brothers, O great Yemeni people, O sons of Saba' and Himyar: Just as you held your ground, defended and championed your will on 26 September and 14 October, you will champion the justice and dignity of 22 May 1990. [applause] O brothers and sisters, O sons of our Yemeni people everywhere: In your name, we extend our great appreciation to the masses of our Arab nation everywhere in the east and the Maghreb of the Arab nation, the Gulf, and the Horn of Africa, who are siding with you in defense of your unity. You are not only fighting the separatist clique on the battlefield. You know who has conspired against your Yemeni unity. [applause] We are fighting this clique, which we can describe as traitorous. Today, they are loitering at the hotel doors to express their loyalty to the regimes that pay them filthy money and to receive the price of unity and the price of the pure blood being shed. They are rushing to the doors of hotels, offices, and embassies abroad. History will not forgive these agent, renegade traitors. They will not be heroes in making unity or heroes in achieving victory. History records only the names of people who make great achievements. [applause] Successive resolutions are being issued by the Security Council. In addition, some regimes and brothers in the Arab world, as well as some friends are shedding crocodile tears over Yemeni blood. We tell them from this place, the Hall of Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir, the great Arab leader [applause]: Do not shed crocodile tears, but stop harming our people. [applause] Stop harming our people and interfering in the internal affairs of the homeland of September and October. The pure blood being shed today is shed to entrench Yemeni unity. [applause] We greet each woman who gave birth to a struggler to defend Yemeni unity. Our people today are rushing to embrace (?death) and are acting out of an absolutely free will to defend unity. The blood being shed today in Dar Sa'd, al-Shaykh 'Uthman, al-Mansurah, the city of al-Sha'b, and (?Mandar) in Aden, will not be for secession or to install the secessionist in Aden as rulers. This pure blood is being shed to preserve unity and destroy this separatist, rebellious clique. No matter what successive resolutions are issued, we will never accept the implementation of a secessionist resolution. [applause] No matter what successive resolutions are issued -- to install the traitor al-Bid; the treasonous al-Jifri; al-'Attas, who is loitering at the doors of intelligence services; and the third traitor who is sentenced to death, al-Asnaj -- we will never ever accept their installation under any circumstances. Dear brothers, we welcome the Security Council resolutions that call for a cease-fire. We have said time and time again that we are willing to cooperate with Security Council resolutions to effect a cease-fire and start dialogue with the oppressed elements for the sake of unity and democracy in Yemen. [applause] We are willing to respond to, and cooperate with, these resolutions that call for a cease-fire, in spite of the strenuous efforts and hardship that some brothers have had to endure to quickly bring about such resolutions. We highly appreciate their interest in Yemen. We had hoped that the greatest service they would do to Yemen would be to stop harming Yemen. [applause] Dear brothers and sisters: We invite the local, party and foreign press in our country to head for the battlefield to ascertain that the cease-fire, which we announced six times, has been violated and that the traitors, secessionists, outlaws who departed from legitimacy do not want a cease-fire. We knew beforehand what they seek to achieve by violating the cease-fire. They seek to bring in international troops to observe the situation in Yemen. The [UN] Charter and [international] law do not allow any observation or international troops without the approval of all parties. So no matter how quickly these resolutions are issued, there must be an approval by the parties in the Yemeni Republic. We are the major party, the Yemeni people, in the face of the rebels. It is not the General People's Congress, the Yemeni Reform Grouping, the Arab Ba'th Party, the Nasirist Party, or any other party in the Yemeni homeland, but it is the people, who are one party in the face of the forces of apostasy and secession. Once again, we call on our brothers, beloved ones, and neighbors to stop harming us, to stop harming the Yemeni people. They must be certain that, just as we remained steadfast in the fighting and confrontation, with our limited potentials, in defense of the Yemeni revolution from 26 September 1962 until 1970, we are also ready once again to defend the Yemeni Republic that was declared on 22 May 1990. [applause] We do not fight on the front as an army, as parties, or organizations. The Yemeni people are spontaneously and freely moving to the front to defend unity. Some are shedding crocodile tears over brave Aden, the second capital, fearing it will be destroyed or hit by the machine guns or the artillery shells of the forces of legitimacy. All these bullets and shells are fired by those who deviated from legitimacy. You know about the biased media covering this and distorting the facts. When the Republican Hospital area in Sanaa was hit by Scud missiles, the biased media said this destroyed area and the dead women and children were located in Aden. Such is the fairness of the friendly media of those who are concerned about the bloodshed in Yemen. The biased media want to fragment the Yemeni homeland. We say to them, from this place, that Yemen will not be fragmented, will not become two Yemens, and will not become four or even five Yemens. Yemen will remain one and united. [applause] They should know that the 2 billion dollars they spent during the crisis will not bring them success. The military and political infrastructure [of the southerners] was completely destroyed in five weeks, thanks to the will of the Yemeni people. They want to destroy Yemen unity. Are they ready to pay another 2 billion? They should spend another 2 billion for construction, for sisterly Sudan, for Somalia, and for all the Arab homeland. They should leave Yemen alone. Yemen will continue to exist on the political and geographical map. [applause] No force in the world can change the Yemeni people, remove them from the political map of the southern Arabian Peninsula, or move them to any other place. The Yemeni people will continue to exist on the political and geographical map. If some regimes are hostile to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is one Yemeni citizen. Why are they making the Yemeni people pay the price? I did not come to Yemen, to the homeland, on the political decision of another country. I am a citizen of this land. [applause] Why do we not respect people's freedom? Why do they lack respect for our will, as we respect them and respect neighborliness? Why do they not stop harming us and stop interfering in our internal affairs? The Yemeni people have not interfered in others' affairs. Dear brothers: In your name, I greet your sons and beloved ones in the axes of military operations, asking God to grant them splendid victory. In your name, we thank the brothers and friends for their sincere support of Yemeni unity. We hope the other friends will not change their stands, that they will maintain their stands as they were at the beginning. Some announced, at the beginning of the crisis, that they support unity and democracy. However, at the end of the war, they began to say something else. They began to speak about stopping bloodshed. We said: Have you received the price? We hope positions will not change. [applause] We extend the hand of cooperation to all those who respect our will, principles, values, ideals, and faith. We extend the hand of cooperation to all those who respect the will of this nation. Those who think that Yemenis will bow down must realize that we bow only to God almighty. [applause] The Yemeni people will never bow to any force in the world. We fight for our dignity, for our existence, for our sovereignty, for our belief, and for living peacefully on our Yemeni land. Our unity will not (?pose) any danger to any other country. It is the unity of the Yemeni people and a unity for the Arab nation, for the good and unionist Arabs. Dear brothers: God willing, when the war stops the future will shine, based on national, modern scientific bases, on all political, social, cultural, and administrative levels. We will expand local government power in all Yemeni governorates. The sons of the governorates will elect their administrative leaders in their areas. [applause] Local governments will have full control over all their affairs, except for the sovereign resources of the Republic of Yemen. Citizens will elect their local councils, governors, and commissioners throughout Yemen. [applause] Dear brothers: We are passing through a crisis and a war. However, the war did not start on 4 May and the crisis did not start on 2 August. The crisis began when the secessionists took their government posts after 22 May 1990. Since then, the Yemeni people have been living a real crisis. The unity festival lasted only six months. After contacting their brothers and friends, who are known for their love and respect for Yemen, the crisis began and the Yemeni people began to suffer from this crisis. Our greetings to you all and to the Arab Committee for the Defense of Yemeni Unity. Greetings to all professors, to all thinkers, and to all authors. Greetings to all of you in the name of our Yemeni people, wishing you success and victory. God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you.
