FR940426-0-00067 FR940426-0-00014 40 CFR Part 271 [FRL&hyph;4878&hyph;6] Georgia; Final Authorization of Revisions to State Hazardous Waste Management Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Immediate final rule. SUMMARY: Georgia has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Georgia's revisions consist of the provisions contained in RCRA Cluster II which are the hazardous waste rules promulgated between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992. These requirements are listed in section B of this notice. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Georgia's application and has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that the Georgia hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Georgia's hazardous waste program revisions. Georgia's application for program revisions is available for public review and comment. DATES: Final authorization for Georgia's program revisions shall be effective June 27, 1994 unless EPA publishes a prior Federal Register action withdrawing this immediate final rule. All comments on Georgia's program revision application must be received by the close of business, May 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to A.R. Hanke at the address listed below. Copies of Georgia's program revision application are available during normal business hours at the following addresses for inspection and copying: Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Waste Management Branch, 205 Butler Street SE., Floyd Towers East, Atlanta, Georgia 30334, phone (404) 656&hyph;2833; USEPA Region IV, Library, 345 Courtland Street NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365; (404) 347&hyph;4216. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: A.R. Hanke, Chief, State Programs Section, Waste Programs Branch, Waste Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 345 Courtland Street NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365; (404) 347&hyph;2234. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270. B. Georgia Georgia initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on August 21, 1984. Georgia received authorization for revisions to its program for RCRA Cluster I on January 12, 1994 (11/16/93; FR 60388). Today, Georgia is seeking approval of its program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3) for rules promulgated between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992, otherwise known as RCRA Cluster II. EPA has reviewed Georgia's RCRA Cluster II application and has made an immediate final decision that Georgia's hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Georgia. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until May 26, 1994. Copies of Georgia's application for these program revisions are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the addresses section of this notice. Approval of Georgia's program revisions shall become effective May 26, 1994 unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.
