Simashko under the ``Signal Processing'' rubric; received after rework Aug. 9, 1991; UDC 621.396.6] [Abstract] An important task of a system for establishing communications (SEC) in navigation and command systems and communication radio systems is to measure signal carrier frequency and provide target indication to the frequency tracking system. The objective of the work was to study algorithms for measuring the carrier frequency of a continuous phase manipulated signal that use two fast Fourier transform (FFT) readings of a discrete complex spectrum and comparing them to known algorithms using one FFT reading. The article analyzes the case when symbols boundaries are unknown. Analysis methods are described. Synchronous and asynchronous SEC operating modes are examined. The synchronous mode yields a lower average carrier frequency measurement error than an asynchronous mode. The asynchronous mode makes it possible to reduce frequency estimate shift and in certain cases yields a lower maximum error than the synchronous mode. Figures 3, references 4.
