To hide the reality of its bias toward Israel in making this decision, Hurd suggested that Britain is ready to reconsider the arms embargo the European Union has imposed on Syria, but only if the Syrian-Israeli negotiations make progress. The British decision is strange in more ways than one. It is clearly biased toward Israel, since it provides that country with the chance to stockpile more weapons within the framework of what is called qualitative military superiority, which the West in general and the United States in particular have tried to secure for Israel over the years in confronting the Arab World. It is also strange because this decision is wrapped in the slogan of peace. Everyone knows that weapons are the exact opposite of true peace and that any progress toward peace requires a real decrease in armaments and strict supervision of the weapons in the region. These topics are supposed to be handled by the multilateral armament supervision committee, which came out of the Madrid conference. In fact, the British decision was not the only one that contradicts the spirit and goals of the peace process in the region. Since the convention of the Madrid peace conference, the United States has provided Israel with many guarantees that it will enable that country to continue its military superiority and will continue to provide it with huge military aid. France also agreed with Israel recently to terminate the freeze on military cooperation between the two sides. Thus, at a time when the West is hoisting the banner of bolstering the peace process in the region, in practice it is bolstering Israel's military power, which contradicts the objectives of the peace process and the roles the United States and Europe are supposed to play. This also strengthens the existing doubts that the talk about peace is contrary to real intentions. Who needs weapons during the age of peace? Who will these arms be directed against? The essential question posed to Britain and other countries that are hastening to change their previous stances that were based on the major causes of the conflict, foremost of which is the Israeli occupation, is: Has the Israeli occupation of Palestinian and Arab territories ended? And does taking new stances really contribute toward ending this occupation and eliminating the reasons for the Arab-Israeli conflict, or are they a new contribution by the West to strengthen Israel's adherence to the stances that it still proposes to this day and that are the major obstacles to a just peace?
