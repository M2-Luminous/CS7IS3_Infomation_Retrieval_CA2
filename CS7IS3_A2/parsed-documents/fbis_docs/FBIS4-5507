Recognizing that this joint meeting has been convened at a very opportune time, now I am going to present a report "On Promoting the Indpendent and Peaceful Reunification of the Country by Thoroughly Implementing the 10-Point Program of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for National Reunification," presented to the meeting as an agenda item. As everyone knows, last April, at a grim time when a dangerous situation--in which a war could have broken out at any time on the Korean peninsula and in which the nation's supreme interest might have been infringed upon--was created due to the anti-republic maneuvers by outside forces and their followers, a handful of antinational forces, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song published the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for national reunification, which he personally worked out based on his outstanding plan to open the nation's way of living by turning adversity into prosperity with the whole nation's united strength. [applause] The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation, personally worked out by the great leader and adopted as the common action program of the nation for the peaceful reunification at the historic fifth session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly [SPA], brilliantly elucidates a wide road that can eliminate barriers lying on the road of national reunification with the nation's independent strength and achieve peace in the country and its independent and peaceful reunification. The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation clearly elucidates first of all the program's basic ideology for all of those who are concerned about the nation's destiny to firmly unite as one nation, transcending the differences in their residential districts and advocacy of ideology, and to make characteristic contributions for the country's reunification and for grandeur and prosperity of a reunified fatherland. The 10-point program also clearly elucidates the general goal of great national unity on founding an independent, peaceful, neutral, and pannational reunified state through great national unity; the ideological foundation of great national unity based on the love toward the nation and the spirit of national independence; and the principle of unity on achieving the nation's coexistence, coprosperity, and common interests and on serving everything for the cause of national reunification. The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation also extensively presents practical ways for great national unity, including the matters on suspending all hostile activities and on achieving mutual trust and unity between the North and the South; the matter on advancing toward the road of national reunification together, irrespective of one's advocacy of an ideology; the matter on protecting all assets belonging to individuals and groups and effectively utilizing them for national unity; the matter on achieving mutual understanding and trust of fellow countrymen and their unity through contacts, visits, and dialogue; and the matter on highly assessing those who have contributed to great national unity and to the cause of national reunification. The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for national reunification is a great encyclopedia for national unity and the banner of national unity which integrates the valuable tradition of great national unity established in the days when the respected and beloved leader founded the Fatherland Restoration Society [FRS]--an original anti-Japanese national united front organization--during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and led the anti-Japanese struggle for national liberation to victory by propagating the 10-point program of the FRS. The 10-point program also integrates the noble struggle experience attained in the struggle for building a new society and national reunification after the liberation. [applause] The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation, which contains the respected and beloved leader's idea of great national unity and his noble will for reunification and patriotism, is the most reasonable and realistic great political program for national unity and a great charter for national reunification to which anyone who truly loves the country and the nation and desires national reunification can consent because of its thoroughly independent, patriotic, nation-loving, fair, and just position incorporating all situations. [applause] The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation is the noble crystalization of the great, broad politics and benevolence politics of our leader, who has devoted his entire life since he set off on the road of the revolution shouldering the destiny of the country and the nation for the country's independence and the national growth and prosperity all by himself and who embraces each fellow countryman with a boundlessly broad mind, accepting even those who committed crimes before the nation broadmindedly and generously, and leading the 70 million people toward reunification with tender care. [applause] Truly, that the respected and beloved leader promulgated the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for national reunification and bestowed the great program for national reunification on the entire fellow countrymen is another immortal achievement he has made in the glorious history of the struggle to pioneer the destiny of the country and the nation with great unity of the nation. It is a political event which has opened a new chapter of great national unity that must be recorded in national history as a remarkable event. [applause] The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation commanded our nation's full support and consensus as soon as it was promulgated as it elucidated the ways to overcome the prevailing crisis and bring a breakthrough in the way of the nation. It vigorously encouraged and gave a strong impetus to the forward movement of the entire fellow countrymen toward national unity and national reunification. As soon as the great leader's great historic reunification program was promulgated, the movement to implement the program was vigorously conducted as a pannational movement in the North, the South, and overseas, and the yearning of the entire nation for reunification became more intense than ever. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il--who devotes his all to bring our nation a reunified country upholding the noble will of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song--elucidated specific directions and ways to vigorously wage the struggle to implement the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation on the basis of the entire nation. He exercised his wise leadership so that all the fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and overseas may unite on a pannational basis and launch themselves into the national movement to expedite and achieve reunification in the nineties. [applause] Under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, we, in the northern half of the republic, have made every sincere effort to achieve reunification in the 1990's on united national strength under the uplifted banner of the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation. In April 1993, we sent the text of the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for national reunification to the authorities, political parties, public organizations, and individual personages in South Korea, including the chief executive [choegodanggukcha], and overseas compatriots, via international mail or various other means. And, in May 1993, we proposed an exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and South out of a single desire to open a road of national survival with the united efforts of the North and South and have repeatedly taken momentous measures to implement this proposal. We also took positive measures last year to hold a pannational rally, which had taken place every year since 1990, in Seoul as a festival for the unity of the entire nation, both in name and in reality. We also opened the door to independent civilian dialogue [chajusonginnun mingan taehwa] and have made patient efforts to hold such dialogue. South Korean people from all walks of life highly extolled the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation, describing it as the only banner of great national unity and a bright lighthouse that lights up the road of reunification, and are positively participating in the patriotic movement to implement this program. The 5 million overseas compatriots residing in the five continents of the world have also launched the movement to collect 1 million signatures to implement the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation. They also proposed that this year be a year of great national unity and are vigorously waging a struggle for reunification and patriotism. Revolutionary people of the world greatly supported and welcomed the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation because of its justness and compelling force. Over 200 party and state leaders of the world have sent us messages or letters of solidarity to express their firm support for the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation. Furthermore, solidarity organizations in over 100 countries of the world, including the Asian Regional Committee for Korea's Reunification and the African Regional Committee for Friendship and Solidarity With the Korean People, are boldly launching the movement worldwide to support the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation. This worldwide solidarity movement launched greatly encourages our people and vigorously inspires all fellow countrymen into a struggle for reunification and patriotism. For the past year since the release of the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for national reunification, the historic work of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, compatriots in the North and South and overseas have been launching a reunification and patriotic movement for national reconciliation and unity, and the movement to extend solidarity with our people's struggle for independent, peaceful reunification has been launched worldwide. This vigorously demonstrates at home and abroad the justness and vitality of the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation. This also shows that a new phase is being opened for national unity and fatherland reunification under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. On this occasion, when we are discussing practical measures to achieve reunification in the 1990's based the great unity of the whole nation, I, with the unanimous loyalty of all fellow countrymen, respectfully extend the great honor and warmest thanks to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, a peerless patriot, national hero, and lodestar of the fatherland's reunification, who released the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation, thus, brightly elucidating the road toward the fatherland's independent, peaceful reunification, and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, our nation's destiny and symbol of the fatherland's reunification, who is leading us to break through the prevailing difficulties and achieve reunification in the 1990's on united national strength. [applause] Comrades, achieving the great national unity by implementing the 10-point program of the great unity of the entire nation for national reunification is a very important matter related to the life and death of the nation today. In his 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for national reunification, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The unanimous demands and will of the whole nation is to achieve national reunification by terminating the history of division and confrontation which has lasted for nearly half a century. The whole nation should achieve a great unity to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland. The great unity of the whole nation is a basic condition for the independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland. The reunification we desire is for the whole nation to harmonize and unite as one. The 70 million fellow countrymen in the North, South, and abroad should first unite as one nation in any place and in whatever work, to consummate the historic cause for the national reunification, transcending differences in thought [sasang], ideologies [inyom], and systems. The country's stern tensions created by outside forces and their few flunkeyistic and nation-selling follower forces within the nation require that we take more decisive steps [kyolchongjok chochilul chwihalgosul yoguhago issupnida] than ever before to achieve the great unity of the nation. As is already known, the South Korean authorities, who finally broke up the exchange of special envoys appointed by the North-South highest authorities--which had been newly initiated by our side and carried out amid the great expectations and interest of the people at home and abroad--are unprecedentedly kicking up a reckless commotion of confrontation as a shock brigade of the imperialist reactionaries' anti-socialist and anti-republic plots and leading our country to the worst situation of extreme danger [wihomchonmanhan choeagui satae]. Along with the United States, they have already formulated the so-caled New Operational Plan No. 5027 to invade our republic and have largely introduced lethal equipment--including fighter bombers, assault planes, and Patriot missiles--to South Korea from the United States. They have not only decided to again resume the provocative Team Spirit joint military exercise--which they had previously decided not to conduct--but also have inspired the atmosphere of war [chonjaeng punwigi] at home and abroad by loudly babbling that they should crush [apsal] someone by force. Based on the unreasonable statement issued by the UN Security Council president, the South Korean authorities intend to escalate the commotion of pressure [apryok sodong] against us. Also, they are going to set a fire on a point of nuclear war by giving impetus to the nuclear development. This clearly shows that the South Korean authorities have canceled the North-South agreement, promising nonaggression; nullified an agreement on converting the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free zone; and pursued only confrontation and war. It is clear to everyone that when a fuse of nuclear war is ignited on the Korean peninsula, this will bring ruin to our country, as well as destroy our nation. It is now the time for all 70 million fellow countrymen in the North, South, and abroad to unite as one in order to solve all problems arising in our nation from the principle of national independence. All fellow countrymen in the North, South, and abroad should unite as one for the sake of national interest; prevent the disaster of an approaching nuclear war [tagaonun haekchonjaengui]; remove the wall of division; and open doors for independent and peaceful reunification. To make all fellow countrymen in the North, South, and abroad firmly unite as one under the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for national reunification, an arena for national dialogue reflecting the intention and demands of the 70 million fellow countrymen should be prepared. All Korean compatriots should be aware of their lofty sense of responsibility and duty of being not only the masters who are responsible for the nation's destiny, but also the persons directly pioneering the nation's destiny, should confirm through frank dialogue that they are fellow countrymen who cannot live divided, and should seek concrete ways to achieve national unity as one nation, transcending ideologies and systems. Proceeding from this desire we courteously propose to the South Korean authorities, political parties, and public organizations, individual figures, and compatriots overseas that a national conference be convened in either Pyongyang or Seoul to seek ways for great unity of the entire nation with the upcoming 15 August, one year prior to the 50th anniversary of national liberation, as an occasion. [applause] The national conference may be in the form of a roundtable conference in which the authorities, representatives of political parties and public organizations, and individual personages in the North and the South and representatives from the compatriots overseas participate are on an equal footing. The conference may open-heartedly discuss the matters the whole nation is interested in, including practical measures to achieve great unity of the whole nation and the nation's common tasks which are raised as indispensable requirements in expediting reunification in the nineties. Reflecting the desire of the compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas, I propose to send a letter containing the proposal for convening a national conference to the authorities, political parties, public organizations, individual personages in South Korea and to the compatriots overseas in the name of this joint meeting. The letter containing our proposal for convening the national conference will, without doubt, evoke active support and sympathy among the compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas. Also, I acknowledge that it is necessary to form a national conference preparatory committee composed of five delegates each from the North and South and overseas in order to successfully convene the national conference. We think that it would be good to hold the first meeting of the national conference preparatory committee in Pyongyang or Seoul in around mid-May. On this occasion, we demand that the South Korean authorities discontinue nuclear war exercises and abandon the international cooperation system for the sake of the great unity of the whole nation based on a stand of national independence and, thus, promote a favorable atmosphere for convening the national conference. Our just patriotic cause of achieving the fatherland's reunification, the historic cause and the nation's earnest desire, with the great unity of the whole nation is ever-victorious. Let us all more vigorously fight to achieve peace in the country and achieve reunification in the nineties based on the great unity of the whole nation in hearty response to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. [applause]
