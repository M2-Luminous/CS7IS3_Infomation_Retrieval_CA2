The breakthrough was manifested in the agreement to set up working groups on specific issues, and especially the agreement to move the talks to Elat and al-'Aqabah. Political elements said that following Israeli-Jordanian contacts held before the encounter, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin consented to discuss borders -- an issue which Israel had earlier opposed discussing -- while Jordan consented in principle to move the talks to the region. [passage omitted] A senior Foreign Ministry source said, however, that the process would be long, possibly a year or two. He explained that objective difficulties, such as border demarcation and water resources control are part of the cause, but mainly he based his estimates on the assumption that al-Asad will not permit Husayn to clinch a separate deal with Israel. What caused the turnabout in King Husayn's foreign policy? Jerusalem elements point to several reasons. King Husayn believes that a breakthrough on the Israeli-Syrian track is imminent. He, too, is aware of the intensive U.S. mediation, and he is afraid of being left out of the process. Syria, too, finds the presence of another partner convenient. Members of the Israeli delegation to talks with Jordan, who returned home last night, said their impression from the encounter with the Jordanians was that al-Asad had given Husayn a green light to make progress, albeit up to a certain point only, because he is not about to allow Jordan to sign a separate peace agreement. An additional reason has to do with the Palestinians. Husayn, who was skeptical about the Israeli-PLO agreement, is now witnessing the implementation of that agreement, and he does not want facts -- particularly in the economic sphere -- to be established on the ground without his involvement and without consideration for Jordanian interests.
