FBIS4-66267 "jpcar032___94022" JPRS-CAR-94-032 JPRS China 15 February 1994 HONG KONG, MACAO Political Attitudes of Senior HS Students Surveyed Political Attitudes of Senior HS Students Surveyed 94CM0266A Hong Kong TANGTAI [CONTEMPORARY] in Chinese No 35, 15 Feb 94 pp 8-10 94CM0266A Hong Kong TANGTAI [CONTEMPORARY] Chinese CSO [Article by the Hong Kong Urban Engineering Institute, Baptist Institute, and Study Friendship Society (Xueyou She)] [Excerpts] Those concerned at the Hong Kong City Engineering Institute, the Baptist Institute, and the Study Friendship Society recently did a study of citizenship education entitled "The Political Transition Period in Hong Kong: Political Attitudes of Senior High School Students." [passage omitted] Approximately 50 percent of senior high school students support direct elections to all levels of the Legislative Council and Legislative Council members: 1994 regional legislative councils (53 percent), 1995 municipal and regional councils (51 percent) and 1995 Legislative Council bureaus (48 percent); however, 30 percent of those interviewed had no opinion. When calculated on a scale from zero to one hundred, (where zero represents all disagree strongly and 100 represents all agree strongly), a rather low 62 points of students gave average support for third-level Legislative Council direct elections. Originally, it was generally thought students were rather idealized; therefore, 62-point support was quite far from our predictions. More students born in Hong Kong support direct elections (by five points) than those born in China. Statistically, this is a notable difference, indicating that cultural and attitudinal factors affect whether senior high school students support direct elections. [passage omitted] Although 38 percent of senior high school students agree that "the Basic Law can ensure rule by law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1997" and 50 percent agree "one country with two systems in Hong Kong is feasible." Nevertheless, less than one-third of senior high school students agree that "the government in Beijing respects the Sino-British Joint Accord" (29 percent) and "will respect the Basic Law" (28 percent). On a zero to 100 scale, the average value of confidence in China's promises by those interviewed was 51. More students born in China (by eight points) than in Hong Kong believe China's promises. Likewise, this is a statistically significant difference. From this it can be seen that senior high school students' differing opinions regarding support of direct elections and confidence in China's promises are related to place of birth. [passage omitted] Approximately 50 percent of those interviewed agree "if a communist desires to publish a speech supporting communism, he should be allowed to do so" ( 49 percent) and "when a communist is elected legally as a Hong Kong Legislative Council member, the residents of Hong Kong should allow him to hold office" (51 percent). The Hong Kong government has promoted citizenship education for eight years now. Surprisingly, only 60 percent of those interviewed agree "minorities should have the freedom to criticize majority decisions." Senior high school students' average political leniency value was 60 on a zero to 100 scale, which is rather low. The concepts of freedom and democracy in middle-school education are not broadly accepted by senior high-school students. [passage omitted] Some 30 percent of senior high school students oppose lowering the voting age to 18 years; 25 percent had no opinion and 45 percent agreed. Comparatively speaking, the senior high school students who disagreed were mainly females or those 18 years and older. As expected, they have no intention of registering to vote or casting ballots in the 1995 elections. The aforementioned results indicate that citizenship education has not been effectively promoted among senior high school students, or else perhaps the students were unable to accept sufficient citizenry education training as expected. [passage omitted] Senior high school students will vote for Legislative Council members according to the following factors: Record of past experience (87 percent), political affiliation (86 percent), degree of education (78 percent), professional qualifications (73 percent), political party background (56 percent), eloquence (41 percent), relationship to China (40 percent), age (36 percent), glamour and looks (13 percent), and sex (nine percent). Senior high school students pay relatively greater attention to the first four "rational factors" in voting for Legco members. A "candidate's inclinations" and "inclinations towards matters" more strongly influence students' voter behavior rather than "political party inclination." [passage omitted] Some 69 percent of those interviewed indicated that if they were qualified to vote in the 1995 elections, they would register to vote in the 1995 Legco elections; 75 percent of them indicated that if they register to vote in the 1995 Legco elections, they will do so. If we subtract the influence of the "social desirability effect," fewer will actually register to vote and cast ballots. This brings up the old issue of how to turn intention to vote into actual voting in the Hong Kong environment. Although the older the senior high school student, the relatively greater the indication to register to vote and cast a ballot, but the relationships therein are not so clear. School seniority has a positively clear influence: Those interviewed of higher seniority comparatively tend to register and vote. Other social and cultural factors such as sex, place of birth, religious beliefs and family income had no significant influence. [passage omitted] Hong Kong senior high school students lack confidence in the Chinese Government, engendering rather low political tolerance. Rather low political tolerance is unfavorable to promote democracy in society. Their low support for direct elections and a lower voting age reflects insufficient citizenship education in school. On the contrary, they indicate a rational side to voting for Legislative Council members. They have appropriate support for registering to vote and casting ballots. In the future 1994 and 1995 elections, this group of new electorates can be seen as politically conservative. They will not be aroused by those political parties who try to please the public with claptrap. [passage omitted]
