Soon, 338 people's deputies, elected as a result of two rounds of voting, will occupy their seats at the Supreme Council. Repeat elections will be held in 112 electoral districts. These data were quoted at a news conference on 13 April by chairman of the Central Electoral Commission Ivan Yemets. He said that the elections had proceeded very actively on an alternative basis and in acute political struggle. Broad openness was ensured at all stages, something that observers from numerous international organizations also noted. Ivan Yemets briefed reporters on the party composition of the new parliament. According to tentative data, 89 deputies, nominated by parties, have been elected to the Supreme Council. The Communist Party has won the greatest number of seats -- 59. Rukh [Ukraine's People's Movement for Perestroyka] has 12 representatives [in parliament] and Socialists and Republicans -- six seats each. However, in view of the fact that individual deputies were nominated by labor collectives, the political spectrum has a somewhat different character. More than 25 percent of the parliamentarians are Communists, about 6 percent represent Rukh, 5 percent are Socialists, and 4 percent are representatives of the Peasants' Party. There are 169 nonaligned deputies. As in the preceding Supreme Council, there are also few women in the new one -- just 12.
