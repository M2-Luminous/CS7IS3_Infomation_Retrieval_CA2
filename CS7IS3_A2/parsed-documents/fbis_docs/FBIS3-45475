Addressing a provincial economic conference which opened here Tuesday [11 January], Wan said that Zhejiang's gross domestic product (GDP) -- the value of goods and services produced -- is expected to total 164.5 billion yuan last year, up 25 percent over 1992. He also released other figures illustrating Zhejiang's impressive economic growth in 1993: industrial output value is projected to shoot up 52.5 percent to 392.8 billion yuan; retail sales are expected to climb 33 percent to 75.9 billion yuan; exports are projected to jump nearly 20 percent to 4.44 billion U.S. dollars; and revenue is expected to soar almost 39 percent to 16.6 billion yuan. The governor said that the GDP of Zhejiang, with a population of 43 million, has risen at an annual rate of 12 percent since 1980. Local officials and economists attending the conference agreed that Zhejiang's rapid economic growth stems primarily from the expanding a market economy in line with specific conditions in the province. Conference delegates will discuss measures to step up the reforms and accelerate economic growth in the new year, with emphasis on enhancing the consciousness of opening up and expanding an open economy. Governor Wan said higher consciousness of opening to the outside world makes it imperative to break away from what he called the idea of a "small-scale peasant economy," and to effect fundamental changes in the way of thinking and work styles. According to Wan, the BOT (build, operate and transfer) method -- which means that a facility is built and operated by an overseas company before transferring it to Chinese authorities after a given period -- should be adopted in using foreign funds to undertake major infrastructure construction projects.
