Leading cadres should take the initiative to launch a down-to-earth study campaign and vie with each other for more efforts and better efficiency in study so as to ensure smooth progress in the work of all fields. The forum was presided over by Hu Jingtao, Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and president of the Central Party School. Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and Secretariat; and Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee; were present at the forum. Jiang Zemin said: Our party has always set great store by study. Whenever revolution and construction develops to a critical turning point and whenever the whole party faces a new situation and tasks, we stress even more the need to study. Every step of advance taken and every victory won in our party's cause during the past several decades are inseparable from the study and advancement made by all party comrades. Fruitful results of extensive study by the entire party membership were especially conspicuous during the Yanan period and on the eve of nationwide liberation. Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, China's endeavor to build socialism entered a new development period. At Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal, the party launched a campaign to renew study. The remarkable achievements in China's economic reform and development over the past more than a decade should, to a large extent, be attributed to our efforts to study. Looking back at our party's experiences over the past several decades, it is of crucial importance to steadfastly take our own road by persistently integrating the basic tenents of Marxism with China's reality, and to diligently study and continually do pioneering work based on the demand of the situation and tasks facing the party in different periods of time. It is precisely because our party upholds the fine tradition of study and continually promotes and strengthens the integration of the Marxist theory with China's national conditions based on changes in the situation and tasks that our party has been able to overcome dangers and difficulties, to develop from a small and weak to a big and strong party, to unite and lead the broad masses of people in taking the road of revolution and construction commensurate with China's national strength, to open up a new situation, and to advance from victory to victory. Jiang Zemin emphasized: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 14th CPC National Congress set the establishment of a socialist market economic structure as the objective of reform. A blueprint for a new economic structure has been drawn up in the decision adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Our reform has entered a new stage of combining package reform with breakthroughs in key economic, political, cultural, and social areas. At present, we all realize that the rapidly-changing situation presents to us many new and thorny problems and the difficulty in our work has increased. All these explain that the establishment of a brand new economic system for further emancipating and expanding productive forces and expediting the pace of socialist modernization has set a new and higher demand for our level of theory, policy, knowledge, and work. There are many things we are not familiar with or do not understand at all. What should we do? The way out is to admit our weaknesses and conscientiously study and master new knowledge and skills. Moreover, we should realize that China's socialist modernization drive is being carried out amidst a complicated and everchanging international environment. The world today is characterized by fierce competition, with the competition for economic and overall national strength as the core issue. In a sense, it is also a competition for talented people, for the ability of leaders and the quality of nations. Amidst fierce international competition, we must seize the opportunity to develop ourselves and become invincible. We must work and study hard. With a big party, big country, big population, our nation cannot effect a real take-off and succeed in modernization if we fail to arm ourselves with scientific theory and to master new knowledge in various fields. Therefore, the issue of study concerns not only the advancement of cadres at large, but also the prosperity of the country and its people and the success of the modernization drive. The entire party membership and the whole nation must reach this consensus. Touching on what leading cadres need to study in the face of the new situation and tasks, Jiang Zemin said: Two important aspects need to be studied: first, Marxist theory and, second, social practice and the practices of the masses of the people. At present, so far as the requirements for leadership work are concerned, the most fundamental need is to study well the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Meanwhile, efforts must be made to study the basic knowledge of a socialist market economy and its related principles, policies, laws, and regulations; the basic knowledge of modern science and technology; and the experiences of Chinese history and, in particular, of modern history and the world history of socialism. Jiang Zemin stressed once again that it is necessary to firmly grasp the quintessence of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts and to study hard and have a thorough understanding of the world outlook and methodology of dialectical materialism and historical materialism contained in Comrade Xiaoping's works when we study his theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. He said: After we have adopted a correct stand, viewpoint, and method, it will be relatively easy for us to have a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the party's line, principles, policies, and various reform plans and prevent one-sidedness or absoluteness; to reach a consensus and reduce unnecessary disputes when we carry them out; and to encourage a pioneering and realistic spirit as well as a spirit to blaze new trails and to avoid subjectivism and blindness when we handle tasks. Having a thorough understanding of more materialist dialectics and reducing idealism and metaphysics through study is an important requirement for leading cadres at all levels. When studying historical materialism at present, we must place more emphases on the mass viewpoint of Marxism and on the party's mass line. It is necessary for us to adhere to the party's basic line, to implement the party's various principles and policies, to improve the work style of leadership, to successfully carry out various tasks, to remold our world outlook, and to enhance our ability to resist corruption and prevent peaceful evolution. Comrade Jiang Zemin called on party schools at all levels to further successfully implement the principle of integrating theory with practice. He said: Integrating theory with practice is a fine tradition, a fine work style, a good style of study, and a particularly strong point of our party. Persisting in integrating theory with practice is an important issue that must be solved when we strengthen and improve theoretical study and an important principle for us to successfully carry out our tasks. If we want to achieve a new breakthrough in promoting reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, we must work hard to make big progress in integrating theory with practice. At present, the problems of inadequate study of theory and losing contact with reality exist among our cadres; the issue of integrating theory with practice remains to be satisfactorily solved. If we want to strengthen and improve the work of party schools, to improve the quality of their education, and to enhance the level of their scientific research, fundamentally speaking, we must further successfully solve the issue of integrating theory with practice by proceeding from their characteristics. If we want to persist in integrating theory with practice, first of all, we must attach importance to studying theory well. It is extremely important for us to unswervingly adhere to the party's basic line for a hundred years. The party's basic line is established on the basis of scientific theory. Only by unswervingly upholding the party's basic theory can we unswervingly adhere to its basic line. The evolution of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics signals that the level of our party's theory has reached a new height. However, it does not mean that all party organizations and all party-member cadres automatically solve the problem of arming themselves with theory. A process of assiduous study is needed to fulfill the task. Persisting in using theory to guide practice is the fundamental purpose of our theoretical study. We must integrate our study of the party's basic theory with our party's history, with the reality of our work, and with the reality of our ideology; we must sum up experiences and lessons; and we must enhance our consciousness of correctly implementing the party's basic line in an all-around way and strengthen our resolve in this endeavor. Jiang Zemin urged party committees at all levels to treat the work of educating cadres on the important status and role of party schools in the light of the overall strategic situation of socialist modernization and from the high plane of long-term peace and stability of the party and the state. Resolute efforts should be made to prevent and overcome such short-term behavior as paying attention to making use of personnel to the neglect of cultivating more talented persons. Due attention should be paid to the integration of the selection, use, and cultivation of cadres. He said: Over the past years, party schools at all levels have achieved great results in cultivating many leading cadres and talented personnel in theoretic fields. The current issue is that party schools should suit themselves to the new situation and enhance teaching quality. Party committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership and guide party schools to center around the work of the whole party, follow a correct orientation of running schools, and strive to conduct reform in depth. In line with their limits of authority in managing cadres, party committees at all levels should be responsible for carrying out the task of training cadres in rotation. They should promptly study and solve important problems in the work of party schools. Attention should be paid to replenishing and strengthening the leading groups and teaching staff of party schools so as to gradually improve conditions for running schools. In conclusion, Jiang Zemin pointed out: At present, the whole party and the people across the country are striving to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote economic development, and maintain stability. The new situation and tasks have put forward higher requirements for the work of party schools and, at the same time, provided a new motive force for running party schools better. It is hoped that comrades in party schools at all levels will have a better understanding of the situation, clearly define their tasks, enhance their sense of mission and responsibility, diligently study, and work in a thoroughgoing manner, and under the leadership of party committees at all levels, work hard to create a new situation in the work of party schools so as to promote the educational undertakings of party schools to a new level, and make new contributions to the great cause of vigorously carrying out the work of building socialism with Chinese characteristics!
