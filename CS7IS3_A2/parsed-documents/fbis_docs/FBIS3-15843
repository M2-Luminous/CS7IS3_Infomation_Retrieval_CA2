The decision was prompted by the parliament's notorious resolution of February 23, 1994, on a sweeping political amnesty. Denisov argues that the Military Collegium's decision does not comply with the Criminal Processual Code of the Russian Federation, which demands that once initiated, any proceedings in court should be carried though and end with passing a verdict of either "guilty" or "not-guilty".
