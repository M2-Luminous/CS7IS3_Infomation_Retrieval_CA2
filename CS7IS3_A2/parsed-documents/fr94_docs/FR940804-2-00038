FR940804-2-00038 FR940804-2-00015 [I.D. 072694C] Endangered Species; Permits AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Issuance of Modification 4 to Scientific Research and Enhancement Permit 795 (P503A). On June 27, 1994, an application was filed by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game for Modification 4 to Permit 795 (P503A) for a take of listed species as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217-222). Permit 795 was issued on July 29, 1992, and subsequently modified three times, as authorized by the ESA. The permit authorizes scientific research and enhancement activities involving listed Snake River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) through December 31, 1997. For Modification 4 of this permit, IDFG will release approximately 500 more of the progeny of the listed Redfish Lake 1991 sockeye outmigrants (artificially spawned in 1993) into two net pens in Redfish Lake in 1994 only. Modification 3 of this permit authorizes the release of up to 9,000 of these fish in 1994. Also in 1994, IDFG will release approximately 450 more listed sockeye fingerlings (1993 brood progeny of Redfish Lake anadromous sockeye that returned in 1993) into net pens in Redfish Lake. Modification 3 authorizes the release of up to 1,200 of these fish in 1994. All of the juveniles will be released from the net pens into Redfish Lake in September-October, 1994. Also for Modification 4, IDFG will release additional progeny of the adult, listed, Snake River sockeye salmon that returned to Redfish Lake in 1991. In 1994 only, approximately 4,000 listed, artificially propagated, juveniles will be released directly into Redfish Lake as presmolts in November-December, 1994 and allowed to overwinter under natural conditions in the lake. These releases were not considered for Modification 3 because the fish developed quicker than IDFG anticipated and because the 1991 adults matured and spawned at unusual times. IDFG plans to culture these fish to reach a target size consistent with the size of the juveniles authorized to be released from the net pens in Redfish Lake. Notice is hereby given that on July 27, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the ESA, NMFS issued Modification 4 to Permit Number 795 for the above taking, subject to certain conditions set forth therein. Issuance of this modification, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such modification: (1) Was applied for in good faith; (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is/are the subject of this permit; (3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This permit was also issued in accordance with and is subject to parts 217-222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits. The application, permit, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following offices, by appointment: Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910&hyph;3226 (301&hyph;713&hyph;2322); and Environmental and Technical Services Division, NMFS, NOAA, 911 North East 11th Ave., Room 620, Portland, OR 97232 (503-230-5400). Dated: July 27, 1994. William W. Fox, Jr., Director, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service.
