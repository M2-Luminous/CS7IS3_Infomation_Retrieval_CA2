Our first question to Peres was about the myriad symbols of sovereignty Israel was prepared to grant the Palestinians: a stamp, passport, international dialing zone, strong police force, legislative assembly. Did you know, we asked Peres, that this was the only autonomy in the world with all these attributes? [Peres] No, it is not the only case. There are not many autonomous areas in the world. I think that there are only one or two. Each autonomy has its own logic. The autonomous areas I am familiar with have passports and stamps. There is nothing unique about this. [Friedman] The question is whether this autonomy's internal logic indicates that this is the embryo of the future Palestinian state? [Peres] I do not know what you mean by the term logic. I only know that we are leaving the Gaza Strip without any intention of ever returning. I do not know what we have to look for in Gaza. You know, we also have to put things in clear perspective. There are 800,000 people in the Gaza Strip. Do we want to give them Israeli passports? Do we seek to prevent them from travelling abroad? Why? We therefore came up with a very original solution. We agreed on laissez-passers and passports for a period of three years; or in other words, until the implementation of the permanent arrangement. I think this is an elegant solution. Look, we should not be niggardly about insignificant things. What do we want? What is all this talk about signs of sovereignty? [Friedman] Up until yesterday, Israel was very adamant about these issues. [Peres] Who told you that? [Friedman] Is this not true? Was Israel prepared to give the Palestinians all this from the very beginning? [Peres] Excuse me. The decision on this was reached in Israel before I left for Cairo. I made no concessions here. We carefully considered what had to be done and I believe we found a unique, original, and fair solution. [Friedman] I expressly asked whether this was the embryonic Palestinian state. You know that there are many Israelis who fear this demon [last word in English]? [Peres] Is it preferable to annex these areas to Israel? We have decided to begin negotiations on the permanent arrangement in two years. These negotiations have to end within a year. We agreed to the issuing of Palestinian laissez-passers for a period of three years. I admit that we were a little bit generous. Why not? This still does not constitute a decision either on a Palestinian state or on the permanent arrangement. This agreement, which is totally unique to the best of my knowledge, deals entirely with an interim period. [Even] Mr. Peres, I do not know if you have been updated on this but Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu has described this agreement as Israel's biggest political defeat ever. Other right-wing figures voiced similar reactions. [Peres] I want to tell you that this constitutes tremendous progress. He has already warned about unprecedented political defeats in the past. We are advancing from defeat to defeat. What has Binyamin Netanyahu ever achieved? What did the Likud achieve during its 15 years in the Gaza Strip? Damage, blood, shame, and disgrace. What else? What does he mean by defeat? Does he want to remain in the Gaza Strip? What solutions does he propose for the refugees, poverty, terrorism, assassinations, hatred? What are these empty statements? Anyone can just quote words from the encyclopedia. I think that this is a brave and fair step. [Even] The question is whether we were not in too much of a hurry to sign the agreement without tying up some very important loose ends. [Peres] I do not understand what we were supposed to wait for. For more terrorist attacks? I think that Israel must use a stick and carrot approach in its war against terrorism. Although we still have our stick we have dropped the carrot. One cannot quash terrorism with just a stick. We unequivocally have no interest in running the Gaza Strip. We therefore took the appropriate steps. What would we have gained from dragging things out another year? We would have just had more soldiers acting as policemen in the Gaza Strip with daily television coverage of children throwing stones at them while mothers were quaking in fear. What for? [Friedman] Mr. Peres, there are two contradictory statements which you may be able to square. One of them is the assessment by the director of the Shin Bet according to which the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the Gaza Strip will precipitate a massacre. The second statement came from Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] who said it would not sabotage the agreement between the PLO and Israel. Which of these assessments do you lean toward? [Peres] I want to make this very clear. Ben-Gurion said that all the experts were very knowledgeable about the past. There are no experts on future developments. Anyone who purports to be an expert about future developments is taking an unnecessary risk. However, I think that an agreement that is equitable both in form and content on the Gaza Strip will greatly help in reducing the level of hatred, and perhaps also violence. I do not see any alternatives. As for the future, time will tell. No one knows which forces will seize control or demonstrate their presence. It is crystal clear, however, that the Palestinians now have an interest in managing a tangible reality through administrative, not violent, measures. The alternative to administration is brute violence. [Friedman] You met U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Cairo yesterday. Christopher has already arrived in Israel, ostensibly to promote the Syrian-Israeli track. On arrival, however, he somewhat discouragingly stated that he did not anticipate significant progress on this track. [Peres] No progress will be made without clear and intelligent decisions. If anyone thinks that anything can be achieved by stuttering or demagoguery then they are wrong. [Friedman] Mr. Peres, I left the most sensitive question for last. Do you think that the agreement you reached with 'Arafat, according to which the PLO promised to immediately deliver any information it receives on the Israeli POW's and MIA's to the Israeli Government, will satisfy Yona Baumel, the father of MIA Zekharya Baumel, who called you a traitor this week? [Peres] That is something I cannot tell you. I only know that both the prime minister and myself have done our best with regard to this sensitive issue. We all belong to the same family. I can certainly understand the feelings of the Baumel family; however, I can also say that we did absolutely everything possible. I would like to take this opportunity to say that I appealed to the Egyptian president who agreed that Egypt would continue to help in the search for the bodies of Israeli pilots and soldiers who fell on Egyptian soil. I know that this issue is also very sensitive and important to the families and to all Israelis. We will never forget the people who risked their lives, fell in battle, or have been missing in action since then. This is the responsibility of the State of Israel and its government, and we will continue to exert serious efforts in this regard and tenaciously pursue this issue. [Friedman] Thank you, Foreign Minister Peres in Cairo.
