FR941011-0-00042 FR941011-0-00011 (f) Assets generating foreign source income _(1) In general. This paragraph (f) provides the rules for determining the source of any income, gain, or loss recognized, and the appropriate section 904(d) separate limitation category or categories for any foreign source income, gain, or loss recognized, on a disposition (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section) of an asset in a general asset account that consists of assets generating both United States and foreign source income. These rules apply only to a disposition to which paragraph (e)(2) (general disposition rules), (e)(3)(ii) (disposition of all assets remaining in a general asset account), (e)(3)(iii) (disposition of an asset in a qualifying disposition), or (e)(3)(v) (anti-abuse rule) of this section applies. (2) Source of ordinary income, gain, or loss _(i) Source determined by allocation and apportionment of depreciation allowed. The amount of any ordinary income, gain, or loss that is recognized on the disposition of an asset in a general asset account must be apportioned between United States and foreign sources based on the allocation and apportionment of the_ (A) Depreciation allowed for the general asset account as of the end of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs if paragraph (e)(2) of this section applies to the disposition; (B) Depreciation allowed for the general asset account as of the time of the disposition if the taxpayer applies paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section to the disposition of all of the assets, or the last asset, in the general asset account; or (C) Depreciation allowed for the disposed asset for only the taxable year in which the disposition occurs if the taxpayer applies paragraph (e)(3)(iii) to the disposition of the asset in a qualifying disposition or if the asset is disposed in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(v) (anti-abuse rule) of this section. (ii) Formula for determining foreign source income, gain, or loss. The amount of ordinary income, gain, or loss recognized on the disposition that shall be treated as foreign source income, gain, or loss must be determined under the formula in this paragraph (f)(2)(ii). For purposes of this formula, the allowed depreciation deductions are determined for the applicable time period provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. The formula is: ␣ 1Foreign Source Income, Gain, or Loss from the Disposition of an Asset 1 = 1Total Ordinary Income, Gain, or Loss from Disposition of an Asset 1× 1Allowed Depreciation Deductions Allocated and Apportioned to Foreign Source Income Total Allowed Depreciation Deductions for the General Asset Account or for the Disposed Asset (as applicable) ␣ (3) Section 904(d) separate categories. If the assets in the general asset account generate foreign source income in more than one separate category under section 904(d)(1) or another section of the Code (for example, income treated as foreign source income under section 904(g)(10)), or under a United States income tax treaty that requires the foreign tax credit limitation to be determined separately for specified types of income, the amount of ``foreign source income, gain, or loss from the disposition of an asset'' (as determined under the formula in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section) must be allocated and apportioned to the applicable separate category or categories under the formula in this paragraph (f)(3). For purposes of this formula, the allowed depreciation deductions are determined for the applicable time period provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. The formula is: ␣ 1Foreign Source Income, Gain, or Loss In a Separate Category 1 = 1Forign Source Income, Gain, or Loss from the Disposition of an Asset 1× 1Allowed Depreciation Deductions Allocated and Apportioned to a Separate Category Total Allowed Depreciation Deductions and Apportioned to Foreign Source Income ␣ (g) Assets subject to recapture. If the basis of an asset in a general asset account is increased as a result of the recapture of any allowable credit or deduction (for example, the basis adjustment for the recapture amount under section 30(d)(2), 50(c)(2), 179(d)(10), or 179A(e)(4)), general asset account treatment for the asset terminates as of the first day of the taxable year in which the recapture event occurs. Consequently, the taxpayer must remove the asset from the general asset account as of that day and must make the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)(2) through (4) of this section.
