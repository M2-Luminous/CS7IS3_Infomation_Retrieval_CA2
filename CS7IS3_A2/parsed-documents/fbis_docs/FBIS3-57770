The publication of such an annual report is required by the new and stricter Arms Export Act of 5 August 1991, which only came into effect on 16 April 1993. The new law, which prohibits arms exports to countries which do not respect human rights, was passed under pressure from the SP [Dutch-speaking wing of the Socialist Party] and the Volksunie [People's Union]. All signs seem to indicate that despite the law, little has changed. The motto for the Walloon-Belgian arms manufacturers remains: "Business as usual." The export of murderous weapons is traditionally viewed as a very sensitive political issue. It is not just a moral question. Since all the large producers of "classical" weapons are on the other side of the language border [Wallonia], it is also a loaded issue in community terms. Reasons enough to raise as much fog and secrecy as possible around this aspect of our export efforts. On 17 May 1993 Volksunie Senator Nelly Maes asked Minister Urbain which countries in North America and in the Near and Middle East are supplied with arms by Belgium. The answer was: "Since the publication of a list of countries which purchased arms in Belgium is extremely delicate given relations with these countries, the discussion of this report [on the application of the new Arms Act] with the agreed confidential framework offers the opportunity to further break down the information into geographical areas." In his answer, Urbain also revealed that since the new Arms Act took effect, from 16 April to 15 May, licences were granted for the definitive export of weapons, ammunition and materiel for military usage, valuing 1,888 billion Belgian francs [BFr]. These products were overwhelmingly destined for NATO countries (BFr1,542 billion) and countries placed on the same footing as NATO countries (BFr135 million), he said. Other areas appeared to be of secondary importance, according to Urbain's figures: the Near East (BFr48 million), Asia (BFr114 million), Latin America (BFr29 million), Africa (BFr2 million) and East Europe (BFr15 million). Double? However, reliable and fairly detailed information in the possession of the editorial office, drawn up by the Customs and Excise Administration of the Finance Ministry, point in another direction. This information mainly covers the period just before the new Arms Act took effect (January 1991 to July 1993). Of course the large and apparently very urgent arms deliveries to Turkey by plane from Zaventem fall under sales to NATO partners. However, a civil war is clearly taking place in Turkey, so that arms exports to it were prohibited under the old law too. In addition, very large consignments of weapons were transported by ship from Antwerp and Zeebrugge to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States, such as Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. Has this enormous trade to the Gulf States suddenly dried up since the new Arms Act took effect? Since the middle of April this year all licence applications have been examined in the light of the provisions of the new Arms Export Act, according to minister Urbain. All-in-all, in the first month since the new law took effect, "one export application was refused, because the destination was obviously violating human rights." In any case the amount quoted by Urbain of BFr1.8 billion in one month seems strikingly large. By way of comparison: Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes (SP), in answer to a previous parliamentary question, said that Belgian arms exports stood at BFr11.5 billion in 1991. If the period under examination of mid-April to mid-May 1993 is representative of the whole year, then in the course of this year arms exports would have climbed to BFr21.6 billion. That is nearly double the amount compaired to two years ago. Outdated There was a time gap of no less that 18 months between the passing of the Arms Export Act by parliament and the publication of the implementation decrees in the Official Journal. During all this time the new Arms Act was in a dead letterbox. Insiders do not doubt that the postponement in the royal decrees should be blamed above all on delaying maneuvers by the PS. This party, which is closely linked to the Walloon arms lobby, had every interest in the longest possible maintenance of the arms export licence system provided for under the outdated 1962 act. Only when a parliamentary committee of inquiry was set up due to the efforts of Louis Vanvelthoven [Dutch-speaking wing of Socialist Party], Nelly Maes [People's Union] and Johan Van Hecke [Christian People's Party], could work be started on changing the law. On 10 September the text was published in the Official Journal. Scarcely two weeks later the "Martens eight" government fell over different interpretations by the communities of certain articles in the act. The French-speakers wanted a large arms delivery to Saudi Arabia. And they had their way, due to the lack of decrees on implementing decrees for the new act. Subsequently a mediocre scheme applied of "federalized" ministry arms export committees, each of which decided on the allocation of arms export licences for its own region. The task has been taken over by Ministers Claes and Urbain since the present government took office. Political Support Belgian arms exports mainly benefit two companies located in Wallonia, namely Mecar and FNNH [New National Factory of Herstal, formerly FN]. Mecar produces a product range comparable to that of PRB, which in the meantime has been sold to the British Astra company. Mecar is a subsidiary of Allied Research Associates and most of its shareholders are U.S. officers and Saudi Arabian sheiks. Virtually the whole of Mecar's production is destined for countries like Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and, until recently, Iraq. Specialists point to the possibility that Mecar was specially set up in Belgium by the United States to get maximum benefit from the flexible Belgian legislation on arms exports. The Walloon-U.S. ammunition maker can count on the virtually unconditional support of a number of Walloon politicians. The same applies to FNNH, at present owned by the French Giat [Association of Land-Based Weapons Industries] group. FN has long been the country's most famous arms producer. The Walloon regional investment company SRIW has not only provided repeated financial support to Mecar and FNNH. To safeguard the export licences of both companies, at the end of 1991 PS chairman Guy Spitaels was even prepared to have a political and institutional crisis, which led to the fall of the Martens cabinet.
