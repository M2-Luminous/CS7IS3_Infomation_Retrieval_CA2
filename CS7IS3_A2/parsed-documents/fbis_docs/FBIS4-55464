He stressed that the Hungarian Civic Party unanimously supports the establishment of a tripartite coalition by the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, the Coexistence Political Movement, and the Hungarian Civic Party. The party regards the Coexistence's proposal for a union of the ethnic Hungarian parties as a positive step. However, it considers it impracticable and unacceptable from the political point of view. If a tripartite coalition is not formed, only one opportunity will be left for us--to run separately in the elections, just as happened two years ago--the Hungarian Civic Party's spokesman stressed at today's news briefing.
