In contrast, Russian officials--in a strategy Ukrainian opponents of the deal are likely to use against it--have suggested just the reverse, portraying the agreement as a vindication of their own strategy of marshaling international pressure on Ukraine to relinquish the nuclear arsenal deployed on its territory. Meanwhile, in a development likely to further diminish chances that the current Ukrainian parliament will go along with the deal, Russian and Ukrainian officials have expressed differing interpretations of a key provision of the accord on relief of Ukraine's energy debt to Russia. The Ukrainian government has begun an uncharacteristically agressive battle with opponents in the Rada to win the parliament's acquiescence in the trilateral agreement signed by Presidents Clinton, Yeltsin, and Kravchuk on 14 January. Since returning to Kiev following the signing ceremony in Moscow, Kravchuk and other key Ukrainian government and military officials have mounted an offensive stressing that the agreement will provide security and economic benefits to Ukraine and enhance the country's international stature as well. Kravchuk on the Offensive Both Kravchuk and the cabinet appear to be committed to defending the agreement. Kravchuk, en route to Moscow on 13 January, suggested willingness to risk his political career by signing the accord, saying the "career of a politician cannot compare with the global problem we are solving" (Interfax, 13 January). At a press conference held on his return to Kiev, Kravchuk lambasted domestic critics of the agreement who, he said, had accused the government of buckling under pressure from Russia and the United States and bringing Ukraine "to its knees." Calling such statements "absurd," Kravchuk claimed that the critics are "a minority" and "demonstrate their total ignorance." He took pains to dispel any impression that Ukraine had yielded to Russian or U.S. pressure, asserting that the agreement resulted from an understanding by Russia and the United States of Kiev's problems rather than "pressure or arm twisting" (Interfax, 14 January). Ukraine's negotiators, Kravchuk said, had remained steadfast in promoting the country's interests, thereby raising Ukraine's political prestige and image as a nation whose "policies are predictable" (Kiev radio, 14 January). Kravchuk and other officials used the same argument in winning the endorsement of the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers on the eve of the signing, suggesting that the government will maintain a united front on the issue. According to Kiev radio (13 January), the government leaders praised "the active stand of Ukraine's representatives" in the trilateral negotiations in December and January, saying it produced "the essential progress" toward the agreement which would "guarantee our state's security and promise it considerable economic benefits." Economic Benefits In an apparent effort to gain maximum leverage from the economic benefits of the agreement, Ukrainian officials have played up not only the benefits specified in the agreement, such as fuel rods for Ukrainian power reactors, but others they argue will accrue from improved relations with the United States, Russia, and the West resulting from the agreement: -- Kravchuk, in his 14 January press conference in Kiev, said the agreement opens the way for expanded economic assistance from the United States, "international financial organizations, and Russia" (Kiev radio, 14 January). -- In a roundtable discussion broadcast on Kiev radio (15 January), Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko cited the U.S. commitment to establish a foundation for small businesses, a $155 million allocation to Ukraine by the United States for "economic reform," and "a whole series of specific projects and programs"--including, according to Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, U.S. assistance in providing housing for servicemen--expected to result from the pending visit to the United States of a Ukrainian economic delegation. Zlenko also hinted that the United States would increase the $175 million in dismantlement assistance it has promised Ukraine. "We know what other reserves they are talking about and, of course, we will be able to get access to those reserves so as to increase this sum," Zlenko said without elaboration. -- In a similar vein, Deputy Prime Minister Deputy Shmarov, in remarks paraphrased by Kiev radio on 17 January, said Ukraine's denuclearization "will enable Ukraine to receive international financial aid, including much needed investment to help resolve defense conversion issues, overcome the economic crisis, and provide for the social protection of our people" (Kiev radio, 17 January). Security Guarantees Government officials evidently feel that the issue of security guarantees presents the greatest challenge in their efforts to sell the agreement at home. They indirectly acknowledged that Ukraine had failed in its effort to obtain legally binding security guarantees from the United States and Russia, and highlighted instead the multilateral security guarantees accruing to nonnuclear parties to the Nonproliferation Treaty and emphasized Russia's pledge not to use economic pressure against Ukraine: -- Clearly uncomfortable when asked repeatedly about security guarantees for Ukraine, Kravchuk, in his 14 January press conference, responded vaguely, at one point suggesting that security guarantees are not very meaningful. "Security does not mean signed documents," Kravchuk said, stressing instead that the road to security begins with "civilized" policies. When pressed further, Kravchuk cited the tripartite agreement's pledge to "respect the territorial integrity, inviolability of borders, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine." Kravchuk added that by joining the NPT, "those security guarantees will acquire a more specific, precise nature." And he noted that Russia had pledged not to use "economic pressure" against Ukraine. -- Zlenko, in contrast, was more self-assured on the issue of security guarantees in the 15 January roundtable discussion on Kiev radio, asserting that Ukraine had successfully won "multilateral" assurances of security through the NPT process rather than mere "bilateral" assurances and adding that France had also offered security guarantees. Underscoring his point, Zlenko asked, "Do you understand what we are talking about? What does it mean for our state, which is still unsteady on its feet of independence, to receive political guarantees from leading nuclear states? It is a guarantee protecting Ukraine's political sovereignty." Military Endorsements Ukrainian military officials also gave their stamp of approval to the agreement affirming that the agreement adequately protects Ukraine's security, and pointing out that since Kiev does not control the nuclear weapons on its soil, they afford Ukraine no real security: -- In an 18 January press conference, Radetskyy said he "fully supports" the agreement, adding, according to paraphrased remarks, that Ukraine "is incapable of maintaining its own nuclear weapons at the moment and would have to get rid of them sooner or later" (Kiev UNIAN, 18 January). Earlier, Radetskyy said "high-precision" conventional weapons are more valuable for Ukraine's security and that he plans to report "in the near future" to the defense Council on plans to "compensate for the withdrawal of the nuclear weapons" (Kiev radio, 15 January). -- In a similar vein, Deputy Defense Minister Col. Gen. Ivan Oliynik said the nuclear arms in Ukraine had no bearing "on the issues of our security. We do not control these weapons, we cannot maintain them.... and we cannot but implement the decision taken by our state to become non-nuclear in the future." He also said Ukraine would "have to rely on our own forces [and] create nonnuclear forces that can enable us to ensure the protection of our state" (Kiev radio, 18 January). Safety Issue Played Up In an unusual twist to support their efforts to sell the agreement, Ukrainian officials have also adopted a Russian argument, which until recently they had heatedly rebutted, that the current physical condition of nuclear warheads in Ukraine is deteriorating dangerously. In his 14 January news conference, Kravchuk himself raised the prospect--often used by Russian military officials--of a nuclear nightmare on Ukrainian soil, saying Ukraine is "obliged to remove [the weapons] because they are more dreadful than all the Chernobyl-type accidents taken together," adding, "we cannot maintain them with due responsibility for our future" (Kiev radio, 14 January). At an 18 January press conference, Kostyantyn Hryhschenko, chief of disarmament for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reportedly said warheads stored in Ukraine are increasingly unstable and pose a serious environmental threat to Ukraine (UNIAR, Kiev radio, 18 January). Party and Legislative Reaction Although some Ukrainian opposition leaders condemned the agreement even before it had been signed and released, a number of key legislators adopted a wait-and-see attitude while others expressed support. Meanwhile, at a parliamentary meeting on 20 January, several relevant committees (foreign affairs, defense and security, and legislation and legality) were instructed to prepare by 25 January a "resolution" on the "compatibility" of the trilateral agreement with the parliament's 18 November resolution (UNIAN, 20 January). Legislative Opponents. Some leaders of the main opposition party People's Movement of Ukraine (Rukh) vituperatively opposed the agreement, although some other leading members took a more moderate stand. Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil called the agreement "a national betrayal," and Les Tanyuk, a Rukh leader and member of the parliament's presidium, asserted Ukraine had been brought "to its knees" (UNIAN, AFP, 14 January; Interfax, 18 January). However, another Rukh leader, Volodymyr Chernyak, was less harsh, praising the agreement for opening possibilities for economic cooperation and compensation, but faulting it for being short on security guarantees (UNIAN, 13 January). Similarly, a statement issued by the Conservative Republican Party, headed by the well-known radical nationalist Stepan Khmara, reportedly claimed that Kravchuk had "acted contrary to Ukraine's national interests" in signing the agreement (Krasnaya Zvezda, 19 January). Mykhaylo Horyn, leader of the Ukrainian Republican Party, keyed on Ukraine's national security interests, asserting in an interview published on 12 January that Ukraine should retain indefinitely the 46 SS-24 ICBMs deployed on Ukrainian soil. Horyn urged Kravchuk not to sign the agreement, saying it would be an "irreparable blunder" (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu). Undecided Legislators. A number of key legislators said that they needed to study the document before taking a stand and claimed that if the accord did not meet the conditions set out in parliament's 18 November resolution on START-I they would oppose it. According to the Ukrainian news agency UNIAR, parliament speaker Ivan Plyushch was "refraining from comment" until the "relevant documents are studied" (15 January). Yuriy Kostenko, Minister of Environmental Protection and head of the parliamentary commission on ratification of START-I, was similarly cited by Russian media as saying that he would "like to read the text" of the agreement before drawing any "conclusions" about whether it conforms to the parliament's conditions (ITAR-TASS, Moscow radio, 16 January). In April 1993, Kostenko was widely reported to have claimed that the nuclear weapons on its territory made Ukraine a "nuclear state" (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 27 April 1993; Kiev radio, 28 April 1993). According to the Russian news agency Interfax, Yevgeniy Marmazov, deputy head of the parliament's foreign affairs commission, told an interviewer that the legislature would "not ratify the deal unless the conditions it had set" were met, but he apparently did not draw any preliminary conclusion as to whether the agreement met this test (14 January). Supportive Legislators. Some legislative leaders have reacted positively to the agreement, some citing the participation of the United States in the accord and some the economic benefits to Ukraine. Mykola Shulha, chairman of the parliamentary committee for issues of state sovereignty and inter-republic and inter-ethnic relations, told a Ukrainian interviewer that he would "endeavor to convince" parliament to support the agreement, arguing that Russian adherence to the terms of the agreement was guaranteed by the "global authority of such an influential state as America" (UNIAN, 14 January). Vladimir Grinyev, former deputy head of parliament and leader of the New Ukraine Movement, reportedly said that he is "supportive" of the agreement and that Ukraine will "reap economic dividends" from it (Interfax, 18 January). Russian Reaction While Ukrainian officials have stressed the benefits of the agreement to Ukraine, Russian officials have let it be known that they view the agreement as the fruit of their and U.S. efforts to pressure Ukraine to relinquish the nuclear arsenal on its territory: -- During in a joint press conference with President Clinton on 14 January, Yeltsin did not demur when an ITAR-TASS correspondent spoke of Russian efforts during Yeltsin's recent visit to Brussels to get the United States and NATO "to exert more influence" on Ukraine. Asked if his "hopes" on this score had been justified, Yeltsin replied, "I think our hopes have been justified extremely quickly" (Russian TV, 14 January). -- An unnamed "senior official" of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reportedly told Interfax that the "extremely negative reaction" by the world community--above all Russia and the United States--to Kiev's earlier hesitant stand on the nuclear question "was understood by Leonid Kravchuk" (1O January). -- In a 12 January article in the government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, commentator Vladimir Kuznechevskiy wrote that Kravchuk was "unable to withstand the combined pressure of the U.S. and Russian presidents" and had therefore "agreed" to sign the document giving up nuclear weapons. Russian officials may also view the trilateral signing as evidence of tacit U.S. acknowledgment of the primacy of Russia's role among states of the former Soviet Union. Member of the Presidential Council Andranik Migranyan, in 17 January remarks disseminated by ITAR-TASS, said that with the trilateral agreement the United States had confirmed "Russia's special role in maintaining stability on the territory of the post-Soviet space." The same sentiment was expressed in a Nezavisimaya Gazeta commentary on the trilateral talks (13 January), which asserted that Yeltsin "managed to demonstrate the role his country is playing in the former Soviet Union: Leonid Kravchuk and Bill Clinton will negotiate on his territory and he himself will be involved in the talks." Disagreement Over Compensation A controversy over the possibility of debt relief for Ukraine as part of the trilateral agreement demonstrates a serious divergence in the two sides' interpretation of the agreement. Although it has been widely reported that Russia agreed in the tripartite talks to write off all or part of Ukraine's energy debt as compensation for tactical nuclear weapons removed from Ukraine in 1992, (Interfax, 12 January; Moscow radio, 14 January), some Russian officials have denied such a possibility, thereby angering Ukrainian officials who are trying to sell the agreement on its economic merits. Kozyrev, in remarks on 14 January, said that "any write-off of the Ukrainian debt is out of the question" (Interfax, 14 January). In addition, a senior official of Gosprom, a leading Russian gas producer, said the Russian government would "never" agree to compensate Ukraine for denuclearization by writing off its energy debt (Interfax, 12 January). Zlenko reportedly reacted with "surprise and disagreement" to Kozyrev's statement, saying, in remarks paraphrased 14 January by Interfax, that a Ukrainian debt relief "formula" was "laid down in the agreement." In a 14 January press conference at the Ukrainian Embassy in Moscow, Kravchuk said the "amount and form" of compensation for tactical nuclear weapons removed from Ukraine in 1992 was yet to be determined, but that "one option" was debt relief for Ukrainian energy imports. Outlook The number of Ukrainian legislators reserving judgement on the agreement offers some hope that Kravchuk may be able to sway the parliament's final reaction to the agreement, and Kravchuk and the Ukrainian Government appear to be forcefully pushing the agreement now. But in the past, Kravchuk has backed away from controversial decisions, such as the signing of the Massandra agreement with Russia, when the political heat rose. Moscow's view of the trilateral agreement, which surely will not go unnoticed in Ukraine, may raise the heat for Kravchuk by undermining his strongest selling points: enhanced international prestige and economic benefits. Kravchuk's domestic opponents will likely use the Russians' statements that the agreement was the product of pressure on Ukraine against him, particularly as the campaign for Ukraine's 27 March legislative election gets into full swing. The apparent disagreement over debt relief to Ukraine is also likely to complicate Kravchuk's effort to sell the agreement on its economic merits and may raise additional difficulties when the parties attempt to resolve outstanding issues of implementation.
