FR941202-0-00052 FR941202-0-00006 The FAA estimates that 245 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 31 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $1,010 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $665,175. This figure is based on the assumption that no affected airplane operator has accomplished the required actions. In addition, this action eliminates the need for the repetitive inspections required by AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02. The FAA has no way of determining the operation levels of each individual operator of the affected airplanes, and subsequently cannot determine the repetitive inspection costs that will be eliminated by the required action. The FAA estimates these costs to be substantial over the long-term. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
