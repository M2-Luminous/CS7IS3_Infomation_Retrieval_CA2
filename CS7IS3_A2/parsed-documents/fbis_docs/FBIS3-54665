Riga hopes that negotiations on this issue will continue, Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs told Interfax. He deplored the circumstance that in 1993 Latvia and Russia did not succeed in reaching agreement on the main issue -- Russian troops withdrawal from Latvia. However Russia's new initiatives aimed at stepping up the withdrawal of the remaining military units are a positive factor, the minister said. (Interfax's note: Russia proclaimed its willingness to withdraw its troops from Latvia before August 31st, 1994, if it maintains control over the radar station in Skrunda for another six years). Andrejevs also expressed concern about the circumstance that most Russians living in Latvia cast their ballots for Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party and for communists. "We have no illusions in regard to the sentiments of many Russians living in Latvia. Our practice shows that what motivates them is the desire to reverse the course of history and return to the recent past, not the striving for democracy," he said.
