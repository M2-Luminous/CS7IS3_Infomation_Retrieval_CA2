Human Rights Commission was unwilling to have a discussion on sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), because the United Nations had violated the Yugoslavs' basic human rights by voting for the sanctions in the first place. Minister Savovic said Yugoslavia was being accused of violating human and minority rights, while the rights of its citizens were being violated by the U.N. sanctions, and its population was surviving in inhuman conditions through a sheer will to live. The Yugoslav Government has filed countless memoranda with the United Nations, apprising it about the difficult position of the children, women, the ill and the elderly in the country and making it clear that "our people have virtually been deprived of the right to live, and the sanctions have violated a host of U.N. conventions, but nothing has been done about it," she said in a statement to Serbia's Radio Jagodina. "The United Nations is well aware that a discussion on the anti-Yugoslav sanctions would call in question their further justifiability since Yugoslavia has complied with all requirements for their lifting. It would also broach the highly unpleasant question of why the United Nations is violating its own conventions," she said. The United Nations imposed comprehensive and mandatory sanctions on Yugoslavia in May 1992, because of its alleged military involvement in civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is being waged among Bosnia's Moslems, Serbs and Croats. Margit Savovic said that more than 180,000 Serbs were living in Albania, Hungary and Romania, and their position there "is far different from that of the minorities in Yugoslavia." "They are deprived of rights in all fields, from the right to education in their mother tongue, to information, cultural development and power-sharing, to being assimilated," she said. Yugoslavia "has no intention of insisting on reciprocity, but wants its minorities to retain their rights, and the rights of the Serbs in the neighbouring countries to be enhanced to correspond to those the national minorities have here," she explained.
