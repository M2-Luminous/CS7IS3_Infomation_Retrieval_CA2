In his speech yesterday he warned that civilian supervision over military decisions is one of the fundamental principles in providing security in democratic states. In a brief interview to our reporter Tomaz Gerden, Mr. van Eekelen also assessed Slovenia's prospects in the European integrations: [Begin recording] [Gerden] We asked Dr. van Eekelen about Slovenia's prospects for cooperation and integration into the Partnership for Peace, the WEU, and NATO: [Eekelen, in English with superimposed Slovene translation] I think that it is important for Slovenia to make progress in all different directions. First in the Council of Europe, whose member you already are, and then in NATO's Partnership for Peace, which will be important for the cooperation of your army with the Western armies. In this way your armed forces will adopt Western standards in military budget, arms, organization, and civilian supervision over military policy. However, I do not believe that you or others will shortly become NATO members. There will be quite some time needed for this. [Gerden] Dr. van Eekelen also added that cooperation with the European Union [EU] is of extreme importance for Slovenia, as it means stability for our state in various aspects. As soon as Slovenia signs the association agreement with the EU it will also be admitted into the WEU Consultative Council, and this cooperation will widen further later. Dr. van Eekelen also stressed that the WEU in no way views Slovenia within the framework of the former Yugoslavia but treats it as an independent European country. [end recording]
