At an NDS-NA constituent congress vote here today, Cernak received 136 votes out of a total of 137 cast. Cernak, former chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS), was the only candidate for the post. Delegates to the constituent conference of the National Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA) decided that the party, which declared itself a conservative one, would seek admission to the European Democratic Union (EDU). According to preliminary consultations, the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) and some conservative parties of the Visegrad group countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia), which are EDU members, would support the newly-established party in its effort. Cernak said the party intended to cooperate with Czech members of the EDU -- the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) and the government coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA). The NDS-NA would run for the forthcoming early elections in a coalition with the Alliance of Slovak Democrats (ADSR) of ex-Foreign Minister Milan Knazko and the Slovak Democratic Union (DUS) of Premier Jozef Moravcik. Negotiations are underway with the Greens Party on its participation in the pre-election coalition bloc. The party's primary goal is preparation of coupon privatisation. Privatisation Minister Milan Janicina said he sought to speed up privatisation in such a way that it became irreversible. Coupon privatisation is to concern 80 to 100 billion crowns (2.6 to 3.3 billion USD) worth of property.
