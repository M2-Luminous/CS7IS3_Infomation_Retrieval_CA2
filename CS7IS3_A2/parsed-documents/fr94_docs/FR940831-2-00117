FR940831-2-00117 FR940831-2-00088 [Release No. 34&hyph;34603; File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;15] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Relating to Interpretation of Rule G&hyph;37 on Political Contributions and Prohibitions on Municipal Securities Business August 35, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, notice is hereby given that on August 18, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Board. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide interpretative guidance concerning rule G&hyph;37 on political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business. The Board has designated this proposal as constituting a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing rule of the Board under Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, which renders the proposal effective upon receipt of this filing by the Commission. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Board is filing the proposed rule change to provide interpretative guidance concerning rule G&hyph;37 on political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business. 1 1 The Board plans to publish the interpretations in the August 1994 MSRB Reports (Vol. 14, no. 4, pp 27&hyph;32). The interpretations also are available for inspection and copying at the Commission's public reference room and at the Board. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule change In its filing with the Commission, the Board included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Board has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change On April 7, 1994, the Commission approved Board rule G&hyph;37. concerning political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business. 2 In response to numerous inquiries received by the Board concerning the application of the rule, on May 24, 1994, the Board filed with the Commission a Question and Answer (``Q&A'') interpretation of the rule. 3 Since that time, the Board has continued to receive questions concerning the rule. Thus, in an effort to further assist dealers in understanding and complying with rule G&hyph;37, the Board is filing this second Q&A relating to rule G&hyph;37. As previously stated, the Board will continue to monitor the application of rule G&hyph;37, and, from to time, will publish additional notices of interpretations, as necessary. 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33868 (April 7, 1994), 59 FR 17621 (April 13, 1994). The rule applies to contributions made on and after April 25, 1994. 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34161 (June 6, 1994), 59 FR 30379 (June 13, 1994). The interpretations were published in the June 1994, MSRB Reports. The Board believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act, which provides that the Board's rules shall be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition Because the proposed rule change would apply equally to all brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers, the Board does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others Written comments were neither solicited nor received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder because the rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing rule of the Board. At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Commission may summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Room. Copies of the filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Board. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;15 and should be submitted by September 21, 1994. For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
