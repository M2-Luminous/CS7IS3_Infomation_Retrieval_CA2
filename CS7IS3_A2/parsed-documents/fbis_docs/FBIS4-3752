According to officials with the company, in the first quarter of this year, it sold 41,000 automobiles of various kinds, and earned 4.24 billion yuan in return, both showing marked increases compared with the corresponding figures for the same period of last year. As one of China's oldest manufacturers of motor vehicles, the conglomerate, headquartered in Changchun, the provincial capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, has grown into China's largest auto producer and is now able to turn out lorries, sedan cars, light-duty trucks, minivans, and buses in more than 100 specifications. Before 1978, the No. 1 Motor Vehicle Plant used to produce only a few kinds of automobiles, and concentrated on the production of "Liberation" brand trucks for about 30 years without changes. In the middle 1980s, the central government decided to carry out structural adjustment of the auto industry step by step, and issued industrial policies to encourage the production of different light-duty trucks and sedan cars. In 1986, the No. 1 Motor Vehicle Plant was listed as a production center of light-duty trucks, and the next year, it was made one of China's three major production bases of sedan cars. Enjoying preferential policies concerning loans and fund-raising, the plant got 300 hectares of land around the old factory site to build two new workshops for producing light-duty trucks and sedan cars. Besides importing sophisticated auto-making technology from Japan and the United States, the plant merged four other factories in Changchun and Jilin cities, and soon upgraded its light-duty trucks which are believed to have met the world's advanced standards. A large number of light-duty trucks, new versions of "Liberation" vehicles produced with low costs and high quality, have been put onto the market since the beginning of this year and they are selling like hot cakes. At the same time, the plant has also started development on 28 types of other light-duty trucks. Officials with the company said that the plant would turn out 50,000 light-duty trucks this year. In the meantime, construction of the sedan car production center has also made strides. At present, the No. 1 Automobile Conglomerate is able to produce three categories of sedan cars--Red Flag, Audi and Jieda. Construction of the Sino-German joint venture plant between the No. 1 Automobile Company and the Volkswagen company of Germany is expected to be completed by the end of this year, and its workshops will produce 150,000 sedan cars a year. Besides this production center of sedan cars in Changchun, China has got two other key production bases of sedan cars--one in Shanghai and the other in Shiyan city, central China's Hubei Province, in addition to three other centers in Beijing, Tianjin and Guangzhou for producing Beijing jeeps, Xiali cars and Peugeot cars.
