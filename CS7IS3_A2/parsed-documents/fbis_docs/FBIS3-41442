It provides for systematic forest management and reforestation. Strict penalties are to be imposed for the destruction of forest. In addition, the master plan for forestry is to be revived. Sri Lanka has lost over 400,000 hectares of its forest cover during the last decade. The rapid deforestation has been blamed on the growing population and other issues. Only 20.3 percent of Sri Lanka's land area is under forest. The forest cover stood at 70 percent at the turn of this century. The declined forest cover has caused natural disasters such as floods, soil erosion, and landslide.
