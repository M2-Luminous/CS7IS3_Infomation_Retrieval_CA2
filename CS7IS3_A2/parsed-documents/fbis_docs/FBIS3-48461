The article says: All manner of contradictions peculiar to the capitalist system give rise to chaos and crisis in politics, the economy, ideology and morality in those countries where capitalism has been revived. Such catastrophic situation in those countries is entirely attributable to the reactionary nature of socio-economic reforms that have brought the revival of capitalism. Hence, the quicker the process of reform, the more serious crisis and chaos. The only way out of the crisis in the countries where capitalism has been revived is to rebuild socialism. Socialism is incomparably superior to capitalism. Capitalism is an anti-popular society where exploitation of man by man prevails and a tiny handful of exploiting class lord it over, a corrupt society based on extreme egoism. But, socialism is a genuine society for the people where the popular masses are masters of everything and everything serves them, a superior society based on collectivism. If the basic principles of socialist construction had been maintained and the advantages of the socialist system brought into full play, frustration of socialism and revival of capitalism would not have taken place at all in some countries. Grudge against the revival of capitalism is swelling up and aspiration for socialism growing strong among the people in those countries who have realised it through bitter experiences. The imperialists and reactionaries are making every conceivable effort to check the revival of socialism. This is a move to block the social progress of those countries and put the peoples of those countries under the permanent yoke of domination and subordination.
