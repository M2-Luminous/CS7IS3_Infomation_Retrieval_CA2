FR940817-2-00158 FR940817-2-00080 (c) The investment advisory and other fees paid by each of the existing Funds are accrued on a daily basis and billed by M&I Management to the Funds at the beginning of the month following the month in which the fees accrued. The applicant states that any additional Funds will follow the same monthly billing arrangement. (d) At the beginning of each month (pursuant to the terms of the applicable Agreements) and essentially simultaneously with the billing described in (c) above, but in no event more than one business day following the receipt of such fees by M&I Management, M&I credits to each Client Plan directly with cash such Plan's pro rata share of all investment advisory fees charged by M&I Management to the Funds (the Credit Program). In addition, M&I currently credits to each Client Plan any amounts it is paid for providing custody and shareholder services to the Funds in the same manner as the investment advisory fees but only to the extent that these amounts exceed M&I's direct expenses for providing such services. However, M&I proposes in the future to retain any fees received by M&I from the Funds for custody and shareholder services or other secondary services. 24 24 M&I states that such secondary services are distinct from the services provided by M&I as trustee to a Client Plan. Trustee services rendered at the Plan-level include maintaining custody of the assets of the Client Plan (including the Fund shares, but not the assets underlying the Fund shares), processing benefit payments, maintaining participant accounts, valuing plan assets, conducting non-discrimination testing, preparing Forms 5500 and other required filings, and producing statements and reports regarding overall plan and individual participant holdings. These trustee services are necessary regardless of whether the Client Plan's assets are invested in the Funds. Thus, M&I represents that its proposed receipt of fees for both secondary services at the Fund-level and trustee services at the Plan-level would not involve the receipt of ``double fees'' for duplicative services to the Client Plans because a Fund is charged for custody and other services relative to the individual securities owned by the Fund, while a Client Plan is charged for the maintenance of Plan accounts reflecting ownership of the Fund shares and other assets. In this regard, the Department notes that the combined total of all fees received by M&I directly and indirectly from the Client Plans for the provision of services to the Plans and/or to the Funds should not be in excess of ``reasonable compensation'' within the meaning of section 408(b)(2) of the Act. In addition, the fact that certain transactions and fee arrangements are the subject of an administrative exemption does not relieve a Client Plan fiduciary from the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act. Thus, the Department cautions the fiduciaries of the Client Plans investing in the Funds that they have an ongoing duty under section 404 of the Act to monitor the services provided to the Client Plans to assure that the fees paid by the Client Plans for such services are reasonable in relation to the value of the services provided. Such responsibilities would include determinations that the services provided are not duplicative and that the fees are reasonable in light of the level of services provided. M&I represents that the credited fees are currently paid to the Client Plan only in cash, but that the credits may be effectuated in the future through the purchase of additional shares of the Funds pursuant to an annual election made by the Second Fiduciary for the Client Plan. The purchase of the shares will occur in lieu of a cash credit on the same day that such credit would have been paid to the Client Plan. M&I states that the fee credits were initially made in cash to the Client Plans so that no authorizations for crediting fees in the form of additional shares of the Funds would be involved at the time of the transfers of the CIF assets to the Funds. All decisions regarding the use of the credited fees to purchase additional shares of the Funds, including annual reauthorizations for such credits, will be made by a Second Fiduciary for the Client Plan. The Credit Program ensures that M&I does not receive any additional investment management, advisory or similar fees from the Funds as a result of investments in the Funds by the Client Plans. Thus, M&I represents that the Fee Structure is at least as advantageous to the Client Plans as an arrangement pursuant to the conditions of PTE 77&hyph;4 whereby investment advisory fees paid by the Funds to M&I Management would be offset or credited against investment management fees charged directly by M&I to the Client Plans. In this regard, M&I states that the Credit Program essentially has the same effect in offsetting M&I Management's investment advisory fees as an arrangement under PTE 77&hyph;4, section II(c), allowing for a credit by subtracting the amount of such fees from the investment management fees charged directly by M&I to the Client Plans (the Subtraction Method). M&I states further that in many instances the Credit Program is more advantageous to a Client Plan than an arrangement using the Subtraction Method because under the Credit Program a Client Plan receives a credit in either cash or shares on the same day (or within one business day after) the fees are received by M&I Management from the Funds. However, under the Subtraction Method, a Client Plan would not receive a credit on the same day (or within one business day after) the fees are paid to M&I Management from the Funds if the billing period for services to the Funds is different than the billing period for M&I's fiduciary services to the Client Plan. The Fee Structure with the Credit Program allows M&I to maintain a fixed fiduciary fee schedule for services to the Client Plans without any adjustments in billing for such services, as required under the Subtraction Method. M&I notes that the Fee Structure also allows the Client Plan sponsor the option to pay the Client Plan's fees to M&I for serving as a trustee, directed trustee, investment manager, or custodian and have the Client Plan receive a credit of the Plan's pro rata share of the investment advisory fees paid to M&I. 25 25 To the extent that the Department of the Treasury determines that this arrangement should be deemed a contribution by an employer to a Client Plan of the credited fees, the transaction must be examined under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, including sections 401(a)(4), 404 and 415. M&I is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls for the Credit Program. In addition, M&I has retained the services of Arthur Anderson & Co. of Milwaukee, Wisconsin (the Auditor), an independent accounting firm, to audit annually the crediting of fees to the Client Plans under the Credit Program. M&I states that such audits provide independent verification of the proper crediting to the Client Plans of fees charged by M&I to the Funds. M&I states further that information obtained from the audits is used in the preparation of required financial disclosure reports to the Client Plans' fiduciaries.
