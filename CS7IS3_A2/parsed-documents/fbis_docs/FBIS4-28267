Regarding the North Korean proposal that it allow nuclear inspections conditional on North Korean-U.S. talks, U.S. State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry, said: "Further study of North Korea's new proposal is needed since it hinted on flexibility in resolving the nuclear conflict." By saying so, he did not reject the possibility of holding new dialogue with North Korea. In a news conference following his visit to the Ukraine, North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said: "If North Korean-U.S. talks are resumed, we will guarantee the inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities by testing, measuring, and preserving nuclear fuel rods there." Minister Kim Yong-nam said: "The United States and North Korea are the parties directly concerned with the current situation regarding the nuclear issue, and only the two can resolve the issue." He then said that "the nuclear issue was created by the United States, and threats against North Korea also come from the Untied States," and denounced the United States for refusing the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks by using delay tactics. He stressed that the United States and some circles of the IAEA continue to organizationally slander, defame, and attack North Korea for political purposes. In the meantime, Spokesman McCurry, who is currently accompanying U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Istanbul, said in his commentary on DPRK Minister Kim Yong-nam's proposal that day, that "the proposal may imply a some degree of North Korean flexibility," and stressed: "In consideration of the U.S. need for a guarantee that North Korea will stay in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, further review of North Korea's proposal is needed [migugurosonun pukhani haekhwaksan choyage kyesok namaiddanun pojangul piryoro handanun kyonjieso igatun cheuirul toisang pyonggahal piryoga idda]." Spokesman McCurry added: "It is certainly important for the IAEA to be authorized to conduct nuclear inspections in North Korea." Regarding this, U.S. officials concerned roused public attention not to react excessively to recent announcements by North Korea over the nuclear issue. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who arrived in Istanbul on 8 June to attend the NATO foreign ministers' meeting also said that he was not taking all the announcements reported from North Korea at their face value.
