Paz told Voz de Honduras radio station in a telephone interview from Washington that the nomination of Gaviria "we believe was the result of a democratic election in which the law of the majority prevailed, which is the fundamental law of democracy." "Gaviria won as a result, and we believe he is a hemispheric leader who will give proper leadership to the OAS," he said. The minister added that among the majority of the OAS member countries there is "satisfaction," but he also said "the feeling of bitterness, especially that of Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus," is logical. Niehaus made an intense but unfortunate effort because in democracy there is always a winner and a loser, according to Paz, who pointed out that Gaviria defeated the Costa Rican foreign minister in the first round 20 votes to 14. Honduras' position on the election of the OAS secretary general was to support the Costa Rican candidate, Bernd Niehaus, in the first round and Gaviria in the second round. Paz Aguilar said that Honduras promised to support a Central American candidacy because it "respects the promises that were made;" however, he refused to comment on the change of heart of those who had pledged their support for Niehaus.
