Zhou Nan, a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC) and director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, said the British side has damaged Sino-british agreements on Hong Kong and created confrontation, which shows that colonialists do not change their nature. Joining the Guangdong delegation in a group discussion during the ongoing NPC session, he said, the essence of the dispute on Hong Kong's political system is whether people should act in good faith rather than a question of democracy. In a deeper sense, it is a dispute over sovereignty. The British side, in the final analysis, intends to use its power of control over Hong Kong in the next few years to establish, under the pretext of accelerating democratic process, its own administrative organization and impose it on the special administrative region so that it can continue to monopolize the political situation in Hong Kong and even turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity. He also refuted the advocation by some people of turning Hong Kong into "an international asset." He said, China will resume complete exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong after 1997. Though Hong Kong will adopt a capitalist system within China and continue to develop as an international financial and trade center, this does not mean that Hong Kong will become a so-called "international asset" or something like the "international concession" of old Shanghai. Zhou noted, the Preliminary Work Committee (PWC) for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region faces "an arduous task and important duty." At present, PWC has entered a stage of substantial work. It must unite with Hong Kong compatriots and make preparations for the SAR, its first government and legislature so as to live up to the expectations of the whole nation. In future, membership of PWC will be further increased. More Hong Kong public figures will be appointed as advisors on Hong Kong affairs or on district affairs so as to solicit opinions and suggestions from Hong Kong compatriots and lay down a sound foundation for the implementation of the principles of "one country, two systems" and "administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people," he added. He also said, most civil servants in Hong Kong have made important contributions to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. "We believe the overwhelming majority of them love the country and Hong Kong and support the Basic Law. We welcome them to continue serving Hong Kong residents after 1997 and make new contributions to Hong Kong's future development." Zhou said that in 1993 the GDP of Hong Kong grew 5.5 percent over the previous year. This substantial economic development was attributable to increased ties and economic cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong. He hopes the cooperation will develop to a new stage and create greater benefits for both Hong Kong and the mainland this year.
