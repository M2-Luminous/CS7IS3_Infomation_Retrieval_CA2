According to broadcast reports from Seoul, some 1,500 students belonging to the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils convened at Seoul Municipal University on 21 May and held a rally for the resolution of inheriting the spirit of the 18 May Kwangju popular resistance and opposing the United States. In the meeting, the students called on the United States to withdraw its nuclear inspection suppression on the North. Denouncing the United States for imposing unreasonable pressure on the North for its own interests, the participants strongly called for the pullout of the nuclear weapons of the U.S. troops occupying South Korea and the suspension of the commotions of nuclear inspection suppression against the North. After the rally, the students, in a high spirit, staged a street demonstration and marched toward Chongno Street in groups. As the students finally advanced into Chongno Street at around 1730, the police ran amok to stop them. However, the students continued a violent struggle without yielding to them. This has been the just-in news.
