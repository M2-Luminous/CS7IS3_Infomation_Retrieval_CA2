The cocaine invading the Pacific coast cities comes from Puerto Cabezas. It is smuggled through Minas, Mulukuku, Matagalpa, and Tipitapa, to Ciudad de las Flores, where traffickers have managed to infiltrate the police force and where several police officers are in charge of distribution. This activity has changed this city into the capital of drug trafficking. The cocaine seized in Nicaragua is classified as "Lacross," "Esterlina," and "The First." "Lacross" is cocaine that experts rate as "medium grade," and its price makes it more readily available to consumers. The traffickers receive it in Masaya and distribute it in eastern towns and other areas. Drug traffickers are believed to have moved their operations center to one of the major cities outside Managua, where there are excellent market possibilities due to population and facilities for moving into other areas along the Pacific coast. Drug traffickers also may have moved their operations because of the recent crack downs in the capital. Authorities have delivered severe blows to large and small-scale drug sales, capturing and prosecuting anyone who "sticks their head up." Cuadra Ferrey said his office will initiate an in-depth investigation of the police implicated in the Masaya drug trafficking activities. "If they are found guilty, they will be prosecuted, because we cannot allow drug trafficking." Donald Sanchez, Virgilo Canales, Mario Vergara and Lieutenant Pablo Potosme are the police officers allegedly implicated in drug trafficking activities. After repeatedly asking Sub Commander Carlos Rodriguez, chief of the National Police in Masaya, for information regarding the men said to be involved in drug trafficking activities, he finally told BARRICADA that Potosme is currently being investigated by military internal affairs for providing information to drug traffickers in exchange for payoffs. It was discovered that Potosme was receiving payments from one of the biggest criminals in Masaya, who was recently arrested for fraud and bribery of a policeman. The former police officer is also charged with having sold information for 600, 700, 1,000, 2,000, and even 3,000 cordobas. Reportedly, he once took a television set from one of the traffickers, because the trafficker had no money to pay him at the time. On another occasion, a police officer gave Potosme a ride to the Parque de los Leones. According to National Police investigations, Potosme then went to the Masaya criminal's home to receive a payoff. Although Cuadra Ferrey and Rodriguez gave no significant details of the investigations, BARRICADA was able to learn the names of four other police officers believed to be under investigation. Our informant said that Police Officers Dino Shelleby, Ernesto Chamorro, and Eliphar Villaobos are reportedly drug users, "although they are still not involved in the drug business itself." Police officer Francisco Valdez is under investigation for his relations with former police officer Francisco Malespin, who is to be sentenced by a military court in the next few days after being found guilty of drug trafficking. Several police officers have been seen at a distribution point, near the Salinas movie theater in Managua, allegedly consuming drugs or receiving payoffs. Sources close to the National Police high command reported that "they are bringing in all kinds of weapons to Masaya and Managua to fight the police officers connected with the drug traffickers and to prosecute whoever they find to be involved."
