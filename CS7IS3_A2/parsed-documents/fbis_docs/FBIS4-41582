An AZERTAC correspondent has asked Vefa Gulizade, state adviser on foreign policy affairs, to comment on the letter. He said the following: I wish to stress that the letter is the initial outcome of the effective cooperation between the CSCE and the Russian Federation. Jan Eliasson held talks with [name and title indistinct], First Deputy Foreign Minister Adamishin [name as heard], and Vladimir Kazimirov in Moscow during the past few days. The need to find a peaceful solution to the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan within the CSCE framework was emphasized. The representatives of the nine CSCE Minsk Group members will meet in Vienna on 7 July. Vladimir Kazimirov will also attend that meeting. The most important point in the letter is the call to the disputing sides to take advantage of the cease-fire and sign a political agreement to completely end the bloody confrontation and move to resolve all the problems through talks.
