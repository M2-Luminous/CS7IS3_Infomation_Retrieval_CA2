FR941031-2-00017 FR941031-2-00013 •We disallowed additional transportation and land-leasing expenses for western honeybee beekeeping because they are based on U.S. costs, and are either inadequately supported or are based on incomplete methodology ( i.e., with regard to transportation, petitioners have failed to take into account the increase in yield associated with migratory beekeeping). •We adjusted beekeeping costs to offset the costs associated with beekeeping services and products other than honey. •We valued packing costs associated with steel drums using Indian import statistics rather than U.S. costs. •We have revised the FMV calculation for the eastern bee using a higher yield, as derived from the supporting data for the eastern bee presented in the petitioners' foreign market research. Fair Value Comparisons Based on a comparison of USP and FMV, petitioners' alleged dumping margins, as revised by the Department, range from 30.95 to 49.24 percent. Initiation of Investigation We have examined the petition on honey and have found that the petition meets the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether imports of honey from the PRC are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value. International Trade Commission (ITC) Notification Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of this action and we have done so. Preliminary Determination by the ITC The ITC will determine by November 17, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of honey from the PRC. A negative ITC determination will result in a termination of the investigation; otherwise, the investigation will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b). Dated: October 24, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
