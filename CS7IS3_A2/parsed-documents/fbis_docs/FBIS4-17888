Before leaving by plane for Tel-Aviv, Rabin expressed hope that fulfilment of the bilateral agreements signed earlier in Moscow will contribute to developing cooperation between the two countries. The Israeli prime minister met with deputy head of St. Petersburg administration Aleksey Kudrin. The exchange of ideas proved useful for the Russian party, because Israel earlier used to tackle the problems which Russia faces now. These include controlling the inflation, privatization (especially, privatization of housing construction) and developing the agro-industrial complex. Asked to comment on his decision to fly aboard an ordinary Israeli plane together with 170 emigrants from Kiev and 25 from St. Petersburg, rather than aboard a chartered one, like he did when he arrived in Russia, Rabin said he wanted to share -- if only for once -- the sentiments of those who had made the hard choice to leave their birth-places for ever.
