FBIS3-7571 "dreas061__a94011" FBIS-EAS-94-061-A Document Type:Daily Report 29 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan Party Leaders Consider Formation of New Party Accord Said Reached OW2903124394 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 29 Mar 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2903124394 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] It was learned on 28 March that an agreement has already been reached between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa that they will work to form a new party under the leadership of "Hosokawa and Ozawa" and that as a preliminary step, they will inaugurate a policy study group under the same leadership before the end of April and call on the ruling parties to join in the group. A series of plans advocated by Hosokawa and others for uniting the ruling parties will inevitably invite criticism from the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger], which are opposed to the idea of Shinseito and Sakigake taking the initiative in promoting the realignment of political parties, because these plans have not been fully discussed by the ruling parties and because they include personnel issues. At a meeting on the night of 28 March, some members of the Japan New Party [JNP] expressed opposition to the idea of merging the ruling coalition into a new party. As such, a rift between the ruling parties will likely intensify. On 13 March, Hosokawa, Ozawa, and Ichikawa together met with the independent Toshio Yamaguchi and senior JNP officials to discuss the issue of uniting the ruling parties into one party. On 18 March, Hosokawa and Ozawa continued the discussions. In the discussions, Hosokawa reportedly urged Ozawa and Ichikawa to begin work to select unified ruling coalition candidates for the next general election, which will be held under a combination of the single-seat constituency and proportional representation systems, and Ozawa and Ichikawa agreed to begin the work from April. It has also been reported that they agreed to turn the policy study group into a new political party at an early stage. They also agreed to name the policy study group "Reform," which would eventually become the Reform Party, to stress the "continuation of reform efforts," and that membership in the group will be one of the criteria to be selected as a unified candidate. They reportedly held in-depth discussions on the formation of the policy study group and a new party. It is said that considering the facts that the Hosokawa cabinet still maintains about a 50-percent approval rating and that Hosokawa is seen as the symbol of the change of government and the inauguration of the coalition government, they agreed to name Hosokawa as head of the group. They also confirmed that Ozawa would be in charge of operating the group. Also, they discussed having Ichikawa be put in charge of policymaking or be appointed to another important post. They agreed in principle on these things and decided to discuss further detailed personnel affairs. The SDPJ, Sakigake, and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] are opposed to and perplexed by the quick moves by Ozawa and Ichikawa to firm up concrete plans to unite the ruling parties into one party. On 28 March, a senior DSP official said, "Our party intends not to allow members to participate in the group even as private citizens." In this way, he disclosed that the DSP is calling on its members to refrain from joining the group. On 25 March, Hosokawa told SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama that "there is misunderstanding" and that "I have not instructed [Ozawa and Ichikawa to formulate plans to merge the ruling coalition into one party]." The SDPJ and other ruling parties are critical of Hosokawa for his insincerity because they believe Hosokawa has discussed with Ozawa and Ichikawa plans to unite the ruling parties, including personnel affairs, and that he is trying to cover up this fact. On 28 March, a top SDPJ official said: "It is unclear what the prime minister's real intentions are. We will never accept the plan to inaugurate a policy study group led by Ozawa."
