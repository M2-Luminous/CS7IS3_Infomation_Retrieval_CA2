FBIS4-45265 "jptdd025__l94017" JPRS-TDD-94-025-L JPRS Narcotics 31 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA COLOMBIA EL TIEMPO Notes `Tense Situation' Generated by Suspended EL TIEMPO Notes `Tense Situation' Generated by Suspended U.S. Radar Operations PA0206185794 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 31 May 94 pp 1a, 11a PA0206185794 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO Spanish BFN [Text] Since the Cartagena Agreement was signed on 15 February 1990 on the struggle against drug trafficking--which includes the United States, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia--never has such a tense situation been generated among the signatory nations as the one observed last weekend between the United States, Colombia, and Peru. One month ago, the Pentagon issued an order to suspend operations of the two radars that detect aircraft. These radars operate in Colombia as a result of that agreement. The same decision was made regarding the radars that operate in Peru. This decision--labeled by high-ranking Colombian Government spokespersons as "not consulted, untimely, unilateral, and discourteous"--has not been officially communicated to the authorities by the U.S. Government which has preferred to remain silent. The incident began on Sunday, 1 May. On that day, the Colombian Air Force officer in charge of radar operations in Aracuara and Leticia (Amazonas), officially communicated to the Defense Ministry that--without any explication--the passing on of information on flights from the radars was being suspended by the U.S. military. Since then and up until now, the two Colombian radars have not been operating. The order was issued by the Pentagon to the soldiers through the U.S. Southern Command in Panama. A high-ranking government official said: "The news was baffling although at the beginning it was said that the suspension was only for eight days." The following day, a Colombian Government official contacted the embassy, which had no official information. At that point President Gaviria decided to request a formal explanation for what was happening. That was 28 days ago, and no reply has been received yet. In Colombia, the matter was handled with confidentiality, until Sunday, when U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST reported that Colombia and Peru "would take reprisals" against the United States as a result of its decision to suspend operations of the four radars. Those "reprisals" would be the decision to ship out of the country two 30-year-old radars that were used in the Vietnam War and which have been of no use in the struggle against drug trafficking for the past month. A government spokesman said that of course the removal of the radars would also be accompanied by "a cordial invitation" to the U.S. soldiers and experts in charge of their maintenance to leave the country. No government official has confirmed or denied that decision. A government spokesman consulted by EL TIEMPO, however, said that "it is obvious that if the radars are useless, there is no sense in keeping them or their technicians in Colombian territory." Meanwhile, the authorities know that drug traffickers' illegal flights have been on the rise in the past month due to the total absence of control in that Amazon area. This is where drugs from Bolivia and Peru enter Colombia. The official report on the illegal flights indicate that in 1993, in that area, 375 aircraft were detected and up until 1 May this year, 200 flights were reported. This past month an average of one illegal flight per day has been added. The government's final determination on the U.S. decision will only be adopted when the United States gives a formal explanation of what is occurring. In the meantime, it is only known that the suspension of radars operations was decided by the Pentagon, apparently without the blessing of the State Department or the Justice Department. What some government officials fear is that an explanation will never be received, therefore Colombia will have to make a decision.
