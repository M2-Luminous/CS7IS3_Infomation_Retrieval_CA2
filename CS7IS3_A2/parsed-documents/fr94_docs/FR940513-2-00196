FR940513-2-00196 FR940513-2-00092 Eligibility In the U.S., participation in the program is open to accredited two-year and four-year colleges and universities, including graduate schools. Consortia of universities and/or community colleges, individually or as systems, are also eligible. In South Africa, participation is limited to the University of the Western Cape, the University of Fort Hare, the University of the North, and the University of Zululand. Proposals from a consortium may be submitted by a member institution with authority to represent the consortium. Participants representing the U.S. institution traveling under USIA grant support must be U.S. citizens. Participants representing South African institutions must be citizens, nationals, or permanent residents of South Africa. The Agency invites proposals from eligible Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's) and other institutions in the U.S. with significant minority student enrollment. Consortia of universities including such institutions are also encouraged to apply. Project Design The project should begin with a conference in South Africa bringing together American experts and South Africans students, instructors, and staff to provide initial training in student affairs/educational administration and conflict resolution and to develop subsequent programming. Incorporating South African citizens' aspirations and objectives into the overall training plan is crucial to the success of the project. The second phase of the project would focus on formal training at the U.S. host institution. The administering U.S. institution, in consultation with the United States Information Service offices (USIS) in Pretoria, and the project participants would select a group of South Africans to come to the U.S. institution for courses, workshops, and guided research on student politics in democratic societies, managing change in educational institutions, conflict resolution, and general management skills. Research might focus upon creating a history of the South African student movement, outlining its role in democratizing educational institutions, and devising models for exercising student power in a democratic South Africa. The U.S. academic experience should be from six weeks to one semester in length. Longer stays for the purpose of pursuing an advanced degree will not be sponsored. Participants may enroll in established courses at the administering institution. However, the institution should also be able to organize customized training sessions for the group participants. The final format of the academic program will depend upon consultation among the U.S. and South African participants at the initial conference in South Africa. The final segment of the grant would be follow-up workshops organized by the South African participants at their home institutions with facilitation and consultation from the U.S. instructors in the program. The U.S. institution may also propose to assist with publication and dissemination of findings developed during the U.S. training program and the final South African workshops. Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life.
