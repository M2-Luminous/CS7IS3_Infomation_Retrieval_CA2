Demanding the details of the nuclear inspection talks on Friday the PML chief said media reports had strengthened the suspicion in this regard as the US declared that its objective was to achieve non-proliferation in South Asia by forcing Pakistan to rollback and cap its nuclear programme. He said since the US Deputy Secretary of State declared these talk as "complete success" therefore it was legitimate to ask about the details of these talks, adding, a further cause of concern is the announcement by both sides that in the future deliberations on achieving the American objectives would be pursed through quiet and secret diplomacy". Former prime minister pointed out that the joint communique issued at the end of these talks failed to mention the Indian nuclear and ballistic missile programme which is a real threat to the security of the region, adding," there has been no reference to a regional approach on the nuclear issue. Nawaz Sharif expressing his concern over the "quiet diplomacy" being talked about in the context of the nuclear programme said, "like the rest of his countrymen I have certain apprehension that under the garb of this quiet diplomacy the PPP government would damage national security as it did by providing help to Rajiv Gandhi on on the Sikh issue". He said that help came to light almost five years after the event when Benazir herself confessed it recently and perhaps it was also a part of the PPP's quiet diplomacy of that period. Criticising Benazir Bhutto he alleged, "since the entire nation knows that she is a security risk we have every right to question her motives in pursuing 'quiet diplomacy' which could end up similar to the secret support to Rajiv Gandhi on the Sikh issue". Highlighting the importance of Pakistan's nuclear programme he said there is broad national consensus on the nuclear issue and the PPP would not be allowed to compromise on this issue. Terming the nuclear issue as a sacred trust and as a deterrent against foreign aggression he said Pakistan's consistent commitment was viewing the nuclear issue in a regional perspective with an even-handed approach that links the core security question like Kashmir with the nuclear issue. He warned that any reversal of this position would amount to rolling back the nuclear programme and the national consensus. He asked the PPP government to dispel apprehensions and doubts it should categorically the nation about its real position on the nuclear issue.
