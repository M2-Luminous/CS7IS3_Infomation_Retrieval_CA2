Repeat this inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 4,000 landings until the inspection required by paragraph (e) of this AD is accomplished. (1) For airplanes that have accumulated less than 11,200 total landings as of February 5, 1990 (the effective date of AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07): Prior to the accumulation of 11,000 landings or within the next 1,000 landings after February 5, 1990, whichever occurs later. (2) For airplanes that have accumulated 11,200 or more total landings but less than 15,201 total landings as of February 5, 1990 (the effective date of AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07): Within the next 1,000 landings after February 5, 1990, or prior to the accumulation of 15,500 total landings, whichever occurs earlier. (3) For airplanes that have accumulated 15,201 or more total landings but less than 18,200 total landings as of February 5, 1990: Within the next 300 landings after February 5, 1990, or prior to the accumulation of 18,250 total landings, whichever occurs earlier. (4) For airplanes that have accumulated 18,200 or more landings as of February 5, 1990: Within the next 50 landings after February 5, 1990. (b) For airplanes having line numbers 201 through 765: Accomplish the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this AD. (1) If any cracking is detected, prior to further flight, repair in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2312, dated June 12, 1989; or Revision 1, dated March 29, 1990; or Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992. (2) Prior to the accumulation of 20,000 total landings or within the next 3,000 landings after February 5, 1990 (the effective date of AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07), whichever occurs later, modify the airplane by replacing countersunk fasteners in the upper row of the lower lobe lap joints in the vicinity of the wing-to-body fairing with protruding head fasteners, in accordance with the procedures described in the Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2312, dated June 12, 1989; or Revision 1, dated March 29, 1990; or Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992. (c) For purposes of complying with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this AD, the number of landings may be determined to equal the number of pressurization cycles where the cabin pressure differential was greater than 2.0 p.s.i.
