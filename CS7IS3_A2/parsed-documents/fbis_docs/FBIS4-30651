FBIS4-30651 "dreas125_j_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-125 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 Indonesia Demonstrators To Appear in Court Demonstrators To Appear in Court BK2806045994 Hong Kong AFP in English 0430 GMT 28 Jun 94 BK2806045994 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Jakarta, June 28 (AFP) -- Up to 21 people arrested Monday during demonstrations protesting a government ban on three weekly publications were to appear in Central Jakarta district court Tuesday. There will be three separate hearings for the demonstrators, who include prominent poet Rendra, said court official Amir Samsudin. He said 29 demonstrators had been arrested but seven were released immediately. One man, identified only as Viktor, was detained for allegedly instigating the demonstration, and will face trial later. One of Rendra's relatives said the demonstrators had been questioned without lawyers being present. Rita Kalibonso, a lawyer with the country's leading human rights group Legal Aid Foundation, said the 21 demonstrators were considered to have committed minor offences under the law and could be dealt with summarily. They were likely to face charges either of refusing to disperse despite repeated warnings by security officials, or holding a mass gathering of more than five people without a police permit. The offences carry maximum sentences of 18 weeks and two-week jail terms respectively. The government's decision last week to revoke the licences of three popular weekly publications TEMPO, EDITOR and DETIK which had criticised a minister close to President Suharto has triggered protests from several human rights groups, students, journalists and artists. On Monday hundreds of anti-riot police and military in combat-fatigues and wearing black T-shirts with "Operation Cleansing 1994" written on them, broke up the demonstrations.
