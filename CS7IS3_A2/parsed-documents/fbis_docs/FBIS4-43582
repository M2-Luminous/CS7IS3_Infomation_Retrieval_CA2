After the controversy created by the Constitutional Court ruling, which revealed a huge gap in the welfare budget, a major structural reform of the welfare system is beginning to take shape. This operation will go ahead irrespective of whatever solution the government will find to the INPS [National Agency for Social Security] gap. Economic ministers are already examining a detailed plan for pension reform that they could include in next year's finance bill. The idea being considered by the government envisions raising the retirement age to 65 for men and 60 for women starting 1 January 1995. This measure would be coupled with the raising of the minimum requirement for an old-age pension from 35 to 40 years. According to a plan drawn up by experts and currently being examined by the government, the total sum gained by these two measures would permit savings of 4,191 billion lire starting in 1995 and would permit the INPS to pay out 254,000 fewer pensions. In 1996 savings would total 7,465 billion lire and 387,000 fewer pensions would be paid. The year after that savings would total 12,031 billion lire and 611,000 fewer pensions would be paid. By the year 2010 estimated savings would be 34,017 billion lire. Public Administration Minister Giuliano Urbani referred to reform of the pension system when he put forward three alternatives for resolving the problem: "To raise the retirement age to the European average of 65, to lower the level of pensions, or to seek a combination of these two solutions." Urbani's remarks, though very cautious, were enough to prompt a protest from the trade unions: "My sharp opposition to such an option," Silvano Miniati, of the pensioners' union, said sarcastically, "is based solely on social considerations. If, apart from introducing the obligation to continue working until the age of 65, the right to do so were also guaranteed, my opposition would be considerably attenuated...." [passage omitted]
