However, we learned that the humanitarian fuel will be distributed free to public hospitals and sold at $1.20 per gallon to the private institutions in Port-au-Prince. Thus, the fuel crisis continues to claim victims in the country's institutions. This week, it is the health sector that is threatened. Saint-Francois De Salle Hospital has decided to close its admission service and surgery unit. The hemodialysis section has also stopped working. This unit, the only center now available for hemodialysis which purifies the blood of patients suffering from kidney failure, can no longer operate because of the shortage of fuel. At the Saint-Francois De Salle Hospital, activities were extremely slow on 24 January. This 100-bed center is facing some extremely difficult moments according to its director, Doctor Sainphar Bontemps. [passage omitted] The French hospital continues to offer full services to patients. The director, however, pointed out to us that its oil stock could be depleted by the end of the week. [passage omitted]. Mr. Martineau advised us that the French hospital intends to extend its admissions of deprived people. At the Canape-Vert Hospital, services are being maintained. The manager of this 48-bed center says the hospital is affected by the shortage of fuel. Jean Craan states that he had to help colleagues who were facing urgent fuel problems this week. The director explained that the Canape-Vert Hospital could not in any event receive all the patients in Port-au-Prince in case the crisis worsens in the other hospitals. Jean Craan expresses the solidarity of the Canape-Vert Hospital with other health centers in difficulty. [passage omitted] Questioned as to reports regarding a possible disqualification of the Canape-Vert Hospital in receiving humanitarian fuel because of the social class of its patients, Craan asserts that it would be a great mistake. He made a point of clarifying that the doors of the hospital are open to patients of differing social classes and that the hospital is approved by the state. The hospital of the State University of Haiti is also affected by the shortage of fuel. The General Hospital is working with a reduced staff and oil products are being purchased at high prices while waiting for the humanitarian fuel, according to Director General Jean Boirond.
