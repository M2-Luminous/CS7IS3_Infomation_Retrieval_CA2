And do the democrats need to intercept them from their political opponents? MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI authors have different views on this problem. V. Lipitskiy: `Enemy Instead of Ally' The success of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and Zhirinovskiy is all the more remarkable in that it was achieved in the absence of serious organizational structures. It graphically demonstrated the power and attractiveness of patriotic phrases, even if reduced to the grotesque. Also notable is the fact that a majority of the electorate went for their noncommunist version, rejecting the old idioms. And now it remains merely to guess at the reason for this. The "national-patriotic" opposition is the child and reflection of the current authorities, nurtured by their mistakes and symmetrically reflecting their characteristic features. Of course, as befits a mirror reflection, its details, despite its entire similarity with the original, have an opposite sign. This applies to the generic characteristics of both the authorities and the opposition: "democratism" and "patriotism." Whence the odd and illogical division into "patriots" and "democrats" as alternate political forces? Without delving even into hoary antiquity, to the sources of the struggles of the Slavophiles and Westerners, it can be seen how difficult it has been to avoid such a division. Any authorities use patriotism as an argument in their favor, in support of preservation of the status quo, and our ancien regime resorted to this method particularly sedulously. The situation pushed those who were opposed to the regime into a disregard for patriotic values, therefore. The dissident movement in the USSR up to 1985 was not mass-based, popular even less. It was highly elite and pro-West. With the start of perestroyka, the situation changed considerably. Sometimes you simply have to wonder: Where did all these swarms of intrepid fighters against totalitarianism come from? What were they doing until they learned from the mouth of the general secretary that free-thinking was allowed, and encouraged, even? Were they suffering in the snares of lies and lack of rights? By no means! Unmurmuringly they "cooperated with the regime" in the ranks of pioneer, Communist Youth League, and trade union organizations and also in the ranks of the Volunteer Society for Assistance to the Army, Air Force, and Navy and the Water-Rescue Society. It is clear that this conformist environment could not have created its own ideology but adopted that prepared in advance by the dissidents. The basis thereof was the idea of democracy--and it was clear to all without needless words, what is more, that Western democracy would be taken as the model. Whence arose a dilemma, just as simple and convincing as it is erroneous: Democrats are the supporters of reforms and familiarization with world, that is to say, Western, civilization; patriots are retrograde persons, restorers of the past, and the enemies of transformations. Such is the prehistory in principle, which by no means excludes special cases. There was also an informal national-patriotic movement, also of the opposition, although the democrats shunned it and expressed doubt as to its independence of the regime. Muslim traditionalism began to gather momentum in the republics, but overseas influence also performed not the least role here. The rejection of patriotic emphases, granted all its conditional nature, proved to be a miscalculation made by the democrats. The flank was surrendered without resistance, although, with a preponderance in the news media at that time, an equality of positions could have been achieved, at least. But the tactics of the democratic forces at that time were determined by the forecast of the lengthy and gradual transformation of society. Inertia is one explanation of why the democrats, having become the authorities, continued (and now continue) to behave as the opposition. The struggle against totalitarianism had pushed to the forefront people with the optimum set of attributes for such a specific mission. They feel themselves to be, as before, overthrowers and are far less inspired and specific when it is a question of constructive tasks. The patriotic idea, national interests, and power projection for this pleiad of destroyers are merely fragments of the old world, in whose breakup they were so thoroughly involved that they did not notice how reasonable limits had been exceeded. In addition, there came with them into power a pro-West orientation, which acquired additional impetus inasmuch as the West discovered in Russia entirely material interests. Politicians who allowed themselves to speak about this out loud quickly found themselves isolated and out of a job. This is why the authorities began so belatedly (only as of the start of 1993, seemingly, when new arguments in the struggle against the Supreme Soviet were needed) to master the patriotic vocabulary. This proved difficult--there was still the desire to utter the sacramental "I do not believe!" And the people uttered it at the elections on 12 December. The radical democrats had acquired a new enemy. They came to life noticeably--a crisis of the genre was manifestly perceived after the October events. Now once again there was someone to implacably combat, and the threat that the slow-moving reforms so sorely needed was discovered. And the very first clashes revealed the increased divergence of the ideas of democratism and patriotism, which increasingly resembled Kipling's East and West: Never would the twain meet. We can only wonder at the low trainability of already venerable politicians who had succumbed to panic in the face of their failure. They were unable to think up anything better than to call together an anti-fascist front. And these are people in whose hands are power and responsibility for the fate of the country, and patriotism, consequently, is their field! This portends nothing good. A choice between an nonindependent policy deprived of national priorities and bellicose nationalism is no choice. A democratism unadapted to Russian conditions has few chances of survival and even fewer chances of becoming a dependable barrier to the far more customary autocracy. And ultra-patriotism (it is into this niche that the authorities are sedulously shoving even very moderate patriotic impulses) also gravitates toward dictatorial forms. The discrediting of the democratic idea, on the other hand, which ensues from the extremely unsuccessful forms of embodiment, is making it a feeble counterweight to the growing national self-awareness, hurt national feeling, and mass discontent at the progress of the reforms. The hounding of patriotism and contrasting it with democracy are extremely unproductive. The synthesis thereof--democratic patriotism (Rutskoy's term, which was undeservedly criticized)--is needed particularly in Russia. And the future is on the side of the political forces that know how to unite people around national values and interests on the basis of democratic forms of the organization of society. Kronid Lyubarskiy: `Monkey's Paw' Now, when the voices of fascists are for the first time starting to be heard within the Russian Parliament and the democrats have simply not recovered, seemingly, from the shock induced by this fact, it is worth remembering one, not all that significant, event, which occurred at the end of June at the Constitutional Conference. After two weeks of work in groups, a plenary session, at which the rapporteurs presenting the viewpoints of all the groups on various aspects of the Constitution were to have spoken, was scheduled. Six persons were chosen from the political parties and grassroots organizations. Among those applying to speak was Vladimir Zhirinovskiy also, but his candidacy was during the vote in the group of parties rejected. Imagine the astonishment when the chairman at the plenary session called to speak, instead of the rapporteur chosen by the group, Zhirinovskiy. With evident pleasure, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia delivered his somewhat insolent and freewheeling speech, the end of which was covered in, I shall not say tumultuous, but quite loud, applause. Some 150 representatives of the political parties had simply been spat upon. After the session, the democrats, at home in the "highest spheres," explained with consternation and with shame: Well, you understand, Zhirinovskiy is for strong presidential authority.... I also am for strong presidential authority. But no political goal, even the most noble, can be achieved with the aid of "allies" from the camp of totalitarianism. A price that obliterates the entire meaning of the victory that has been won has to be paid for such "assistance." Support for the democrats by fascists or communists is the monkey's paw from the well-known parable of the talisman capable of fulfilling wishes, but always in the most appalling way. So when its young owner made a wish for riches, there was an immediate knock on the door from a messenger who informed him of the death of his much-loved father, who had left him an inheritance. All other miracles wrought by the monkey's paw were of the same kind. I cannot prove this, but I have the continual suspicion that Zhirinovskiy's occupation of television in the fateful first 10 days of December was not simply Bragin's stupidity or a spineless understanding of "pluralism." Zhirinovskiy was put on the screen as an ally in the cause of propaganda of the Constitution. People wanted to "use" him, but the "monkey's paw" effect worked unswervingly. The price that we will all pay for Zhirinovskiy's "support" of the Constitution has not as yet been fully recognized, it would seem. Yet by the time Zhirinovskiy was put on the screen, his political views were no secret. I will quote merely the following significant words: "How I dream that Russian soldiers will wash their boots in the warm water of the Indian Ocean.... That any platoon of Russian soldiers could bring order to be bear in any space.... The Army cannot get stronger in military recruiting offices and barracks. It needs a purpose, a mission.... The Russian Army would have to revive again today were....it to accomplish an operation to establish Russia's new borders in a southerly direction" (Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, "Last Dash to the South," which was signed to press on 28 September 1993, over two months prior to the Duma elections). If what has just been quoted does not constitute the formal elements of a crime as specified by Article 71 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Propaganda of war, in whatever form it is conducted"), I would inquire of Aleksey Kazannik, general procurator of the Russian Federation, what in this case he considers such propaganda. And does not his own silence fall under another article of the Criminal Code, Article 172, which reads: "....an official's nondischarge or inappropriate discharge of his duties as a consequence of a negligent or unconscientious attitude toward them that has appreciably damaged state or public interests or the rights and interests of the citizens protected by law"? I greatly fear that the tolerant attitude of representatives of the Russian power establishment toward fledgling Russian fascism has deep roots. It is hardly that any of them harbor affections for fascism. But they lack immunity; their blood lacks a sufficient number of antibodies immediately and decisively rejecting totalitarianism and its methods in any form. The spirit of totalitarianism is with frightening constancy being revived in the hearts of democrats, and some of its methods seem acceptable to them, even, and its support, permissible. I recall the discussion at the Constitutional Conference of the article on the citizen's right to freedom of movement on the territory of the Russian Federation, when there suddenly appeared a proposal, submitted by it is not known whom, for restricting this freedom. It was not a question of some temporary measure, but of the introduction of restrictions in an unalterable part of the Constitution determining the basic rights and liberties of the citizens! A spiritual leader of Russian democracy, Father Gleb Yakunin, the "Russian Makarios," delivered an impassioned speech in support of these restrictions, alluding to the wishes of the electorate. Well, "yesterday's slave, tired of liberty," frequently "demands the lash." These demands can be heeded. It was the unanimous support of Muscovites and their anger at the "capture" of Moscow's markets by "people of Caucasian nationality" and so forth to which Moscow's City Hall alluded when introducing the "special procedure of residence" in the capital. It counted on the same when adopting the decision on the expulsion of the refugees, for whom it was required to display concern by an international convention that had been signed by Russia. The problem is not only and not so much the fact that the spirit of Moscow's initiative rapidly spread through Russia and was echoed in the "near abroad." The most frightening aspect is that each such step is a substantial contribution to a revival of the "ethics" of totalitarianism. Only by having defined misanthropic ideologies as an absolute evil and having rejected them once and for all, patiently explaining their essence, will we have an opportunity to bar the way to fascism. Zhirinovskiy's victory is merely the first bell. We need to be able to hear it.
