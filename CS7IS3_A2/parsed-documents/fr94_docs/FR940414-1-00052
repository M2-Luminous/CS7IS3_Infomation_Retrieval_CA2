FR940414-1-00052 FR940414-1-00010 One effective pollution prevention technique for laboratory equipment cleaning is to dedicate laboratory sinks to certain products, so wastewater generated from testing a product can be collected for reuse in the product or for transfer back to the PAI manufacturer or product registrant. In the cases where solvents are often used in conjunction with the QC tests performed in the laboratory, the facility may not be able to reuse the solvent-contaminated water. One facility uses a small activated carbon unit to treat their lab water. 10. Contaminated Precipitation Run-off This source of wastewater includes all precipitation that falls directly onto or runs onto PFPR facilities that is believed to be contaminated by product constituents. Contaminated precipitation runoff can be prevented by bringing all PFPR operations indoors, as many PFPR facilities have done, or roofing outdoor storage tanks and dikes, which has also been done at many PFPR facilities. The roofs must extend low enough to prevent crosswinds from blowing rain or other precipitation into spill-containment dikes. To prevent rainwater contamination, the drain spouts and gutters should conduct roof runoff to areas away from PFPR operations, and the roofs should be kept in good repair. VIII. Wastewater Control Technology Currently Available EPA has sampled six facilities with wastewater treatment. Through EPA's survey of the formulating, packaging and repackaging industry, very few facilities were found that use water in their formulating, packaging and repackaging process that also treat their wastewater. Most facilities discharge their wastewater indirectly to POTW's with little or no pretreatment. Many facilities send some of their more concentrated streams off-site for disposal or treatment, and many others reported recycling or reusing some or all of their wastewater. Of the few facilities that reported treatment, most are treating their wastewater and recycling it back to the facility. Five of the six sampled facilities that are treating their wastewater were recycling their treated wastewater. One of the six sampled facilities treated wastewaters from floor and equipment exteriors cleaning with ultrafiltration followed by activated carbon filtration. The treated water is recycled back to be used for this purpose again. At the same facility most of the wastewater generated by cleaning equipment interiors is recycled back into the product. This facility segregates wastewaters generated in the insecticide formulation area from those generated in the herbicide formulation area but otherwise mixes all herbicide or insecticide wastewaters together for treatment. A second facility treats its wastewater through a filtration system with a portion of the wastewater stream being sent to biological treatment. Most of the filtered wastewater is recycled to the facility for reuse as general process area cleaning water. The wastewater treated through biological treatment is sent for use as make-up in the general facility air pollution control scrubber. Two other facilities treat their wastewater through a cross-flow filter followed by activated carbon filtration. The wastewaters are then sent back to the processing area to be used for general clean-up. Another facility treats its wastewater through ozonation followed by activated carbon filtration. This wastewater is recycled back to the facility for reuse. The sixth facility sampled is also a manufacturer of pesticide active ingredient. This facility treats its formulating and packaging wastewater along with its manufacturing wastewater through an activated carbon system prior to discharge to an industrial pretreatment facility. The other surveyed facilities that treat their wastewaters were mostly the pesticide manufacturing facilities. Through site visits or phone follow-ups, EPA discovered that some plants have instituted several changes to wastewater handling practices since 1988. For example, one of the sampled facilities with wastewater treatment has since shut down. Between 1988 and shut down, the operation converted from discharge to reuse of wastewater. Two of the facilities that were sampled for wastewater treatment system performance have installed treatment since 1988. Another facility that was sampled for its wastewater treatment system had upgraded its system by adding ozonation treatment after 1988. IX. Best Practicable Control Technology Currently Available A. Pesticide Chemicals Formulating, Packaging and Repackaging (Subcategory C) EPA is not proposing any substantive amendments to the existing BPT provisions applicable to Subcategory C, established in 1978. However, EPA proposes to add the word repackaging to the title and the applicability provision for subpart C (ยง455.40) and to specifically exclude from BPT applicability the wastewaters generated by employee showers and laundry facilities. These changes are being proposed to clarify the types of operations covered and would not expand or contract the current coverage of the BPT effluent limitations guidelines. The term ``packagers'' in the subpart C applicability provision, 40 CFR 455.40, was always intended to cover repackaging as well as packaging. Likewise, EPA proposes to expressly exclude from coverage wastewaters generated by employee showers (distinct from safety showers, which are included), fire protection test water and laundry facilities. The current regulation does not expressly state whether employee showers and laundry facilities are process wastewater sources. EPA is proposing to clarify that employee showers, fire protection test water and laundries are not within the scope of coverage because of concerns that their inclusion could cause a disincentive for facilities to provide shower facilities for their employees, which in turn could pose a potential health and safety concern. Fire protection test water is generated by facilities testing sprinkler systems or hydrants to ensure their operation should the facility have a fire. EPA does not wish to create a disincentive for this testing by controlling these waters especially since it is unlikely they would be contaminated. EPA is aware of PFPR facilities that have permits allowing discharges from employee showers and laundries while other PFPR wastewater sources at the facilities are required by their permits to achieve zero discharge. EPA is soliciting comment on this clarification of the applicability of the PFPR regulations to wastewater from showers, fire protection test water and laundries.
