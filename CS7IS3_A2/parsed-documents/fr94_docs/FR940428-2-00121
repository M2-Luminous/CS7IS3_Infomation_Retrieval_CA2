FR940428-2-00121 FR940428-2-00055 PACIFIC NORTHWEST ELECTRIC POWER AND CONSERVATION PLANNING COUNCIL Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program April 15, 1994. AGENCY: Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Northwest Power Planning Council). ACTION: Notice of Proposed Amendments to the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (mainstem passage survival hypotheses). SUMMARY: Pursuant to the Pacific Electric Power and Conservation Act (the Northwest Power Act, 16 U.S.C. section 839, et seq.) the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Council) has proposed amendments to the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (program). The amendments propose to establish hypotheses regarding the relationship between river flows, velocity, transportation, and the survival of anadromous fish in the mainstem of the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Copies of the proposed amendments are now available, and comments are solicited. BACKGROUND: The proposed amendments are intended to facilitate investigation of the relationship between flow, water velocity and fish survival and the efficacy of smolt transportation. After the conclusion of this rulemaking process, the Council will consider the need for further actions to reduce mortalities to anadromous fish in the mainstem. The current rulemaking process, however, is not intended to predetermine any decisions made in the later, summer rulemaking. OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMENT: The Council will receive written comment on the proposed amendments through 5 p.m. Pacific time, May 25, 1994. Comments should be clearly marked ``Mainstem Hypothesis Comments,'' and submitted to the Council's Public Affairs Division, 851 S.W. Sixth Avenue, Suite 1100, Portland, Oregon 97204. After the close of comment, the Council may initiate further consultations, or reopen the record for further written comment. The Council expects to make a final decision in this rulemaking process in June, 1994. HEARINGS: The Council is in the process of scheduling hearings in the four Northwest states. Please call the Council's public affairs division for information on the schedule and location for hearings, and watch for further information in the Council's newsletter, Update.
