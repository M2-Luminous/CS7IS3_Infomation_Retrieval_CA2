FR940202-1-00005 FR940202-1-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;178&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 767 Series Airplanes Equipped With Pratt and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 or General Electric CF6&hyph;80A Series Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes, that currently requires inspections, adjustments, and functional checks of the thrust reverser system. This action would add a requirement for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature, periodic functional tests of that locking feature following its installation, and repair of any discrepancy found. This proposal is prompted by the identification of a modification that ensures that the level of safety inherent in the original type design of the thrust reverser system is further enhanced. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent possible discrepancies in the thrust reverser control system that can result in the inadvertent deployment of a thrust reverser during flight. DATES: Comments must be received by March 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;178&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard Simonson, Aerospace Engineer, Propulsion Branch, ANM&hyph;140S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2683; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;NM&hyph;178&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;178&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On January 7, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8157 (57 FR 3004, January 27, 1992), applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes, to require inspections, adjustments, and functional checks of the thrust reverser system. That action was prompted by an ongoing design review, resulting from an accident investigation from which it has been determined that, prior to the accident, the airplane apparently experienced an uncommanded in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser. Deployment of a thrust reverser during flight could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. The requirements of that AD are intended to ensure the integrity of the fail safe features of the thrust reverser system by preventing the possible discrepancies in the thrust reverser control system that can result in the inadvertent deployment of a thrust reverser during flight. Since the issuance of that AD, Boeing has developed a modification for Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 or General Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines, which, when accomplished, will ensure that the level of safety inherent in the original type design of the thrust reverser system is further enhanced. The FAA has determined that the installation of these additional features will further reduce the likelihood of an in-flight thrust reverser deployment. The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0060, Revision 2, dated August 19, 1993 (for Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines), and Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0061, Revision 1, dated August 5, 1993 (for Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines). These service bulletins describe procedures for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature (denoted as a ``synch-lock''), which will reduce the possibility of an uncommanded in-flight deployment of the thrust reversers. Accomplishment of that installation includes revising certain wiring, replacing selected circuit breakers, changing the microswitch pack, and adding electrical components. The synch-lock is controlled independently of the existing electro-mechanical safety features of the thrust reverser system. This additional locking feature has been certified by the FAA. The FAA has determined that installation of the synch-lock in accordance with the applicable service bulletin is necessary in order to positively address the identified unsafe condition with regard to these airplanes.
