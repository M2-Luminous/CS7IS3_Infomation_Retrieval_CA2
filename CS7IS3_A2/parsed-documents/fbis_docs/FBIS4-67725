Last year 9.7 abortions were performed per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 19, about half the number that were performed in the 1980's. In the United States the corresponding figure is five times higher. The goal of the Population and Family Welfare Federation's new campaign, which is aimed at ninth graders, is to cut the number of abortions in half again by the year 2000, and at the same time reducing the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases [STD's]. [passage omitted] Condoms Accepted Associate Professor Pekka Lahteenmaki, senior medical officer of the Family Welfare Federation's family planning clinic, feels that today's young people are increasingly accepting condoms as a contraceptive. Some 14 million condoms are used in Finland annually. [passage omitted] Condoms are the only contraceptive method that also provide protection against sexually transmitted diseases. And the latest disease statistics show that cases of gonorrhea and syphilis have declined, while chlamydia has increased somewhat. There were 575 HIV cases at the end of last year, of which 149 had developed AIDS, and 106 of these had died. Statistics are unavailable for condyloma and herpes. [passage omitted]
