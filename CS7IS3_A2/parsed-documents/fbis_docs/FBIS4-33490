He has said if the service is interrupted, the executive will have no other recourse but to implement measures to deal with such a contingency. The transportation sector cannot be permitted to defend its own rights by harming the community, which has already shown considerable tolerance to the increase in the cost of living. Aguiar has said his office has been monitoring the situation between the mayor's office and Simon Lavera, president of the Central Federation of Roving and Terminal-Based Passenger Vehicles, regarding fares. Aguiar has announced that willingly or unwillingly, the government will prevent the strike with the resources as provided by the de jure state so the rest of the community will not be harmed. [Begin Aguiar recording] We do not have to come up with emergency measures, which already exist, as do plans utilizing the Armed Forces and National Guard to tend to these situations. It will also be necessary to devise complementary measures to prevent any provocation or pressure. We will study these measures and be prepared to implement them. [end recording] Mentioning the high crime rate, Aguiar expressed favor over organizational measures and announced the National Guard's cooperation to act in the so-called security areas, while the police would protect the people with squad cars and motorcycles.
