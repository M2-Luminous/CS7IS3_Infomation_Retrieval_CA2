This revision corrects deficiencies and adds requirements for the control of VOCs from surface coating, pneumatic rubber tire manufacturing, graphic arts and synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry (SOCMI) equipment leaks. The intended effect of this action is to approve these Pennsylvania VOC regulations as a revision to the SIP. This action is being taken pursuant to section 110 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). DATES: This action will become effective February 21, 1995, unless adverse or critical comments are received on or before January 23, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 31, 1985, June 29, 1988, and August 19, 1992, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (PADER) formally submitted amendments to 25 Pa Code Chapter 121_General Provisions and Chapter 129_Standards for VOC as SIP revisions. These revisions were submitted by PADER to correct existing deficiencies in its VOC regulations and to control emissions as part of the Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) Fix-up requirement of Section 182 of the CAA. Specifically, this document approves the addition of §129.72_Manufacture of Sulfonates (Surface Active Agents) and §129.71_Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry Equipment (SOCMI) Leaks into the PADER SIP submitted on December 31, 1985 and June 29, 1988, as well as amendments to the following section of 25 PA Code §121.4_Regional Organization of the Department; §129.51 General_VOC Recordkeeping Requirements; §129.52_Surface Coating; §129.62_General Standards for Bulk Gasoline Terminals, Bulk Gasoline Plants and Small Gasoline Storage Tanks; §129.66_Compliance Schedules and Final Compliance Dates; §129.67_Graphic Arts; and §129.69_Pneumatic Rubber Tire Manufacturing; §129.72_Manufacture of Sulfonates (Surface Active Agents) and §129.71_Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry (SOCMI) Equipment Leaks contained in the August 19, 1992 submittal. The December 31, 1985 and June 29, 1988 submittals also included a request that EPA approve the addition of the Commonwealth's wood cabinet and wood furniture finishing rule into the Pennsylvania's SIP. That regulation is the subject of a separate rulemaking document. On May 26, 1988, EPA issued a SIP call letter to Pennsylvania notifying the Commonwealth that its SIP was substantially inadequate to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone. In a June 14, 1988 follow-up letter, EPA notified PADER of deficiencies in its existing VOC regulations which needed to be corrected in order to make the regulations consistent with EPA policy and guidance. A SIP call letter is a finding made by EPA that the SIP does not provide for attainment by the required date, (section 110(a)(2)(H) of the Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(H); 42 U.S.C. 7410(A)(K)(5)). EPA's review of this material indicates that PADER has addressed the deficiencies pertaining to the correction of State VOC regulations required by section 182(a)(2)(A) and section 184(b) of the Act, as amended in 1990. Summary of the SIP Revision Section 121.4_Regional Organization of the Department The PADER revised the names and the counties included in the six administrative regions for the purpose of air pollution control. Southeast Region: Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties; Northeast Region: Carbon, Lackawanna, Lehigh, Luzerne, Monroe, Northampton, Pike, Schuylkill, Susquehanna, Wayne and Wyoming Counties; Southcentral Region: Adams, Bedford, Berks, Blair, Cumberland, Dauphin, Franklin, Fulton, Huntingdon, Juniata, Lancaster, Lebanon, Mifflin, Perry and York Counties; Northcentral Region: Bradford, Cameron, Centre, Clearfield, Clinton, Columbia, Lycoming, Montour, Northumberland, Potter, Synder, Sullivan, Tioga, and Union Counties; Southwest Region: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Cambria, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Somerset, Washington and Westmoreland Counties; Northwest Region: Butler, Clarion, Crawford, Elk, Erie, Forest, Jefferson, Lawrence, McKean, Mercer, Venango and Warren Counties.
