The figures are 39 percent for and 30 percent against, according to the latest EU poll carried out on behalf of DAGENS INDUSTRI and SKOP [Scandinavian Opinion Polls]. This is mainly due to the decreasing number of opponents rather than a growing number of supporters. In January, 39 percent of Swedes thought that Sweden should definitely or possibly join the EU. This figure, which is more or less unchanged since November-December, confirms an earlier indication that the negative opinion trend was reaching its peak. Since October the number of supporters has increased by 8 percent. The number of Swedes who think that Sweden should definitely or possibly not join the EU, on the other hand, has fallen from 34 percent in December to 30 percent in January. The greatest drop is among those totally opposed. The number of absolute opponents has been falling continuously from the figure of 42 percent recorded in September. The proportion of undecided voters increased during this period from 26 to 31 percent. That represents a growth of 2 percent since September, not confirmed by the statistics [as published]. The undecided continue to be crucial for the outcome of the vote. This category would still be inclined to vote no if the referendum were held today. The opposition would then win by 53 percent against 47. That is a 6-percent lead, compared with 23 percent in November-December and 25 percent in September. A more positive attitude toward the EU is permeating through all voter categories. Socialist sympathizers have taken a much more positive attitude, with 27 percent in favor and 37 percent against in January. The proportion of "don't knows" among socialist sympathizers topped 75 percent in September. In the conservative camp, those inclined to vote yes represent the same 52-percent majority as in September. "Support for the EU is growing among men and women, old and young, blue- and white-collar workers, and employees in the public and the private sector", Birgitta Hultaker of SKOP said. EU -- The Most Difficult Plebiscite of All Time "Three, maybe four, important factors will determine Swedish opinion on the EU issue from now until the voting -- and it will be impossible to predict its final course," Soren Holmberg, election researcher at Goteborg University, said. The forthcoming crucial debate around the Swedish vote will mainly depend on: 1. The ability of the parties to rally and capture their own groups of voters. It is generally easier for people to change their views than to switch party. 2. External events affecting Sweden, such as developments within the EU, unrest in East Europe, etc. 3. Economic development. The EU debate has been very materialistic so far. Favorable economic development in Sweden between now and the referendum will give more room for other EU issues, such as environment, equality, and peace. 4. The setup of the debate. No previous plebiscite in Sweden (right-hand traffic, general supplementary pension, nuclear energy), except for the one on alcohol prohibition in 1922, has given rise to such emotional involvement among the Swedes as the vote on EU membership. Soren Malmberg believes that this is due to the "catchall" nature of the EU issue. "The EU can be linked to everything: Economy, national security, equality, environment, industry, growth, unemployment, peace, etc., and this makes the issue difficult and unwieldy. It is impossible to predict how public opinion in Sweden will evolve, especially if you consider that two parliamentary parties -- the Social Democrats and the Center Party -- have evaded the issues and confounded their voters for such a long time." The nature of the debate -- and the scope created by the actors on the scene -- will of course depend on the first three elements in the opinion scenario outlined by Soren Holmberg. "The peace issue, which I see as being fundamental to the whole concept of the EU, has not received much attention in the debate so far. Except for a brief spate of euphoria less than two years ago, the EU debate has hitherto focused on materialistic issues and the economy."
