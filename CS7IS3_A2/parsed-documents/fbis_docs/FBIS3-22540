Rear Adm. Than Nyunt, who arrived Tuesday on a four-day unofficial visit, broached Myanmar's AIDS situation in a brief session of talks with Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, the officials said. Than Nyunt told Ouchi that Myanmar is grateful for AIDS-testing devices donated by the private Japanese Foundation for AIDS Prevention. The devices were donated last April during a visit to Myanmar by foundation leader Tatsuo Ozawa, a Shinseito member of the House of Representatives. Than Nyunt said until Japan's 1988 suspension of official aid to Myanmar, the country received substantial medical assistance from Tokyo. Japan suspended aid along with many other countries after Myanmar's military suppression on a democracy movement. Ouchi was quoted as saying Japan is very concerned about the AIDS problem in southeast Asia from a humanitarian point of view. But he did not offer any concrete support for Myanmar's AIDS prevention program, they said. A recent World Health Organization interim report said that by last June, Myanmar had only reported 47 AIDS cases. But Japanese officials said the actual situation is no doubt considerably worse. Than Nyunt, who is also chief of staff of the Myanmar Navy, is visiting Japan on his way home from a meeting of the United Nations Children's Fund in Mexico City.
