It is still too early to assess this step, he said in an interview with this newspaper. He sees the possibility that an acceleration of the peace process might follow from the threat. However, it is also conceivable that a disastrous logic of violence will be started. It might become very difficult to break it again, he said. Melescanu took the view that, after the agreement between the Muslims and Croats on the formation of a joint state in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the attempt has to be made now to again involve the Bosnian Serbs in the negotiations. A comprehensive peace plan that starts from the German-French peace initiative is necessary. In return for concessions of the Bosnian Serbs in the peace negotiations, this plan, which was proposed by [German] Foreign Minister Kinkel and [French] Foreign Minister Juppe and later adopted by the European Union (EU), provides for the gradual loosening of the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. In addition to the European Union, the United States, Russia, and the United Nations have to be involved in the talks of the warring parties, Melescanu said. Nastase, president of the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament and chairman of the biggest partner in the government coalition, the Social Democracy Party of Romania (PDSR), expressed the view that, with NATO's latest threats, the peace process has reached a decisive point. Nastase, who is expected for a five-day visit to Germany this Monday [25 April], told this newspaper that the shelling of Muslim enclaves by the Serbian besiegers has to be stopped immediately. At the same time, however, he also warned against a possible escalation of violence. All political means have to be used to accelerate the peace process again. Here a gradual loosening of the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro is also to be considered. So many attempts have been made to achieve peace in the former Yugoslavia. "We should also try to loosen the sanctions," Nastase said. According to Nastase, Romania has suffered an economic damage of more than 11 billion German marks [DM] as a consequence of the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. In order to compensate the neighboring countries of "Yugoslavia" -- Serbia and Montenegro -- at least for part of the damage, Nastase proposed the establishment of a UN fund. Romania, which has traditionally good relations with all successor states of the former Yugoslavia, is offering its services as a further mediator in the Balkan war, if this is desired. Bucharest is also conceivable as a possible place for new peace negotiations. "Yugoslav" Prime Minister Jovanovic said in Bucharest that NATO's threats are an "unfortunate development" and a further proof of the continuous application of different standards in the Balkan war by the West. The "negative developments" in Gorazde were caused by a Muslim offensive, to which the Bosnian Serbs had only reacted with a counteroffensive. The "Muslim offensive," however, was not noticed in the West, but it reacted with punitive actions to the Serbian counteroffensive. Jovanovic expressed the fear that the "important results" of the meeting of Akashi, UN envoy for the former Yugoslavia, with Serbian President Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic in Belgrade last Saturday, might be thwarted by NATO's "pressure from the outside." Morizet, French diplomat in Bucharest, felt called upon to warn that one must not counter "the terror on the ground with (NATO) terror from the air" in Bosnia.
