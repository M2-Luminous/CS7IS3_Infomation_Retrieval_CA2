FR940317-1-00013 FR940317-1-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;05&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes Equipped With Pratt & Whitney JT9D&hyph;3 or JT9D&hyph;7 Series Engines, Excluding JT9D&hyph;70 Series Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections of the inboard and outboard strut chords, stiffeners, and web to detect cracks and loose fasteners; repair of the chords, stiffeners, or web, if necessary; and replacement of any loose fastener. This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue cracks and loose fasteners found in the forward lower spar web of the inboard strut on Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D&hyph;3 and JT9D&hyph;7 series engines. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent separation of the strut from the wing of the airplane due to fatigue cracking. DATES: Comments must be received by May 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;05&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tim Backman, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANM&hyph;120S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2776; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;05&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;05&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion The FAA has received six reports of fatigue cracks and one report of loose fasteners found in the forward lower spar web of the inboard strut on Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D&hyph;3 and JT9D&hyph;7 series engines. The cracks were found in the area under the stiffeners and baffle and along the web chord. The airplanes on which these cracks were found had accumulated between 6,451 and 18,350 flight cycles and between 17,797 and 83,960 flight hours. All cracks reported have been found on the web of the inboard strut. During investigation of a recent in-flight engine loss, a similar crack of approximately two inches in length was found on the forward lower spar web. Although the in-inflight engine loss incident is still under investigation, the crack in the web was determined to be a contributing cause of the accident. Cracking in the forward lower spar web of the inboard strut could reduce the lateral strength of the strut. This condition, if not detected and corrected in a timely manner, could result in separation of the strut from the wing of the airplane due to fatigue cracking. Although all cracks reported were found on the web of the inboard strut, given standard design tolerances, little difference exists between the thickness of the web of the inboard strut (0.025 inch) and that of the outboard strut (0.032 inch). Additionally, the inboard and outboard webs are similar in configuration and loading environments. For these reasons, the FAA finds that the outboard strut web is subject to the same unsafe condition as the inboard strut web.
