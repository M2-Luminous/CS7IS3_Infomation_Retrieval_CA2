On arrival, the Prime Minister will be received by Air Chief Marshal Farooq Feroze Khan. The Prime Minister will also take a round of the PAC and inspect the overhaul and engineering facilities there. F-7P, a Chinese aircraft, is the larest addition to PAF's inventory. The ceremony will herald a new era of technological advancement and technical cooperation between Pakistan and China. F-7P is a Chinese-built version of Soviet MIG-21. Its basic capabilities have been enhanced with improved fire control and avionics systems to meet specific PAF sources. F-7P aircraft has been inducted into PAF to augment its fleet of interceptor aircraft against threats of adversaries. The F-7 Rebuild Factory was established in 1972. It rolled out its first F-6 fighter in 1981, while its trainer version FT-6 was rebuilt in 1985. Later on, its capability was enhanced to rebuild FT-5 in 1987 and A-5III in 1988. The factory is now rebuilding all Chinese origin aircraft on PAF's inventory. This is also the first time that the aircraft rebuilding has been taken up in the country. This has not only reduced the burden on economy but also increased the technical maturity of the work force. The F-6 Rebuild Factory, which is also rebuilding the F-7s, has successfully rebuilt more than 294 Chinese origin aircraft of various types for the PAF since its establishment. It also makes some 10,000 aparts of F-6s, FT-6s, FT-5s and A-5IIIs for maintenance of these aircraft. The factory has also produced 500 and 800 line supersonic auxiliary tanks for the F-7s. They are in addition to the 1,140 line auxiliary tanks which the factory has already made for the F- 6s. These tanks are installed externally to increase the endurance and range of the aircraft. The first F-7P was taken up for overhaul by the factory in April, 1993. The basic infrastructure for the overhaul was already available and only a few additions for the overhaul of F-7 have been made. The PAC comprises F-6 Rebuild Factory, Mirage Rebuild Factory, Aircraft Manufacturing Factory and Kamra Avionics and Radar Factory. The Mirage Rebuild Factory is actively engaged in rebuilding the French Mirage aircraft and overhauling Praff & Whitney F-100-200 engines for the F-16s. More than 25 of the ex-Australian Mirages which PAF acquired in what may be called as "the deal of the decade" have also been produced by this factory. The Aircraft Manufacturing Factory is engaged in co-production of Karakoram-8 Aircraft with Chinese collaboration, apart from manufacturing the MFI-17 (Mushshak) aircraft of Swedish origin. Though not too old, the Kamra Avionics and Radar Factory is presently rebuilding ground radars for the PAF.
