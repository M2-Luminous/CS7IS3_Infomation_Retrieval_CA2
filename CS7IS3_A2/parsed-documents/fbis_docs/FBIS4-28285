FBIS4-28285 "dreas111_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-111 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 North Korea South's `Grave Military Provocation' Alleged South's `Grave Military Provocation' Alleged SK0806045294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0447 GMT 8 Jun 94 SK0806045294 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets on June 6 and 7 committed a grave military provocation by illegally introducing recoilless guns and large-calibre machineguns into the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and staging a shooting exercise against the North, military sources said. On the 7th of June, they deployed 90 mm recoilless guns in the DMZ under the nose of Komsa-ri, Chorwon County, and staged an exercise of firing at a post of the North side. Earlier, on the 6th, they brought many armed bandits and large- calibre machineguns to the DMZ off Mt. Wolbi in Kosong County in the eastern sector of the front, Jawon-ri, Phyonggang County in the central sector and Imgang-ri, Jangpung County in the western sector, inciting a war atmosphere. The reckless introduction of heavy weapons and military provocation by the South Korean puppets posed a grave threat to the safety of the Korean People's Army soldiers who were on a routine duty. This is a deliberate and premeditated military provocation designed to push to a higher pitch of strain the situation in the DMZ where Armed Forces of the two sides are in acute confrontation with the Military Demarcation Line in between. The South Korean puppets must look squarely at the developments in the DMZ, stop acting recklessly and pull the illegally introduced armed bandits and all the heavy weapons out of there at once.
