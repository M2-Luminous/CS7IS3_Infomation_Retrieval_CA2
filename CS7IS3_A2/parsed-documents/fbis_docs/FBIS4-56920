This was stated on Monday by Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro upon her return from Costa Rica where she attended President Jose Maria Figueres' inauguration. The five Central American presidents, taking advantage of their presence in San Jose, held a mini-summit in which they also agreed to continue with the integration process. President Chamorro also highlighted the importance of consolidating democracy in our countries and she said that Costa Rica is an example of democracy in the world. To consolidate democracy, President Chamorro stressed, peace and understanding must be achieved by all Nicaraguans. Farmers must be able to plant their crops, she said. Chamorro added that an army and a police force are necessary to protect citizens. When questioned on an ultimatum issued by the U.S. Government to Nicaragua to solve the property problem, President Chamorro said: I do not think it is an ultimatum, rather I believe it is a cutback in aid to all nations so that the U.S. can asses their respective situations. She added that she does not accept pressures from any government, but she acknowledged that the property problem must be resolved. For this, however, cooperation is needed from citizens occupying homes that do not belong to them, she noted.
