Beyond that, science ends and art begins. At this moment intuition and imagination should begin to play a greater role than a knowledge of facts and trends, and the ability to analyze them. This almost axiomatic premise would seem to be more applicable to Russia than anywhere else, because in Russia, everything is moving, collapsing, growing, and serious political scientists are extremely reluctant to make predictions even a month into the future. However, it is in the present that we can predict the policies of Russia relatively far into the future with much greater confidence than has ever been possible in the last several decades. Fifteen or so years ago this would have been impossible because it was obvious that the system was rolling downhill, and things were about to explode. But as for how many explosions there would be, and what would follow them, this was unclear. Three and even two years ago the old system was undergoing decomposition and disintegration, but it was still hanging on, and no one was sure when development would begin. Many things have become clearer this year, 1993. A superimposition of a large number of phenomena and events--dramatic expansion of the property-owning class, of the stratum of people working in the private sector (they now represent over a third of the employed), growth of the "gray," unregulated and unaccountable economy, which was nonetheless feeding millions, and B. Yeltsin's victory in the spring referendum--transformed quantity into quality. There appeared in the politically and economically active and competitive part of the population a certainty, a latent feeling that Russia "will break out," and become a mighty country of prosperous and free people. Russia crossed over the mountains dividing its totalitarian past from a normal future. The descent into the valley of normalcy is perilous. A misstep could still mean disaster. But it's even harder to go back. New elites whose interests are predictable and are already rather clearly discernible began forming quickly. These were the new bourgeoisie, moving from trade, essentially military, to production. These were the directors of state enterprises undergoing privatization, who were becoming capitalists. These were the political elites, coming together with the first two and quickly gaining strength. And finally, these were the military, whose influence was visibly growing in a time of weakness of state power and political instability at the borders. The main vector of the interests of these elites is already clear--moderate state nationalism, economic reintegration of a significant part of the former USSR while avoiding brutal and costly actions of political reintegration, and a desire for cooperation, especially economic, with the outside world. In this case the failed hopes of aid from the West are visibly intensifying neo-isolationist sentiments and self-reliance. A course of rapprochement with Europe, with the West, remains a priority, but internal and external limits imposed upon this rapprochement, as well as the economic ties of regions of southern Russia, Siberia and the Far East are partially reorienting interests in the direction of Asia and the Far East. The need for settling conflicts and preventing their spread is generating a habit of relying on military force--albeit at lower levels. The main interests are now focused on internal survival, on keeping instability at Russia's borders from encroaching. But despite the fact that such a focus makes Russia not even a continental but just a regional power in terms of its present interests, the elite does not perceive Russia to be as such, and it is certain that it will once again become a mighty continental power. At the same time hardly anyone is ready for serious sacrifices in behalf of greatness, and all the more so on behalf of Russia's return to the status of a global superpower, which had been imposed on it by the vagaries of history--the postwar vacuum in Europe, superimposed over possession of nuclear weapons and residual communist messianism. This is the group of interests that will determine Russian policy over the course of the next decade. The country will go through a time of crisis, which will last another year or two. Then stabilization will begin, and then an ascent. After 5-6 years, if political disintegration, which is extremely improbable, or a catastrophic social explosion does not occur, an economic boom will begin in Russia. By 2005 Russia will more likely be a dominant economic center and a leading political force in a fraternity of states consisting of Belarus, Ukraine (or the states that form on its territory if it falls apart as a result of the economic disaster that has begun there), Kazakhstan, and possibly Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzia. The fate of the Transcaucasian countries is unclear. Most likely if they are able to quench the flames of open conflicts in the foreseeable future, they will have extremely close political and economic relations with Russia as well. But this time Russia will be pursuing a relatively equal policy in all directions. However, cultural and spiritual traditions, the ongoing instability in Asia, and mighty, and possibly already unstable China will prod it toward alliances with the West. The strategy of the national security of the newly ascending capitalist Russia of the year 2005 will depend to a certain degree on what happens in the 12 years separating us from that moment. If in this time Russia becomes a part of a military-political association or strategic alliance extending from Vancouver to Tokyo, if it comes closer to Europe politically, if it comes closer to or even enters the European free trade zone forming around the expanding European Community, and if it is able to achieve real membership in the European market, and become an object of massive capital investments, Russia's strategy will be European, oriented on maintaining the status quo of world development. Imperial impulses, unavoidable for such a mighty country that is additionally undergoing an era of early capitalism, will be easily contained by the advantages of membership in a Euro-Atlantic-Pacific strategic association. Moscow will be forced to pursue another strategy, even in terms of Russia's security. But it is becoming a normal country, and it will be forced to pursue a normal policy. And this means that it will strive to change, which is inconsistent with its national interests.
