Following the withdrawal of five comrades, 352 candidates are vying for 81 seats in the National Assembly. The stakes in this legislative election are high. It is to provide our Constitution, which was overwhelmingly approved on 27 September and promulgated on 14 October 1992 by the president of the Republic, with an important organ which is the National Assembly. The presidential group is hoping to get a majority of seats in parliament to consolidate the executive's power base, while the goal of the opposition is to win the legislative elections and therefore be able to choose a prime minister from their ranks. French and Burkinabe civilian and military observers sent throughout the country are seeing to the smooth running of the polls. Hundreds of foreign personalities, who are experienced observers, went to several polling stations in Lome and the provinces to ascertain the regularity of the polls. Security is ensured near the polling stations by members of the Operation Reconciliation-Security 93 Force. Polling stations were closed at 1800 for the cities in the provinces while they were closed at 1900 in Lome, the capital. The Ministry of Territorial Administration and Security announces that polling stations have been closed since 1800 throughout the country. On the whole, the elections took place in calm without any incidents reported. President Eyadema, who insisted on going to Yamoussoukro to participate in the last tribute to Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, could not go to the polling station in Pya, his hometown where he is registered to vote, because of his tight schedule. He therefore voted by proxy in his hometown because the provisions of the electoral code do not allow him to vote in Lome where he is not registered on any voters list.
