FR940428-0-00057 FR940428-0-00022 One commenter considers the lightning protection requirements to be unclear when applied to individual subsystems prior to installation in the airplane, and recommends that the relationship between the airframe manufacturer and the subsystem supplier to clarified. The commenter contends that the proposed rule appears to suggest that all systems that perform critical functions would be required to withstand the full direct strike currents, without taking into account any reduction in these currents due to the shielding provided by the airframe. As discussed in the NPRM, the purpose of the proposed regulation is to require lightning protection for electrical and electronic systems that perform critical and essential functions when installed in an airplane. Protection may be provided by the airplane structure, shielding of the wiring, and enclosures of the individual subsystems. The level of protection needed for subsystems is generally specified by the airframe manufacturer. In the past, when the airframe manufacturer did not specify the level of protection needed, Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) Document DO&hyph;160, Section 22, ``Lightning Induced Transient Susceptibility,'' was used to provide guidance. While Section 22 of DO&hyph;160 is incomplete, it is currently being revised to include the effects of multiple burst and multiple stroke test waveforms so as to be in agreement with FAA Advisory Circular 20&hyph;136, ``Protection of Aircraft Electrical/Electronic Systems Against the Indirect Effects of Lightning,'' dated March 5, 1990, and Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE Committee Report AE4L&hyph;87&hyph;3, Revision B, dated January 1989. Until the DO&hyph;160 revision has been completed, the test and analyses described in the advisory circular should be used to qualify subsystems. The test waveforms presented in Appendix III of the advisory circular represent a severe natural lightning environment, including the multiple stroke and multiple burst criteria, that is external to the airplane and that may be used by certification purposes in accessing the induced effects of lightning. The equipment should be protected to the appropriate test level, as specified in Appendix IV of the advisory circular, for the proposed airplane installations so that the subsystems are able to continue to perform their intended functions after the tests are conducted. Two commenters suggest that the definitions of the terms ``critical'' and ``essential'' functions be removed from the proposed rule and placed in 14 CFR part 1 of the FAR, Definitions and abbreviations. The FAA does not concur with this suggestion. The terms ``critical'' and ``essential,'' as used in the proposed rule, have a unique definition based on §§25.1309 (b)(1) and (b)(2) that may be inappropriate when used in other rules. Commenters have expressed confusion over the use of these terms; therefore, the definitions of ``critical'' and ``essential'' functions have been integrated into the wording of the rule so as not to require separate definitions. One commenter suggests that the words ``contribute to or'' be removed from the definitions for critical and essential functions given in proposed §§25.1315 (c)(1) and (c)(2) because this terminology is undefined and can be subject to broad interpretation. The FAA does not concur. This terminology is consistent with that used in existing regulations and is generally understood by the aviation industry. It is used in this rule to convey that although a failure by itself may not be catastrophic or major, it may be a contributing factor when combinations of failures are considered. For example, a latent or undetected failure could contribute to a hazardous failure condition when combined with one or more specific failures or events. Also, systems that perform only non-essential functions could contribute to a failure condition involving an non-essential or critical function.
