Mikhail Gorbachev, the last president of the Soviet Union, signed a contract to sell Iran three diesel-powered "Kilo" class submarines. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the Russian Government announced that it would honor the contract, and indeed delivered two submarines to Iran. Russian sources yesterday pointed out that the decision to cancel the sale of the third submarine to Iran is justifiable, because it concerns an optional sale agreement, not a pledge to sell, as was the case with the two other submarines. Russia decided early this month to cancel the sale of two nuclear-powered stations to Iran because of the latter's inability to pay their costs, as was reported. Tehran accused Moscow of "submitting to Washington's pressures." The U.S. Administration spoke to more than 20 states, including Russia, in a bid to persuade them not to sell advanced weapons to Iran. While Russia emphasized the decision not to sell the third submarine to Iran, Ukraine tried to win part of the Iranian arms market. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Zlenko said that his government has decided to supply Iran with spare parts for the Soviet-made weapons in the Iranian arsenal. He pointed out that Kiev has rejected the "improper pressure" exercised by Washington and is determined to strengthen its relations with Tehran. Borys Tarasyuk, senior Ukrainian arms exports expert, announced that Iran is not one of the states to which Ukrainian arms exports are banned. He pointed out that only Serbia, Libya, Cuba, North Korea, and South Africa are subject to this ban. Tarasyuk pointed out that Iran is offering Ukraine oil at "very tempting prices" in return for spare parts and military technologies.
