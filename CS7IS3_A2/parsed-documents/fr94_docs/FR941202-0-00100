At the end of the 16-hour test run, check to make sure the inclined liquid level indicators are level; if not, make the necessary adjustments. Record the final inclined liquid level indicators readings and time. 3.6␣Determination of Solvent Vapor/Air Interface Area for Each Sump. Determine the area of the solvent/air interface of the individual sumps. Whenever possible, physically measure these dimensions, rather than using factory specifications. A schematic of the dimensions of a solvent cleaning machine is provided in figure 307&hyph;4. BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSER02DE94.006 BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;C 4. Calculations 4.1␣ Nomenclature. A B = area of boiling sump interface, m2 (ft2). A I = area of immersion sump interface, m2 (ft2). A V = area of solvent/air interface, m2 (ft2). E = emission rate, kg/m2-hr (lb/ft2-hr). K = 100,000 cm . g/m . kg for metric units. = 12 in./ft for English units. L BF = final boiling sump inclined liquid level indicators reading, cm (in.). L Bi = initial boiling sump inclined liquid level indicators reading, cm (in.). L If = final immersion sump inclined liquid level indicators reading, cm (in.). L Ii = initial immersion sump inclined liquid level indicators reading, cm (in.). S B = length of the boiling sump, m (ft). S I = length of the immersion sump, m (ft). S V = length of the solvent vapor/air interface, m (ft). W B = width of the boiling sump, m (ft). W I = width of the immersion sump, m (ft). W V = width of the solvent vapor/air interface, m (ft). r = density of solvent, g/m3 (lb/ft3). u = test time, hr. 4.2␣Area of Sump Interfaces.
