The Peruvian foreign minister stated that Claudett Werleigh, Aristide's minister of foreign affairs and culture, while speaking on Aristide's behalf on 14 June in Washington, asked Peru to withdraw Agustin's recognition. Goldenberg said: "Out of respect for a democratically elected government, which is the only government we recognize in Haiti, we have decided not to recognize Mr. Roland Agustin's ambassadorial status." This decision averted criticism by the opposition against Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori who rejected the idea of military intervention in Haiti or Cuba during the recent Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. The opposition accused Fujimori of defending the Haitian military regime headed by General Raoul Cedras "in view of his authoritarian convictions." Goldenberg added that Fujimori's position, and that of his administration, is based "on the principle of self-determination of countries." Goldenberg said Peru supports a political and peaceful solution to the Haitian issue and supports the measures approved by the OAS and the United Nations. Regarding the criticism surrounding Fujimori's recent trip to Beijing, Goldenberg said Peru believes China has great potential for Peruvian economic and commercial interests. He added that "China is not a political model for Peru." Goldenberg stated: "With all due respect, the Chinese political model is not an example for us because we are in a different situation."
