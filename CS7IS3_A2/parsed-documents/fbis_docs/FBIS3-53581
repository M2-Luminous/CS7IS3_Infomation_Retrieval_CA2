The bureau notes that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin thanks President Clinton for his contribution to the promotion of the peace process. Minister Shulamit Aloni says a summit meeting should be planned soon between the Syrian president and Prime Minister Rabin. Minister Yosi Sarid is encouraged by the results of the meeting in Geneva, and says that Clinton's remarks about al-Asad's willingness to establish normal relations with Israel are very important and commit the Syrian president. Tzomet says that Prime Minister Rabin has scored a failure in the management of the peace process, and has now given President Clinton the power to make decisions. Demonstrations against the Geneva summit have begun in various locations in the north. Residents of kibbutzim in the Bet She'an Valley are holding a demonstration at the 'En Hanaziv junction under the slogan: Clinton and al-Asad Will Not Determine the Future of the Golan. Another demonstration was held at the Tzemah junction, and some 200 people are demonstrating in Qiryat Shemona. Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that the Israel Police have reinforced their deployment in anticipation of the reaction of the inhabitants of the north.
