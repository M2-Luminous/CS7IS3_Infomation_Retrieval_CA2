Admiral Jacques Lanxade, referring to a NATO ultimatum over attacks against UN-designated safe areas, said that if it was violated in any way: "France would recommend strikes." The most serious harassment in the last two days was a direct Bosnian Serb attack on UN tanks in northern Bosnia, UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman commander Eric Chaperon said. He said UN Nordic battalion tanks reinforcing an observation post near the UN-designated safe area of Tuzla responded with 72 tank rounds when attacked by Serbs. Chaperon said the Serbs fired four wire-guided anti-tank missiles which landed close to the tanks, porovoking the tanks to respond with 72 rounds, the most massive UNPROFOR retaliation so far. "The rockets were fired to hit. These are not toys. They did not miss their targets deliberately," he said. No exact figures for Serb casualties in the incident were available, Chaperon said, but added that Serb military commanders had reported a number of dead and injured, as well as damage to equipment. In Sarajevo, "the usual ceasefire violations" had been reported, Chaperon said, indicating these were mostly exchanges of small arms fire. A French Puma helicopter was hit by small arms fire while approaching the airport Saturday. Meanwhile in Vitez, also a UN-designated area in central Bosnia, a rocket-propelled grenade landed 50 metres from the entrance to the base of the British UN batallion Saturday. In Gorazde, small arms fire had continued despite the stand-off with NATO last week, and two Bosnian army mortar shells fell on Serb positions, Chaperon said. Sources in the region have indicated that about 100 armed Serbs were deployed in the region to protect the Serb population on the right bank of the river Drina. "They are Serb militia, not soldiers. We do not have exact figures" for the number involved, Chaperon said. Meanwhile Admiral Lanxade, who arrived here Saturday, stressed that Paris backed strict adherence to the threat of air strikes for violations of the NATO ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs. Talking to journalists at Sarajevo airport, Lanxade stressed that it was "absolutely clear that if the terms of the ultimatum are violated, France would recommend strikes." Informed sources said Lanxade discussed the issue with UNPROFOR commander General Sir Michael Rose when he met him here Sunday morning. A member of Lanxade's staff said the meeting was to "clear up any misunderstandings." He said there was a "need for mutual explanation. "The staff member said Rose's views "should be made more precise," because "he gives the impression of being so against strikes that he is removing their credibility entirely." The French general stressed however that "the UN has not backed off, nor has there been a difference opinion with France... we must negotiate on the ground, and maintain the NATO pressure. Success on the ground depends on the combination of these two actions," he said, stressing that the West did not plan to "strike for striking's sake, but to lead to a resolution" of the conflict. Lanxade later left Sarajevo by helicopter bound for the Croatian port of Split, from where he will return to Paris.
