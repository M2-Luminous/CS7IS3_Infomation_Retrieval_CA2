The meeting was closed to the press but the ITAR-TASS correspondents managed to learn from informed sources that during the meeting the Russian prime minister gave most attention to two problems -- the development of reforms and the prospects for Russian-U.S. business cooperation. Acknowledging that the economic situation in the country remains very complicated, Chernomyrdin at the same time pointed out that some encouraging signs had appeared, which indicated that the situation was improving. He singled out among these the fact that inflation was being brought under control and this makes it possible to really get down to improving the climate for investment and to tackle problems of social protection for the population. Touching on problems of foreign aid for Russia, Chernomyrdin noted that the period when the country needed direct massive support from the United States had passed and what was on the agenda now was the question of how to arrange mutually advantageous cooperation. The demand for foreign investment was vast -- in the order of $15-20 billion per year. In other words, over the next 15 years Russia is in a position to "digest" about $300 billion from abroad, primarily from the United States. However, Moscow is interested in attracting primarily private investors. The Russian prime minister stressed that the increase in foreign investments in the economy depends on two basic factors. First, his government must draw up measures to create the most favorable national regime for foreign businessmen to operate in. Second, U.S. businessmen must display initiative in response to this. Chernomyrdin expressed concern over some obstacles that still exist in the United States and which obstruct the development of bilateral trade. In particular, he cited the fact that Russia had still not been given permanent most favored nation status in trade with the U.S. and he also recalled the anti-dumping restrictions on Russian exports. The head of the Russian Government said that the results of the third session of the "Gore-Chernomyrdin" commission show that the two countries are moving in the right direction and that in line with this movement an increasing role is beginning to be played by bilateral links between private businesses.
