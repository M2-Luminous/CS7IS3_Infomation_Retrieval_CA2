[Text] The new minister of health pledges that she will defend the universality of health care. Ottawa--For Diane Marleau, the new federal minister of health, there can be no discussion of it: Public funds may well become scarce, but the sacred principle of universal health care will not be touched. As long as the Sudbury deputy is at the helm, tickets [portion of the cost of treatment paid by the insured] of whatever nature will be unacceptable at the Ministry of Health. "Whether they be called `ticket orienteur' or `ticket moderateur,' in the final analysis the ticket is a tax on illness, and I want no part of it," she snaps without the slightest hesitation, putting an end to the sentence somewhat abruptly, with a slight smile that seems to say: "Next question?" The next question is the most difficult one, namely, the one that the provincial and federal governments have faced for many years now. It is the question of how to reduce the cost of health care while adhering to the principle of universality. This time, the minister's response is more lengthy, less clear-cut. She begins by responding: "We must set our priorities and do the best we can with the dollars we have." A 50-year-old Franco-Ontarian, she comes to the Ministry with the experience of one who, with a degree in business administration, has raised three children, made a career of municipal politics, headed an accounting office, and managed a restaurant, among other things. Explaining that her strategy will consist first and foremost of rooting out abuses, the minister continues, "We must address the abuses. It is clear that there are abuses. Is charging going to eliminate the abuses? I do not think it will.... If diligent effort is devoted to eliminating abuses, the means of doing so can be found," she says. She speaks of instilling a greater sense of "responsibility," of awareness of the costs of health care, in the users and the operators of the system. Do you really think that approach would suffice, that it would work? "Nothing ventured, nothing gained," replies the minister. Yes, but isn't that likely to be difficult? "It is always difficult, but it is worth the effort.... It is surprising what can be done with a little cooperation." According to the minister, dialogue and an effort to reach agreement are the keys to the solution. In its electoral platform, its famous red book, the Liberal Party acknowledged the gravity of the problem of financing health care and proposed the convoking of a national forum on the issue, to be presided by Prime Minister Jean Chretien himself, to bring all the operators of the system together in an effort to find agreed solutions. Mrs. Marleau says she would like this forum to be held this spring. Freezes? Reductions? For detailed responses on the possibility of a freeze on transfer payments to the provinces, for details on ways of reducing the costs of services without reducing the list of services that are to be provided, for details on the strictness with which Ottawa intends to enforce the health-care law, we shall have to take a rain check. Mrs. Marleau has not even decided yet how she is going to respond to Quebecois Minister Marc-Yvan Cote's proposal to bill patients for certain home care services. She is awaiting a proposal in writing. It may be that the response to these questions will rather come from the minister of finance, who, since the restructuring of the government, is responsible for everything concerning transfer payments to the provinces. Or perhaps it will come from Minister Marcel Masse, who is responsible for federal-provincial relations and who recently stated that spending on health care must be reduced by 20 percent, although he later retracted this statement. In short, Mrs. Marleau will not be the only one to concern herself with this thorny problem of health-care costs, but, as the minister responsible for enforcing the Canadian law on health care, it is nevertheless she who will have to shoulder the task of steering the profound and painful restructurings looming on the horizon. Gaston Levac, general director of Sudbury's Laurentian Hospital, who knew Mrs. Marleau when she was a member of the institution's board of directors, believes she has the "knowledge and the ability" needed to find solutions. "But that alone is not necessarily sufficient. I wonder whether Mrs. Marleau will have the necessary force of character to make the tough decisions that will have to be made and to deal with the opposition that is going to develop. Because the social changes being talked about are going to be very difficult to implement." A Poor Childhood A native of Kirkland Lake, Diane Marleau has spent most of her life in Sudbury, in what is known as northern Ontario but what is really the north of inhabited Ontario. She comes from a single-parent family of three children, her father having deserted the family household when she was very young. Mrs. Marleau does not remember her father. Her mother, who was a schoolteacher, had to work hard and long hours to make ends meet. "I grew up in poverty, considerable poverty. At that time, it was not easy for a woman left alone with three children. They were not paid the same wages as men. It was barely half as much, I believe," says the minister. When asked if it is these difficult experiences that have made her a feminist, Mrs. Marleau bridles. She evidently does not like the term "feminist." "I don't like to be categorized. Actually, I am a very traditional woman. I have been married to the same man for 30 years," she snaps. Her friend and adviser, Vince di Norcia, a professor of philosophy and former Neo-Democrat, however, thinks she is precisely "a true feminist, those women who take their place through action." Diane Marleau was elected for the first time on the federal scene in 1988, but her political career goes back to 1980 when she was elected to Sudbury's municipal council. And her very first experience in politics goes back to the election of Judy Erola--former Liberal minister--in the Nickel Belt county, in that same year. Mrs. Erola had asked Mrs. Marleau's husband, Paul Marleau, an accountant--today, "semi-retired"--to be her official agent. Mr. Marleau replied in the affirmative, adding that, in any case, Diane would be doing the work. Anita Thompson, a former journalist and long-time friend of Mrs. Marleau's family, recounts that Judy Erola lost no time in telling him that, if that was the case, she was quite capable of asking Diane directly to be her official agent. The City Without Debt A few months later, Mrs. Marleau made her own entry into the world of politics, on the municipal scene, after three years spent at home caring for her youngest child, Stephane, who is now 16 and lives in Sudbury with her father. The minister says the idea was suggested to her by the municipal councillor of her district, who had decided to retire. Mrs. Marleau met him in the street and told him that she was not particularly impressed by the names of his would-be successors at the time. "At that point," she recalls, "he said to me: `Then, why don't you run for the job?'" Mrs. Marleau was elected to the municipal council, then appointed to Sudbury's regional council. "I helped her write her first speech to the business community. Since then, she calls me her mentor. It is a very nice compliment," says Mrs. Thompson. "Diane was very tense, very nervous, at the time. But she learned. She is by no means like that today." In 1985, Mrs. Marleau ran for mayor against Peter Wong and lost. This fact is not found in the official biography provided by the party. Nor does she herself care to talk about it. Regarding her years in municipal politics, everyone remembers mainly one thing: Mrs. Marleau was one of the principal advocates of an austere antideficit policy that finally enabled the city to pay off all its debts. "She was truly one of the most committed throughout that debate," recalls Peter Wong, who holds this "hard worker," his one-time rival, in very high esteem. Is Mother Going to Ottawa? After her defeat for mayor, Mrs. Marleau became an administrator at Collins, Barrow-Maheu, Noiseux, a Sudbury accounting office. In 1988, the Liberal Party pressed her to run as a candidate for office in Sudbury County, a county that has always been Liberal, except for a brief period around the end of the 1960's when the Neo-Democrats won a by-election. Mrs. Marleau says laughingly that she was caught at her own game. She had often complained about the fact that the party never gave counties that are sure bets to women. When they offered her the candidacy, they went out of their way to remind her of this. So, she decided to run and won in the autumn of 1988. She does not in the least regret having made that decision, but says that it was very painful to her to have to leave her family behind in Sudbury, especially her "baby." Today, Mrs. Marleau still lives in Sudbury, and she returns every weekend. She spends the rest of the week in Ottawa with her oldest daughter, Brigitte. In the opposition she has played many roles, including that of substitute critic for Mines and for Government Operations. She was also a member, and subsequently vice chairman, of the Standing Committee for Finance, president of the Ontario Caucus, deputy whip, etc. In November, Jean Chretien appointed a loyal deputy, but a member of the party's scratch team, as his administration's minister of health. A woman "who, being in the opposition, has not had occasion to make political enemies," says Mr. Levac, but who now finds herself having to deal with 10 provinces, a universal health-care system that is in deep financial crisis and one of the Liberal Administration's most difficult ministries to pilot.
