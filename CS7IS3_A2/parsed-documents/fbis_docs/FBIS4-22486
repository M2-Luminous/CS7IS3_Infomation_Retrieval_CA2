This was shown by the meeting of representatives of commercial banks, trading companies, and the Central Bank of Russia, held yesterday at the Russian Chamber of Trade and Industry and devoted to discussion of proposed banking legislation. At this meeting the Central Bank came out against the formation of a federal reserve system. It is notable that the representatives of the commercial banks did not insist on any substantial change in banking law either. Yesterday's meeting of representative of state and commercial structures was organized to discuss legislative proposals to amend and supplement the Law "On the Central Bank of the RSFSR (Bank of Russia)" and the Law "On Banks and Banking in the RSFSR," which are planned to be put on the agenda in parliament in the near future. Konstantin Lubenchenko, head of the legal department of the Central Bank, spoke at the meeting. He stated that the proposed bill on the Central Bank is an attempt to increase the degree of the bank's independence of the government, which will make it possible to implement financial and emissions policy more effectively. An innovation in the bill is the point on forming a consulting council at the Central Bank, consisting of representatives of leading banks and banking associations, national economic specialists, specialists from financial bodies, and scholars. In Lubenchenko's opinion, the activities of this council will enable the Central Bank management to reach decisions efficiently on the most important matters touching the interests of all agents of the financial system without exception. In all, Lubenchenko's talk showed that the Central Bank has no interest at all in significant change in the Russian banking system. It is noteworthy that Lubenchenko touched especially on the issue of the prospects of establishing a federal reserve system in Russia on the model of the one that exists in the United States. In the opinion of the Central Bank representative, which from all appearances coincides with the opinion of the bank management, "At the present time there is no need to copy the American plan, nor do conditions for it exist." Furthermore, he said, in the States the Federal Reserve System is in fact being subjected to harsh criticism and is blamed for the collapse of national monetary policy. A similar opinion was expressed on this matter on the same day at a Central Bank briefing (see the article on this same page). It is noteworthy that neither this position nor the proposed bills aroused any particular condemnation from those present. It is true that representatives of the commercial banks stated that it would be wise for the bills to stipulate specifically what constitutes banking activity as compared to other types of entrepreneurial activity. At present, in their opinion, these specifics are not being taken into account, and the authorities have an opportunity to receive unobstructed information which bank clients do not have an interest in divulging. Furthermore, it was suggested that the legal basis of registration be put in more concrete terms and that the sphere of activity of bank associations and councils be defined more specifically. But not one representative of the commercial banks spoke in favor of a fundamental reform of the banking system, for example for conversion of their own bank into a federal reserve bank.
