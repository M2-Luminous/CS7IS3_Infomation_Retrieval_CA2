FR940728-2-00117 FR940728-2-00081 Employment and Training Administration [TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,925] Cooper Industries; Cameron Forged Products Division, a/k/a Wyman-Gordon Forgings Co., Houston, TX; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance In accordance with section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on October 22, 1993, applicable to all workers of the subject firm. The certification notice was published in the Federal Register on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59492). At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. New findings show that on May 26, 1994, Wyman-Gordon Forgings became the successor-in-interest firm to Cooper Industries. The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports. Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to show the correct name of the worker group. The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,925 is hereby issued as follows: ``All workers of the Cameron Forged Products Division of Cooper Industries, Houston, Texas the predecessor-in-interest firm to Wyman-Gordon Forgings, Houston, Texas who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after July 22, 1992 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.'' Signed at Washington, DC, this 20th day of July, 1994. Violet L. Thompson, Deputy Director, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
