The meeting highlighted that Cairo will remain a center, a forum, for all Arab leaders to discuss their issues and coordinate and plan for the region's peoples and their ambitions to solve their problems fairly and honorably. The summit followed a new development in the Arab region due to the latest Hebron massacre and its new threats to the peace process, which was about to make some progress on the road to Arab-Israeli reconciliation. The massacre came to undermine the peace process and had it not been for the self-restraint demonstrated by the Arab region, most notably the PLO, the whole region would have seen a retreat on the course of peace through negotiations. [passage omitted] The summit talks in Cairo showed that Syria is eager for a comprehensive peace in the region based on Security Council resolutions and international legitimacy, which rejects aggression and does not allow the occupation of others' territory by force. In a statement after seeing off Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, President Mubarak said he hoped Syria and Israel would reach an agreement. The statement emphasized the Syrian leadership's earnest desire to end the Arab-Israeli conflict and create stability and peace for the region on fair bases. As President Mubarak explained in his answer to a question from an Israeli correspondent, peace requires sacrifices by both sides, particularly the party that occupies the land. This party has major capabilities that give it the chance to make peace with the other parties and to achieve historic reconciliation that would reflect positively on all the region's peoples. The sides are fed up with conflicts and their dangers for both sides. History proves that things cannot remain as they are and that no one entity can remain stronger than the others forever, whatever his capabilities. President Mubarak's continuing call on the need for the parties to be flexible about peace demonstrates that the Egyptian leadership is eager to maintain the momentum of the peace process and spare the Middle East the scourge of bloody conflicts. No one can deny the threat of these conflicts to all the peoples of the region.
