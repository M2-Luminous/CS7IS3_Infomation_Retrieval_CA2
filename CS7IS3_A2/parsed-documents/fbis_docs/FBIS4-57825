We get the details from (Via Gallaway): [Begin recording] [(Gallaway)] The prime minister, the right Honorable Dr. Kennedy Simmonds, while delivering an address of the opening of the new branch of the Royal Bank of Canada said that the commerical banks in St. Kitts and Nevis play an important role in the overall developmental thrust through the wide array of banking and financial services they provide. He commended the Royal Bank of Canada for the confidence it has placed in the continued growth of the economy, adding that it has helped to provide a variety of modern conveniences. He also attributed to the solid performance of the economy over the past decade and our strong infrastructure base on the policies of his government. [Simmonds] All of these entities have been effected from the very liberal [word indistinct] regime and the [words indistinct] investment climate that my government has created through variety of creative fiscal and economic policies. In fact, my government is now providing new incentives for companies to undertake developments of this nature. Hence, the 1994 budget provides that companies may now enjoy capital allowances in respect of new commercial buildings, the construction of which commence on or after matched across 1994. Hence, as I said [words indistinct] company limited and other companies continue to invest and expand, we will enjoy additional tax relief. [(Gallaway)] Meantime, the vice president for the Barbados and Eastern Caribbean area, Mr. Douglas Maloney, said that the reason for the establishment of the bank was trade. The Royal Bank of Canada had begun life as the Merchants Bank of Halifax. At the turn of the century, the merchants found many opportunities in a [word indistinct] trade financing between Canada's maritime provinces and the Caribbean. He said at the time, sugar, cotton, and spices were being traded and the Royal Bank was kept busy providing banking services to importers and exporters on all of the islands. Governor of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, Mr. (Dwight Brenner), said a great deal of concern is being expressed about impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, on our economies. He disclosed that in the OECS [Organization of Eastern Caribbean States], you have to be very careful to continue to maintain a rational approach in matters of this kind and not succumb to the [word indistinct] "Join at all Costs" imperative, which Mr. Brenner noted seems to be the case elsewhere in the region. [(Brenner)] In a situation where some countries are claiming to be NAFTA eligible, we in the OECS have to remember two things: firstly, that in the new atmosphere of trade and financial liberalization, [words indistinct] national economy, countries must prepare themselves to be internationally competitive, whether there is a NAFTA or there is not. Secondly, a competitive environment is based on getting the economic fundamentals right. And in this area, the OECS countries have done remarkably well for countries of their size. [(Gallaway)] The new branch of the Royal Bank of Canada is located at the [word indistinct] Complex on Wellington Road. I am (Via Gallaway) reporting for the Caribbean Evening News.
