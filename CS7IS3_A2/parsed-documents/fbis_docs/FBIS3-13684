In a statement it issued today, the Arab League Secretariat affirmed its stance rejecting these statements because they contradict international resolutions, primarily Security Council Resolution 252 issued in 1968, which asserts the legal status of Jerusalem and stresses that any measures aimed at changing Jerusalem's status are void. It pointed out that this resolution calls on Israel to immediately stop any acts that lead to changing the status of Jerusalem. The Arab League Secretariat statement clarified that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles stipulated that Jerusalem is one of the issues that will be discussed during the coming stage of the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations. The statement affirmed the Arab League's concern about the peace process and its support for all the international and regional efforts aimed at establishing a just and permanent peace in the Middle East. The statement noted the U.S. President and Administration's concern over the need to make 1994 a year of peace in the Middle East. The statement recalled the stances of successive U.S. Administrations affirming the special status of Jerusalem by considering it occupied territory the fate of which no single party has the right to decide unilaterally. They also affirmed the need to respect its religious and legal status as the cradle of "all divine religions."
