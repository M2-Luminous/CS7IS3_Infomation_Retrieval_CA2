Antonio Martino, Forza Italia's economic expert, smiles and speaks with a voice strained from too many debates: "Yes, the premises which [Communist Renewal leader] Bertinotti starts out from are sacrosanct: The present system, the taxation of public debt securities, is unjust. But the paths separate here, and I draw totally different conclusions." Professor Martino does not think of making people pay interest on treasury bills, nor does he espouse the measure of registering securities, which would be "dangerous." "At least for the time being," he states, until such time that the virtuous mechanism bearing Berlusconi's name comes into motion, which should restore the state's finances. "Reasons of political opportunity" suggest that it is better to make do with this situation, which we have not created, but which has come about over many years, until such time as the restoration of the public finances allows us to take provisions in the direction indicated also by [economist] Mario Monti. Hence, according to what the quoted economist is suggesting, the future according to Martino for treasury bills is the "bringing in line of their tax treatment with that of other investments." And yet, Bertinotti's idea has raised ferocious opposition in the "pole of freedoms," a war on the communists who wish to annihilate government securities. "No, not from me. And then, if one looks behind all the various positions, the absurd fact is this: In Italy, two citizens enjoying the same income are treated in two totally different ways. The person earning it from working is punished with a confiscatory tax system. The other, whose income comes from interest on public debt securities, pays not one lira of tax." The war cry, which fires off applause from the elegant audience and the rostrum (all the Rome candidates: Fabrizio del Noce, Gustavo Selva, Publio Fiori, etc.), is the war on taxes: The raising of deductions and the single personal income tax rate of 30 percent are the "two pillars" of the program, which have unbridled the "most uncivilized, heedless, disorderly reaction by the left, evidently short of arguments, against us." One reason more not to abandon the confrontation. By the way, Professor Martino, is it true that you refused a face to face interview with Budget Minister Spaventa in front of the "Milan, Italia" TV cameras? "No. First of all, they told me that yesterday evening there would be Spaventa, then Visco [in charge of Democratic Party of the Left tax policy]. But I do not suit them and the job went to someone else." Is this not a wish to escape confrontation, following Berlusconi's line? "Nothing of the kind. We have been confronting Spaventa for a very long time. Maybe, if he did not insult me, it would be more pleasant." Forza Italia's economist confesses having been tempted to impose a blackout on those newspapers which ill-treated him worst. ("One cannot run the headline `Come Forward Martino,' that is the limit...") but he quickly changed his mind. Is he offended if one talks of a magic wand for those million jobs which are promised? He replies with the numbers: "If we manage to obtain the detaxation of fiscal burdens, the three-year extension for the net creation of new jobs -- and not the entrepreneur who dismisses and then rehires, this is fraud -- I believe that this would represent an enormous stimulus for employment." In just two years, as Berlusconi guarantees, a million new people brought into the workforce? "Well, perhaps this was an objective thrown out..."
