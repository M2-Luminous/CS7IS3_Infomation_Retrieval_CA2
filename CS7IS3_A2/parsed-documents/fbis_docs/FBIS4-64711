The affair of the motion approved by the Strasbourg parliament, which has unleashed bitter argument in Italy, is shrouded in mystery. The National Alliance alleges that the Italian translation of the motion has inserted the additional sentence -- following the horrors of Fascism and Nazism. This phrase does not appear in the French language version of the motion that was approved by the European Parliament, nor does it appear in the motion translated into the other official parliamentary languages. The incriminating passage completes the appeal to the Italian Government to respect the values of the European Community. According to National Alliance spokesman Francesco Storacce, the insertion of the sentence is not a technical oversight, but a miserable propaganda exercise. European Parliament President Egon Klepsch intends to set up an inquiry. We are awaiting further developments.
