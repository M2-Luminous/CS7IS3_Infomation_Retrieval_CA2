FBIS4-57542 "drlat098_n_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-098 Daily Report 18 May 1994 Chile Lawyer Fears U.S. `Kidnapping' of Arms Manufacturer Lawyer Fears U.S. `Kidnapping' of Arms Manufacturer PY1905125294 Madrid EFE in Spanish 2349 GMT 18 May 94 PY1905125294 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Excerpt] Santiago, 18 May (EFE) -- Today, lawyer Juan Pablo Hermosilla, who is defending Chilean businessman Carlos Cardoen, told EFE that there is a risk the United States may order the kidnapping of his client to take him to Miami to try him on charges of illegal exportation of a mineral used in Air Force cluster bombs. The lawyer said that "we discussed the subject during our conversation with U.S. prosecutors, but apparently they will try to obtain Cardoen's extradition." Hermosilla said, however, that the risk of kidnapping exists, as when the United States ordered the kidnapping of a Mexican medical doctor accused of drug trafficking. He added: "It is a risk, so we will therefore adopt legal measures, as that is illegal in Chile." The lawyer mentioned the subject when EFE consulted him about the trial that began today against the Teledyne company, which is accused of having sold to the Cardoen company 100 tons of zircon used to manufacture cluster bombs for the Iraqi Army, a fact that was omitted when the export permit was requested. Juan Pablo Hermosilla said "it was well known that the Cardoen company used zircon to manufacture cluster bombs, something that was even described in the company's advertising leaflets at the time, and was known by all U.S. diplomats accredited in Chile." The lawyer said that the article published yesterday in THE NEW YORK TIMES is mistaken in describing zircon as an explosive material. "That is not so. It is as if I were to say that the steel used in the bolts holding the cluster bomb shell together is an explosive material." Hermosilla said that the purchase of zircon from Teledyne was made directly by the Cardoen company, and not by a subsidiary. [passage omitted]
