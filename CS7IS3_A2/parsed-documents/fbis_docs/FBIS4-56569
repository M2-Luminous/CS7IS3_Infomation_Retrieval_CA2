I also believe that we have to be fully convinced that the only way out of the special period is the revolutionary, socialist, steadfast path we are undertaking. This way out, of course, demands effort, work, and sacrifice. However, that effort, work, and sacrifice are worthy. Comrade Estruch [Deputy Luis Estruch Lacano] pointed out several important things which serve to compare Cuba's situation at the time of the triumph of the Revolution with the immense transformation that has taken place, particularly, in comparison with the reality of today's difficult moment. I believe that our people have confirmed their commitment to the ideals of socialism and their rejection of certain dogmatic ideas being forced upon today's world, and in Cuba's case, from abroad. Capitalism will not be Cuba's future because capitalism was its painful and sad past. Our people will never return to the past. Listening to Estruch, I remembered certain elements which I believe our people remember and understand. Our people are a cultured, intelligent people, a well-educated people as result of all that effort alluded to by Estruch and other comrades. Since I agree with Estruch that part of this great battle for the national economy -- to correct our finances and stimulate the economy -- is also a political battle, it seems right to refresh our memory with some information which clearly illustrates the reality of that capitalist past, and also illustrates -- and we can not forget this because the special period irritates us, pains us, and causes daily difficulties for everyone -- that a special period, a difficult and anguished living, a true hell, was the life the immense majority of our men and women knew for most of Cuba's history until 1959. I have here certain points of reference, not produced by us, by the revolutionary movement, but by unsuspected sources. This document, this book, was not published by the Revolution but by the Batista regime. It is the Population, Housing, and Electoral Census of the Republic of Cuba of January 1953. This other book was not published by Cuban revolutionaries either. It is an official document of the U.S. Government from that period aimed at U.S. investors and includes a study of the Cuban economy conducted three years after the Batista census, and has among other things certain criticisms of results of the census. In the study conducted by Batista's authorities, we see certain data which portray Cuba, as a country difficult to imagine for today's Cubans. The census partially covered the issue of housing. There were, nationwide, 1,250,594 houses ranging from the most luxurious mansions to the most modest shacks of the most humble of our peasants. I will give some of the data included in this report. Regarding construction, the authorities classified it in a list beginning with masonry, cement slab roof, and floors of a higher quality than plain cement construction. The list continued down to a humble thatch hut or something similar and earth floors. In the Republic of Cuba, according to the 1953 census, 27.8 percent of the houses were masonry and cement construction and 32.2 percent were thatch and earth floors. Of course, in rural areas, there were more than double the amount in this lower category. However, in the urban areas, in our large cities, 10.2 percent of the houses, according to the 1953 census, had earth floors and had no other material for roofs and walls than thatch. The aqueduct reached only 35.2 percent of the houses and a little more than half the urban houses. Sanitary service was available to only 28 percent of the houses, including 32.8 percent of urban houses. The same happens here. They do a classification ranging from houses with indoor sanitary service to private latrines, and communal latrines, and ending with the no sanitary service category. Some 23.2 percent of the homes fell in this category. Some 45.6 percent of all the homes in Cuba lacked baths or shower facilities. Barely 48 percent of the homes had electricity. However, 75.2 percent of the homes nationwide lacked refrigerators, iceboxes, or any equipment to conserve food, including 62.5 percent of the urban homes. The U.S. Commerce Department study confirms that the situation remained unchanged three years later. This is regarding housing. Regarding education, the 1953 census reveals that 23.6 percent of the population was illiterate. With good reason, the U.S. Commerce Department study criticizes the accuracy of the Batista census regarding this aspect. First of all, it points out that the people who did the census simply asked the people if they knew how to read and write. Some 23.6 percent responded no. However, the American researchers pointed out that more revealing data is found in the census. Such as that illiteracy was much higher among 10- to 14-year-olds, which was 31.8 percent; that 31 percent of the entire Cuban population had not had any formal education; and that only 11 percent had gone beyond primary school education. The Americans' conclusion was that true illiteracy was much higher than that reflected in the official Cuban census and that the republic was regressing given the extremely low school attendance level. For example, of 2,459,730 youths, individuals between 5 and 24 years of age, 1,619,535 -- about half -- did not receive any type of education in Cuba in 1953. From this we have to deduce that in any event, illiteracy would continue to increase if we interpret correctly the information provided by the Batista government. In 1956, the Americans pointed out other important characteristics, we can even call them manipulations, of the 1953 census. First of all, it was conducted in the month of January, in the midst of the sugarcane harvest, at the moment of the highest economic activity and thus the information on the workers, the poor would be higher than at any other time of the year. In addition, in the U.S. study -- Investment in Cuba, Basic Information for U.S. Businessmen, Commerce Department, Washington, 1956 -- the Americans point out that in that period, the first half of the decade of the 1950's, certain Cuban economic indicators had had their best performance in comparison with the republican period preceding it, and that the year with the highest per capita income, at the time, was 1952 -- the year before the census. Those who extol the advantages of capitalism, and try to portray that system as every man's alternative, better not harbor any dreams because this American document explains that in 1952 Cuba attained a third of the per capita income of the states in the southeastern United States. There is something even more revealing, Cuba's best year in terms of per capita income, the apex of our capitalist development according to them, was equivalent to half the per capita income of Mississippi in its worst year. In other words, according to them, when Cuba attained its highest point, it had reached half the level of the worst year of the poorest and most backward state in the United States, Mississippi. What does this top year of capitalism reveal to us? Batista's census did not concern itself much -- and this was also pointed out by the Commerce Department study -- with unemployment and workers conditions. However, they missed certain indicators. They, for example, found out the number of weeks worked by the people covered by the census in 1952 -- the famous apex year of capitalist development according to the Yankees. Some 36.8 percent of the Cuban labor force had worked every week in 1952, and the great majority of those who had worked or looked for jobs in that year of capitalist glory, 48.7 percent of the workers, had not worked even 10 weeks. We would have to ask if it was a pure coincidence of history that at the time when the reality of our country was described in this manner -- poverty-stricken, lugubrious, painful -- by the Batista era census, Fidel Castro and a group of youths were preparing to assault the Moncada Barracks and rekindle the revolutionary movement of our people. Was it possible to continue in that lamentable, painful state of the better period, of the top development of capitalism in Cuba, when that was the best it did for our people? Could anyone be surprised if in 1956, when the Commerce Department issued this study, Fidel Castro and his comrades were preparing to land in our fatherland and restart the postponed but never interrupted war of our people to put an end to that hell capitalism brought for the majority of our people? Can anyone think that this people could prefer that type of society which reserved for the majority ignorance, lack of education, poverty, and misery? The 1956 study also covers other aspects of the economy which the Batista census had overlooked. In its analysis of our countryside, it reveals that less than eight percent of the farms occupied three fourths of the arable land in Cuba, and that less than half of one percent of those farms controlled a third of the arable lands. That is the phenomena of the latifundia. This explains other data, other realities, which other entirely reliable reports also revealed at that time. I refer to a third document. This study by the Catholic University Association of Havana, which was not in any way a radical group, was conducted in 1957, a year after the U.S. Commerce Department study. They discovered, regarding the farmers' nutrition, that the percentage that eat meat was four percent; fish, less than one percent; eggs, 2.12 percent; milk, 11.22 percent; bread, 3.36 percent; cornmeal, 7 percent; vegetables, zero percent. The Catholic group also researched the health conditions of our farmers and found higher percentages than those I just mentioned regarding food. Tuberculosis, 14 percent; typhus, 13 percent; intestinal parasitism, 36 percent; and malaria, 31 percent, among the people polled. The highest percentage included in this document results from asking the peasants what they desire the most, what is most important for them, what they need the most. Some 73.46 percent responded with one word: Work. Can anyone be surprised that our people were at this time, as the Catholic researchers were conducting this study, persevering in the struggle in the mountains and savannas to jostle free from that regime. Is that society really an alternative for anyone? Was it or was it not a special period without escape, hope, justice, or equality endured by those peasants demanding work, peasants pained by tuberculosis or malnutrition. Was this not a true hell into which the immense majority of our population was born, lived, and endured until death? Our people not only remember but also, because they are a knowledgeable, informed people, they know that millions upon millions of people in this world also endure special periods without equality, justice, escape, or hope. True hells are being experienced by the peoples in many parts of the world. This U.S. magazine published by THE MIAMI HERALD features on the front page an issue of growing concern in the United States: what they call the homeless. People who as a result of capitalist measures have found it impossible to continue paying rent and have ended up on the streets, the only place available. This young woman on the front page with her two small daughters is not worried about her salary, taxes, or even the cost of food or salaries. The sign states that she will work for food. She offers her labor for food for herself and her two daughters. Poor woman, she is not thinking about how to pay for school uniforms for her daughters or their school breakfast or lunch. There is no school for those girls, nor is there a job for this woman. She is simply bartering her labor for food -- that is on the front page. The inside, features a man whose sign reads: I am 74 years old and destitute. I am a homeless person but not a bum. I have worked since I was 14 years old. This is typical in capitalism where a man, after working for 63 years, has no other alternative but to stand on a city corner and beg. There is something else that is very interesting. The text explains that in 1990, according to the U.S. Census Office, there where 228,621 homeless people. Certain liberal U.S. organizations, of course, say that this figure does not reflect the reality and that there were many more. However, I prefer to focus on another aspect of this issue. There were over 228,000 homeless in 1990. In 1993, the same source, the U.S. Census Office, estimates there were 2 million homeless. In other words, between 1990 and 1993, according to their official data, the number of homeless -- people such as this old man, this young woman, these girls -- has increased tenfold. This coincides with these difficult years we Cubans call the special period. I ask myself: Is there a special period in the United States? Is anyone imposing a financial, economic, and commercial blockade on that country? Have the U.S. main trading partners disappeared? Have their markets collapsed? Has any madman, any Torricelli in this world, come up with a law to prohibit and obstruct trade with the United States? What explains that instead of improving, there has been a tenfold increase in those people experiencing the living conditions of a special period in the United States? I also have here THE MIAMI HERALD edition of 20 March, right at the time we were in the workers assemblies discussing, analyzing collectively, and seeking means and ways to confront our difficulties. I want to give you the example of financial measures implemented capitalist style. One day, a real estate company or some landlord of an apartment building in the United States decided there had to be a rent increase to improve the margin of profit and make the corporation more efficient. Was a workers assembly summoned? Were the tenants asked how much they ought to or could afford to pay? This article describes how the measure was taken. It was simply this. [Knocks three times on the table] One night -- states one of the two boys interviewed -- there was a knock on the door and someone told mom that the apartment rent was -- it most be an extremely modest place because it has been a long time since you could find anything but a small room for this amount I am going to say -- $295 a month. This was the rent this humble working woman was paying. Someone implemented that measure [three knocks] and told her: From now on the rent is $325 and that is that. She had no other choice, stated her son: Mom sat both of us down and told us that we were going to sleep on the streets because the rent had gone up. Measures such as this one, by the thousands, are adopted by capitalism everyday, and these are the consequences, this picture. The boys showed the reporter their home. As you can see it is the underside of a bridge in Miami where they spent last winter. The text of the article cites another interesting fact. Not about the homeless in general, but about homeless children in Florida in particular. The number of homeless children in the state, according to a study by a Florida university, was 50,000 in 1993. This is three times the number of children in Florida living on the streets. [as heard] Are these children or are they not living in a totally unfair special period because it is not the result of any external factor upon that society but the intrinsic characteristics of that society which result in some living in opulence and dissipation while many others are denied the most essential rights. Comrades, we face the challenge of being able to continue to resist, struggle, and make whatever sacrifices necessary to preserve a society incomparably superior to the one being forced upon us by those trying to turn into a universally mandatory dogma that truly abominable life style and forms of human interaction that ought to have been abandoned in prehistory. We have no other alternative but to save this revolution, this socialist endeavor, to overcome the current difficult period with a revolutionary spirit, the socialist way because the alternative is that past reflected by the Batista era census, or the Yankee study, or the Catholic University Association. That past is the present of hundreds of millions of people in this world, such as these Americans I have referred to. Finally, I have another publication from Florida. There is great interest abroad regarding what happens in Cuba, regarding the result of our efforts, our struggle to overcome the special period. There are people, those who benefited from the misery and poverty of the majority of Cubans, those who never underwent any special period yet imposed it on the majority of the people in the past, who harbor dreams and believe the time will come again when they can return, regain their privileges, and once more impose on the majority of the people that past which shall never return. I have here a copy of the SOUTH FLORIDA magazine which contains several articles in this regard. The man on the left is a former landowner. In the article he describes his mansion, of course, it had sanitary hook-ups, showers, electricity, and everything else. The mansion was so luxurious that he now complains that his backyard is no longer private [word play on a nursery rhyme]. It is filled with children playing, playing sports because his large mansion is today a large school. On top of this, he complains that there are even black and mulatto children among them, colored people that were not even allowed on the streets of his neighborhoods during the era of the Batista census. He explains their plans so that upon their return, once the revolution is defeated according to their dreams, that school will be turned into a private mansion once again. The name of the article is: This land is my land. The article on the left [as heard] -- those with a good memory perhaps remember the Cuban Landowners Association which grouped the owners of the sugar mills. They have a group named the Cuban Landowners Association in Exile. In the article they explain their plan. They plan to retake their mills, to return the lands to the landowners, to once again place our peasants in the conditions which the Catholic Association mentioned, to make over 65 percent of the population hope for jobs. We have to defend this project under the particularly difficult conditions this country faces because, without a shadow of a doubt, capitalism would mean a return to that past we knew. However, it would be amplified by the hate, ire, and fury which that minority would try to impose on our people, that minority which today dreams of returning and was responsible for making life for the majority of us nothing but a perpetual special period without hope or end. Of course, in the workers assemblies, in every meeting held, and in this ANPP session the Cuban people are telling those people: You shall not pass. [applause] Recently, our people commemorated the 125th anniversary of the Guaimaro Assembly, six months after the beginning of our first war of independence, six months after the beginning of the only Cuban revolution, the one begun by Cespedes and fulfilled by Fidel Castro, the patriots, the revolutionaries meet in that tiny town in Camaguey to find the indispensable patriotic consensus, to unite ideas and wills, to organize the struggle under the terrible and difficult circumstance faced by our people from the beginning. The Cuban patriots and revolutionaries met without relinquishing the machete, without relinquishing the struggle against Spanish colonialism, and as our people were also confronting -- as foretold by Cespedes -- the threat of the U.S. policy seeking to take Cuba over. Cespedes said that was the hidden agenda of their policy. The Cuban people were capable of overcoming differences and putting, above all, the ideal of an independent and just fatherland, a fatherland rooted in human solidarity and equality. Today, 125 years later, the Cuban people have recreated Guaimaro everywhere, have revived the spirit of our forefathers, and have been able to reason, discuss, and examine frankly our points of view to unite ideas and wills. We have not held academic debates, but fraternal discussions, and collective analysis in the midst of the struggle and on behalf of the struggle. May Guaimaro's spirit live eternally among us. May we be capable of continuing, like Cespedes, Agramonte, and all the men of that generation, who sacrificed everything, that ideal of independence and justice. May we continue to develop our collective wisdom with the combat spirit of the men of Guaimaro, in the struggle and for the struggle. I believe and am convinced that this is the required route for every patriot, and the route we will follow, and through it we will attain victory, despite everything, despite all the difficulties and sacrifices we might have to endure. Thank You very much. [applause]
