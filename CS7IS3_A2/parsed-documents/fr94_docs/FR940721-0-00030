FR940721-0-00030 FR940721-0-00010 The study also showed that the chest clip acceleration increased for the 3-year-old dummy tested in two shield booster seats, from 31G to 44G and from 38G to 45G, respectively. The chest acceleration increases for these seats were from about 36G to 52G and 28G to 44G respectively. In short, NHTSA does not know of any shield-type booster seat that performs well when the booster seat is used with a lap/shoulder belt system and the shoulder portion of the belt system is left in front of the child. 3. Aircraft Use This rule requires that belt-positioning seats be labeled with a statement that they are not certified for use on aircraft. The Air Transport Association and UM&hyph;CPP supported the proposed requirement but also suggested requiring all boosters to be so labeled. That suggestion is outside of the scope of the NPRM and has not been adopted. However, NHTSA and the Federal Aviation Administration are jointly examining this issue and may initiate a separate rulemaking, if warranted. ATA was concerned that both the statement against aircraft use and the statement certifying to aircraft use are required to be in red. ATA suggested that the former statement be in a color other than red, to distinguish it from the latter. The commenter believed an other-than-red contrasting color will help airline personnel better identify which child seats are suitable for aircraft. NHTSA does not agree with the suggestion that there is a need to require the use of an other-than-red contrasting highlight color to distinguish the warning against aircraft use from the certification to aircraft use. The red color is sufficient to draw the attention of airline personnel to a warning. NHTSA believes using a color other than red would not necessarily increase the level of awareness of the message contained in the warning. Rather, a message highlighted in red would catch the eye of the reader (in this case, airline personnel), who would then read the message. Further, because belt-positioning boosters lack any component in front of the child, they are readily distinguishable from other types of child restraints (i.e., child restraints suitable for aircraft). The unique appearance of belt-positioning seats should facilitate their identification by airline personnel. III. Labeling Boosters for Children Weighing Not Less Than 30 Pounds This rule adopts a labeling requirement to address the problem of booster seats being used for children too small for the restraints. This rule requires that, in labeling booster seats with their recommendations for the maximum and minimum weight and height of children who can safely occupy the seats (S5.5.2(f) and S5.5.5(f)), manufacturers must not recommend the seat for use by a child whose mass is less than 13.6 kilograms (30 pounds). No specific comments were received on the feasibility of developing a booster seat that would safely restrain children weighing less than 30 pounds. Comments on the proposal were divided. Supporting the proposal were Volvo, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, UM&hyph;CPP, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Advocates believed that if booster seats are permitted to cover a wide range of body weight and size, they become less appropriate at either end of the weight spectrum of recommended use. Further, Advocates said ``merely stating a minimum figure of 30 pounds in the manufacturers' recommendations for the weight and height range of the restraint is not sufficient.'' It said the booster seats should also have a separate affirmative warning statement that the booster seat is not recommended for children who weigh less than 30 pounds. AAP stated: While the Academy encourages NHTSA to be responsive and supportive of innovations in restraint technology, development of new products should be guided by a recognition of a child's requirements for protection at different stages of growth. What would be the low-weight end for such a product? We doubt that it is appropriate to approve a booster seat for children weighing less than 30 pounds, when these children can be more safely transported in standard car safety seats. Ten years ago, it was not uncommon for boosters seats to be available for children who weighed 20 pounds. Gradually, the industry shifted because of concern for protection of the younger children to where the low-weight end for boosters became 30 pounds. To drop below 30 pounds as the minimum weight for boosters, again, means to consider designs that provide for upper-trunk support, designs like the early Strolee booster seat that included a five-point harness and tether. Since it is unlikely that this design would find popular acceptance and use, a more reasonable course might be to explore the potential of integrated booster seats in motor vehicles for children weighing less than 30 pounds. To do this, however, requires attention to developing a lap/shoulder belt that can adjust to varying heights so that the fit is across the child's chest, not the child's face or neck. Ford and Cosco opposed the proposal. Ford said that the vehicle manufacturer should have the flexibility to recommend use of a belt-positioning (booster) seat, ``even for some children under 30 pounds.'' Ford said, ``A very thin child weighing less than 30 pounds may be too tall for a convertible child restraint, but an ideal candidate for a belt-positioning booster.'' Ford suggested that rather than base the prohibition on weight (30 pounds), NHTSA base it on height or age. Thus, Ford suggested that Standard 213 specify that no booster can be recommended for children of standing heights less than 900 mm (36 inches) or less than two years of age. Cosco believed that the prohibition against recommending a booster for children less than 13.6 kilograms (kg) is design restrictive: Surely it is possible that a booster seat meeting all requirements *␣*␣* could be developed either for children under 30 pounds or over 60 pounds in the future. Requiring a product to meet all the dynamic test requirements regardless of what weight is recommended should be sufficient.
