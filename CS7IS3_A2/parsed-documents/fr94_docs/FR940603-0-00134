FR940603-0-00134 FR940603-0-00029 CHAPTER 1_FEDERAL CREDIT UNION CHARTERING I_Goals of NCUA Chartering Policy NCUA's chartering policies are directed toward achieving three goals: •to uphold the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act concerning granting federal charters •to promote credit union safety and soundness •to make quality credit union service available to all eligible groups who wish to have it. NCUA may grant a charter to any group or combination of groups desiring credit union service where it finds: •the group or groups possess an appropriate common bond; •the subscribers are of good character and are fit to represent the group; and •establishment of the credit union is economically advisable_i.e., it will be a viable institution and its chartering will not materially affect the interests of other credit unions or the credit union system. Generally, these are the only criteria NCUA will look to. In unusual circumstances, however, NCUA may consider other factors, such as other federal law or public policy, in deciding if a charter should be approved. II_Common Bond Congress, in the Federal Credit Union Act, has recognized three types of federal credit union common bonds_occupational, associational, and community. A federal credit union may also consist of a combination of occupational, associational, and, in certain limited circumstances, community groups. For example, NCUA may charter a federal credit union consisting of employees of a local school district and members of a church group. The Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA recognize that individual groups have their own common bond. All of the groups belonging to one particular credit union included in Section 5 of the credit union's charter make up the credit union's field of membership. If the charter is granted, the federal credit union will only be able to grant loans and provide services to persons within the groups defined in the field of membership. If a federal credit union later wishes to add persons to its field of membership, it must comply with the procedures set forth in Chapter 2. II.A_Occupational Common Bonds II.A.1_General A federal credit union may include in a single occupational common bond, regardless of location, any and all persons who share that common bond. NCUA permits a person's membership in an occupational common bond to be established in a number of ways: •Employment (or a long-term contractual relationship equivalent to employment) in a single corporation or other legal entity makes that person part of an occupational common bond of employees of the entity. •Employment in a corporation or other legal entity with an ownership interest in or by another legal entity makes that person part of an occupational common bond of employees of the two entities. •Employment in a corporation or other legal entity which is related to another legal entity (such as a company under contract and possessing a strong dependency relationship with another company) makes that person part of an occupational common bond of employees of the two entities. A proposed federal credit union must supply documentation from as many authorized representatives as are needed to establish that all persons to be included in a single occupational common bond are in fact linked in one of the ways described above. An occupational common bond must include a geographic definitions, e.g., ``employees, officials, and persons who work regularly under contract in Miami, Florida for ABC Corporation or any of these majority-owned subsidiaries. *␣*␣*'' Other acceptable geographic definitions are: ``employees of *␣*␣* who are paid from *␣*␣*'' or ``employees of *␣*␣* who are supervised from *␣*␣*'' To the maximum extent possible, setting geographic definitions by changeable corporate or division boundary_e.g., ``employees of Federal Reserve District 6''_is to be avoided. So that NCUA may monitor any potential field of membership overlaps, each group to be served (e.g., employees of subsidiaries, franchisees, and contractors) may be separately listed. The employer may also be included in this common bond_e.g., ``ABC Corporation and its subsidiaries.'' The employer group will be defined in the last clause describing the field of membership. II.A.2_Sample Occupational Fields of Membership Some examples of occupational group definitions are: •``Employees of the Scott Manufacturing Company who work in Chester, Pennsylvania. *␣*␣*'' (common bond_same employer) •``Employees and elected and appointed officials of municipal government in Parma, Ohio. *␣*␣*'' (common bond_same employer) •``Employees of Johnson Soap Company and its majority-owned subsidiary, Johnson Toothpaste Company, who work in Augusta and Portland, Maine. *␣*␣*'' (common bond_parent and majority-owned subsidiary company) •``Personnel of fleet units of the U.S. Navy home ported at Mayport, Florida. *␣*␣*'' (common bond_same employer) •``Department of Defense civilian and U.S. Army personnel who work or are stationed at, or are attached or assigned to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, or those who are retired from, or their dependents or dependent survivors who are eligible by law or regulation to receive and are receiving benefits or services from, that military installation. *␣*␣*'' (common bond_same employer) •``Employees of those contractors who work regularly at U.S. Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. *␣*␣*'' (common bond_employees of contractors) •``Employees, doctors, medical staff, technicians, medical and nursing students who work at Boston Medical Center at the locations stated: *␣*␣*'' (common bond_same employer)
