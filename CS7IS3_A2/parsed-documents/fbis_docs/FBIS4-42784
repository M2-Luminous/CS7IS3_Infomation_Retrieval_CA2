The waltz will probably be the most striking in the domain of quiet diplomacy in the next few days. The developments that are expected to take place will be important enough to have a bearing on Turkey's relations with Russia and the United States. The first is the implementation of Turkey's new rules on the [Dardenelles] Straits and the second is the resumption of the truck traffic across the Habur Bridge on Turkey's border with Iraq. Turkey is determined to implement the new rules and to resume traffic on the Habur bridge. So determined is Ankara on the new rules for the straits that Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin reacted to Russia's memorandum in early May as follows: "Let's step up the procedure that is necessary to implement the new rules that will apply for the passage through the straits." Implementation of the New Rules Being Stepped Up Far from abandoning the new rules, Turkey is moving to step up the procedure that is necessary to put them into action. The government is taking a determined approach on the matter. However, the new rules will be applied without publicity. Meanwhile, Ankara has made initiatives to Russia to explain Turkey's decision. In short, Turkey will implement the new national rules on the passage through the straits on 1 July. Open the Habur Bridge Without Publicity The second development is related to the resumption of traffic on the Habur Bridge. The bridge is not officially closed, but there has been almost no traffic on it since 1992. There is no heavy truck traffic between Turkey and Iraq at the present time. Consequently, Turkey is preparing to set the trucks rolling between the two countries again. But how will it achieve that? Several countries regard the resumption of traffic between the two countries as a violation of the embargo on Iraq. There was congested traffic on the Habur Bridge in the immediate aftermath of the Gulf War. Trucks carried to Iraq commodities that were not covered by the embargo, such as foodstuffs, pharmaceutical drugs, and cigarettes. They brought back fuel oil in large containers. The truck traffic on the bridge was suspended because the PKK was reported to have received a significant share from the business done by the truck owners in 1992. Extraordinary Figures The decision to suspend the traffic on that bridge caused significant economic stagnation in the region. Some 400,000 people earned their living from the trade across the border. The filling stations provided additional jobs to 20-25 persons in the region. Other economic benefits existed as well. Fuel oil costs 1,000 Turkish lira per liter in Iraq. It is sold for 12,000 Turkish lira per liter in Turkey. It has been ascertained that Turkey acquired 3.5 million tonnes of fuel oil across the Habur Bridge in 1992. The refineries in Turkey meet 70 percent of the demand for fuel oil; consequently, Turkey has to import the remaining 30 percent. Importing fuel oil over the Habur Bridge is the cheapest way Turkey can get what it needs. The amount of foreign currency Turkey saved at the time also has to be considered. Some 180,000 trucks crossed the Habur Bridge in 1992. The number of trucks that cross that bridge has fallen to 20,000-30,000 at the present time. Karayalcin's File Considering all that, Turkey is determined to resume the truck traffic on the Habur Bridge. The government's decision would have been put into effect at the end of 1993. However, it was postponed as a result of intensive Western pressure, which was prompted by the extensive publicity ministers gave the matter at the time. The government's decision will be put into effect without publicity. It was to have been implemented during the past few days. The clashes between the supporters of Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud Barzani and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani forced the officials to postpone it. Ankara is waiting for an appropriate time. Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin has studied the matter in detail. The outcome of his research has been or is about to be submitted to the Council of Ministers. The government's decision will then be put into effect without publicity.
