Will the government-proposed budget improve them? [Swiecicki] Not only will the government draft budget fail to improve Poland's financial condition, it will also make it even worse. The increase in spending will be so large that in order to pay for it, the government, apart from increasing tax rates, wants to increase the budget deficit from 44 trillion zlotys [Z], the 1993 level, to Z83 trillion this year. The Sejm will probably approve an even greater increase. The government is not going to fulfill its preelection promises in any case, and an increase in the budget deficit could ensnare Poland in new debts. This will make it impossible to fulfill any promises whatsoever in the future and will lead to a further increase in taxes and dramatic cuts in social spending. The government seems to forget that we have still not repaid the horrendous debts that Gierek [former communist party first secretary] incurred. Poland's foreign debts amount to over Z1,000 trillion--i.e. almost $50 billion. This year we will spend almost Z30 trillion on servicing these debts. This is only possible because we are not yet repaying the London Club, and the agreement with the Paris Club contains exceptionally favorable conditions. To this, one must add the servicing of our domestic debts. In 1994, we have to spend over Z80 trillion on servicing these debts. Already this year, 18 percent of budget revenues will be spent on repaying old debts instead of financing the health service, education, the Army, or the police. An increase in the budget deficit and the acquisition of new credits to finance this deficit could bring about a collapse of state finances in subsequent years. [Grzegrzolka] Perhaps the deficit will revive the economy? [Swiecicki] That is rather impossible in our situation because there is no spare production capacity to produce quality products that could boost demand. Many enterprises have lost their markets. Apart from that, we have too many people engaged in agriculture and a new population boom. As you can see, new jobs and investments are necessary in order to cause a revival. Yet the banks are compelled to finance the budget deficit, and they do not have much money left to give to investors. The budget deficit makes loans more expensive. [Grzegrzolka] What types of spending do you consider unnecessary? [Swiecicki] In a market economy, is it really necessary to subsidize the State Railways by Z7 trillion and provide agriculture and industry with several dozen trillion zlotys? Instead of spending budget funds on social objectives, it would be better to give money to the rural districts, which are bound to manage this money better. [Grzegrzolka] Is a spending cut the only solution? [Swiecicki] Great structural reforms to the social security system, health service, and education are required. Unfortunately, the government has still not presented any ideas of its own about these spheres, and it has abandoned the ideas of previous governments. [Grzegrzolka] But the present ruling coalition is considered very prosocial. [Swiecicki] The indiscriminate granting of costly social security benefits in a poor country means that there is not enough money for those who are really dependent on social security. For instance, too many working people have gained the right to early pensions. Many people are retiring early but are still working at their jobs. This is the so-called gray zone. Instead of contributing to insurance funds, these people are drawing from them. For instance, in Poland there are more men who are drawing pensions and have not yet reached retirement age than men who who have passed retirement age. Despite the very high social security contributions, 30 percent of the workers' contribution and 94 percent of the farmers' contribution are paid out of the budget. We pay high contributions, but not even such basic benefits as family income supplements for low-income or multichildren families are available. It is similar with unemployment benefits. The coalition has evaded the difficult subject of reforming the social security and pension systems, as well as the health and education systems. In Poland, 90 percent of the funds to combat unemployment are spent on benefits. Only 10 percent is spent on creating new jobs, public works, retraining programs, and loans for people setting up their own businesses. [Grzegrzolka] Democratic Union politicians are very fond of discussing this issue, but not even the Democratic Union government managed to resolve it. [Swiecicki] But the program to combat unemployment initiated by the Democratic Union government remains valid. The present government is allocating more money for this program but has failed to indicate necessary cutbacks in other spheres. The rural lobby in the Sejm will demand subsidies for fuel and preferential loans for farmers. Large farms will profit by this, but it will not save the small farmers or the workers make redundant by the closure of state farms. [Grzegrzolka] Do you see a better solution? [Swiecicki] This money should be spent on developing the rural service infrastructure, expanding small-scale production, establishing more schools in rural areas, and creating nonagricultural jobs there. That will reap greater benefits than pumping money into rural production, which has only 25 percent of the per capita productivity of urban production. People should leave small and inefficient farms and transfer to other areas of the economy, and they ought to receive help for this transfer. In economically developed countries, less than 20 percent of the population lives off agriculture; in Poland, 50 percent of the population does. Instead of restructuring this percentage and making rural areas dependent on market forces, the government is making them dependent on state subsidies. [Grzegrzolka] What do you think of the idea of a protectionist customs duty? [Swiecicki] Poland has the conditions to produce more food than for just its own needs. Therefore, it is quite natural to compete for foreign markets, especially in West Europe. But cutting ourselves off from foreign competition is a bad solution. The government's proposed equalizing payments will preserve the high production costs in Poland and cause high food prices. All this will affect the consumer. The Mazowiecki government was criticized for opening up Poland to a mass influx of Western food on the Polish market, but these critics forget that it is thanks to this opening up that we can now buy fancy foodstuffs that used to appear only at Christmas or never at all. The quality of Polish dairy produce has also improved thanks to foreign competition. In 1990, our food exports went up by 20 percent against the previous year, and we had a $1-billion trade surplus in food, and without any equalizing payments. I wish the present government similar success. I think that opening foreign markets to Polish agricultural produce should be one of the government's strategic tasks.
