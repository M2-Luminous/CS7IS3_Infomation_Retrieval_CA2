"If it corresponds to my hopes, and these hopes spring from the people, then I will sign it," he stated. Lech Walesa declared his support for the head of the Ministry of National Defense, who announced that he will institute legal proceedings in the Constitutional Tribunal because the Sejm encroached upon the powers of the executive branch by ordering the Defense Ministry to purchase equipment made exclusively in Poland. "In new democracies, when new deputies come, they think that everything depends on them," he added. Commenting on his conflict with the National Council of Radio and Television [KRRiT], the president said: "I expect several moves that will make the task easier for me." Asked what kinds of moves he meant, he said: "effective," and, on the part of KRRiT, moves "making action and life easier for the president." Asked about the possibility of Ryszard Bender's leaving the council, he said that he has a few friends in KRRiT. Concerning Andrzej Zaorski, who is said to be the presidential candidate for the council's chairman, the president said: "He is a good expert." As to the candidacy of Aleksander Kwasniewski to the post of president, he said: "He will definitely be defeated by me." Lech Walesa may refuse to sign the Budget Law, just like any other law. It would then return to the Sejm, which may overturn the presidential veto with a two-thirds majority vote. The Sejm's arithmetic suggests that the Sejm should not have any problem doing just that, if necessary. The lack of the president's signature would also in no way affect implementation of the budget.
