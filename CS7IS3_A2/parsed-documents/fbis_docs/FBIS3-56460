Gaydar's resignation should not be taken as an attempt to bring down the president or his government, Pochinok told INTERFAX on Monday. He pledged no opposition to Yeltsin or the government on the RC's part, adding that Gaydar was in the mood for constructive dialogue. Pochinok sees Gaydar's move as the most honest option, saying that one must resign if unable to implement his ideas. At the same time, Pochinok, who is a real contender for the post of chairman of the planning and budgetary committee, says he sees no replacement for Gaydar.
