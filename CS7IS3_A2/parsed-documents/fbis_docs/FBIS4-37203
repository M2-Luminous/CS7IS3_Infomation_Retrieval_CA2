This came in a message the League received today. It was delivered by Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the political bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. Assistant Arab League Secretary General 'Adnan 'Imran told our correspondent that the League also received a copy of the message YSP Leader 'Ali Slaim al-Bid sent to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, urging him to work toward an immediate cease-fire in implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 924. 'Imran added that the League is keeping up its good offices with the various Yemeni parties in the north and south, as well as with fraternal Arab states and the international community, to bring about a cease-fire. The League also wants to bring the two sides to the negotiating table to initiate a dialogue rather than fight. He reiterated the League's stand on the Yemeni crisis and its call to end the fighting as soon as possible in order to enhance security and stability in Yemen.
