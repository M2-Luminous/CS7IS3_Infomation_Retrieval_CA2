FR941028-2-00156 FR941028-2-00109 F. Engineering Controls Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation Comments: Data are insufficient to recommend the use of UVGI. Greater emphasis should be placed on the use of UVGI in health care settings. Response: No change. No new information was provided and the current guidelines were considered appropriate. Ventilation Comments: Provide specific recommendations on engineering controls as they relate to risk level. Provide information on how to evaluate air changes per hour (ACHs). There are no data to support requirement for six or more ACHs. Response: Clarified: 6 ACHs are an absolute minimum, and a level of 12 or more ACHs are recommended, especially in new construction. Referred to table S3&hyph;1, which provides the number of air changes per hour and the minutes required for removal efficiencies of 90.0%, 99.0%, and 99.9%. The 12 ACHs or more recommendation was arrived at by both use of this table and NIOSH experimental data. Added discussion on the benefits of higher ventilation and recommended ideal performance criteria. Comments: Provide retrofit information and some examples of alternative methods for achieving required ventilation. Response: In response to requests for information on alternative methods, retrofit information, and interim guidelines, expanded the introduction to this section and introduced a clearer hierarchy of ventilation methods. Comments: Provide clearer directions on bronchoscopy location and ventilation requirements. Response: The confusion about bronchoscopy location resulted from inconsistency in the guidelines in relation to performing the procedure in the operating room vs. an area of patient isolation. Clarified this point. Room Units Comments: Provide information on room air ``cleaning'' units. Can these units serve as a substitute for not having six or more ACHs?
