In a concerted public opinion campaign, the Maltese government is trying to persuade the EU to give the green light at its Corfu summit in June for the talks to begin. That message will be given loud and clear to members of the European Parliament when they visit Malta next week. It follows a vigorous diplomatic offensive by the prime minister, Dr Edward Fenech Adami, on a visit to Brussels on 2 February. The Maltese government believes public opinion in the EU is moving its way. But they are likely to find that while there is appreciation of the economic reforms now under way to prepare the country for membership, the EU does not want to be pushed into negotiations. "It is still too early. There is no question of us putting together a negotiating mandate this year. I think we would rather look at this early next year," said one senior EU source, confirming the opinion of the commissioner in charge of enlargement talks, Hans van den Broek, that reforms must be carried out before formal negotiations can begin. It is hardly surprising that the Maltese government is pushing for entry. The policy has been the main thrust of Fenech Adami's ruling Nationalist Party since it was elected to office in 1987, and it is politically important that it be seen to be delivering before the next elections, possibly in 1996. Last week Fenech Adami stressed Malta's European affiliations. "If Malta had been an independent state immediately after the Second World War, we would have been, no doubt, among the founding members of the European Community," he suggested. Many question whether the Union can accommodate Malta slightly larger than Luxembourg and with a population of 380,000 -- without a significant institutional upheaval. To such sceptics, Fenech Adami replies: "My view is that Europe has institutional problems. But this should not be an obstacle to starting negotiations, especially with Malta. We should be treated on our own merits." Malta is at pains to stress the pace of economic reform it has set in train. By Easter it will have tabled at least 16 bills in areas ranging from financial services to consumer protection. From next January its fiscal system will be fully in line with that of the Union. But the government may well find itself under pressure to liberalise a number of state-controlled companies which enjoy monopolistic powers over the production of fresh milk (Malta Dairy Products), importation of cereals (Medigrain Ltd), the country's only casino (Casma Ltd) and ferry services (Gozo Channel). Demands are coming from consumers who believe they will benefit from greater competition and from a number of companies who are confident they can operate more efficiently and profitably in these areas. The Gozo Channel's monopoly on ferrying passengers and cargo between Malta and Gozo has sparked off a fierce debate in the country's media. The company has successfully objected to a licence being given to any competitor.
