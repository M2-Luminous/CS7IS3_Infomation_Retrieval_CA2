According to a report by the Halle Economic Research Institute, the average production of dust and sulfur dioxide decreased by 50 percent in areas with high pollution, and by a third in areas less exposed to pollution. It was, above all, the conversion of coal-fired heating systems to oil and gas- fired ones in more than 1 million private households that has caused this positive effect. In the electricity sector the funds for fighting dust, sulfur, and the disposal of ash, gypsum, and water are expected to increase to 20-30 percent of the basic investment. Of the 28 billion German marks of investment in plants expected by 1997, some 40 percent will, however, have to be used for repairing the power network.
