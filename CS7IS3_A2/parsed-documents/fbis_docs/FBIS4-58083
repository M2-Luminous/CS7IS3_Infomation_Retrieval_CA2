"There is nothing to stop Yasir 'Arafat going to Jericho as soon as the autonomy agreement is signed on Wednesday," said the official who refused to be named. "But he will no doubt wait until the first week of June when the Israeli army has completed its withdrawal and redeployment," the negotiator told journalists aboard a return flight to Tel Aviv from Cairo where an agreement to launch autonomy was reached on Thursday. The official also confirmed that besides freeing 5,000 Palestinian prisoners after the agreement is signed, Israel and the PLO had decided that Palestinians opposed to the peace process could also be released from jail. But he explained: "We are ready to envisage such releases only if the prisoners make a written commitment (renouncing violence) and if their hands are not stained with (Israeli) blood." Negotiations would continue on the fate of the 9,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, he said.
