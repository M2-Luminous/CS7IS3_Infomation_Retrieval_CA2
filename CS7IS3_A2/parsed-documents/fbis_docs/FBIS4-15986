The Boarderguard Board told ETA, on Tuesday [12 April], that on Sunday an Estonian was detained in Narva who tried to illegally import from Russia a six-member group of Kurdish refugees. The Kurds escaped back to Russia, where they were detained by a Russian borderguard patrol. Acting head of the Estonian Detainment Institutions Board Valeri Kravets told ETA, on Tuesday, that there were 137 Kurdish refugees in Estonia at present on whom documents were being prepared in order a decision could be made as to their internment. During the two-month internment period, the Migration Board has to decide whether to deport the Kurds or to grant them a status of refugees, residence and working permits. Kravets said that at Harku Prison there were 22 Kurds whose future has not been decided. At Maardu, 8 Kurds are detained, who have been in Estonia for more than three months and have been granted another two months of internment time. Kravets said it was not understandable why the solution of the problems was dragged because the accommodation and feeding of the Kurds costs a lot to Estonia. Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar told a press conference on Tuesday that government still had no money to build a permanent internment camp. He added that it was however much more important to set a better mechanism in order the Kurds will not come to Estonia illegally, the possible solution being better work of the borderguard. Those Kurdish refugees that have come here illegally have to be sent back to where they came from, he said.
