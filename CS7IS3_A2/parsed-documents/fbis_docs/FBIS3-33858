Azerbaijan Prov., Feb. 1, IRNA--A Turkish delegation on Monday [31 January] visited the victims of the last Friday bombardment of two villages in Sardasht by the Turkish jet fighters, hospitalized in this northwestern city. The delegation headed by Turkey's Foreign Ministry director general for political affairs, Ogur Dugan, arrived here Monday to inspect the bombarded areas, visit the wounded and estimate the damage caused on the villages. Talking to the victims the Turkish envoy expressed his government's deep regret over the incident. Those injured, some in critical condition, gave a detailed account of the sudden attack of the Turkish warplanes on Qasemrash region of Sardasht, West Azerbaijan Province, and called on Iranian Government to follow up the issue. The delegation also met with Deputy Governor General of the province Mohammad Ashtari. Dugan described as irrational statement of the Turkish officials that they had informed the Iranian Government of the raid beforehand. He added that upon return he will make it known that such claims were unfounded. Ashtari strongly protested the statement of the Turkish authorities and said in light of the formation of border security commissions and frequent exchange of visits between the two countries' officials in the past eighteen months, Tehran has always introduced Ankara as a friendly neighbor and a brother. However, he added, the attack raises serious questions in the mind of the public. The Turkish official expressed deep regret over the incident and hoped that such incidents will be repeated in future. [sentence as received] The Turkish delegation is to leave for Sardasht later today.
