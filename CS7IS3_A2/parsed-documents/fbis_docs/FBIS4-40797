"The implementation of this operation is the logical continuation of the consolidation of our relations with Russia," Shevardnadze said in a DPA interview in Tbilisi on Tuesday. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Georgiy Kondratyev stated in Moscow that President Boris Yeltsin ordered the beginning of the operation on Tuesday. The Russian soldiers are first supposed to remove the mines that had been planted during the fighting between Georgia and Abkhazia -- an autonomous region at the Georgian Black Sea coast -- last summer, Shevardnadze said. "This establishes security guarantees, not only for the entry of the peace troops, but also for the return of the refugees." According to his information, altogether three Russian battalions are to be stationed in the districts of Gali and Ochamchire. In the first stage of the operation the employment of up to 1,500 soldiers is planned. "The peace operation will be restricted to the troop withdrawal," he stressed. "I already said some years ago: The real sun rises for Georgia in the north," said Shevardnadze, "without Russia, we also do not have the best opportunities today to save ourselves and our state, which is being developed." "The most important thing is that Georgia must not wage war and has to learn to solve problems exclusively by peaceful means. Taking all present factors into account, this is only possible with Russia's active participation, as our bitter experiences show."
