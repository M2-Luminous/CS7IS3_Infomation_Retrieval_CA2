The spokesperson made the announcement during a phone call to Radio Cadena Nacional studios in Medellin, Colombia's second largest city. An explosive charge was detonated as Hommes' vehicle drove past, causing damage to the car. The minister was unhurt, but one of his escorts was slightly injured. A man who identified himself as a member of the ELN said that the attack was a consequence of the economic policies that have brought poverty and unemployment to the country. Hommes, who is one of President Cesar Gaviria's closest supporters, has held his current post since 7 August 1990.
