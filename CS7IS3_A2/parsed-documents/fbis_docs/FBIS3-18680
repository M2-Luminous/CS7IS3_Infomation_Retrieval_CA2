Russia's influence on the Serbs in the conflict is of considerable importance. Without Moscow's participation there will not be a solution, Kinkel said in a short debate in the Bundestag on Thursday [3 March]. As a result of the Russian efforts, the chances for the reopening of the airport of the beleaguered city of Tuzla have increased. The foreign minister said that his hope for a peaceful solution has increased since NATO's combat mission. Deputy Peter Glotz of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] conceded that the West was recently pursuing a serious political approach to solutions.
