In the old days, Liu Bi, the emperor of the Kingdom of Shu, visited Zhuge Kongming at his house three times, trying to persuade him to become his military advisor. The expression has been derived from this story. In dealing with the DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected development of nuclear arms, the PRC did not respond to "sanko-no-rei." Secretary of State Warren Christopher of the United States, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan, and President Kim Yong-sam of the ROK visited Beijing one after another to request cooperation in applying economic sanctions to North Korea, which is refusing nuclear inspections. However, the PRC did not say yes to any of them. Economic sanctions without the participation of the PRC are meaningless, as the PRC is the largest trade partner of North Korea. It has become necessary for the United States, the ROK, and Japan to rebuild their strategy. A Feeling of Distrust Against the United States Exists Among the PRC Military Authorities Why has the PRC's attitude has become so stubborn? A Chinese source in Tokyo pointed out three reasons: First, the PRC's judgment is that the DPRK has not yet succeeded in developing nuclear weapons. According to the ROK's mass media, PRC leaders reportedly said at a meeting with President Kim that "North Korea has not yet succeeded in developing nuclear weapons. If the country is serious in developing the nuclear weapons, we will be responsible for curbing their intentions." While this report was denied quickly after taking North Korea's position into consideration, the report sounds quite reliable. The PRC's judgment may be that it is not a preferable policy to corner North Korea with suspicions of its nuclear ambitions -- which is merely a pretentious "card" -- thus forcing the country to actually develop nuclear weapons, and to increase the danger of creating military confrontation. Also, the PRC is afraid that economic sanctions may further aggravate the already weakened North Korean economy and might cause its government to collapse. Second, there exists in the PRC a feeling of distrust toward the United States. Reportedly, because of the human rights diplomacy of the United States, and because of the intervention with the Tibetan issue, anti-U.S. nationalism is being created within the PRC, with hawks gaining influence with the military authorities. At the UN, the PRC was ahead of the United States -- which was to propose a "resolution to recommend reinspection" -- in proposing a "chairman's statement" of a flexible nature. This may be an expression of its aversion toward the United States taking the initiative in UN operations. Third, the PRC intends to keep "the DPRK card." While the PRC currently does not have enough strength of its own to influence North Korean actions, it expects Pyongyang to take the PRC's ideas into acount if Beijing refuses the requests of the United States, the ROK, and Japan. It is the PRC's deliberate calculation that its international influence will be strengthened if it can make timely use of this card and succeed in persuading North Korea. Besides, though not openly expressed, the PRC doubts the justice of resorting to forced measures such as economic sanctions. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) is an unequal treaty, under which possession of nuclear arms is permitted for those countries which already possess nuclear arms and prohibited for those countries which are trying to develop nuclear arms. After all, it is to be decided by individual countries whether or not to join the NPT, and such a decision is not to be forced by international law. If a country withdraws from the NPT, it becomes free from the obligation to undergo nuclear inspections. For example, India and Pakistan, while possessing nuclear devices, are not members of the NPT and thus are not subject to nuclear inspections. Also, North Korea is different from other nations such as Iraq because it has not invaded foreign countries. Even if North Korea happens to be a dangerous country which is unfriendly to the international community, the justification for members of a town attacking a certain family in the town on grounds that the family is disturbing the town's harmony is questionable. Noteworthy Comment by North Korea's Ambassador It seems that, perceiving a certain atmosphere in the international community toward North Korea, the United States has changed its strategy to include both forcible and flexible approaches. Also, for the time being, the ROK -- which has the right to announce the reopening of "Team Spirit," a U.S.-ROK joint military maneuver -- is supposed to try to find a way to reopen talks with North Korea, emphasizing its ability to cope with negotiations over the nuclear issue. Unfortunately, hard-line elements opposing North Korea's inflexible attitude are gaining strength within the ROK, making it difficult for the Kim Yong-sam government to follow a flexible line. On the other hand, contrary to its radical words, North Korea also seems to be trying to find a way to open the talks. The statement of North Korea's ambassador to Austria that "we are ready to agree to the nuclear inspection to be newly effected if the United States agrees to hold talks with us again" is considered to be a trial balloon expecting reopening of the talks. The DPRK leaders also seem to be aware that it is difficult to reconstruct the economy and to remain in power if their country is isolated from the international community.
