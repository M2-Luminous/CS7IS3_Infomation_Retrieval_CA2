He also denied that his party is linked with that organization. Through a communique sent to this office, Saucedo maintained that the reason for statements pointing to "my alleged participation in the Drive for Peace and Reconciliation in Chiapas established by the EZLN, Bishop Samuel Ruiz, and Manuel Camacho" is to distort my work and the political positions of my work. He emphasized that to say that within the framework of the two negotiations -- the EZLN-government talks and the negotiation between various political parties with the government to reach a consensus for electoral reforms as a condition for social peace -- is grave because it would affect the right environment for the dialogue. I want to express, Saucedo said, my total rejection of such statements because I have never, neither now nor in the past, wanted to give advice to the EZLN or Subcommander Marcos. I have only been an observer. In conclusion, he explained that it must not be forgotten that the PRD is a national force on the verge of attaining the government and that is the reason for our interest in the peace negotiations in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. "Nothing will change our communication and commitment with the people of Chiapas, the EZLN, and the country." Meanwhile, the PRD Office of the Federal District, headed by Rene Bejarano Martinez, presented charges to the Federal District's Human Rights Commission that a couple of PRD members were kidnapped by the National Defense Secretariat within the framework of an event called "The 100 Marches for Democracy" held on 24 February.
