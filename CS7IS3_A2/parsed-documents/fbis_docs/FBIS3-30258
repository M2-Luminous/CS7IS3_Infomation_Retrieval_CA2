Commentaries appeared immediately saying that Havel would become a lonely figure without political weight. However, the fact that he has been elected president is evidence that he is not politically negligible at all. Several days before the presidential elections, various representatives from Klaus's party had indicated that they could accept the idea that one of the most popular Civic Democratic Party politicians--Jan Strasky--would assume office at the Castle. The former federal prime minister, for whom the opposition would vote just to make Havel angry, was not completely without chances. Moreover, this enlightened and educated technocrat is a much more typical representative of Czech society than an exceptional dissident, creating in the world a rather distorted picture about ourselves. However, one of the Civic Democratic Party's highest officials admitted that the party executive committee had arrived quickly at the conclusion that Havel, as a living legend, is "less dangerous as president than as nonpresident." Havel and the Foreign Minister The first conflict between the Castle and the Foreign Ministry broke loose only two days after Havel's election. The president said that the "Czech Republic should support the idea of an international military intervention in Bosnia." Then he added that the country's binding standpoint would be discussed at his meeting with the foreign minister. Josef Zieleniec, bringing the text of the Constitution with him, visited the Castle. He drew the president's attention to the fact that the president may represent the Republic, but the Republic's foreign policy is formulated by the government. Nevertheless, in April, during Vaclav Havel's visit to Bill Clinton in Washington, he said: "One possibility of achieving peace in Bosnia is to make air strikes on Serbian positions." Three days later, Vaclav Klaus reacted: "To recommend someone to intervene, and to stay aside, seems very difficult to me." This was an exchange of opinions that has become a framework for political duels regarding foreign policy: The president's generally correct moral standpoints versus the realism of the government policy based on the world's complicated relations in which the Czech Republic's voice is only one of many. At that time, Vaclav Havel and Josef Zieleniec used to dine together almost once a week. The minister very decently explained the Cerninsky Palace's diplomatic intentions to the president. At the same time, he strictly insisted that, unlike in Dienstbier's time, each of them will be active in a clearly delimited space. On the other hand, the newly elected leaders, too, began to understand, on their foreign visits, that the president's fame abroad is no fiction. One of our diplomats admits that "the same way Milan Kundera writes for the British or the French, President Havel delivers speeches abroad that the foreign officials want to hear. As the wise ruler in The Little Prince, he invites someone to do what he wants to do anyway. When he does it, it even strengthens Havel's authority." Owing to the mediating role of Alexander Vondra, Zieleniec's first deputy and Havel's former adviser, relations between the Cerninsky Palace and the Castle have gradually improved. Clinton's visit to Prague was already under the influence of Cerninsky Palace's skillful maneuvers and Vaclav Havel's personal diplomacy. After Josef Zieleniec allowed Budapest to become Warren Christopher's host city last year, Havel, by a suggestive letter, could invite the U.S. president to Prague. He, as well as his predecessor Bush, has understood that it is advisable to appear, from time to time, on the television screen with Havel, the philosopher and intellectual. According to eyewitnesses, the president, the prime minister, and the foreign minister acted unanimously during Clinton's visit. Impressed by this cooperation, one of Havel's advisers said: "Clinton would not arrive if Havel were not the president, but he would equally not arrive if our economic transformation were on the Romanian level." Havel and the Prime Minister Since his arrival at Prague Castle, Vaclav Havel has become a close collaborator with Vaclav Klaus. Someone has said that, particularly in the first six months of his rule, the president seemed to be fascinated by the prime minister's exceptionality. This, however, is a problem that Klaus's partners must sort out. "The most difficult thing is to survive the first three years with Klaus, then everything becomes O.K.," one of the prime minister's friends says. Between the prime minister and the president, there are few disputes about the concepts. However, they sort of kick one another's ankle, in the name of political prestige. Of course, in this sort of duel, Klaus is more inclined to attack. This is a result of the prime minister's aggressiveness and also of his political instinct for self-preservation. Unlike the president, who has been elected by parliament for five years, party leader Klaus must everyday collect points for himself and for his party for the coming communal election and for the parliamentary elections later on. Vaclav Klaus has not missed any opportunity to let the public know who is the number-one man in our politics. Permanent pressure on the president has occasionally assumed an impolite form toward the head of state. For example, some ministers recall that the prime minister let Vaclav Havel wait in the antechamber for several minutes when the president came to a government meeting. Maybe Havel, who is always polite, realized later that he should have left immediately. Apparently, one year is too short a time for Havel to get accustomed to the rules of the power struggle that belongs to the party-oriented policy in stable democracies. Whoever can prove that he is able to exert vehement pressure on his milieu and to react promptly to the attacks of his partners wins. The fact that Vaclav Havel has avoided direct confrontation with the prime minister has thus provoked the most embarrassing episode of the year: The disrespectful dispute after the visit by Salman Rushdie, whose visit was quite desirable otherwise. Irrespective of the fact that this was a private visit on the incentive of the International Helsinki Committee, the president knew about it and should have discussed it with the prime minister. Today it is a known fact that the top echelons of the Interior Ministry and the Foreign Ministry knew about the visit two weeks in advance but did not report it to Klaus. When there was a verbal dispute between the president and the prime minister, in which both issued politically improper statements, no one was willing to admit a mistake. It is quite symptomatic that, after a three-hour debate behind the Castle's closed door, involving the president, the prime minister, the foreign minister, and the interior minister, Havel finally gave up. The result was a farce in the form of a communique that described the president's spokesman, Ladislav Spacek, as the culprit who committed the faux pas. With the exception of Rushdie-type affairs, both political protagonists have kept their personal disputes under wraps. On the other hand, there is no reason for them to hide their disputes regarding their concepts and opinions originating from their different political beliefs. Who else than the president and the prime minister should set an example of how to conduct ethical discussions in which one participant tolerates the other? Havel and Parliament In the era of his federal presidency, relations between Vaclav Havel and parliament represented a stumbling block. Today, however, the communication between the president and the Chamber of Deputies has lost the tension it previously had. This is also due to the fact that the Constitution allows the president to return bills to parliament but not to present them. Vaclav Havel used his right to veto the bills when he returned to the deputies the immoral bill on customs by which the legislative body granted unjustified advantages to deputies as regards customs control. Otherwise, it seems that the president has gradually adopted one of the principal methods of practical policy, which he had demonstrably despised in relations with the Federal Assembly--that is, cultivating official contacts and also contacts behind the scenes, with the influential representatives of both the coalition and the nongovernment parties. His activity culminated by the end of last year when he met with all of the clubs of deputies within several hours, with the exception of Sladek supporters, debating the politically "hot" and topical subject of the reform of the state administration. Otherwise, it seems that the president is seeking to establish contact with the chairmen of two coalition parties--Josef Lux and Jan Kalvoda, prominent Civic Democratic Party personalities in parliament--and also with several representatives of the opposition. It is impossible to question the fact that Havel, Kalvoda, and Lux have similar opinions, but it would be a simplification to say that an anti-Klaus coalition is being created here. "The president is only searching for possible allies, and he is also consulting other people, which he did not do before," one of the People Party's deputies says. Havel and People One of the most sensitive problems, persisting from the time of Havel's federal presidency, is the problem of our "settling accounts with the past." There is no doubt about the fact that the president raised the hopes of the people when he said on 21 August 1990 that we have to continue the revolution and to finally destroy the power of the communist mafias. However, Vaclav Havel has never specified how such a cleansing process should be performed. However, he strictly rejected any unlawful settling of accounts with the past, including the published list of the State Security collaborators. Last spring, in an interview for the Polish paper GAZETA WYBORCZA, Havel said that the screening law and the illegally published list of agents in NECEZUROVANE NOVINY had caused human tragedies. "I know about people who committed suicide and about children who jumped out of the window when they learned that their father was on the list," the president said. Later on, when he was sued by Peter Cibulka, one of the NECENZUROVANE NOVINY editors and a Charter 77 signatory, the president spoke in front of the court about attempted suicides only. It is possible to agree with those who say that the controversy between Havel and the vulgar Cibulka in the courtroom is a private affair between the two former dissidents. On the other hand, it is impossible to ignore that some people were maliciously happy to watch the conflict between former "prisoners of conscience." Daniel Kroupa, Civic Democratic Party deputy chairman, is of the opinion that the president should abstain from disputes--disputes between parties, in particular. "Vaclav Havel should focus on great presidential topics," Daniel Kroupa says. "We should not moralize, but we should support values in politics." It seems that Vaclav Havel began behaving in that manner by the end of his first year in office at the Castle, when he summarized in his New Year's speech his opinions about civic society and applied them to real political problems, particularly the territorial division. He presented controversial opinions that provoked the prime minister's reaction but caused only a mediocre discussion in the press. It will depend on the president himself whether he will be able to present more detailed plans, embellish them, and present them to the attentive part of the public in such a form as to make them the predominant topic the next year. Havel in His Role The German paper GENERAL ANZEIGER has written about Vaclav Havel recently: "The president is on his way to becoming what he was when he was a dissident--a man striking his head against the wall, while being surrounded by a sea of indifference. The fact that mostly old wives and children are waving hands when the president is traveling within the Republic does not mean much. Other people have to make their living and do not have time to applaud wise speeches of statesmen. However, Havel has won 70 percent of the popular vote in public opinion polls, which suggests that people want to have someone in the Castle who is protecting the general principles of society. The president has certainly passed this test.
