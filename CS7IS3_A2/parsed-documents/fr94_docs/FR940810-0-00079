FR940810-0-00079 FR940810-0-00021 Most of the requirements in paragraph (g) are instructions to use specified work practices. The work practice approach to controlling asbestos exposure in construction activities is widely endorsed. It is the model for NESHAP regulation under EPA (see 40 CFR 60.143), most state regulations and voluntary consensus guidelines. OSHA has tried to formulate work practice requirements as simple, flexible instructions, embodying the basic control strategies for asbestos dust suppression. These are to wet it down, contain the disturbance, and isolate the operation. The work practice-engineering controls which are listed and described in the regulation are the ones which the rulemaking record confirms are used, understood, and effective. OSHA expects that modifications and innovations in asbestos control technology will be developed. The standards provide for this by setting up general criteria for alternative controls, and an easily met procedure to allow the use of effective alternatives. Paragraph (g)(6) governs alternatives for Class I control methods, and paragraph (g)(7)(vi) for Class II methods. For both classes, detailed written demonstrations of the effectiveness of the alternative/modification are required and evaluations by designated persons are required. Alternatives for Class I work require a more rigorous demonstration of effectiveness, and advance notice to OSHA of their use. OSHA intends these requirements to be capable of being met by well-designed and tested alternative control methods. They are meant to exclude short-cut methods which hope to evade the other provisions in the standard. By their inclusion, OSHA is stating its policy view that industry has demonstrated its responsible innovative capability in the past, and will continue to do so. The first provision in the construction methods of compliance paragraph, (g)(1)(i), requires that three basic and simple controls be utilized in all operations covered by the construction standard, regardless of exposure levels in those operations. These provisions apply to, for example, employers who install asbestos-containing material (no Class designation), clean up asbestos-containing debris at a construction site (Class IV), repair a boiler covered with asbestos-containing TSI (Class I or III), and remove asbestos-containing surfacing material (Class I). The controls required are: use of HEPA filtered vacuums to collect debris and visible dust; use of wet methods to control asbestos fiber dispersion; and prompt disposal of asbestos contaminated waste materials. OSHA has imposed these controls to reduce airborne contamination by asbestos fibers disturbed during construction activities. However fibers are released, contamination can be reduced by suppressing asbestos containing dusts, and/or collecting them before they dry and are able to migrate. OSHA believes that most employers will be able to use wet methods, in handling asbestos-containing materials to reduce the airborne migration of fibers. The use of wet methods to control airborne asbestos was not explicitly required in the 1986 construction standard. It was mentioned among the control measures which could be used to keep down fiber levels during ``maintenance and renovation projects in environments that do not lend themselves to the construction of negative-pressure enclosures'' (51 FR 22711). In the Method of Compliance section, OSHA presented use of wet methods among a list of engineering and work practice controls from which an employer could choose when seeking to comply with the PEL. The 1972 asbestos standard had required the use of wet methods to the extent practicable to reduce the release of asbestos fibers unless the usefulness of the product would be diminished by the use of such methods. On reconsideration, OSHA now finds the use of wet methods to be an inexpensive, generally feasible, and highly effective way to control release of asbestos fibers and returns to the earlier requirement for its use in all feasible situations. There is overwhelming record support for the use of wet methods (e.g., Exs. 7&hyph;1, 7&hyph;34, 7&hyph;37, 7&hyph;51, 7&hyph;52, 7&hyph;74, 7&hyph;86, 7&hyph;89, 7&hyph;99, 7&hyph;132, 119P, 143, Tr. 223, 722 and 756). Representatives of most sectors, expressed support for a requirement for wet methods.(e.g., transite panel removal, Ex.7&hyph;74; removal of asbestos packing, Ex. 7&hyph;99; floor tile maintenance, Ex 7&hyph;132; custodial or maintenance work, Ex. 162&hyph;4, 162&hyph;25; floor tile and sheet removal, Ex 7&hyph;132; sheet gasket removal, Ex 119; cutting of transite pipe, Ex.117, Tab 6 at 5, Tab 7 at 1). B. Kynock of the AIR Coalition endorsed the use of wet methods, stating: ``wetting of material is still considered a state of the art engineering control_using wet methods_because it is the one definitive way we can keep fiber levels to a minimum'' (Tr. 3574). Evidence submitted into the record concerning a variety of asbestos jobs showed significant decreases in exposure levels when wet methods were used, compared to when the work was done dry [see e.g., re: sheet gasket removal (Ex.119&hyph;P)]. In the study by Paik et al, 1982 (Ex. 84&hyph;204) sprayed-on asbestos containing material was removed from eleven buildings, in one dry methods were employed due to electrical considerations while wet methods were employed in the other buildings. The dry method resulted in a geometric mean fiber level of 16.4 f/cc, while during the use of wet methods the geometric mean was 0.5 f/cc. OSHA notes that the OSHA PEL at the time the samples were taken was 2.0 f/cc. Exxon (EUSA) submitted extensive sampling data indicating low fiber counts during outdoor removals in which wet methods were used (Ex. 38). Exxon also submitted sampling data from the outdoor removal of pipeline wrap from underground lines in which wetting was the primary means of control and in which 30 personal samples had an average fiber level less than 0.03 f/cc (Ex. 127). It is noted that Exxon also submitted specific additional work practices used in conjunction with wet methods to control fiber levels.
