In his opening speech to the fourth conference of the World Energy Studies Center, which he heads, Yamani said that Iraq's resumption of oil exports would put OPEC members under great pressure unless they work to offer it a suitable quota of the organization's output. He added that the oil price would in this case fall to $10 a barrel and remain at this level during 1996. Yamani pointed out that the official U.S. position on Iraq's resuming its oil exports continues to make it conditional on Iraq's compliance with all UN resolutions concerning Iraq, but this position is not now as clear as it used to be.
