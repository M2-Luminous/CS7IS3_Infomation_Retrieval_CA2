It says we cannot report the data coming from the Voting Table Boards; that is what the TSE is saying and is threatening to take action against the radio station. I would like to tell the TSE gentlemen that the political parties not the news media have accepted that law, a law that gags the freedom of thought to broadcast facts, which have already turned into news after the voting ended. So as not to cause problems to this company, I am henceforth going to be silent on the survey and the results coming from the Voting Table Boards from all over the country. I only have one thing to say to the TSE gentlemen, who are supposedly living in a democratic country: Not even the country's most sinister criminal dictatorships kept the news media from reporting the results that came from the Voting Table Boards. That is what you, TSE gentlemen, have done. I am publicly asking you, for tomorrow and the next elections, to correct the tremendous disarray you generated, as thousands of Salvadorans did not appear on the voting lists. Before gagging the news media, correct the disarray inside the TSE for the sake of all Salvadorans. Colleagues from this station all over the country, we will keep our information to ourselves. One has to express regret that politicians of the TSE and the parties have accepted a law that is not for the news media. The news media and the people's will must not be gagged. That is the sad thing. TSE gentlemen, allow me to repeat this: Not even the country's most sinister and criminal tyrannies succeeded in subduing the news media, as you have tried to do today. Long live freedom of expression, something for which we will fight tirelessly from this trench. I regret the conduct and pseudolegal position of the TSE gentlemen.
