Raja Mohan: "U.S. Arms for Pakistan Operations in Somalia"] [Text] Washington, Dec. 2--The Clinton Administration is considering transfer of arms worth $45 millions to Pakistan apparently to augment the operations of Islamabad's forces in Somalia. The American military transfer, free of charge, to Pakistan, is part of a proposed $106 millions of military assistance to the U.N. forces in Somalia. Sources in the State Department are unwilling to reveal the details of the proposed transfer to Pakistan, but have told THE HINDU that the transfer is under active consideration of the Clinton Administration. State department sources insist that the arms are only for the use of Pakistani troops deployed in Somalia and they would not be entitled to take it back with them to Pakistan when they leave Somalia. The sources are also reluctant to reveal the nature of the military package that is being proposed to be transferred to Pakistan. But they suggest that it consists of equipment that will facilitate the operations of the Pakistani contingent in Somalia. The equipment could include anything from a handful of advanced tanks to auxiliary equipment. The American decision to transfer arms to Pakistan via the U.N. peace-keeping and peace-making operations is not entirely new. State Department sources say that the Clinton Administration transferred some armoured personnel carriers and transport equipment to Pakistani forces in Somalia last summer. But they are unwilling to comment on the exact value of that transfer. The Clinton Administration's plans to provide arms to Pakistan through the U.N. peace-keeping route has angered the U.S. Congressional leadership. In a letter sent last week to the U.S. Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher, a group of Senate Republicans, led by minority leader Bob Dole and Jesse Helms, have criticised the Administration's proposal to provide military assistance to the U.N. forces in Somalia. The Senators said they were "deeply troubled" by the Administration's plans to transfer weapons to the Pakistani contingent in Somalia. The Republican Senators said such a transfer would circumvent the 1985 Pressler Amendment, which bars economic and military assistance to Pakistan because of its nuclear weapon programme. But the Administration insists that such arms transfers to Pakistan do not violate the Pressler law. Since early 1992, when it presented a new interpretation of the Pressler Amendment, the State Department has been arguing that only direct government-to-government military sales are prescribed by the Pressler law. They have suggested, in a clever but tortuous legal argument, that commercial sales of military equipment to Pakistan do not come under the ambit of the Pressler Amendment. The Congress in general and Senator Larry Pressler, in particular, have objected to this interpretation of the non-proliferation law; but the Administration has stuck to its guns. Liberating itself from the constraints of American non-proliferation law, the U.S. Government has resumed the sale of military spare parts and other equipment to Pakistan since 1992. But the administration told the Congress, notwithstanding its new interpretation of the Pressler Amendment, that it will be cautious in considering arms transfers to Pakistan. The U.S. Government says all such transfers will be on a case-by-case basis, and Washington will not let Pakistan enhance its military capabilities either through upgradation of the military equipment or an increase in its numbers. However, the Administration has often said that it will not allow a deterioration in Pakistan's military capabilities. The military significance of the proposed American arms transfers to Pakistan is clearly limited. The political message emanating from Washington may be more important. That Washington is prepared to find any means--including the United Nations peace-keeping operations--to launder military equipment to Pakistan, signals a new political resolve in the Clinton Administration to revive the strategic relationship with Islamabad and reinvigorate its ties with the military in Pakistan.
