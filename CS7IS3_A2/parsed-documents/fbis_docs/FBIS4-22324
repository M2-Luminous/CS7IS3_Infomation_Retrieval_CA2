Today this is a strategically advantageous position in the marathon distance of the Russian movement toward the market. It is possible to spring ahead, but then you run the risk of overtaxing your forces. And they are needed to confidently reach the goals that have been set. But the impressive rates of development of Finist Bank and its rapid and confident mastery of new kinds of services and modern banking technologies reveal in it the fighting spirit of one of the most powerful and promising financial institutions in the country. While in 1992 its currency reserve increased 2.8-fold, credit investments--2.5-fold, and profit--fivefold, during the past year these indicators stood out even more sharply--4.5-fold, fourfold, and 4.4-fold, respectively. Of course the growth of volumes and the scale of banking operations were taken into account here. The person I spoke with, Mikhail Gladilin, a member of the board of Finist Bank, nonetheless evaluates the results of the path that has been followed critically and in a balanced fashion. His taciturn reflections are distinguished by their simplicity, logic, and completely convincing arguments. I did not observe a desire to promote himself, to present himself in a more advantageous light. "We are a team that adheres to the ideology of mutual prosperity," he emphasized repeatedly in the conversation. "That is, we can all get rich together, but not at one another's expense. Through mutual efforts we are striving to increase our combined revenues. This approach corresponds more to the Russian national character than the principle of Western individualism does." Finist Bank, as one of the largest and most competitive general commercial banks of Russia, which performs to high international standards, was created in 1989 and soon obtained a license from the Central Bank of Russia. It is a matter of special pride that it has no cases of failure to fulfill its payment obligations. Under difficult economic conditions of rupture of economic ties, nonpayments, decline of production, inflation, and other kinds of disorder the bank has managed to protect the interests of its clients and stockholders. All of its stocks, incidentally, have gone through the procedure of licensing, that is, verification for quality and reliability, they have a permanent market quotation, and they are highly liquid securities. All this attracts extremely solid and respectable companions. It would take too much time to travel to all the places where the bank does business--its 19 branches are located in large industrial centers of Russia and CIS countries and serve more than 6,000 dynamically developing enterprises and organizations. Finist Bank has correspondent relations with first-class banks of the United States, Germany, England, France, Singapore, and other countries. "Our bank's gold reserve includes dozens of devoted, honest, and highly professional specialists," Mikhail Gladilin says with conviction. "This year we will be placing most of our hopes in them. The bank has created a computer center and a significant analytical service that has diverse independent sources of information. We are investing a great deal of effort and money in the growth of our intellectual potential and technical retooling, while receiving a high return from this. In particular, Finist Bank plans to change over to a system of electronic payments, `without leaving the office,' within a realistic time frame and also to introduce a system of accounts using plastic credit cards. "Today our banking organism is in a stage of stable and confident growth," continues Mikhail Gladilin. "While our previous achievements were gained relatively simply, our current prognosis and analysis convince us of the need to turn toward strategic target planning, to tested expedient and economical actions, and to a radical improvement of the quality of work and of personnel and bank subdivisions with existing and new service markets. The search for solutions is proceeding in a market spirit--healthy, vital, and creative. Strategic target planning, for example, strives to `look' several years ahead, is built on a comprehensive analysis of global changes in economic conditions, and is calculated for specific spheres of activity and talented Russian entrepreneurs, as well as the capabilities of the partners and clients of our bank. "Here is one example of `quick reaction' to what would seem to be insignificant changes in the economic situation. There was revealed a tendency for Russia to begin to raise higher and higher the customs barriers that protect domestic commodity producers from the flow of goods and finished products that has surged onto our immense market. So in a year or two it will be more advantageous not to import foreign goods but to produce our own products in Russia itself on the basis of existing enterprises. But the latter have a significant `but.' In order to produce competitive products, practically all Russian productions are in need of modernization, reconstruction, new mechanisms for financial and administrative activity, and retraining of personnel. Otherwise, we will never see high-class furniture, motor vehicles, audiovisual equipment, computers, or many other things with the long-awaited mark `made in Russia.' "In order to carry out these tasks the bank has founded the International Investment Fund (MFI) which will soon open in Moscow. It will work on establishing direct ties between Russian and Western partners, developing technical-economic plans and investment programs, and preparing all the necessary documentation. In this connection I was happy to learn of the two-volume `Guide to German Enterprises' which gives `portraits' of 400 of the most successful German firms that want to work with their Russian partners. "The publication was prepared and published with the participation of Finist Bank in the Russian and German languages by the Russian firm Poliform in conjunction with its Berlin partner Katalist Verlagsgesellschaft GmbH. Because of the new information technologies it will be necessary to `work through' other countries as well. So it is enough for our businessmen to fall within the field of vision of the aforementioned MFI, without running through the Moscow offices and dealing with the bureaucracy, to engage in the creation of joint productions and the output of high-quality products on the basis of their own plants and factories. "Today Finist Bank is aiming at investing its money in the domestic economy. Under the conditions of the unfavorable Russian investment complex this step, frankly, seemed questionable to me. After all, hundreds of today's banks are using their capital for transactions of the `buying and selling' type. By reducing its share of such operations the bank will inevitably lose some of its profit. It will probably be necessary to have supernatural sensitivity and an especially large reserve of strength in order to invest our money in productions from which the return will come in a year or two. In industry, agriculture, road construction, and communications. "These are my assumptions here. While other businessmen are ranting and raving over super high profit, Finist Bank without a lot of fuss and with knowledge of their business holds key positions in the branches of the economy whose renewal will determine the image of the revived Russia. That is when the bank's strategic vision will probably appear, the emblem of which today is the fantastic `Finist--the bright falcon,' a strong, keen-sighted, high-flying bird."
