The article says: "Just when the Clinton administration continues to criticize China for exporting prison goods to the United States, California and Oregon are stepping up efforts to export their prison-made clothing to Asia." The article specifically exposed the following fact: "Oregon will export $3 million worth of prison-made jeans and shirts this year to Japan, Italy, and other countries," "while California has sent selling offers to Japan and Malaysia." The U.S. export of prison-made products is no longer news. What merits people's attention is that although the U.S. export of prison goods is an open secret, some people in the United States do not feel ashamed of it. They continue to castigate others on the issue while posing themselves as persons of high morals. This cannot help but arouse dissatisfaction from many people, including some honest Americans. The article in THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR precisely represents the sentiments of these honest people. Some people in the United States, however, put a label on China for the so-called export of prison goods and the alleged "violation of human rights." Why, then, does the United States not violate human rights by exporting its prison goods? China has issued explicit orders and taken practical measures to ban exports of such goods, and why has the United States continued sending its selling offers to market and export prison goods everywhere? These people have made irresponsible criticisms of China for compelling prison inmates to work and "produce export goods without pay." Perhaps this is the reason why prison goods exported by the United States are different from those exported by other countries. However, the article in THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR points out: "In California prison workshops prisoners are forced to work like slaves. If they do not work, they are at risk of losing some preferential treatments and serving longer sentences." "The U.S. authorities exploit prisoners." "The net pay of prison inmates is much lower than the official minimum wage. California's prisoners sewing shirts receive $0.35 an hour. Although Oregon prisons pay inmates $6 to $8 an hour, they take back 80 percent as charges of board and lodging." There is no wonder that the article quoted some Americans as saying: "The U.S. Administration often criticizes other countries for infringing upon human rights, but it turns a blind eye to the domestic phenomena of human rights violations." Some people even said indignantly: "The practice of two different kinds of policies on prison goods may smack of old-fashioned imperialism." It seems unnecessary to say anything else as the foregoing is clear enough, but this writer cannot help thinking of an ancient Chinese saying that reads: "The magistrate is free to burn down houses while the common people are forbidden even to light lamps." This indicates that the magistrate's tyranny has developed to such a point that his policies "may" not just "smack of" something.
