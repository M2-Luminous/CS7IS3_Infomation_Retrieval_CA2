David Axelrod, the Kahana Hay spokesman who resides in Kfar Tapuah, told our correspondent Gil Litman that yesterday he received an order restricting his movements and banning him from entering Hebron and Qiryat Arba'. He was also ordered to return his army-issued weapon to the IDF. Axelrod told our correspondent he will not obey the two orders and that he intends to come to Qiryat Arba' in order to visit the grave of Barukh Goldstein. Axelrod claims he should keep his weapon for self-defense purposes.
