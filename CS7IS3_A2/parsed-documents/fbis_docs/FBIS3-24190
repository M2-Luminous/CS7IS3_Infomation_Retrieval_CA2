Vorobyev, chief of the oblast UVD [Internal Affairs Administration]: "Without Overcoming Crime, We Will Not Achieve a Normal Life." Comments on summary of criminal statistics for 1993] [Text] [Begin boxed material] The operational situation in the oblast during the past year was difficult. There were 22,712 crimes recorded, an increase of 10 percent over 1992. There was a characteristic increase in serious crimes. Moreover, not only was there an increase in their number, but also in their relative share within the overall structure of crime. This signifies an escalation of violence, cynicism and harshness in relations between people. During the year there were 182 reported cases of murder with assault. Moreover, almost half of them were in the sphere of family-domestic relations. There were 421 cases of grave bodily injury, with one in four of these resulting in the death of the victim, as well as 101 cases of rape and attempted rape. [End boxed material] Behind each of these criminal acts are the grief and tears of the victims, their loved ones and family members, a huge and often irreplaceable material loss, moral and psychological trauma, and broken human lives. The situation is particularly alarming in the rural areas, where crime has increased by 10.5 percent and practically one out of every three crimes registered in the oblast is committed. The blame for this may be placed not only on the ill-planned migration policy, which has flooded the rural areas with convicted persons who have persistent negative habits and who are the outcasts of society, but also on the total absence of leisure time of the rural residents, their spiritual decline. A rich, full life, healthy in its constant interaction with nature, is often replaced by a ruinous passion for alcohol. The rural areas are steadily degenerating both spiritually and physically... We may find many reasons for the avalanche-like growth of greedy acts, but the main one, in our opinion, consists of the increasing enmity between the haves and the have-nots, which is caused by an increase in the process of stratification of society by level of income and living standard. Criminal expropriation is rampant. But they are robbing not only the millionaires. Among our 10,230 fellow citizens whose property has been subjected to criminal encroachments, the overwhelming majority are ordinary workers with moderate or low income. Thieves have "cleaned out" 2,858 apartments, stolen 790 automobiles and motorcycles, and performed 258 acts of stealing livestock from personal subsidiary farms. There have been 972 cases of robbery and 166 cases of assault and brigandage committed against the personal property of citizens. Taking the misfortune of others close to heart and understanding very well the condition of the people who have suffered because of criminals, I once again call upon Smolensk residents to show concern for the safety of their relatives and dear ones and the safekeeping of their personal property. We are ready to give aid in equipping residences with security alarms and to issue permits in accordance with the law for obtaining hunting rifles and gas-powered weapons, to help in the protection of enterprises, stores and offices, to train our four-footed friends for the security-guard service, etc. Such a form of greedy-violent crime as extortion also requires special mention. There were 125 recorded cases of racketeering during the year. And, unfortunately, we are predicting an increase in such crimes in the future. We must say frankly, the detainment of extortionists presents no special difficulties. Many are caught red-handed and brought to criminal responsibility on all instances which have been reported in a timely manner by the victims. Nevertheless, according to the estimates of our experts, there are hundreds of times more cases of extortion than are officially reported and registered. This is an extremely dangerous crime, fraught with the most serious consequences, and the appraisal which the criminal code gives it is rather inadequate to the severity and social significance of racketeering. Indulging in extortion and the obedient payment of the sums demanded by it will inevitably lead the bribe-payer into a maze of crime and will place him in jeopardy, along with the members of his family, his life and health, his property and well-being. I suggest that anyone who knows of cases of extortion and anyone who has become the victim of criminal terror, threats and violence immediately report this to the law enforcement agencies. The number of encroachments on state property is continually growing. Underground "privatization" is going on due to the carelessness, connivance, and sometimes even the participation of economic managers and other official and materially responsible persons. This is inflicting a great loss upon the economy. Along the line of criminal investigation alone there have been 6,470 registered crimes against state property, 79.5 percent of which constitute theft. The number of violant encroachments on our goods has increased: There have been 100 recorded cases of robbery and 13 cases of assault and brigandage. The decline in the level of morality and culture, the disappearance of many hindering barriers, coupled with the spread of alcohol, have led to a significant deterioration of law and order. There were 2,271 crimes committed in public places, an increase of 54.8 percent. Street crime has increased by almost 30 percent. Moreover, almost half of these crimes were committed in Smolensk, and one-fourth--in Promyshlennyy Rayon, which for a number of reasons has become the most dangerous in terms of crime for Smolensk residents. The increase in all forms of crime has been facilitated by a weakening in the struggle against drunkenness. Drunks committed around 5,000 crimes, which is 26 percent higher than in 1992. And in individual rayons, as for example in Roslavlskiy, Khislavichskiy, Monastyrshchinskiy, Temkinskiy and Rudnyanskiy Rayons, the increase in "drunken" crimes has comprised more than 80 percent. Especially negative processes are taking place among the young people. Today few are worried that a thousand youths have been thrown out of schools and other educational institutions, deprived of the possibility of earning an honest living. Left to their own devices, having lost their moral guidelines and faith in justice, raised not on respect for the traditions of the older generations and all-human moral principles, but on worship of far from the best examples of Western life, young people often embark upon the path of crime. Around 2,000 crimes of the racketeering type are committed by young people ranging in age from 14 to 18 years old. Among them there are thieves, robbers, rapists and murderers. Statistics show that the "army" of those who have transgressed the criminal law is being replentished not from the ranks of repeat offenders, but at the expense of young people. While recidivist crime has declined by 5.2 percent, crimes committed by minors have increased by one-fourth. Especially daring crimes are often committed in groups. The increase in group crime comprised 24.3 percent. The participants in many criminal groupings are juveniles. An exceptional social danger is posed by the increasing tendency of adults to involve juveniles in criminal activity, by the division of spheres of influence between the groupings, and by the training of physically developed but morally deficient young people who are ready to do anything for money in semi-underground sections and karate, boxing and kick-boxing clubs. One other very complex problem is the struggle against the unlawful distribution of narcotics. The desire to withdraw into the phantom, unreal world of dope is especially inherent to young people. Judging by the official data, the scope of drug distribution is huge. In Russia during 1993 there were 53,169 identified cases of crimes associated with the illegal circulation of drugs, with one out of every 72 of these being discovered in our oblast. The Russian internal affairs agencies have seized around 20 tonnes of narcotic-containing plants from criminals, and here in our oblast--over 300 kilograms! Yet the "profession" of the drug addict is certainly not quiet: Considerable money is required to obtain the drugs. And this money is acquired through theft, robbery and hold-ups... The increased boldness and violent directionality of crimes is expressed also in the fact that criminals are using weapons more often, including firearms. They are showing active resistance to the associates of the militia. According to the data of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], during the year associates of the Russian militia had to use weapons in suppressing crimes and detaining malefactors in 2,186 cases. The militia itself has borne tangible losses in this uncompromising struggle: 183 associates of law enforcement agencies were killed and 572 wounded in encounters with criminals. There have been over 400 cases of unlawful storage and carrying of firearms discovered in the Smolensk region. Seized from the underground arsenal were 70 rifles, an anti-tank gun, 53 sawed-off shotguns, 39 homemade firearms, 81 grenades, 8 mines, 13 kilograms of tolite and almost 14,000 cartridges. There were over 800 recorded cases of resistance to associates of the militia, and 64 criminal cases were filed against persons using physical violence against the associates. The associates of the Smolensk militia were forced to use their weapons in over 200 cases! Last year, thanks to the intensive work of the investigative services, 14.6 percent more criminal cases were investigated. The rate of crimes solved increased by 0.7 percent and comprised 58.1 percent (for all of Russia this figure is 50.6 percent). Of course, neither we, the professionals, nor the victims of the crimes, nor the oblast population can be satisfied by any positive results as long as there are 19 murderers and attempted murderers, 51 persons guilty of committing grave bodily injuries, 12 rapists, 500 robbers and brigands and over 7,000 thieves whose wrongdoings have not been exposed living in our midst. All our efforts and means are directed toward exposing these grave crimes and identifying and detaining the guilty parties. This in general was the criminal situation in the oblast last year. We cannot call it extreme, but we predict an even more difficult situation whose control will require the effort of all forces and the attraction of all available means.
