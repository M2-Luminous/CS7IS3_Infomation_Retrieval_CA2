Chamber Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko has two deputies and one post remains vacant. Shumeyko nominated two candidates for the post -- head of Voronezh region administration Aleksandr Kovalev and Chairman of the regional council of the Leningrad region Vadim Gustov. The region retained the old name in contrast to the administrative centre which was renamed into St. Petersburg. However, Kovalev refused to run for the post, while Gustov lacked 15 votes to become deputy speaker. 71 lawmakers supported him instead of the necessary minimum of 86.
