His meeting with his Croatian counterpart in Bonn today also served this purpose. The diplomatic merry-go-round regarding the Bosnian war continues. The Bonn government, the chancellor, and foreign minister have noisily stressed their contribution to the search for a political solution to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and hosted the Croatian Foreign Minister Granic today. According to the principle that everybody who has something to do with efforts to end the war in the Balkans tries to influence that party to the war with whom he maintains good relations, Germany is expected to devote its special attention to Croatia, which turned from the victim of the Serbian aggression into an equally brutal aggressor in the eyes of the international community of states a long time ago. Thus, the presence of Croatian Government troops in Bosnia was also discussed today. The U.S. intelligence service believes that 5,000-6,000 Croatian soldiers are deployed there. A UN resolution calls for their complete withdrawal. So far the Croats have not provided any clear information, and it is difficult to identify the fighting soldiers, because they naturally do not wear Croatian uniforms. Yet, Granic promised today that Croatia will observe the UN resolution. A total of 600 Croatian soldiers are to be withdrawn from the Muslim part of Mostar in the next few days. As far as Mostar itself is concerned, where the Croatian population has suffered at least as much as the citizens of Sarajevo, the town is to be placed under European control after the adoption of a cease-fire. Germany is ready to play a major role here, Kinkel pointed out. In central Bosnia, where a Muslim offensive is taking place against the Bosnian Croats, and in other trouble spots, officials want to achieve with political instruments what was accomplished by means of a military threat in Sarajevo -- that is a cease-fire and the disengagement of hostile troops. Kinkel does not want to rule out completely the instrument of a military ultimatum, but a political solution is to be given priority. The Russians have already made it clear that they reject the Sarajevo model. Above all, it is now important to make full use of the dynamism that resulted from the success of Sarajevo. Negotiations between the former allied, but now hostile, Muslims and Croats, which will continue in Zagreb today, are also a sign of hope. Although efforts are under way to end the war in the former Yugoslavia, the Federal Government is still skeptical of the proposal submitted by Russian President Yeltsin to convene a summit conference. Such a summit would have to be prepared carefully, Kinkel stated. He does not believe that the time has come yet. He expressed the hope that the Russians will prevent the Serbs from using the weapons withdrawn from Sarajevo in other places in Bosnia.
