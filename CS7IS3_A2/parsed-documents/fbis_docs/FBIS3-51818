Nomination day is February 4. The announcement, Friday night, found opposition political parties well into campaigning. It also found the ruling New Democratic Party with an image problem, following the resignation of minister in the prime minister's office, Burton Williams. Williams said he had resigned last week, with immediate effect, because Prime Minister James Mitchell treated Vincentians with "utmost contempt and disrespect." Political insiders said Williams was among three persons the NDP wanted to sit out the next general election. Williams, however, said he would try to hold on to the South Windward constituency seat he has held since 1984. The NDP has not yet said who would replace Williams as its candidate or whether controversial former trade minister, Johnathan Peters, would seek to retain his North Central Windward seat. This month, Mitchell announced he was relieving Peters of his portfolio and placing him on leave until month-end. Peters has been in the U.S. since early December. He is reported to be sorting out problems with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. Fifteen seats are at stake in the election. Mitchell's party won all in the last election here, in 1989. Mitchell's main opponent is the St. Vincent Labour Party, headed by Stanley John. The NDP will also be up against political scientist Dr. Ralph Gonsalves' Movement for National Unity. Opposition politicians have listed unemployment and inadequate housing and health care delivery among the campaign issues. A key issue is sure to be the state of the banana industry, the main source of foreign exchange here. The industry has been hit by falling revenue. The St. Vincent Banana Growers Association, which virtually manages it, earned just over 60 million East Caribbean Dollars (one EC dollar = 37 U.S. cents) in 1993, down from just over EC99 million dollars the previous year. There has been a sharp increase in the voters list. Late December, 1993, the electoral office put the tally at 66,598, up from 61,091 persons registered for the 1989 poll.
