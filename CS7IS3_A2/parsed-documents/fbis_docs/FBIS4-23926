He is in protective custody and is giving valuable information to the police concerning the activities of the far-right and plans to establish an underground "people's army" of international freedom fighters with close neo-Nazi links in South Africa. German Recruits The 46-year-old Ronald Deuster arrived in the country from Europe two months ago with two German recruits. He was not pleased about the amateurish way in which right-wing extremists tried to get their underground struggle off the ground and decided to reveal everything to the police. Before the election Deuster converged with other foreign mercenaries and far-right South Africans on a farm outside Brits, but since then everyone has dispersed. A former member of the AWB, Mr. Eddie MacIntosh, owner of the Silkaatsnek Nature Reserve near Brits, this week confirmed that Deuster was employed there and that he had surrendered to the police. Fought in Bosnia "According to his documents Deuster was in the French Foreign Legion and he also fought in Bosnia, where he heard of the possibility of coming to fight in South Africa," says Mr. MacIntosh. "However, the AWB's [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] war games did not impress him. He complained that there are too many generals and not enough foot soldiers in the AWB." Brigadier John Wright, executive director of Interpol's National Central Bureau in Pretoria (Interpol NCB), this week confirmed that his unit is playing a leading role in the identifying of international neo-Nazi suspects in South Africa. Brig. Wright specifically referred to the two New Zealand mercenaries, the twins who acted as bodyguards for AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche, and the latest breakthrough concerning the arrest of a French citizen in KwaZulu-Natal.
