FBIS4-12979 "drnes073_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-073 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 SYRIA Minister Comments on Peace Process, UN Mission Minister Comments on Peace Process, UN Mission JN1504060094 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0415 GMT 15 Apr 94 JN1504060094 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman yesterday evening received a UN Middle East fact-finding mission that includes journalists from several nations. The minister spoke about Syria's policy toward the peace process. He said: We supported the U.S. initiative because it considered the implementation of UN Resolutions 242 and 338 the basis for the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the region. The minister denounced the policy of procrastination and maneuvering being pursued by Israel to thwart the peace process. He asserted that the Madrid conference and the Washington talks have revealed to the world that Israel does not want peace and that it seeks instead to take on this or that Arab party on its own to conclude separate deals away from an international frame of reference. Dr. Salman said further that Israel has tried to circumvent the outcome of the Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton by using pressure and launching a defamation campaign, in cooperation with the Zionist lobby, against the U.S. President. This is meant to drive the U.S. Administration to go back on its pledges regarding the achievement of peace on all tracks of the conflict. The minister added that the new tendentious campaign against Syria is part of the schemes of Israel and the Zionist lobby to mar U.S.-Syrian relations and try to influence Syria's position that adheres to a comprehensive solution and does not submit to any blackmail or pressures. The minister concluded his conversation with the members of the UN fact-finding mission by noting that the U.S. Government praised Syria's cooperation with Washington and European and international organizations in the field of combating drugs. Israel, on the other hand, is one of the primary countries that facilitate drug trafficking worldwide.
