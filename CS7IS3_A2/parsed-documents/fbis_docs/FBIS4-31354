What has led to the abandonment of the temporizing policy practiced thus far? [Cosea] Both the slow pace and the shortcomings to date in the privatization process have obviously influenced our decision. But what made us act now was the desire not to let the opportunities of the moment go unused. We have reached a stage whereby we managed to score some results in the overall stabilization of the economy, thanks to certain monetary measures. However, these results are very fragile and their consolidation cannot be ensured without key actions in the real economy. In our opinion, the most important measure in this respect is the privatization, which will lead to changes not only in the form of ownership, but also in the structure of the economy, primarily industry. Without such a change, we cannot relaunch production on sound bases. We also took into consideration the fact that the acceleration of the privatization process will consolidate the progress already made and will also help us make further headway. Through such an action we leave out a good part of the state sector -- which is a frenetic user of public moneys -- from the 1995 budget. The results thus obtained will allow us to direct our attention to other sectors of the reform -- such as education, health, and culture -- which we have failed to tackle so far because of the lack of financial means. [Cercelescu] How is the mechanism for speeding up privatization conceived? [Cosea] Our program relies on two pillars, namely involving the population in the process of privatization of the enterprises through ownership certificates and large-scale privatization. More than two years ago, the people received 30 percent of the state's assets free of charge, but only on paper. Now, the holders of these certificates are going to change them into shares and thus effectively become owners of the respective enterprises. Some 3,000 trade companies will be privatized in 1994. They will be presented to the public not only nominally, but also through a "visit card," which we will issue in order to enable everybody to form an opinion about each and every enterprise. Therefore, the citizens will be able to acquaint themselves with the social capital value of the respective enterprise, its business turnover in the past three years, its export activity, its main field of activity, the nominal value of a share, the overall number of shares, and the profit levels as a function of the business figures and social capital of that enterprise. The citizens have 30 days to choose their preferred enterprises. Their choice will be written down in a printed option form, which will be directly sent to the respective company. The active personnel and the pensioners of the respective enterprise have priority at the exchange of certificates for shares. The shares will not be printed on paper, but we will use -- as everywhere else in the market economies -- dematerialized shares, that is computer-registered shares. However, the people who have exchanged their certificates for the shares will receive a written document attesting to the fact that they are shareholders. In this connection, I would like to make the following clarification: The exchange of certificates for 30 percent of a given enterprise's shares will not bring money to the respective enterprise. The only way in which the privatized enterprises can acquire further capital is by selling the rest of the 70 percent of their shares, which thus becomes part of the large-scale privatization -- whereby the employees and pensioners of the respective enterprises again enjoy priority in the acquisition of shares. [Cercelescu] Certain developments have taken place between the time when the people received these ownership certificates and the time of their utilization, something which has substantially influenced both their value and distribution. How will these abnormal situations be solved? [Cosea] The most delicate problem is that of the value of these certificates. We now have two values: The value given by the nonorganized market, which is between 10,000 and 15,000 lei for each certificate, and the value given by the Private Property Fund [FPP], which is in excess of 170,000 lei. In both cases, the value is underestimated. This can be easily proved. For example, if we just take the 170,000 lei value of the certificate, the total number of certificates does not cover the 30 percent of the social capital, but much less -- according to certain calculations, it only covers 8-9 percent of it. We have a very simple method to calculate the value of a certificate as closely as possible to the current situation prevailing in the economy: We divide the 30 percent value of the social capital as it was on 31 December 1993 by the overall number of certificates issued. We will thus obtain a much higher value than is the case now and, what is more, it will be the same for everybody. As a matter of fact, the acceleration of the privatization process will be achieved by granting equal changes to everybody, from the very beginning, in the most open way possible. This is what we had in mind when we established the principle of one certificate per person and enterprise. There have been many social complaints about the inequalities created by the concentration of an important number of certificates in the hands of certain persons or legal entities. In order to reduce inequalities, at least in the current stage of the process, a citizen can only choose one certificate per enterprise. If he has more certificates, he can go to other companies, but also with a single certificate, something which will disperse his capital. [Cercelescu] Some of the enterprises put out for privatization will be very profitable and most of the people will be attracted to them, rather than go to the other ones. What will happen if the exchange options exceed the 30 percent free-of-charge part? [Cosea] At the enterprise level, one will be able to go up to 50 percent of the social capital, following that the State Property Fund [FPS] and the FPP should agree on mutual compensations, so as to maintain the proportion of 30 to 70 percent in the overall economy. I would like to add that there are also other ways of utilizing the ownership certificates. One is to entrust them to the FPP, which will administer them and pay dividends. Another possibility is to negotiate the certificates on the bonds market, which will appear concurrently with the start of the action of changing the certificates into shares. On such a market, the certificates can be sold or bought at prices fixed by the offer and demand. At the same time, one should take into consideration a possible second wave of privatizations scheduled for the start of next year -- on the basis of the same procedure -- when further enterprises will be privatized, as well as those enterprises left untouched by the first wave. Until then, the list of the 3,000 enterprises scheduled to be privatized in the first wave will be finalized in June; the media will disseminate the action throughout July; the offer will come out in August; and the exchange of the ownership certificates will begin on 1 September. We hope that a good part of the economy will be privatized by the end of the year, so as to be able to proceed more rapidly along the road of reform.
