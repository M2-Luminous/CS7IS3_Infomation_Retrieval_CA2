The accord signed with the Bulgarian Energy Committee and the Bulgarian state-owned power company NEK identifies areas and modalities of Franco-Bulgarian cooperation over the next three years. In addition to the Kozlodoui plant, it provides for continuation of cooperation agreements in the domain of power system management. Among other things, the agreement provides for creation of permanent structures for dialogue and for bilateral financing of high-priority nuclear safety improvements. This financing will come in addition to funds put at the Bulgarians' disposal by international agencies. Franco-Bulgarian cooperation, launched in 1991 with the help of European Community funding, has facilitated rehabilitation of the Kozlodoui 1 and 2 generating units, which started up again recently and are now "operating within acceptable safety parameters." NEK has benefited from constant organizational and management support since early 1993. The Kozlodoui plant generates 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours per year, accounting for all of Bulgaria's nuclear energy production and 33 percent of the country's electricity. Kozlodoui has six generating units equipped with Soviet pressurized-water (VVER) reactors; the first four of them had safety problems, according to international experts.
