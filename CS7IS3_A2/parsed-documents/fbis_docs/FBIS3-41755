As its employees reported to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, more than 60 tonnes of sausage meat intended for sale to Moscow residents was found infected with life-threatening salmonellosis. The meat, which was purchased abroad for a very low price, was shipped to the capital by a commercial firm. The vacuum-packaged sausage meat could have been sold through commercial booths as well as through stores by direct contract. In specialists' words, the lion's share of imported food products being sold in the capital by direct shipment is hazardous to Moscow residents' health. Veterinarians are most afraid of meat products from Spain because the plague is now raging in that country.
