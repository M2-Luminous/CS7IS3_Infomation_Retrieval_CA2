Most-Favored-Nation Status Given to China, But Not Russia"] [Text] After agonizing reflection, President Clinton has adopted a decision to extend China's most-favored-nation [MFN] status in trade. He also intends to give up the policy of linking trade with the state of human rights in China altogether. The president was subjected to powerful pressure from both sides. Human rights lobbyists demanded that Beijing be taught about civilized norms of behavior. The financial-industrial lobby warned of increased unemployment in the United States if multibillion Chinese orders were lost. Overcoming an inner divide, Bill Clinton nevertheless came to the conclusion that economic interests are more important than democratic principles. Most-favored-nation status releases trade between two countries from barriers in the form of duties and tariffs. In the Americans' estimation, refusal to extend the status (following the events on Tiananmen Square, a procedure for renewing this status is conducted every year) would entail irreparable damage to American companies' positions in the Chinese market. U.S.-PRC trade turnover last year was over 27 billion. Boeing, for example, obtained fantastic profits by selling China the most airplanes. American manufacturers are counting on being able to secure very major deals with China, whose import demand in the next five years is estimated at $400 billion. A year ago Bill Clinton made a commitment to secure progress from Beijing in terms of the observance of human rights. In the past few months the Chinese authorities have released a number of dissidents. But at the same time, as our Beijing correspondent Vladimir Skosyrev reports, new arrests have been made. The fate of Wei Jingsheng, the civil rights activist who is the most popular in the West, and who disappeared from Beijing two months ago, is unknown. American human rights activists are angry at the President's unprincipled attitude, pointing out that the Beijing leadership is doing nothing to initiate democratization. This subject is not fashionable in the major Washington offices at the moment. They are more concerned about how to use partnership with China to strengthen the U.S. position in Asia and worldwide. American diplomats are also counting on the hope that Beijing will help them cope with the unruly Kim Il-song, who is developing his own nuclear weapons. Meanwhile all the indications are that the developing cooperation between Moscow and Beijing is causing a certain amount of concern in Washington. Russian business is obviously no competition against American business in the Chinese market. However, the weapons trade and stepped-up contacts between the Chinese and Russian military are making the Americans nervous. Moscow is denied privileges that China has in trade with the United States. Russia has still not been granted most-favored-nation status.
