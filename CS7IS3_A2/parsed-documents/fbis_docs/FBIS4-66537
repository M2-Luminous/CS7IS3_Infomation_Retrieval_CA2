Having failed to achieve the desired results with the Sikh boys in forging an alliance with the Kashmiri militants under its K2 (Kashmir Khalistan) plan, so that their respective "freedom movements" could be guided to its logical conclusions Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI] of Pakistan with the assistance of Jehad Council is now trying its hands at Ahmadiya youth. [sentence as published] While one of the Ahmadiya boys Zubair Ahmed, reported to be an activist of Babbar Khalsa, was shot dead at Qadian in Gurdaspur district, the international headquarters of the community some time back a couple of others have been nabbed by security agencies in Srinagar and Delhi in recent weeks. The "arrests" have revealed that members of the Ahmadiya community were being recruited for dual purpose--reviving terrorism in Punjab and fomenting more trouble in Kashmir. Besides furthering the K2 ambition that got a battering in Punjab, the new recruitment is also aimed at bringing a bad name to the Ahmadiyas, a hated lot in Pakistan. Ahmadiyas are the followers of London-based religious chief Mirza Tahir Ahmad, the fourth generation of Khalifatul-Masih. Ahmadiyas have over the years been complaining of persecution in Pakistan where they are not treated as Muslims. As per the diktats of Islam there cannot be any Prophet after Prophet Mohammad, Muslims in Pakistan contend. Ahmadiyas, however, claim that they are true Muslims. They say that Mirza Tahir Ahmad is a "man of God", who "was born to bring comfort to fellow human beings." It is understood that olive branch being held out to Ahmadiya youth while exhorting them to take to the gun is that once they proved their loyalty to Islam by joining the "Jehad" they could claim parity to other Muslim sects. The brain behind this move is none other than Maj Gen-[Major General] designate Imtiaz, who is heading the Jehad Council. Interestingly, Brigadier Imtiaz was earlier heading the Kashmir cell of the ISI and was also the key functionary of the Joint Command Coordination Cell (JCC), later rechristened as the Jehad Council. The Major General-designate is currently being assisted by Col. Sadiq in Sialkot and Major Javed in Muzaffarabad. Recent interrogation reports have disclosed that one Ayaz Ahmad was the first boy from the Ahmadiya community to be trained in Pakistan occupied Kashmir by the ISI sleuths sometime last year. He was sent to the Valley later to establish contact with youngsters from his clan and motivate them into joining the struggle for liberation of Kashmiris from the "shackles of India". Ayaz escaped security dragnet twice in Kashmir and moved to the national capital where he took up the assignment of preparing fake passports and travel documents for ISI contacts and make their lodging arrangements in old Delhi area. These contacts started arriving in India by Samjhota Express after large number of them got killed while crossing the Line of Control (LOC) around November last year. Another Ahmadiya boy active in Punjab has been identified as Habib Ahmad. Habib is operating for Babbar Khasla, an organisation for which his late younger brother Zubair was working. He has been making frequent trips to Kashmir with a view to establish fresh contact with the militants in the Valley in a bid to provide a fresh lease of life to the K2 plan. Questioning of the arrested extremists have confirmed that Khalistani protagonists like Daljit Singh Bittoo of the Sikh Students Federation and Lakhbir Singh Rode (Khalistan Commando Force) are currently in Sialkot and were closely in touch with the Kashmiri militants. They are in the care of Col. Sadiq, who was earlier based in Multan. Another votary of Khalistan Wassan Singh Zaffarwal, as per latest reports, was spotted in Muzaffrabad recently. He is believed to be closely associated with Major Javed, one of the very few to have direct access to Jehad Council chief Imtiaz.
