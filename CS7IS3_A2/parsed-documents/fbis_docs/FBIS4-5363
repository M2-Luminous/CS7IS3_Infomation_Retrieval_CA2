In a general policy-makers' meeting, the DLP's current affairs analysis committee pointed out that the party and government should heed recent U.S. press reports and study measures to cope with developments in the nuclear matter. The party and government should note a report by the newsweekly TIME, which said North Korea already possesses one or two nuclear weapons, and a U.S. congressional report predicting a possible withdrawal of American forces from South Korea in return for North Korea abandoning its nuclear ambitions, the committee said.
