This change began in the late 1980's following the arrest of the main leaders. This version on the situation of trafficking in the Rio de Janeiro shantytowns -- with incidents during the past years -- is upheld by a "friend" of CV leaders who chose to remain anonymous. He said that the "media" has created an image of power that these groups never enjoyed. He added: "Moreover, most drug traffickers have always been independent." Another person who does not believe in the power of the CV and TC as organizations is Prosecutor Raphael Cesario, 55, who believes that this oversizing -- nourished by some policemen -- is designed to protect the true cocaine and weapons traffickers: The numbers game operators. Cesario says people "are stupid" if they believe the great traffickers "live in shantytowns surrounded by cockroaches and open sewers."
