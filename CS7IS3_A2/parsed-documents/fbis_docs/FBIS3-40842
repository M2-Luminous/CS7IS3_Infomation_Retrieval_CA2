Kaushik: "Congress' In-fighting in the Southern States"; quotation marks as published] [Text] A belligerent cat said to the other cat, "come fight." Yes, if we do not enact such a scene, we will soon lose the title of the victorious warrior. The Congress (I) in Karnataka is trying to take over control. In the neighboring Tamil Nadu, the cat called Jayalalitha is growling at Governor Channa Reddy. Meanwhile, Rajshekhar Reddy's meow' in Karnataka for Chief Minister Vijay Bhaskar could become dangerous once again. Narasimha Rao have cats on both sides. The prime minister was wrong if he thought that after the vidhan sabha election in northern India and resolution of Manmohan Singh's resignation affair, he would take a sigh of relief. The dissatisfaction with the Congress (I) is increasing with each passing day. If is Karnataka's turn today, Andhra Pradesh' tomorrow, and Tamil Nadu's the day after. The idealistic days of collaboration between idli and dosa [southern dishes] are gone. Even rasam [southern dessert] is becoming bitter now. This is a double jeopardy for the Congress president. There will be elections in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh during the next nine months. If this dissatisfaction increased more, it would be grievous for the party. The party leaders are worried that the party could be hurt badly in these elections whether they change the party leadership at state level or not. Even more important is the fact the Congress (I) had more control in southern states than in northern states during the last general elections, and that had helped it bag the prime minister's position. It was the first time since the independence that a southerner was appointed prime minister. It is true that there are still two more years for the next general elections. Still, it seems that the upcoming vidhan sabha elections will indicate what the Congress will have in 1996. In addition, there will be several vidhan sabha elections in 1995, starting those in Orissa. No doubt, the Congress (I) won the elections in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh in December 1993. Dissatisfaction is brewing within the Congress (I) here also, and the Congress (I) cannot lulled into complacency. Many party leaders are distressed because the central leadership has not been consistent in it dealing with Karnataka Congress (I). The Congress (I) came to power in 1990. There have been three chief ministers here since then. Virendra Patil was the first chief minister and Bangarappa showed up and raised the flag of dissatisfaction. When Bangarappa became the chief minister, Moily blew the bugle of rebellion. Now Moily is the chief minister and S.M. Krishna is leading the dissidents. It is ironic that despite its having the majority with 183 members out of the total of 224 members in the vidhan sabha, the Congress (I) has failed to establish a stable government. This has not happened because of an aggressive opposition, but because of factionalism within the party. The Congress (I) members accused the cabinet members of their own government more than the opposition members did. They did not worry even about the fact that they will have to face the voters during the next election. The detractors recently staged a dharna [sit-in] for three days and the vidhan sabha chairperson had to adjourn the session. Moily and Krishna came to blows right in front of Jagannath Misra, the high command supervisor. Commented he on this incident, "Until now I thought that Bihar's Congress members were undisciplined and there is anarchy there because of the state's culture. No one will ever believe that peace-loving Kannada people can present such a scene that could put even the Biharis to shame." Not only this, the problem that the party is facing in the vidhan sabha itself is attributed to the Congress (I) high command. It did not interfere in time when Bangarappa was starting the tirade against Virendra Patil or when Moily was spewing fire against Bangarappa or now when Krishna has risen against Moily. These leaders have followed this technique, and the central leadership had given them a long rope hoping that they would straighten out the situation themselves as time passes. This did not happen and they replaced one with the other. Last week, Mr. Narasimha Rao had said in Hyderabad, "There can be 15 Congressites who are qualified to become the chief minister, however, all 15 of them cannot be appointed to the one position." He strongly criticized internal conspiracies, but also felt that the main reason for dissatisfaction within the party was the overflowing egos of the leaders. If this is true, then it is surprising that he decided to keep himself out and let the fire of dissatisfaction rage. It is also strange that Moily has the prime minister's trust, but he still does not find himself in the same boat as did Bangarappa. It is true that Krishna is the leader of the dissidents. He was an associate of Moily in the cabinet and is making his life miserable since last May. They have drifted far apart from each other now. Not only this, Moily is not able to focus on his government tasks now. He has not been able to get even one important bill passed during this time. Some directives and legislative orders were issued but those have lapsed now. He could neither run even one day of the vidhan sabha session since September nor could he hold a meeting of the Pradesh Congress Committee. The high command did not accept resignations of the dissident cabinet members. It resulted in loyal members adopting the same attitude. This encouraged the weary Moily, however, the situation is still serious. The Karnataka Congress (I) has still been given the opportunity to deal with its inner strife on its own. This will not last long, however. It looks like Karnataka has a non-Congress government. The governor should also have submitted a report on constitutional crisis. He could have recommended to the president to establish presidential rule in the state. Whatever happens, one thing is certain: These incident will tarnish Congress' image. There were many incidents of fraud during Bangarappa's government, and nothing has been achieve during Moily's government. Former Chief Minister Bangarappa was expelled from the Congress (I) for six years, and he has formed a regional party. It is assumed that he may join Bahujan Samaj Party's Kanshi Ram. These two will try to make Karnataka another Uttar Pradesh. The Janata Dal can also join them. The Janata Dal can also try to stage a comeback on its own strength. Another power has been formed by the union of Ramakrishna Hegde and Devgauda. In this situation, the competition will be among the three groups in this state--the newly emerging power, the Congress, and the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]. The BJP received more than 30 percent votes in the last vidhan sabha election, and it has established its roots here. In Andhra Pradesh, T.N. Ramarao would like to avenge himself of the insulting defeat he suffered in 1989. The inner bickering within the Congress (I) is going on there also. The party discipline committee has served a show cause' notice to Rajshekhar Reddy, the legislator from Kudappa. The head of this committee is chief minister Vijay Bhaskar Reddy. The dissatisfaction there is not as severe as is in Karnataka. Rajshekhar is more tolerant than is Bangarappa. It is expected from Narasimha Rao that he establishes peace and cooperation in both states. No one is angry at Narasimha Rao in Tamil Nadu, however, the Congress (I) president will have to deal with another dissidence in the party there, and also take care of Chief Minister Jayalalitha who is active against the governor. There are 61 Congress (I) members in the vidhan sabha and they are divided into six factions. They also ignored the state Congress (I) president's directive to boycott the vidhan sabha session. As the prime minister, Narasimha Rao will have to recognize the chief minister's working style. The central government has to ignore the opposition government if it disagrees with the governor. It is clear that some disagreements between the chief minister and the governor have surfaced during recently. Jayalalitha has accused the governor of several things--he is keeping the files hanging, is building cases against some of her cabinet members, and is threatening to impose president's rule. It really is ridiculing history when the governor is removed from chancellorship. It was Channa Reddy who had straightened out N.T. Ramarao when he had appointed himself the chancellor of the Telagu University. It is possible that the central leadership may not interfere even after the state Congress has requested it. Some people think that since Jayalalitha had presented a silk shawl to Narasimha Rao during his recent visit to the state, the tension between the two has evaporated. Still, if the hold is loosened, there might be some danger. Now the question is: Will the Congress (I) high command be able to hold the key to keeping its control in southern India in its own hand or not? At present, the Congress (I) has become its own worst enemy. It was apparent during the recent vidhan sabha election in Rajasthan that the Congress members were cutting each other's neck. This all could be reenacted during the Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh vidhan sabha elections. The Congress (I) must have thought before the election, "the wave will rise in the North if not in the South." The party still believes now that if the party wave does not rise in the South in 1994, then it will rise in the North in 1996. However, it is also possible that the Congress (I) drowns sandwiched between the North and South.
