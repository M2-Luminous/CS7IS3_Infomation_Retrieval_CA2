Gqozo on the line from his residence in Bisho to tell us the reasons behind his decision, but unfortunately he can't be reached by telephone. Meanwhile, however, the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] has appointed two joint administrators in Ciskei. One of these administrators is South African Ambassador Pieter Goosen, who joins us now on the line from Ciskei. Good evening Mr. Goosen, and welcome to Newsline. [Goosen] Good evening. [Ascar] The obvious question to start off with: Do you think the situation in Ciskei was such that it warranted the brigadier stepping down? [Goosen] Brig. Gqozo must have decided that the situation warranted that request because this is not a takeover by the South African Government or the Transitional Executive Council of an existing administration. It is a request from Brig Gqozo to the South African Government and the Transitional Executive Council to place his administration with that of his own. [sentence as heard] [Ascar] What do you think would have happened had the brigadier not stepped down? [Goosen] It would be speculation. What we've had in Ciskei was a protest by the Ciskeian civil servants on matters affecting their conditions of service, primarily pension, but also matters concerning their conditions of employment, which I think is not only restricted to the Ciskeian civil servants but could be described as of a universal interest to civil servants throughout South Africa. [Ascar] Will you, as the TEC-appointed administrator, be able to address these concerns of civil servants? [Goosen] Well, we will certainly address them. Whether or not we will be able to effectively solve them is another matter, but we will certainly try to do exactly that. I am encouraged by a meeting which was held this afternoon by the task force on the public service, consisting of Minister Sam de Beer and Philip Dexter, who were appointed by the TEC, who met representatives of Ciskei today, and my impression is very positive that there is a willingness on the side of the Ciskeian civil servants to cooperate in rendering services to the citizens and people of Ciskei. [Ascar] Should the civil servants continue to strike, what action would be taken, or do you think it will affect the situation? [Goosen] I'm not aware. We discussed....[pauses] We were informed that there were certain groups of civil servants who intended striking or had intended striking some time ago, and we have obviously appealed to them to give the new administration a chance to look into their grievances, and my distinct impression there also is that they will do so. [Ascar] Mr. Goosen, there have been reports that the brigadier is indeed under house arrest. Are you able to clarify that situation at all? [Goosen] As far as I know, he is not under house arrest. There is not, as far as I can gather, a feeling of kicking anybody out or fighting with anybody. I think we all would like to see a smooth transition, including dealing with the presence of Brig. Gqozo. [Ascar] It's said that about 5,000 Ciskeians gathered at a stadium today and waited for Brig. Gqozo to address them. The brigadier did not arrive. Do you know of any reason why he did not arrive? [Goosen] Well, the obvious reason would be that the brigadier as from yesterday has stepped down, and when the new administration effectively took over as from this morning, he must have felt that there was nothing really he could tell them as he had relinquished all powers. [Ascar] Did the new administration, as you refer to it, address the 5,000 Ciskeians at the stadium? [Goosen] Not the administration, because at that time we were not formally appointed, but members of the TEC did address the civil servants. [Ascar] Would you say that the members of the TEC have been welcomed to Ciskei? [Goosen] I think their presence and the visit here has been a great success. [Ascar] And what lies ahead, what will the next step be? [Goosen] The next step will be for me and my coadministrator, Reverend Finka, to get together in the morning with a member or more of the TEC to formulate our plan of action. Certainly high on the agenda would be to address these grievances from the civil servants as they were put to us today. [Ascar] Mr. Goosen, we are hoping to have an interview with Rev. Finka on the line from Ciskei. We thank you for your participation. [Goosen] Thank you.
