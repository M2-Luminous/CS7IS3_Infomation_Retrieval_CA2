Regarding the security situation in Europe, he stated that refusal to accept the Baltic state as members in the Partnership for Peace program will mean a violation of the fundamental principle underpinning the initiative, which is an individual approach and an equal opportunity for all states. According to Jozef Moravcik, the granting of special status to Russia will not be favorable for the countries of Central Europe, and it will signify to a certain extent a return to the idea of the division of the sphere of interests between Russia and the countries of the European Union or NATO. He added that if Slovakia were to be accepted as a member of the North Atlantic Alliance then the special status of Russia will not matter to us at all.
