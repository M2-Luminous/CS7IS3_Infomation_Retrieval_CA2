He said the quota limit amounting to 180,000 tonnes a year imposed last August was no longer necessary following an accord by six major producers in Ottawa this week to cut output by about two million tonnes a year. The six are Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway, Russia and the United States. Annual world over-production of the metal is estimated at between 1.5 million and two million tonnes. Under the accord, Russia, which had been largely blamed for causing a glut on the market, agreed to cut aluminium output by 500,000 tonnes a year in 1994 and 1995. The spokesman said the EU quotas, mainly on Russia, had been imposed last August as a "temporary, necessary and urgent measure" to pressure the Russians into negotiating the production cut agreement. He said the EU was "cautiously optimistic" that the "memorandum of understanding," accepted in Ottawa but negotiated in Brussels in January, was starting to bite. It included a commitment by the signatories to help restructure the highly-polluting Russian aluminium industry. A meeting to re-assess the state of the aluminium market is scheduled here for April 21.
