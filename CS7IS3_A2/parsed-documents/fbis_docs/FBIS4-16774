The newspaper, as is clear from its name, is aimed at representatives of the nascent estate of Russian entrepreneurs and attempts to fulfill the active function of their enlightener. After issue No. 11 the founders and the editorial board got into financial difficulties (the newspaper does not receive state subsidies). The "debts" to subscribers are now being repaid. In the present issue the reader will be attracted, above all, to a double-page spread of previously unpublished photographs of N.S. Khrushchev from R.N. Adzhubey's personal archive with her own comments and reminiscences (pegged to Khrushchev's centenary), as well as a number of articles by well known political experts and economists devoted to the most painful problems of Russian society.
