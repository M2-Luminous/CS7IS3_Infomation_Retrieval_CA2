Otherwise the alternative is civil and political confrontation, unresolved socioeconomic problems, and hence national enmity. Conflicts and impoverishment, which are well known from the bitter examples of Chechnya, Karabakh, and Abkhazia. Farsighted politicians such as Tatarstan's president, Mintimer Shaymiyev, have also realized that talk of separatism and national independence helped them to come to power but not to remain at the helm, since you cannot feed the people or boost the economy on political ambition. It is customary to think that the bilateral treaty between Russia and Tatarstan concluded 15 February this year has brought stability to life in Tatarstan. However, I think that the treaty was the consequence of conscious necessity and not a panacea for separatism. The economy of Tatarstan, as you know, rests on three basic things -- automobile building, military-industrial complex enterprises, and the agrarian sector. It was not only First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets but also the Tatarstan leadership who stressed during Boris Yeltsin's trip that without Russian Government aid the republic would not have managed to refurbish the KamAZ plant, particularly after last year's fire in the engine plant. And the subsequent development of the automobile giant would have been in jeopardy without the 47 billion rubles [R] in credit given to KamAZ on the eve of the Russian president's arrival, without the enterprise's being exempted from profits and value-added tax until the end of the year, and without Russian Government guarantees in return for which the Japanese, inter alia, are giving KamAZ $400 million in credit. Need one say that the military-industrial complex plants undergoing conversion in Tatarstan would have long since closed down without financial injections from the federal budget. As for the agrarian sector, according to Fatikh Sibagatullin, the republic's agriculture minister, since the beginning of the year alone, R80 billion have been paid out of state coffers to meet the sector's requirements, and in June Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha promised another R35 billion. During a conversation with your ITAR-TASS commentator, Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev also acknowledged that the republic's agro-industrial complex cannot develop without budget subsidies. However, Mintimer Shaymiyev in his mild oriental manner persuaded Boris Yeltsin of the advisability of an "experiment," which boils down to Tatarstan implementing "reforms with a human face." Thus, low food prices are being retained in Tatarstan, and privatization is proceeding at a far more restrained pace than in other regions. At the same time Tatarstan is paying 5-6 percent of the 20 percent in taxes to the state treasury stipulated in the bilateral treaty, Vadim Pechenev, deputy head of the Russian President's Staff Administration for Work with the Territories, and Emil Pain, an expert in the head of state's staff, calculated. As a result, since the beginning of the year alone Tatarstan's debts to Russia have amounted to R43 billion (a figure cited by Boris Yeltsin in an interview with an ITAR-TASS commentator), while the total is around R2 trillion. In order not to hurt the Tatarstan leader's feelings too much, the Russian president told journalists that the republic's debts are the result of the universal problem of payment defaults and Mintimer Shaymiyev has himself promised to pay off the debts as soon as a financial solution emerges. But, needless to say, these were just statements for the press, and behind clsed doors the Tatar side won Boris Yeltsin's support for the funding of a bridge across the Kama and for the restoration of the Kazan Kremlin. There was also a request for money for the modernization of the airport in the republic's capital. "There are always requests for money despite the desire for independence," one high-ranking representative of the Russian delegation commented on the state of affairs. And Mintimer Shaymiyev was indeed far less keen to discuss with Boris Yeltsin the question of bringing Tatarstan's constitution into line with the new Russian Constitution. The point is that the republic is claiming an autonomous role as a subject of international relations. What is more, under its laws soldiers only perform their compulsory military service on Tatarstan's territory. All that is clearly at variance with the principles of a federal state. Thus, the bilateral treaty between Russia and Tatarstan on the demarcation of areas of jurisdiction has today made it possible to resolve the main problem -- the problem of political stabilization. "Tatarstan has been transformed from a region that was almost used to scare children into one of the calmest republics for people of different nationalities," Emil Pain said. Thus, in his view, a weight has been taken off the minds of both the almost 4 million Tatars living outside the republic and the Russians in Tatarstan who make up half the republic's population. However, Boris Yeltsin summed up the results of his trip by warning that the treaty should not become just a political declaration, just a "piece of paper." Concrete efforts are needed to implement it on both sides, which was why a bilateral commission, led on the Russian side by First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets and on the Tatarstan side by the republic's prime minister, Mukhammat Sabirov, was formed. The commission is to work out a mechanism for the operation of the treaty which presupposes the implementation of a whole series of federal programs and economic agreements. Subsequently the format of Russian-Tatarstan bilateral relations may be used to conclude similar treaties with other republics, krays, and oblasts in the Federation. Nevertheless, the center's first experience of settling relations with Tatarstan can rightly be described as the "golden key" that opens the doors to constructive ethnic and regional policy and the creation of a strong state capable of protecting citizens' interests.
