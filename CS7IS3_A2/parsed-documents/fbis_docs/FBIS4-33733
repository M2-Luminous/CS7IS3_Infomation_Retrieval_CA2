Rodriguez] I think that, as has been analyzed on previous occasions, in a society like ours, money hoarders must get their resources from state funds and state stores. Compared to a continental nation, there are no borders through which contraband could enter here. These money hoarders do not import anything from abroad, they have no contacts abroad, so they get everything here, they steal everything, they divert everything from state resources. I believe this is a very important issue because if we are trying to fully eradicate the problem and prevent it from ever occurring again, we must go to the root of the problem and investigate why these money hoarders emerge as tycoons, as we have seen in some recently published cases. [J. Rodriguez] Yes, Osvaldo. Evidently, the money hoarders, this phenomenon of ill-gotten wealth, as you said, does not come from abroad, from outside our country. As you said, we are an island; there are no private suppliers or warehouses here. There are joint enterprises, but these have obligations to the state rather than to individuals. [O. Rodriguez] These enterprises have very little stolen from them because they have the best control methods. [J. Rodriguez] Of course, because they do not want to lose revenue. [O. Rodriguez] Not only that, I believe they have very good, effective control methods, so very little pilferage takes place. [J. Rodriguez] Yes. Now what happens, this phenomenon that we face... [pauses] many times we see only the final result of the phenomenon. It is true we must counter the phenomenon of ill-gotten wealth, and it is true that a series of measures have already been implemented; but we must also investigate how this happens, what factors allow it, what phenomena in our society encourage or endorse this behavior and these actions. Osvaldo, it is also true that the great amount of resources they handle can come only from our own enterprises' warehouses. The country has a deficit of raw materials and products in every sector -- we know that even pins are scarce in our country -- so we cannot understand how reports on the first results of the operations indicate that certain products, which are stored and controlled by the state, end up in these persons' houses. [O. Rodriguez] Large amounts of fuel. [J. Rodriguez] Large amounts of fuel -- fuel we do not have, Comrade. [O. Rodriguez] Yes, of course. [J. Rodriguez] We do not have it and we are experiencing great problems in the energy sector. We find that these people have even stored oil. That oil comes from a base, from a.... [O. Rodriguez interrupting] A state-owned base. [J. Rodriguez] Certainly. A state-owned base. No one here gets a tank of oil by mail from another country. [O. Rodriguez] Certainly, certainly not. They also have soy, fodder, and cement. They have built large houses. How do you build a large house? You can build a large house only by stealing the materials. Everyone knows that. Those who have built houses on their own know how difficult it is to complete one. In normal times -- we are not talking about the crisis, we are talking about normal times when it was easier to get construction materials -- it takes many comrades three, four, or five years to build their houses. Sometimes it takes 10 years because it also depends on the financial resources available. Well, these people are capable of building three-story houses, eight-room houses, mansions in six months. These people have undoubtedly stolen a considerable part of those materials from the state. Of course, I do not think they have stolen all of the materials from the state. [J. Rodriguez] Obviously. [O. Rodriguez] These people also have other things -- for example, cars and motorcycles. [J. Rodriguez] Of course, of course. The main source of their riches, meaning the profitable thing -- that which allows a person to achieve a status that is 15 or 20 times higher than that of any citizen -- is essentially a result of the products stolen from the business sector due to the lack of controls. [O. Rodriguez] I think our reasoning about the lack of controls should be expounded upon so that we make our listeners aware of the individual participation that each one can have in this control. Whenever we think about control, we think about the enterprise's director or manager, and we forget about the warehouse employee, the driver, the receptionist, the clerk, everyone. Those who do not handle the resources at least get to see them. [J. Rodriguez] Of course. [O. Rodriguez] They see the merchandise; they see when it is removed; and they can remain alert to any developments. [J. Rodriguez] Look, Osvaldo, there is a specific example of this phenomenon about the lack of control. It was discussed even during the previous period of sessions at the National Assembly of the People's Government. It is one of the cardinal problems that must be tackled head-on. I am talking about the lack of discipline in bills and payments between enterprises. [O. Rodriguez] This helps to hide the pilfering. [J. Rodriguez] All the pilfering. For example, I am a supplier of detergent, and you are the dry cleaning enterprise -- this is a hypothetical example, unrelated to any particular case. I send you a monthly amount. All this has to be supported by documentation. This is why accounting was invented; it has no other purpose. The problem is to make people comply with the accounting system. At times, we ask ourselves: Why is this not followed? I am convinced there are people, managers, who have not attributed the proper importance to economic control, but there are also people who benefit from the lack of economic control, shoddy accounting, and a lack of strictness because otherwise, they would lose their supply line. We mention the lack of discipline in billing and payments. I send you the detergent and that has to be accounted for by documents that we both sign. You buy the detergent and I supply the detergent. If you never pay me through the bank or by documents for my shipment however, what guarantee do I have that the shipment made it to your enterprise? This is how much of the pilfering has been accomplished. This detergent is later sold to us on a street corner -- a little can of detergent costs I do not recall how much. [O. Rodriguez] Yes. If I did not pay for it, if it did not make it to my inventory, I do not have to answer for what I did not pay for. Yet, I received the product. [J. Rodriguez] There are two possibilities: Either you are a foolish businessman -- a luxury we cannot afford -- or you are aware of what you are doing and are promoting the lack of control, which benefits many individuals. This is also what happens. [O. Rodriguez] Yes. I think this example is very enlightening. I believe it reflects why the billing and payments problem continues. I believe this example, which is hypothetical, as you pointed out, takes place over and over at hundreds of enterprises. [J. Rodriguez] If it was a foreign company, they would make sure they were paid what they are owed because it affects their profits. However, since at times we separate the two -- this is for the state, not for me -- then we do not worry, and John Doe is expected to pay. [O. Rodriguez] Yes, I think your reasoning is logical, but I would like to slightly disagree with what you said at the end. You said that if there is a foreign company, they make sure they get their money. I believe there are many Cuban enterprises and state enterprises that get paid. We have mentioned negative examples here of foolish managers or managers who are voluntarily on the take. There are also many honest, good managers, however, who have other problems with their enterprises in achieving control. There are other reasons, such as structure, guidelines, excessive centralization of the decision-making process, and other things. There are places that observe control measures, however. In Cuba, we have places that are exemplary in terms of controls, not only in the civilian sector, but also in the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR]. The industrial enterprises of the FAR are a good example of controls. I believe that you have written in JUVENTUD REBELDE, and earlier in TRABAJADORES, about control and how there are places, warehouses etc., where even the smallest screw is controlled, and nothing gets lost. [J. Rodriguez] I believe this is, above all, a problem about political willingness. As you say, there are many enterprises that have always displayed a great zeal for strict controls. This also depends on the combined willingness of the people involved and their awareness of its importance. Before, we used to say: Yes, we must meet the plan at any cost. That was a standard cliche. At this juncture, however, in terms of the economic endeavor, and above all, because of the way we are pressured and affected by the national economic situation, we cannot afford to lose even a pin. This is one of the essential problems. We have conducted campaigns for trustworthiness in accounting, and plans to control rotations and essential resources. We have done all kinds of things. Many more things can be developed, however. But what is decisive is the human and political will to protect the resources. [O. Rodriguez] I believe that individual responsibility is needed even more, a commitment to watch over those resources. Returning to the initial subject: What has been seized from money hoarders demonstrates that there is a lack of control in many places. They have great amounts of spare parts, cars, fuel, and resources. Therefore, I believe those are the cracks in the state economy that permit the emergence of money hoarders, their wealth, and their continued abuse of the rest of the population.
