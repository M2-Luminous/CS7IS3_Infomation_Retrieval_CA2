The draft resolution is being submitted to the State Duma by President Boris Yeltsin. Mityukov pointed out that the draft resolution had not yet come to the State Duma and explained that, in accordance with Article 103 of the Russian Constitution, the declaration of an amnesty is the prerogatve of the State Duma. "Naturally, the president has the right to initiate an amnesty act, which means that he has the right to submit a draft resolution on this issue for the consideration of the parliament's chamber," he said. Mityukov described the mechanism of the discussion of the document by the State Duma: after the committee for legislation and the reform of the judicial-legal system gives its conclusion, the draft resolution will be submitted to the chamber's council and after that it will be discussed at a plenary session of the State Duma. "It is difficult to forecast the results of the examination of the draft resolution by the State Duma, but I think we cannot do without a discussion. Important events in the life of the country, such as the adoption of a new constitution and major anniversaries, have always been accompanied by the declaration of an amnesty. The question arises, however, what will be the limits of the amnesty," he said. In the opinion of Mityukov, "maximum caution should be displayed in such situations, especially taking into consideration the current crime situation in conditions of the weakened law and order in the country."
