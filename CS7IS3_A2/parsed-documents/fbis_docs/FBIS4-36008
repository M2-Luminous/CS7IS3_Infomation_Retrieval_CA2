Thirty Palestinian families were evacuated from the camp to Aden, the sources said, but it was not known whether anybody was killed or injured in the attack. Several Palestinian camps are situated in Yemen. The attack came as gun battles raged around Aden on Thursday despite a UN resolution Wednesday for a cease-fire in the civil war which broke out on May 5. At least six civilians were injured during northern air raids on Aden Thursday, a southern military source said.
