It seems that these organizations have serious disagreements. This is what we learned from one of the activists -- interviewed by our correspondents -- of the Hungarian National Front [Magyar Nemzeti Arcvonal, MNA], which has already been announced as a movement. Istvan Gyorkos, whose Nazi activities were noted by the authorities and who was sentenced by the court to suspended imprisonment for incitement against the community in 1993, is the "national commander" of the MNA. We interviewed the leader of the MNA's youth group in Budapest. His name is known to our editorial staff but he wished to preserve his anonomity in the interview in which he spoke about the extreme right-wing movements in Hungary, their connections and operation. On 21 November 1993, Istvan Gyorkos officially announced the Hungarian National Front Movement at the court. As they do not yet wish to function as a party, they do not need court registration for their operation. As opposed to the VNP led by Albert Szabo, the MNA considers itself to be the true Hungarist [Hungarian Nazi] movement. The Budapest party leader spoke about Gyorkos as the successor of former Arrow Cross leader Ferenc Szalasi with legal continuity. It is alleged that the former leader of the old Arrow Cross Party who was living in Australia instructed Gyorkos to organize and lead the new Hungarist movement. The MNA is a nationwide organization. As its activist stated, the Hungarist movement has regional leaders and it is led by a so-called leading core. "We do not have any membership, we only have supporters in all large cities of the country. We also have influence on a number of social organizations, for example the National Guard Federation [Nemzetor Szovetseg], the scout troops, and the National Federation of Political Prisoners [POFOSZ]," he said. The MNA is mainly supported by the younger and older skinheads and it already has a propaganda group. In Hungary, the skinhead group called Szalasi Guard is also based on Arrow Cross traditions. Its leader, just as our interviewee, was one of the accused in the court case of skinheads relating to the incident at Dobrentei square. Our interviewee knows them but he distances himself from them because, as he says, the Szalasi Guard is too aggressive and simple: "All they do is keep drawing arrow crosses on walls." His views on the VNP are even more bleak. He knows Albert Szabo, its leader, because after his return from Australia, Szabo got in touch with Gyorkos. He is supposed to have been instructed by the Australian Arrow Cross membership to help the MNA's party building work. However, instead, Szabo started to "build his own career on separate ways." Szabo deceives the unsuspecting young people, the skinheads. Istvan Gyorkos is accepted throughout the world but even the Australian Arrow Cross membership has distanced itself from Szabo, our interviewee claimed. According to our interviewee, Albert Szabo has often received cash from the editor of the NAPKELET journal. He also asked for financial help from Australia but he was refused. Gyorkos's group did not support him financially, although, according to the activist, it could have. The MNA receives money from the Australian Arrow Cross membership, from its wealthier members. In fact, they even have enterprises: They want to publish and sell books, bumper stickers, and T-shirts. They also have foreign connections. They know the American and West European neo-Nazis. "They think in terms of international national socialism, but the MNA first has to become strong in Hungary. We no longer distribute the militant national socialist bulletin called NEW ORDER which is made in the United States," our interviewee said. We also have links with extreme right-wingers in Russia, namely with the Pamyat radical nationalist organization. According to reports, at the meetings of the VNP, Szabo denied the Holocaust and the destruction of Jews in the Second World War. The MNA's youth leader also accepts this view and treats it as a historic fact. However, he does not deal with this issue because "Hungarian issues are more important for the MNA."
