Zhu Rongji's entourage included more than 60 senior officials from various ministries and commissions of the State Council. They were divided into six separate groups for investment projects, state-owned enterprises, rural fair markets, financial and taxation affairs, foreign trade, and banking affairs. They joined the departments and enterprises concerned in Jilin in considering and resolving various problems. Zhu Rongji himself focused attention on the grain issue and problems with the large state-owned enterprises. Jilin is China's largest commodity grain production base. On 10 June, the prices of various foodstuffs in all parts of China were raised. Zhu Rongji inquired in detail about the prices, storage, and circulation of grain in Jilin. In Gongzhuling City, which is located south of Changchun, Zhu Rongji inspected the state's grain reserve warehouses and visited local peasants and a rural fair market. When Zhu was told by local grain officials that they did not issue even one single IOU to peasants last year, Zhu Rongji said seriously: "IOUs have become a thing of the past and will never appear any more." When Zhu Rongji called on peasant Zhou Shuwen, the host said that he regretted having sold grain too early and not waiting until grain prices were raised. Zhu Rongji smiled and said: "This year, you can still sell grain at the good price. As long as you make efforts to produce more grain and also develop sidelines, you will certainly build up a family fortune." Zhou Shuwen's daughter gave the guests strawberries the family grew themselves. Zhu Rongji said wittily: "The girls here are prettier than those in Changchun." At the fair market, Zhu Rongji inquired about grain prices. When being told that grain prices had not increase but slightly decreased, Zhu Rongji was pleased. At a meeting, he said that without substantial agricultural development, there would be no substantial development in the economy as a whole, and the state must adopt macroeconomic measures to effectively stabilize the price of chemical fertilizer when raising the grain prices. On the afternoon of 17 June, Zhu Rongji met with officials of the relevant departments of Jilin Province, and expressed his opinion on various economic issues. When talking about the national economic situation, Zhu Rongji said: The situation is good, not just ordinarily good but very good, much better than that in the same period of last year. As for the situation in Jilin, Zhu said: The situation is good; there remains great potential; the momentum of develop will last; difficulties still exist; and there are also solutions. On the spot, the officials of the relevant ministries and commissions of the State Council solved 21 of the 22 issues the Jilin provincial authorities requested assistance with from the central authorities. The central authorities also decided to give a certain amount of financial subsidies to Jilin in order to help the province boost its economy. Zhu Rongji's team worked with high efficiency, and they often worked late into the night. They often did not eat at the same time, and those who finished the meal might leave first in order to continue their work. The time for social courtesy was reduced. At an evening show held in Changchun City, Zhu Rongji listened to famous Peking opera singer Zhang Chunqiu's recital, and applauded while listening to a local official's explanation of the story. The opera singer recognized Zhu Rongji and asked him to play the erhu. Zhu gladly and skillfully played the erhu to accompany the singing. The audience applauded, and the atmosphere was animate. Some senior provincial officials told this reporter that Zhu Rongji's inspection tour gave substantial assistance to the province in solving some major issues, and the concerted efforts made by the central and local authorities were inspiring. They said that Vice Premier Zhu's highly efficient style of work was impressive and also set a good example for us.
