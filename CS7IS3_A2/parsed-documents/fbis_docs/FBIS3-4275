The deadline for appeal is Tuesday. Around 0400 on 13 December 1993, a fire broke out at a four- storey warehouse owned by the Gaofu Textile Company Limited in the Fuzhou Mawei Economic and Technological Development Zone, killing 61 workers in the warehouse and injuring 15. It was a tragedy. After the incident the police investigated the cause of the fire and quickly discovered that it was set by a factory worker, Dong Yanglin, who has received a death sentence. On 27 January this year, the Fuzhou City People's Procuratorate charged Mai Tsu-wen, the legal representative of the Gaofu Company and its director and general manager, with serious negligence at the city intermediate people's court. It is understood that he was the first Taiwan businessman to be sentenced on the mainland following the promulgation and implementation of the "PRC Investment Law Protecting Foreign Businesses." It is on account of this that relevant authorities were very careful in verifying criminal evidence and handing down sentences, giving full consideration to the fact that the defendant had assisted actively in dealing with the aftermath of the fire, and had repented and regretted his crime.
