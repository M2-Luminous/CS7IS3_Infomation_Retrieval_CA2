Some 82 commercial banks of Russia participated in the survey. These include 22 small banks (with authorized fund of up to R200 million), or 27 percent of the total number of banks surveyed; 20 mid-size banks (with authorized fund from R201 to R500 million), or 24 percent; 14 large (with authorized fund from R501 million to R1 billion), or 17 percent; and 26 major banks (with authorized fund over R1 billion), or 32 percent of the total number of banks surveyed. It must be noted that the time frame for conduct of the survey coincided with publication of the decision of the Russian Federation Central Bank to increase, effective 1 March of this year, the minimum authorized capital for newly registered commercial banks from R100 million to R2 billion, and bring the authorized fund of banks to 5 million ECU prior to 1999. The new rules reflect an objective orientation on the part of the Central Bank to effect the establishment in Russia of fairly large and stable commercial institutions with a developed branch network. In spite of the fact that presently existing small banks are capable of operating relatively comfortably for another five years, the results of this survey show a definite pessimism on the part of the directors of small banks with respect to their future prospects. The assessment of changes in the many indices characterizing the activity of these banks up through the end of the current half-year period is worse than the actual situation that has taken shape for the second half of 1993. Overall Results Bank directors predict development of the situation in Russia's monetary and credit market in the first half of 1994 as follows: --two-thirds do not expect a worsening of the financial and economic situation in the banking system as a whole, including 35 percent who are hoping for an improvement; --60 percent report a possible strengthening of the financial and economic situation of their banks; --eight out of 10 respondents expect increased profits; --almost 90 percent predict an increase in their bank reserves; --about 75 percent of the bank directors do not intend to reduce the share of total volume of attracted capital that consists of interbank credits, and 44 percent expect this to increase; --virtually no bank intends to reduce its staff, and 65 percent are planning on augmenting this; --only one bank out of 10 expects an improvement in the financial and economic situation of its state enterprise clients; --only 20 percent of the banks propose to expand their deposit base by virtue of state enterprises; --68 percent of bank directors do not expect a deterioration in the financial and economic situation of commercial structures being provided services, and more than a third predict improvement here; --virtually no one is planning on reducing the affording of credits to commercial structures, and 82 percent of respondents expect this will be increased; --more than half state the possibility of expanded investments by commercial structures; --88 percent predict a growth in their number of clients among the populace; --90 percent of the directors intend to expand the deposit base of their banks through deposits by physical persons; --eight out of 10 intend to engage in short-term loan transactions, and only 16 percent--in long-term credits. The Financial and Economic Situation of Banks and the Banking System in General As in previous periods, the majority of respondents noted no deterioration of the financial and economic state of the banking system on the whole in the second half of 1993. Some 70 percent stated there was in fact an improvement, and only 10 percent--a deterioration in the situation at their banks. According to predictions, the favorable situation in their activity will be maintained in the first half of 1994 (60 percent and 9 percent, respectively). Directors of the major banks turned out to be more optimistic than the others. More than 75 percent reported an improvement, and less than 8 percent--a deterioration of the financial and economic situation of their banks in the second half of 1993. The most unfavorable situation was seen with respect to the small banks--63 percent and 14 percent of respondents, respectively. If we compare actual and predicted assessments, the latter were more pessimistic in the eyes of directors of all bank categories. In this regard, the smaller the banks, the less frequently their directors provided positive forecasts with respect to the current year. Thus, 81 percent of respondents from the major banks, 64 percent of those from the large banks, and 55 percent of those representing mid-size banks expected an improvement in the financial and economic state of their institutions (virtually no one predicted a deterioration). For the small banks, this index dropped to 37 percent (27 percent of the respondents expect a deterioration of the situation). Analysis shows the same kind of direct dependence linking the size of the banks with their expected profit. As far as the state of the banking system on the whole is concerned, the most pessimistic assessments of both the actual second half of 1993 and the predicted first half of 1994 were expressed by the directors of small banks. Respondents from the mid-size banks were the most optimistic here. Bank Clients and Their Financial and Economic Situation The survey showed that the trend towards active enlistment by banks of physical persons and commercial structures as clients was maintained in the second half of 1993. In both instances about 90 percent of all those surveyed indicated an expansion, and practically no one--a reduction in the numbers of clients in these categories. Respondents make a similar prediction with respect to the beginning of 1994. The overall reduction in bank clients comprising state enterprises continues. Respondents reported increases in the number of such enterprises as clients of their banks only half as often as they reported decreases (17 as opposed to 34 percent). Approximately the same distribution of assessments is expected for the first half of 1994. On the whole, respondents assessed positively the change in financial and economic state of their clients comprising physical persons. Over half believed this situation improved; only one out of 10--that it worsened. According to predictions, the corresponding figures for the first half of 1994 are 48 and 15 percent. The opinion of the bankers regarding the past and present state of commercial structures is entirely ambiguous--in both instances, each possible response (improved, worsened, did not change) was indicated by about a third of the respondents. For comparison purposes, we note that in the beginning of 1993 more than half the respondents believed the financial and economic situation of businessmen had become more favorable. The bank directors provided an appreciably worse assessment of the situation of state enterprises than they did during the previous period--60 percent note a deterioration and just 7 percent--an improvement in the second half of 1993. For the first half of 1994, 51 and 10 percent, respectively, of respondents predict such change. Attracted Capital As in the beginning of 1993, two-thirds of bankers reported an increase, and less than 10 percent--a decrease, in the deposits of commercial structures in the second half of 1993. In this regard, only just over half predict that such deposits will increase during the current period (4 percent predict a decrease). Directors of the mid-size banks reported an increase in the deposits of commercial structures significantly more frequently than the others--nine out of 10 so responded. Mid-size banks intend to a greater degree than the other categories to attract deposits of the nonstate sector of the economy in the first half of 1994. In the second half of 1993, banks appreciably intensified their activity, as compared with previous periods, with respect to expansion of their resource base by attracting capital of the populace. More than 90 percent of respondents noted an increase, and virtually no one--a reduction. A similarly high degree of activity by banks among the populace in general is predicted for the current half year as well. This trend, noted over the course of all surveys, shows that the absolute monopoly of Sberbank [Savings Bank] over deposits by the populace is gradually weakening. This is explained by the more flexible interest rate policy and broader range of services offered by commercial banks as compared with Sberbank. Judging from the survey results, a reduction was seen in the second half of 1993 in the share of banks increasing their attracted capital by virtue of the deposits of state enterprises. Some 37 percent of respondents indicated a reduction, and only one-fourth--an increase in such contributions. The large banks clearly led in this respect (65 and 21 percent of respondents, respectively). A further reduction of the deposits of state enterprises is expected in the first half of 1994. Here only the mid-size banks are "falling out" of this trend. In evaluating the past and current periods, more than a third of their directors note an increase, and only 20 percent--a reduction, in the contributions of these enterprises. A high dependence by surveyed banks on the market of interbank credits was observed over the course of all surveys. Approximately two-thirds of respondents regularly reported the expansion, and only about 15 percent--the reduction, of such credits. Mid-size bank respondents reported more frequently than other categories about increases and less frequently about decreases in the securing of interbank loans during the last half of 1993. For the current half year, however, it will apparently be the large and major banks that will be most active in the interbank credits market. The interest rates of commercial banks on deposits continued to rise during the second half of 1993. Nine out of 10 directors reported an increase (and one out of 10--no change). Predicting the situation for the first half of 1994, 80 percent of respondents indicated such an increase. The interest rates of small banks increased to a lesser degree than those of other bank categories. The rise in interest rates of the large and major banks will decelerate over the current half year, according to the survey. Credit Policy No significant changes took place in the second half of 1993 in the credit portfolio of commercial banks, and no changes are expected in the first half of 1994. As before, commercial structures remain the main borrowers from banks. About 87 percent of respondents reported an increase in loans afforded these structures over the past half-year period, and 82 percent expect an increase during the current period (in both instances virtually no one indicated a decrease). According to the survey data, major banks displayed the greatest activity in affording credits to commercial structures. None of these reduced, and 92 percent increased their extension of credits to these clients during the second half of 1993. During the first half of 1994, all the major banks are planning on increasing their credits. Major banks have also expanded and will continue to expand the amounts of hard currency afforded commercial structures to a greater degree than other categories of banks. Despite the worsening of the financial situation of state enterprises noted by respondents, banks have continued to increase the credits afforded these structures, though in smaller amounts. In the second half of 1993, less than half (44 percent) the respondents reported increases here, and almost 30 percent--decreases in loans allocated to the state sector. It is expected that during the first half of 1994, the number of respondents indicating increases will again go down (to 37 percent), and the number indicating decreases will remain at its prior level. In this regard, about 60 percent of banks did not lend hard currency to state enterprises. About 15 percent expanded, and 7 percent reduced their extension of hard currency credits during the second half of 1993. It is expected that the gap between these two indices will narrow during this half-year period, also that the major banks will be the most active bank category with respect to extending credits to state enterprises in the first half of 1994. This includes hard currency transactions as well. Commercial banks significantly augmented the scale on which they provide services to the populace during the second half of 1993, as compared with the previous period. Some 45 percent of respondents reported an increase here, and only 9 percent--a decrease in loans extended to physical persons. For the current half-year period, these figures are 40 and 11 percent, respectively. Mid-size banks, as well as the major banks, expanded their provision of credits to the populace to a greater extent than other bank categories. According to predictions, mid-size banks will maintain a high degree of activity during the current half year. The large banks will join them. Over the course of all the surveys, a stable 12 percent of respondents reported diminished extension of credits to other banks. The proportion of respondents noting an increase rose steadily, however. This percentage reached 27 percent during the past half year, and is expected to reach 32 percent during the current period. Not a single bank reduced its rates on credits extended during the second half of 1993, and 93 percent increased these rates. Judging from the responses of bank directors, a certain stabilization around the level of the second half of 1993 is expected for the current half year with respect to the cost of obtaining credit. Over 20 percent of the respondents so indicated. Apparently, the real reduction in the rate of inflation seen in recent months enables us even now to evaluate the current rates as favorable. The directors of small banks responded more frequently than those of other bank categories regarding the possibility of maintaining interest rates at their previous level. In addition to the above-mentioned factor, the fact that many small banks are greatly dependent upon their founders also exerts an influence on such expectations. Under the present circumstances they are often compelled to extend credits to their founders at lowered interest rates. Priorities and Main Orientations of Credit Policy During the second half of 1993, as before, short-term loans remained a priority in the structure of credits, almost 90 percent of the respondents reporting increases in this regard, and just 1 percent--reductions. The figures with respect to long-term credits were 16 and 34 percent, respectively, i.e., the scale of provision of investment credits diminished even more. In this regard, judging from the distribution of respondent replies, about 30 percent of the banks did not extend long-term credits at all. The intensity of expansion of short-term credits will apparently decrease somewhat during the current half year, while the reduction in extension of long-term credits will continue at approximately the same level. In this regard, whereas fewer than one-fourth of the banks maintained the level of such credits unchanged during the second half of 1993, this number is expected to be over 30 percent in the first half year of 1994, according to predictions. At the same time, the survey results show that a rather significant group of commercial banks operating in Russia's monetary and credit market do not foresee a reduction in long-term credits in the first half of 1994. These comprise primarily the small (46 percent) and large (50 percent) banks. Whereas most of the small, "pocket" banks will be engaged in this activity by virtue of pressure founders exert on them, the large banks can be viewed as potential credit institutions prepared to engage in the financing of investment projects. Clearly, the swiftest possible implementation of the main provisions affixed in the March decree of the Russian Government on financing and affording credits for capital construction in the Russian Federation could greatly minimize the risk to banks related to provision of long-term credits and could make this type of banking activity more attractive. The survey shows that banking structures intend to increase their financial support to all sectors of the Russian Federation economy during the first half of 1994. The scale on which this support will be provided varies greatly, however. In the opinion of the bankers, trade is the preferred sphere of future credit investments. Two-thirds of all respondents predict an increase, and only one out of every 10--a decrease in such investments. About half of the respondents expect growth in credits extended to industry and only 15 percent--a reduction. The situation with respect to financial support for construction is noticeably worse. One-third of the bankers intend to increase their issuance of loans to this sector of the economy during the current half year, while 17 percent intend to reduce it. Investments in the infrastructure will increase to a lesser extent than investments in other spheres. Large banks will expand their issuance of loans to the sphere of trade on a significantly larger scale than other bank categories, as stated by 86 percent of the large bank directors (none indicated any reduction in these loans). Credits afforded this sector of the economy by mid-size banks will increase more intensively than the sampling average. Large banks intend to increase their financial support to industry to a greater degree than the others. About 65 percent of their directors reported a growth in extension of industrial credits, and just 7 percent--a decrease. Small banks are expected to show a low degree of activity. However, small banks lead the way in affording loans to agriculture. Their directors predicted growth of these loans more often (one out of two), and diminution less (14 percent). The major banks also intend to increase credits to agriculture, while mid-size and large banks intend to reduce them. As far as the construction sphere is concerned, the following rule applies. The larger the bank, the greater the scale on which investments in it will increase. Mid-size banks intend to support the infrastructure most actively. Their directors reported possible increases significantly more frequently than others (40 percent), and reductions--less frequently (5 percent) in the issuance of loans to this sphere. It should be noted in conclusion that, on the whole, the predicted and actual assessments of bank credit policy in the second half of 1993 coincided. In this regard, bankers were somewhat more optimistic in predicting expansion of their clientele than in afterwards asserting the reality, while they were more pessimistic in assessing the future scale of expansion of attracted capital.
