Yeltsin's office in the Kremlin. Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin was there, as were Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Aleksiy II; M. Miytukov and V. Viktorov, deputy chairmen of the two chambers of parliament; Ye. Gaydar, leader of "Russia's Choice"; V. Zorkaltsev, representative of "Communists of Russia"; N. Vitruk, chief of the Constitutional Court; and representatives of trade unions and public organizations. The president assembled this audience in order to seek the entire spectrum of views on a very important idea he has been plugging of late -- the idea of civil peace and accord. "We are getting information from all over Russia," the president said, "that people support the proposal I put in my message to parliament on the signing of a document on civil peace and accord. Everyone must see that the time for confrontation is past. I am proposing an organized discussion today of the question of preparing such a document, on the basis of which it would be possible to unite all political forces in society for the sake of the main goal -- peace and tranquillity in Russia. In fact, irrespective of our different views, we are all patriots. This should not be a battlefield. If there are differences on other questions they must be resolved through negotiations. A short document of five pages or so could be prepared within two weeks, and then we could meet again to find the mechanism whereby as many participants as possible would sign it." If the main political forces were to sign the document (memorandum or charter?) on civil peace and accord, all potential instigators of social tensions would find their hands tied, since people would be unlikely to oppose the idea of social accord publicly. Whether it is possible or not is another matter. It is hard to imagine a binding rather than merely cosmetic document suiting parties of different ideological hues. While making pledges, they would inevitably start making demands as a condition of signing the document -- from the creation of a coalition government to the reestablishment of the USSR. Such is the spread of views at the moment.
