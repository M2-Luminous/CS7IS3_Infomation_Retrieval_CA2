In an interview with the BBC today, he said limited fighting is now taking place in Abyan and Lahij provinces between the government forces and what he termed as a group of the separatist forces. He said Scud missiles had been used against Sanaa and other cities in the north and that aircraft from the south had raided the capital Sanaa. He added that of the aircraft that had raided the capital and other cities ten were shot down. He said the decision to dismiss Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid was permitted by the constitution, which empowers the State Council to make such decisions.
