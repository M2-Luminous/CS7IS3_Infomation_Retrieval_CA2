Sources at the Central Electoral Commission told ITAR-TASS everything has been prepared. The ballot sheet includes names of two candidates -- that of North Ossetian Parliament Speaker Akhsarbek Galazov and Prime Minister Sergey Khetagurov; the rest four candidates quit the election campaign. According to information of the North Ossetian Humanitarian Research Institute's sociology service, Galazov has the highest rating. North Ossetian mass media circulated today a decree of the Russian president "on suspension of the state of emergency regime on part of territories of Northern Ossetia and Ingushetia." The decree says the Russian president has decided to suspend from midnight of January 16 through midnight of January 17, 1994, the validity of the state of emergency regime on part of Northern Ossetia and Ingushetia that has been prolonged by the Russian president's decree of November 30, 1993. A reason for this is the need to ensure citizens' right to vote during the elections of the North Ossetian president. Allied forces attached to the temporary administration on territories of the Mozdok, Prigorodnyy regions and adjoining areas of Northern Ossetia and the Malgobek and Nazran regions of Ingushetia shall take measures to protect citizens and ensure order in public places. The North Ossetian situation is relatively calm. Not a single inter-ethnic armed clash has been reported over the past 24 hours. The Russian peace-makers together with the local law-enforcement bodies fully control the situation in the security zone.
