White noted on Thurday evening that the purpose of this work was to render Ukrainian scientists broader scientific and financial support. In his opinion, ways should be sought to make up for the 17-19 megawatts that are still being generated by the Chernobyl atomic power plant and which account for about seven per cent of the total quantity of electricity generated in Ukraine. White also pins hopes on cooperation between the Ukrainian and American nuclear laboratories in ensuring the safety of nuclear power plants, on exchanges of experience in the use of alternative sources of electric power. "Today we are thinking how to stop the still working power units of the Chernobyl atomic power plant. The turning point came when the United States joined our effort to resolve Ukraine's power problems," Ukrainian Vice-Premier Valeriy Shmarov said during a meeting with White. Shmarov stressed that Ukrainian power engineering specialists had completed the needed calculations and were ready to hold consultations with American colleagues on the commissioning of new generating units at the Khmelnitsk and Rovno nuclear power plants by 1998 in order to be able to close down the Chernobyl plant without any losses. Ukraine also has some technologies for raising the effectiveness of coal combustion at thermal power plants, but lacks the necessary money to implement them. The question of the exchange of Ukrainian nuclear warheads for Russian nuclear fuel was also discussed during the meeting. White said that the 60 million U.S. dollars, earmarked to pay Ukraine for the nuclear weapons withdrawn to Russia, had already been remitted to the corresponding bank account. The sides have agreed to sign joint documents after the American experts complete their work and to set up an expert commission to draw up proposals for the thrifty use of electric power and the needed investments, and a document on cooperation in solving problems linked with the Chernobyl atomic power plant.
