Our correspondent Abel Abraao reports from Kuito: [Abraao] The Black Cockerel troops, in a vain attempt to storm and take over the city of Kuito before the Lusaka talks are concluded, once again shelled with heavy artillery all parts of the capital of Bie Province, at the same time launching a direct attack on the positions of government forces. A reliable and well informed source from the operation command in Bie today told our newsdesk that over the past few hours Jonas Savimbi's organization sent five container trucks with troops carrying long-, medium- and short-range weapons to the outskirts of Kuito. The same source added that over the past 62 hours the government forces killed 43 UNITA rebels and captured six AKM weapons, two PKM's, an N-79 weapon, and an assortment of ammunition and anti-tank mines. At present clashes are under way in the south of the city, with government forces inflicting heavy losses on Jonas Savimbi's UNITA. The Kuito residents did not go to the streets searching for food, wood and water this morning because UNITA soldiers have been shooting at everything and everyone. Thus, as well as civilians dying due to military activities, the number of people dying of famine is also growing, having reached alarming proportions. On the southern front the situation has been described as stationary, judging by the movements of the UNITA rebels all over the region. Colonel Antonio Alberto Manuel, spokesman for the Southern Military Front has said these movements are taking part in the north of Matala District, particularly in the Cuvelai, Cai and Mufa areas. Our correspondent reports from the Huila Provincial Station in Lubango: [Unidentified correspondent] The spokesman of the Military Southern Front says that there are three battalions of the rebel movement in Quilengues and two in Matala District. Questioned about whether the situation may become serious, Col. Antonio Alberto Manuel stressed that everything is serious for the soldiers and that everything is being done to contain this wave of movements. In operations mounted by government forces in response to UNITA attacks, a number of Jonas Savimbi's troops were killed, and an unspecified number of others were taken prisoner. The Ebo District in Cuanza Sul Province is still under the control of the government forces despite the enemy's attempts to take over the city. Operation Command Spokesman Colonel Calado says that UNITA lost 40 soldiers when trying to carry out yet another criminal action against defenseless civilians. Our correspondent reports from Cuanza Sul: [Correspondent] The Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] senior officer, who was speaking to our correspondent in Gabela, said that the dead include a lieutenant colonel who had been head of the Black Cockerel forces in the Eastern Front. He said violent and bloody clashes took place in the Canhembe, Bengo and Serra do Camuco areas, in which the government soldiers captured an assortment of war materiel, notably 13 RPG-7 weapons, eight AKM's and ammunition of several calibers. Colonel Calado concluded his interview with JORNAL DE ANGOLA by saying that government forces are totally in control of a radius 40 km from Ebo and continue with what he described as punitive attacks on Jonas Savimbi's soldiers in Waku Kungo, Quilenda and Ebo. In Malanje, government forces this morning repelled a group of UNITA soldiers whey they tried to infiltrate a position of government forces in Cambondo. Our correspondent Francisco Curingana reports from the area: [Curingana] On that occasion the rebels left on the ground 14 of their dead soldiers, 10 AK weapons, as well as an anti-tank missile, eight 81 mm mortar shells, and an unspecified number of infantry ammunition. Today, following an offensive by government forces, yet another eight Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] soldiers deserted their colleagues and turned themselves over to government forces with their weapons. Over the past two days, government forces put out of action 151 rebels and captured seven bandits, and 39 others turned themselves in with their weapons. FALA 90th and Intervention Battalions were totally defeated and withdrawn from the theater of war.
