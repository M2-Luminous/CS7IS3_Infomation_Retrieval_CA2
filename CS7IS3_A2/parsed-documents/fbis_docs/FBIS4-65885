How will relations between Italy and the United States change? [Martino] I do not think they will change, and I can assure you there will be no change in our essential options. As far as Italy's Atlantic policy is concerned, let me say right away that above all there will be continuity; in fact I am convinced that this policy can be carried forward with substantial opposition support. I have already had an opportunity to discus this with opposition representatives. [Flores D'Arcais] Two pressing problems: Bosnia and relations with the United Nations. What changes are there with respect to the past? [Martino] Let me give you a specific example right away: Bosnia. Our position is clear-cut: Italy must be involved in decisionmaking processes from the outset; we cannot accept our exclusion. For geographical and also military reasons, Italy has a substantial interest in Bosnia. [Flores D'Arcais] But we have been excluded from the "contact group" in the peace negotiations, which is comprised of the United States, Russia, Germany, France, and Britain. [Martino] Our exclusion is unacceptable. [Flores D'Arcais] Will you request admission to the "contact group"? [Martino] Yes, I will state clearly that our country must be a member. [Flores D'Arcais] Are you in favor of sending Italian Blue Helmets to Bosnia? [Martino] I am not opposed to it, on the following conditions: 1) that Italy take part in the decisionmaking process; 2) that it takes place as a UN initiative and under NATO military command; 3) that it genuinely be a peacekeeping operation; 4) that the aim of the operation be observance of an agreement accepted by all the sides involved and that the presence there be confined to the absolute minimum necessary. I say this because I believe that adventurism in foreign policy is very dangerous. [Flores D'Arcais] Croatian President Tudjman has reaffirmed his anxieties about border issues. [Martino] And I reaffirm our position: We are not raising any issues about borders; let them remain as they are. We have no intention of regarding treaties as mere pieces of paper. What we do have are some bilateral problems, and we will deal with them. [Flores D'Arcais] What are these problems? [Martino] For instance, property, the possibility of purchasing real estate, and freedom of movement. [Flores D'Arcais] Will you reconsider the Osimo Treaty? [Martino] The Treaty will be observed; in fact some parts of it have yet to be implemented. If there are any points that need to be reconsidered, we will deal with them. [Flores D'Arcais] When people accuse you of being "anti-Europeanist" you reply it is inconceivable that the son of Gaetano Martino could be opposed to European ideals. However, on some points of the Maastricht Treaty -- the single currency, for instance -- you disagree with the previous government's policies. So what is your vision of Europe? [Martino] It seems to me that the Community made the mistake that people often make when they buy a computer. First they buy one, then they decide what to do with it. I think that you must first think what you want to do and then choose the means, define a program. Recently in Europe we have wondered in an abstract fashion which are the best institutions, and only afterward decided what to do with them. [Flores D'Arcais] What would you like to do with the European "computer?" [Martino] I would proceed from an obvious observation. A political institution justifies its existence on the basis of objectives that cannot be achieved equally effectively at another level of government. We have a national government with national objectives. Then we have Europe, which has objectives that cannot be pursued at the national level. [Flores D'Arcais] What are these objectives? [Martino] They are few, but of huge importance. The first is political: We must have a European foreign policy. Not in order to return to the old concept of European civilization, but in order to grant Europe a common voice. Also, we need a joint European defense; we must not delude ourselves that the United States will always take care of defending us. Of course, there are also economic objectives. The first -- which has been almost completely achieved, and whose importance is underestimated -- is the single market, which is a European asset. We cannot allow national states the possibility of impeding the free exchange of goods. [Flores D'Arcais] Is this the point over which you differ most from the so-called "Eurobureaucrats?" [Martino] Keep in mind that this is not a purely economic thing and that economic liberalism alone will not guarantee peace. However, the maxim "where goods do not pass, armies pass" applies, and it is a fact that when countries communicate more, there are fewer conflicts. Let me quote to you something some one else said: "Trade unites, politics divides." [Flores D'Arcais] So are you opposed to any kind of intervention in the markets? [Martino] Yes, because if we grant Brussels the ability to intervene, we will then have various "milk wars," because prices must be determined by the market, not by a centralized bureaucracy at the European level. Let me give you an example: There is a Community directive that even states how large the pea in a whistle should be. [Flores D'Arcais] Is it true that you have in mind a Rome-London axis to set against the European policy of France and Germany? [Martino] No, that is not the right way to consider the matter. I believe in the enlargement of Europe because I think that, just as we can no longer talk about a West Germany, it no longer makes any sense to talk about a West Europe -- either politically or economically. [Flores D'Arcais] Would you open Europe's doors to the countries of the East, too? [Martino] Yes, if we want to give the countries of the East the chance of opening up their markets, this is necessary. If we close our doors to them, we will force them into an economic stagnation that could lead to serious political difficulties. [Flores D'Arcais] Does this include an opening up to Russia? [Martino] In the future, yes. Above all, we must not give any of those countries the impression that anything is being done against anyone else. Of course, the liberalization of the markets of the East could in some instances disadvantage some industrial groups to the benefit of others. However, until those countries produce as much as they can, they will never develop. [Flores D'Arcais] The next appointment is in Corfu. Will there be an Italian candidate for the presidency of the European Commission? [Martino] No, partly because after 10 years of French presidency, we do not think that another Mediterranean presidency is possible. There are several candidates... [Flores D'Arcais] Will you support [Leon] Brittan? [Martino] We have not yet decided; we are discussing it. What we want is a greater and more incisive Italian presence in the various international bodies. For instance, the elimination of the deputy chairmanship of the European Bank of Research and Development is a blow to countries such as Italy which are major shareholders in the Bank. [Flores D'Arcais] The Middle East: In the past Italy has been accused of having an excessively pro-Arab policy. [Martino] I hope that the present situation will lead to a genuine peace. We must not criminalize anyone, and we must also avoid condemning the Islamic world. [Flores D'Arcais] Will you be going to Israel? [Martino] Yes, soon, and I would also like to visit Cairo. [Flores D'Arcais] The presence of neo-fascist ministers worries Jerusalem in particular. [Martino] I have already explained that the National Alliance minister belongs to a center government. The new electoral rules led to the formation of an alliance that opposed a left-wing bloc. Many people abroad have understood this, too. The major criticisms come from countries where there is an internal problem -- France, Belgium, sometimes Germany. [Flores D'Arcais] Do you too accuse the press of having whipped up a campaign? [Martino] What I think is that since the European elections are about to take place on 12 June, the presence of National Alliance ministers is being manipulated for domestic political ends. Furthermore, while the French press has been very critical, in other countries such as Britain or even the United States -- with the exception of the NEW YORK TIMES -- things have been different. [Flores D'Arcais] What seems to worry the Americans more than this is the issue of the separation of powers. In other words, the Berlusconi problem. [Martino] As a liberal, I have always believed that the greatest danger comes from concentration of power. But I do not think there is a problem with [Prime Minister] Berlusconi. If he had wanted to enter politics for the sake of his own vested interests, he would not have submitted himself to so much public exposure. Now the slightest suspicion that a decision made within the government sphere could benefit his private interests would whip up both the press and the opposition. As an economist, I believe that everyone must behave in accordance with his own interests. It is in Berlusconi's interest to behave extremely carefully, not to give rise to any suspicions.
