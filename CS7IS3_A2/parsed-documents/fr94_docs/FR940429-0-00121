FR940429-0-00121 FR940429-0-00012 One commenter opined that it was critical that quantitative measures be consistent within and among all States and believed that the Student-Right-to-Know regulations, when published, will provide a uniform basis for calculating student graduation rates. The commenter recommended a coordinated study by the research community to develop acceptable percentages for the quantified standards and suggested that the implementation of those standards should be delayed for 12 to 18 months pending the results of that study. Several commenters urged the Secretary to remove the proposed references to the NOICC Master Crosswalk in the standard regarding the placement rate of an institution's graduates in occupations related to their educational program. The commenters believed that any method under which the NOICC Master Crosswalk could be used to code employment status would be extremely complex and likely to yield false precision at great cost. Discussion: The Secretary agrees that the Student-Right-to-Know methodology will provide a uniform basis for calculating student graduation rates, and encourages States to develop consistent methods for calculating student withdrawal rates, placement rates, and licensure examination pass rates to reduce burden on institutions. The Secretary acknowledges, however, that some States have developed robust student information systems, and does not intend to force those States to use specific methodologies for computing rates to measure student outcomes. Therefore, the Secretary disagrees with the commenters who suggest (1) that it is critical that all States adopt the same quantitative measures, or (2) a delay in implementing those measures is warranted. Finally, the Secretary disagrees that using the NOICC Master Crosswalk (Crosswalk) to code employment status would either be complex or costly. The Secretary intends that institutions and SPREs use the Crosswalk as it is currently used by State agencies_as a reference source and guide to evaluate the relationship between an educational program and a job. Changes: None. Standard in Proposed §667.21(a)(11) Governing Market, Job Availability, and Licensing Standards Comments: A few commenters suggested that the Secretary should expand this standard. The commenters were concerned that the standard does not specify the geographical scope of the labor market information to be provided, nor does it specify that average entry-level earnings should be provided. In addition, the commenters believed that the proposed provision regarding the disclosure of State licensing requirements should be more specific. According to the commenters, some of the most egregious title IV, HEA program abuses have involved institutions that, by enrolling a student in a program that required a State license, implied that the program met, and the student would meet, the State's licensing requirements when in fact the institution failed to provide adequate training to meet those requirements. The commenters suggested that the standard be revised to require an institution to describe in clear and specific terms how its educational program meets, and a student in the program would be able to meet, the relevant State licensing requirements. Discussion: The Secretary believes that a SPRE's standards in this area will only be acceptable if they are applied in a meaningful manner that meets the demands of these last commenters, but the criterion in these regulations does not have need to be revised to accomplish this purpose. With regard to the comments concerning the geographical scope of labor market information on the determination of entry-level earnings based on averages, the Secretary does not disagree that these might be relevant and valid considerations. The Secretary does not believe, however, that these regulations need to specify all the factors that contribute to making disclosures meaningful. Instead, these factors are best considered when a SPRE consults with the institutions in its State to develop the standard for applying this provision. Changes: None. Section 667.22␣Disapproval of State Review Standards Comments: A number of commenters opined that the NPRM would empower the Secretary to exercise control over an institution in a manner that is contrary to section 103(b) of the Department of Education's Organization Act (Pub. L. 98&hyph;88). The commenters believed that the Secretary would exercise control over the direction, supervision, or curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel or an institution through the evaluation of State review standards. According to the commenters, given the influence of States over institutions by virtue of State review standards, evaluation of those standards by the Secretary enables the Secretary to exercise the direction, supervision, and control over institutions that is prohibited by law. Discussion: The Secretary disagrees with the commenters. First, section 494C(d) of the HEA provides that the standards shall be subject to the Secretary's disapproval. Second, under the same statutory provision, these standards must be developed by the SPRE in consultation with institutions in the SPRE's State, and these regulations provide in §667.22(a) for the Secretary to take that consultation into consideration in determining whether the standards may be disapproved. The Secretary believes that institutional participation in the development of standards does not constitute interference in institutional areas protected by the Department of Education Organization Act. Changes: None. Comments: A few commenters writing in response to the request in the NPRM for additional criteria the Secretary should use to evaluate a State's review standards, suggested the following criteria: (1) An explanation by the State of the rationale for each standard;
