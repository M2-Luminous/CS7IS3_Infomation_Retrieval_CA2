The "gas separation process by pressure swing absorption" (PSA) developed at the Southwest China Institute of Chemical Industry (SCICI) is being used in 270 chemical and other enterprises throughout China. According to SCICI President Feng Xiaoting, these PSA installations consume 500 million kwh less electricity and 600,000 tons less coal a year than the conventional cooling process. That means an additional cut of one billion yuan in production cost for the enterprises. In 1985, SCICI won the state scientific progress prize for developing the process and industrializing its use. "Nationwide application of the process is being promoted by the state commission for science and technology," Feng said. "We concentrate on what is most urgently needed by the country and enterprises -- that's the secret of our success," he said, adding that since 1984, the institute has won national prizes for nine scientific accomplishments. Next in importance to psa is a method that reduces use of natural gas from 1,200 cubic meters for producing a ton of ammonia to 850. The method is specifically meant for synthetic ammonia plants with a production capacity of less than 50,000 tons a year. There are more than 1,000 such plants throughout China, including about 80 in Sichuan Province. "If the method is used in all Sichuan plants, that will save an annual average of 400 million cubic meters of gas and 250 million kwh of electricity," Feng said.
