The reason for this is a report published in the 1 Esfand [20 February] issue of HAMSHAHRI. According to this report, on Saturday 30 Bahman (19 February) at a meeting of deputy ministers and chiefs of the nation's administrative organizations Rafsanjani said among other things that "no change" will be made in the Islamic Republic's revised constitution, and, "I will work in another of the government's fortifications as a soldier of the revolution." On the other hand, some observers consider the comment about no change in the Constitution to be due to the fact that it is said that with the change in the Constitution Rafsanjani wants to eliminate from this law the provision that one person can serve only two consecutive terms as president of the republic, in order to be able to serve a third term in that office. However, in the Islamic Republic the procedure for revising or changing the Constitution has not been specified in legal terms. There is only the fact that in 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] Khomeyni appointed a council of his own choosing and arrangement to revise the Constitution, and the new Constitution is the result of that revision. The most important changes made in the first Constitution are separating the position of the leader of the revolution from that of source of emulation, and the other is eliminating the position of prime minister and designating the president of the republic as the government's highest executive officer. `We Have No Problem' Our sources in Iran write that if the Khamene'i-bazaar-clergy group had not tied Rafsanjani's hands by ousting his colleagues and close associates such as Mohsen Nurbakhsh, Mohammad Hashemi and others, Rafsanjani would probably have begun a battle to revise the Constitution and open the way for a third term of his presidency. However, with the repeated defeats Rafsanjani has suffered, the likelihood of his resignation is now much greater than the likelihood that he will open the way for a third term as president of the republic (see also our report under the headline "God Willing It Is a Cat" on page 12 of this issue. See also the column "Obvious and Between the Lines.") Rafsanjani, who has fallen into difficulties on all sides, spoke at those meetings of "relative resolution of problems" in the country and added that the gains under the First Five-Year Plan were "positive." He said: "Infrastructure problems such as water and electricity, shipping and transportation, raw materials, reconstruction of factories and the growth of employment have been relatively solved. Conditions are completely normal and we have no problem with the reconstruction of the country. We are producing more than ever. For example, cement production has grown 5 percent over last year. If there is stagnation, where is this cement going? Rafsanjani said the recent changes are "nonpolitical" and said the main reason for these changes was that "some officials" have remained in the same position since the beginning of the revolution.
