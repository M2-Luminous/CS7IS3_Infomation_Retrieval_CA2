The greatest factor in the rapid increase in the market price of foreign exchange over the last two weeks is the failure to open draft credit accounts for factories in the banking system and their turning to the open market. Other factors in the increase in the foreign exchange rate on the market were the approaching New Year's holidays, planning for travel, and turning to the market to procure foreign exchange, conversion of the cash of government factories, companies and institutions to foreign exchange for future purchases, and the creation of a psychological mood to make profits. The above was announced yesterday in an interview with RESALAT's parliamentary correspondent by Engineer Seyyed 'Alinaqi Khamushi, Majles deputy from Tehran and chief of the Iran Chamber of Commerce and Industries. He gave an expert analysis of the reasons and factors in the instability of the foreign exchange market in recent months, and he criticized and studied the Central Bank's policies in this regard. Reduced Foreign Exchange Revenues in the Current Year Eng. Khamushi began by discussing the roots of this problem. He said: In the First Five-Year Plan foreign exchange and revenue sources and expenses were taken into account, but in practice the expenses were as predicted while the revenues did not come in, and there was a scandalous deficit. The second question is the manner of using financial resources. If debts are studied it will be clear that 70 to 80 percent of them are short-term and about 20 percent are long-term, and this in itself has created escalating problems for the country. Continuing, he said: Another problem concerns the revenues anticipated from the sale of oil, which are far removed from reality. For example, in the current year government revenues from the sale of oil are about $3 to $4 billion less than anticipated, and this figure will create problems for the nation's economic ability. Excessive But Nonessential Imports Eng. Khamushi then discussed the problems caused by the procedures for allocating foreign exchange. He said: Based on legislation from the Third Majles, the Foreign Exchange Allocation Committee divided approved credits from the very beginning according to sectors. In order to spend the allocations approved for that year the government organizations consumed and imported in cases where it was not necessary without taking priorities into account. He also added: Most of this consumption and importing was in the commercial sector and in government imports of manufactured goods, most of which did not have priority. Currently many of these goods are gradually being put on the market, yet there has been absolutely no need for some time to import some of these goods. Continuing, the chief of the Chamber of Commerce discussed the way the banking system allocates foreign exchange. He said: Since the time the foreign exchange rate was allowed to float and the various banks were authorized to open credit accounts for goods, any kind of policy or priority in the country went off the boards, and some goods were imported in abundance into the country without taking necessities into account. This caused the amount of foreign exchange earned through oil exports to become imbalanced in relation to the nation's import needs and it brought us up against a shortage of foreign exchange. This caused the price of foreign exchange, which is like a commodity on the market, to increase. Injecting Foreign Exchange Into the Market Eng. Khamushi criticized the Central Bank's injection of foreign exchange into the market. He said: At the outset the Central Bank announced that there are no limitations of any kind on the insertion of floating foreign exchange into the market, without taking into account the extent of market struggle and demand. After some time they realized that no matter how much foreign exchange is injected into the market, there is still a struggle and that doing this is a mistake. He added: Before they imposed restrictions, they paid $5,000 to anyone with a passport, and it reached the point where this procedure brought the nation's foreign exchange consumption up to $70 million per week. This is one of those mistakes that were made without paying attention to the market pulse and its struggles. During the period when this procedure was in effect, about $1 billion was injected into the foreign exchange market, while at the same time the figures on opening credit accounts had fallen to less than $10,000 and we were faced with nonpayment. This can in reality be called a foreign exchange disaster and a banking system disaster that brought the country face-to-face with a problem. In the same regard the chief of the Chamber of Commerce added: When the banking system officials took notice and stopped this practice it was already too late and we were faced with the failure to make payments, and this failure to make payments has continued for a little over a year, is still going on, and has created a serious problem for the country. It has caused foreign banks to refuse to accept credit accounts because of the failure to make payments. To solve their problem, importers, most of which are factories, have resorted to importing without the transfer of foreign exchange. Doing this means disrupting supply and demand and the result of that is also to increase the price of foreign exchange. Continuing, Eng. Khamushi said: This measure was adopted about three months ago, and the practice continued for some time. Gradually the currency changers took over the work of the banks. Goods were paid to the money seller for the transfer of foreign exchange, and goods were imported. In negotiations with the Central Bank we brought the bank to the conclusion that this was a mistake and that the bank must do this work. Before the bank adopted this measure the price of the dollar at the bank was 1,750 rials[R] and it was R2,300 on the market. As soon as the bank agreed to do the work on drafts, the floating foreign exchange rate dropped from R2,300 to about R2,000 and this trend has continued for four months. Registration of Many Orders and the Central Bank's Decision The chief of the Chamber of Commerce then discussed a recent improper decision by the banking system. He said: A procedure that was adopted by the banking system was a mistake that was made due to the effects of excessive orders registered in the Ministry of Commerce. When the Central Bank was unable to open credit accounts for these orders, the bank suddenly decided to rescind them. It announced to the applicants that there was no ability to open credit accounts. As soon as the bank announced this decision and it became known in the market, all the applicants turned to the market and the market price of foreign exchange increased. Eng. Khamushi discussed the solution to the current foreign exchange market problems. He said: To reach an immediate result and stop this current trend, the banking system should continue the same system of drafts that was being used until three weeks ago. It should continue this until the day the opening of credit accounts returns to normal and the banks accept the opening of credit accounts. Priority should be given to factories, machinery, and raw materials until this huge volume of demand can be removed from the market and the bank can stop the rise in the price of foreign exchange. Agreement Between Iran and Germany Concerning Debts In conclusion, the chief of the Chamber of Commerce said: Just as was announced, negotiations were held with Germany concerning the suspension of debts and the movement towards normalization of relations with this country has begun. It is very likely that the negotiations with Japanese officials will also conclude by the end of the week. Negotiations will also be held in turn with other European countries. This will be a step towards returning the situation with opening credit accounts to normal. If the banking system does not increase the foreign exchange rate and if it does not create unwanted inflation, and if it works with drafts until the opening of credit accounts is normalized, then the foreign exchange rate on the free market will decrease, the difference between the bank's foreign exchange rate and that of the free market will be reduced, and the situation on the foreign exchange market will return to normal.
