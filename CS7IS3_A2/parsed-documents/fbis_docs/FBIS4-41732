Of all recruits who reported to medical boards, only 42 percent were pronounced fit for military service, which is slightly more than last year. More than 6,500 recruits did not report to call-up commissions. Approximately one-third of the number will have to pay fines of 118 lits ($30). Action will be brought against 30 persons, who may face up to 2 years in prison for evading military service. But the number of persons dodging military service decreased from 50 percent in 1993 to 38 percent this year. The level of education of recruits decreased, as well, with less than a half of this year's rookies being high school graduates.
