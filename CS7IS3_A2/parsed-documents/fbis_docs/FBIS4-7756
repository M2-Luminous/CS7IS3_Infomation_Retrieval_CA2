This happened on the basis of a decision by all 17 member states of this international institution, made at The Hague in the Netherlands last November and confirmed in Amsterdam on Wednesday [30 March]. A new organization to replace COCOM is to be set up in the very near future. It should no longer be open only to advanced Western countries but also to many states of Central and East Europe and the Third World. "The Czech Republic [CR] is interested in participating actively in the work of the COCOM successor organization," Bretislav Gregr, director of the Special Materials Department operating under the Licensing Administration of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the CR, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY yesterday. As Gregr went on to say, our government is already engaged in a number of negotiations in this matter. According to Gregr, the termination of COCOM's existence definitely does not mean the abolition of [export] control regimes in industrially advanced countries. It means only the abolition of the existing institutional structure of this organization. [passage omitted] The new organization, the establishment of which is foreseen for the beginning of next year, should associate all the member countries of the former COCOM, plus Austria, Ireland, New Zealand, and Switzerland. The admission of additional states, including Russia, China, the CR, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland, is planned in the future. According to representatives of the former COCOM, the speed of the integration of these states will depend on the progress of their domestic legislation, which must provide safeguards against advanced Western technologies being misused. In contrast to COCOM practices, one no longer counts on the drafting of lists with embargoed goods or banned export territories.
