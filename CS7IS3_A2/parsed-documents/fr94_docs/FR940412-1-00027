FR940412-1-00027 FR940412-1-00008 Currently, the navigable waters of the Great Lakes are divided into eight pilotage areas. United States registered pilots, along with their Canadian counterparts, provide pilotage services in areas 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Pilotage area 3 (the Welland Canal) is currently a wholly-Canadian area where only Canadian pilots provide services. Pilotage areas 2, 4, 6, and 8 are ``undesignated waters.'' Pilotage areas 1, 5, and 7 are ``designated waters.'' Pilots are required to direct navigation of vessels in designated waters. Pilots are required to be on board and available to direct navigation in undesignated waters. The seven U.S. pilotage areas are grouped together into three pilotage districts. District 1 consists of areas 1 and 2. District 2 consists of areas 4 and 5. District 3 consists of areas 6, 7, and 8. Each district has its own pilot association. Section 9305 of the Pilotage Act provides that the Secretary of Transportation, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State, may make agreements with the appropriate agency of Canada to prescribe joint or identical rates and charges. The latest Memorandum of Arrangements between Canada and the United States specifies that the Secretary of Transportation and the Minister of Transport will arrange for the establishment of regulations imposing identical rates. In the past, consultations resulted in nominally identical U.S. and Canadian rates. Not only are generally uniform rates required by the agreement with Canada, but they are also important from the standpoint of predictable costs for vessels requiring pilotage. However, there are differences in the cost bases and in the operating organizations of the U.S. and Canadian pilots, particularly with regard to pilot compensation. These differences need to be taken into account in reaching identical U.S. and Canadian rates. Therefore, the proposed methodology, like its predecessor, would not translate directly into new rates, but rather would form the basis for proposals to be negotiated with Canada. On December 7, 1988, the Department of Transportation published the Great Lakes Pilotage Study Final Report (1988 DOT Pilotage Study). The study revealed weaknesses in accounting for the expenses incurred by the pilot associations and the need to formally establish the factors used in establishing pilotage rates. On April 25, 1990, the Coast Guard published a final rule (55 FR 17580) establishing improved audit requirements and general guidelines and procedures to be followed in ratemaking (CGD 92&hyph;072). In May, 1990, the Inspector General (IG) for the Department of Transportation initiated an audit of Coast Guard oversight of Great Lakes pilotage. The final report of the audit (Audit of the U.S. Coast Guard's Oversight and Management of the Great Lakes Pilotage Program), detailing further issues affecting the basis for Great Lakes pilotage rates, was issued on December 14, 1990. On August 2, 1991, a DOT Task Force was formed to: (1) Develop an interim rate adjustment; and (2) establish a new pilotage ratemaking methodology. On June 5, 1992, an interim rate increase was published (CGD 89&hyph;104). This rate adjustment was designed to increase the revenue received by the pilots, pending development of a permanent rate methodology.

Discussion of Proposed Amendments This NPRM proposes a new methodology for setting pilotage rates on the Great Lakes. This NPRM would replace the general guidelines of the existing methodology, set forth in 46 CFR Part 404, with more detailed and specific steps to be followed when setting Great Lakes Pilotage rates. It would also make correlative changes to the accounting and reporting requirements set forth in 46 CFR part 403. This NPRM would not change the current Great Lakes pilotage rates and charges contained in 46 CFR 401.400&hyph;401.428. This NPRM proposes to change the methodology by which those rates would be determined during Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking proceedings.
