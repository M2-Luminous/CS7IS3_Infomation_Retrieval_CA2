The Wingti government is spending about $75,000 [Australian dollars] of Bougainville restoration program fund on setting up a government propaganda station, but as Sean Dorney reports, the station might be illegal. [Begin Dorney recording] Bougainvillians already have one government-funded radio station to listen to -- Radio North Solomons -- run by the National Broadcasting Commission, the NBC, which has an independent charter somewhat similar to that of the ABC. But Radio North Solomons, which had to abandon its original facilities in Kieta in central Bougainville in 1990 and operated out of Ribaul until shifting back to Buka Island about a year ago, is apparently too independent for the Wingti government. This new radio station, which is to be called Radio Bougainville, is going to be quite different to Radio North Solomons, according to the Papua New Guinea [PNG] Government's daily information release, BOUGAINVILLE TODAY. It says the new station's objectives will differ from the NBC's station in that it will enable the people to hear government news and, what it calls, awareness programs. The station is to be located at Loloho in central Bougainville -- not far from the areas of the island still under the control of the BRA, the Bougainville Revolutionary Army. The BRA station, Radio Free Bougainville, has been a severe irritant to the government for quite some time now. It broadcasts rebel propaganda -- much of it wildly exaggerated accounts of military encounters in which the BRA inevitably killed the PNG troops, while its own men miraculously escaped injury. However, it does have some good sources in areas nominally back under PNG Government control, and occasionally causes the PNG military some embarrassment by revealing details of proposed military operations and even military briefings. The idea of the government's station seems to be to counter that rebel propaganda. Needless to say, the NBC is not too happy about having a government-funded station competing with its Radio North Solomons, and the NBC chairman is in a position, at least on paper, to do something about it. Some years ago, the chairman, Sir (Okon Tololo), was given sole authority to approve or disapprove of any new radio station in PNG. He has not given his approval to the new government propaganda station. So, when it does go to air, unless the government provokes his present authority over such matters, the government's station won't be legal. [end recording]
