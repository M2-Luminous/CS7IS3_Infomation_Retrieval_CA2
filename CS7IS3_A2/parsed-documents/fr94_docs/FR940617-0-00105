(a) Criteria. After receipt of a completed initial registration and required fee, an Exemption Certificate and decal will be issued to the vessel owner. If the Certificate and decal are issued in 1989, a 1990 annual sticker for the decal will be automatically issued upon receipt of required report(s) for 1989. The Exemption Certificate will be renewed and an annual sticker issued after receipt of an updated registration, required fee and required report(s) covering all registered Category I and II fisheries. An interim report should be submitted with the renewal request if fishing under the current Exemption Certificate will not be completed by December 31. (b) Possession of Certificates and decals. (1) The decal and, after 1989, a current annual sticker must be attached to the vessel port side on the cabin or, in the absence of a cabin, port side forward on the hull, and must be free of obstruction and in good condition. A decal is not required for non-vessel fisheries. (2) The Exemption Certificate or valid copy must be on board the vessel while it is operating in a Category I or II fishery, or, in the case of non-vessel fisheries, the Certificate or valid copy must be in the possession of the person in charge of the fishing operation. The Certificate or valid copy must be made available upon request to any state or Federal enforcement agent authorized to enforce the Act or to any designated agent of the National Marine Fisheries Service. (c) Terms and conditions. (1) Certificates will expire at the end of the calendar year, except that Certificates issued in 1989 will expire at the end of 1990. After 1989, a current annual sticker is required for a decal to be valid. (2) Reports. (i) All Exemption Certificate holders must ensure that a daily log of fishing effort and incidental takes of marine mammals is accurately maintained on board the fishing vessel in such form as prescribed by the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries. Fishermen must complete an entry on the report/log form each day they fish. Marine mammal report/log forms require information on: The fishery, fishing effort, gear type and fish species involved; the marine mammal species (or description of the animal(s), if species is not known), number, date, and location of marine mammal incidental takes; type of interaction and any injury to the marine mammal; a description of any intentional takes (i.e., efforts to deter animals to protect gear, catch, or human life by non-lethal or lethal means); and any loss of fish or gear caused by marine mammals. With prior approval by the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service, alternate report/log forms, such as forms issued by individual states, Fishery Management Councils, or Indian Governments, which collect the same information required by the National Marine Fisheries Service, are acceptable. (ii) A current report/log must be kept on board and must be made available for inspection upon request by any state or Federal enforcement agent authorized to enforce the Act or any designated agent of the National Marine Fisheries Service. (iii) An annual report, consisting of a copy of the required log, must be submitted to the National Marine Fisheries Service no later than December 31 of each year covering all Categories I and II fisheries for which the Exemption Certificate holder is registered. This log shall include information for all Categories I and II fisheries for which each Exemption Certificate holder is registered, whether or not any marine mammals were taken. If a fishing vessel was not used in a Category I or Category II fishery during an exemption period for which it was registered, a report to that effect must be submitted. (3) Observer requirements. (i) If requested by the National Marine Fisheries Service, a Certificate holder engaged in a Category I fishery must take on board an observer to accompany the vessel on any or all fishing trips in a fishing season. (ii) After being notified by the National Marine Fisheries Service that the vessel is required to carry an observer, the Certificate holder must comply with the notification by providing the specified information within the specified time on scheduled or anticipated fishing trips to facilitate observer placement. (iii) The National Marine Fisheries Service may waive the observer requirement based on a finding that the facilities for housing the observer or for carrying out observer functions are so inadequate or unsafe that the health or safety of the observer or the safe operation of the vessel would be jeopardized.
