The rest will be used to buy vehicles. "Ms. (Xi Yuyi), PRC ambassador to Cambodia, met and discussed this matter with Ing Kiet, state secretary of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, on 21 June." This decision has disappointed the ministry which has written a letter to the Royal Government requesting that the total loan be maintained for the ministry as mentioned in the agreement signed between the two countries on 17 January 1994. "According to the agreement, the loan will be used for the four most important domains urgently needed by the ministry, that is, 862,200 dollars for buying two airplanes, $2.8 million for buying 190 large and small vehicles for transportation work, and $4,437,800 for repairing railroads." It is unknown why the Chinese side wants to divert its loan of $8.6 million to the Royal Government for repairing Mao Zedong road which has not been mentioned in the agreement. Some people have said that if China wants to repair this road, it should have asked for funds from the Chinese people and Government instead of using this loan which will only affect the important projects set in the agreement. "The source added that the $4.4 million budget set for the repair of railway system is very important because Cambodia's railroads are now very old and damaged." According to the project, this budget is set to repair the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville line and purchase steel and other materials to improve the railway system. If the Chinese side withdraws part of this fund, the repair of railway system will be forced to depend on other loans. In this case, in addition to being disappointing, the agreement which was signed by government representatives of the two countries will be meaningless.
