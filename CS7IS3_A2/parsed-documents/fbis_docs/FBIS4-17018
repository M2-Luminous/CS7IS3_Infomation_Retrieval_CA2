[Ganiyev] Superpowers should not take upon themselves to resolve all of the world's problems, PRC State Council Prime Minister Li Peng said yesterday at a meeting with the parliament and public of Uzbekistan. No matter what model of development that states take, they have equal rights in the world community. This was the main idea in his speech that was heard here as part of the program. The official Chinese delegation familiarized themselves with the operation of the Chkalov aviation production association in Tashkent this morning. I will remind you that besides buying Uzbekistan's traditional goods, China also purchases IL-76 transport aircraft here. The Republic has dozens of joint enterprises with China, the goods from, which are in great demand. When acquainting himself with what is a unique enterprise for this region, the head of the Chinese Government expressed the hope -- during his short interview especially for our program -- that the visit will open up new prospects for cooperation between China and Uzbekistan. [Karimov] The visit by the prime minister of the Chinese People's Republic is not only of political significance to us, but of economic significance as well. First and foremost, it is of economic importance because we have so many unused reserves when it comes to economic cooperation that it can be seen at a glance.
