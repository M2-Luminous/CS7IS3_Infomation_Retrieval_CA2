Bimolecular lipid membranes with incorporated fusion peptides are best suited for such study. The researchers here chose to use a synthetic polypeptide that consisted of 23 amino acid residues structurally similar to the Lassa arenavirus fusion peptide and that induced the fusion of small single-layer liposomes in a study of the features of the interaction of that peptide and bilayer lipid membranes consisting of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine; they demonstrated the ability of the peptide to form single cation-selective channels with varying conductance levels. The amplitude histogram of the single channels contained four components with average values of 4.5, 8.2, 10.1, and 12.4 pSi for bilayers in 0.1 M solutions of KCl, pH 7.4, at 21ï¿½C and peptide concentrations of 2 x 10[.sup]-9[/] M. Peak number and position was a function of peptide concentration in the aqueous solution, their ion composition, pH value, and temperature. The heterogeneity of levels of conductance was attributed to the presence of various aggregates of fusion peptide molecules. Figures 5, references 20: 2 Russian, 18 Western.
