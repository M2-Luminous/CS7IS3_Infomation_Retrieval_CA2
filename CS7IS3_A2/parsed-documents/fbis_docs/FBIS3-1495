They have been sent in after a series of armed bandit raids thought by the Cameroonian authorities to have been carried out by Chadian bandits. The attacks have inflamed the existing ethnic tensions between Kotokos and Arab Choas in the north and hundreds have been forced to flee the area. From Yaounde, William Wallace reports: [Begin Wallace recording] At least a thousand people have fled into neighboring Chad from the region of Logone and Chari in the last few days. Their flight, according to official sources in Kousseri, the main town in the region, has been caused by an unprecedented series of attacks on villages carried out by armed bandits. Three days ago, the Cameroon Army was called into the affected districts of (Blondjoua) and Makari, situated between the banks of Lake Chad and the River Logone, in order to restore order. But according to a local magistrate who I talked to this morning, the situation remains extremely tense. The fighting started 10 days ago when a group of armed bandits attacked the village of (Kounze Akou) situated on the River Logone which forms the border between Chad and Cameroon. A bullet fired by the bandits reached the Chadian village of (al-Deby) on the other side of the river, wounding one woman. Members of the Chadian Army based there crossed over in a pirogue [canoe] and, in an exchange of fire, killed four of the bandits who, according to some reports, were identified as Chadian rebels loyal to the now deceased dissident, Abass Koty. Of the remaining bandits, six Chadians were said to have been executed on the spot and a further 10 Cameroonians were arrested and taken to Chad. Following the incident, at least five more villages have come under attack, amongst them the Kotoko village of (Enganatia), which, according to the local prefect, was burned to the ground by bandits. When I asked the local prefect, Delphon Zono, if he could confirm reports that fighting had broken out between the long-term rivals, the Arabs and the Kotokos, he said that it was not impossible but that today the area had been too risky to enter and the exact motive of all the attacks was still unclear. He attributed the conflict to the massive presence of armed criminals from the area, many of them from Chad, but he did not exclude the possibility that the bandits were being aided by members of the local population. He said that those who have fled the area in panic are from both the Arab and Kotoko communities as well as Nigerians and Chadians resident in Cameroon. The exact numbers of dead and wounded following the attack have yet to be confirmed and according to local sources many of the bodies have still to be found and identified. [end recording]
