FR940725-0-00161 FR940725-0-00019 5. §1915.15␣Maintenance of Safe Conditions The principal substantive change to this section continues to reflect OSHA's general decision to expand the scope of Subpart B to cover all phases of shipyard employment as defined in the final rule. Operations covered by the previous requirements in §1915.15 were limited to ship repairing and shipbreaking. Under the previous rule, only employers engaged in ship repairing operations needed to comply with paragraph (a) of §1915.15 and only employers engaged in shipbreaking operations needed to comply with paragraph (b) of §1915.15. Because of the expansion of the scope of Subpart B to include all phases of shipyard employment, the final rule consolidates the requirements of §1915.15 paragraphs (a) and (b) into one section of requirements that apply to all phases of shipyard employment. OSHA raised two issues in the proposal that are related to the maintenance of safe conditions as regulated in this section. These issues concern the frequency of retesting and the need for testing to be accompanied by visual inspections. Proposed §§1915.13(b)(4) and 1915.15 addressed the requirement to conduct atmospheric tests frequently. Proposed §1915.13(b)(4) would have required that factors which influence the frequency of rechecking, such as air temperature and residue volatility, be considered when determining how often to retest, while proposed paragraphs (d) and (f) addressed the need for frequent atmospheric tests in order to maintain the initial working conditions in a tank. Neither OSHA's previous standard nor the proposal specified how frequently a tank should be rechecked. Public comment was solicited as to whether OSHA should specify the frequency of testing in the standard, and if so, what that frequency should be and why. OSHA also asked if the factors which influence the need to check tanks frequently should be addressed directly in the standard. Finally, the Agency sought comment on whether OSHA should change the term ``frequently'' to ``as often as necessary'' and if so, why. Many commenters addressed this issue and most favored requiring testing ``as often as necessary'' and setting forth the conditions that determine the actual frequency. For example, the U.S. Navy's Environmental Health Center (Ex. 6&hyph;31) commented, The term frequently is too vague and should be redefined to specify that re-testing should be dependent on alteration of specific atmospheric conditions, manipulation of valves, or opening of manholes at the work site. Shipbuilders Council of America, (Ex. 6&hyph;3) indicated that OSHA should not attempt to define ``frequently.'' SCA stated that, If an attempt is made to define the term ``frequently,'' it may create more problems than it would solve. Illustrative is defining ``frequently'' as every two hours. There may be some tanks that only need monitoring three times a shift instead of four. There are also some tanks that may require continuous monitoring. Using the terminology ``as often as necessary'' solves these problems, and allows the individuals monitoring the areas a little more discretion at utilizing their precious time wisely. NFPA (Ex. 6&hyph;10) agreed that requiring testing ``as often as necessary'' would be appropriate, The standard is intended to provide minimum requirements. Establishing a predetermined specified frequency for testing spaces through regulations may not allow for the various factors which may alter conditions *␣*␣* Once the initial entry has been authorized, retesting is necessary at some frequency to ensure that conditions are not changing thus endangering the safety of the workers in the space. The frequency of retesting must be determined by the individual conditions and circumstances of the work activity. Various factors as described in Appendix A to Subpart B may affect the initial conditions. Confined spaces need to be prepared on the basis of initial entry, subsequent work, and safe exit. Most often where accidents have resulted, there was either no testing for initial entry or no consideration of the change in conditions which might occur due to the work process or other factors. NFPA supports the concept *␣*␣* that frequency of follow-up testing be expressed in terms of ``as often as necessary''. On the other hand the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard recommended OSHA specify a 4 hour retesting minimum, although he also acknowledged that Marine Chemists and competent persons must exercise their judgment on frequency of testing. *␣*␣* A minimum frequency should be specified *␣*␣* In general spaces should be tested ``as often as necessary''. This phrasing implies that relevant factors have been considered and a judgment made about the need for retesting. Testing ``frequently'' does not imply any judgment. *␣*␣* This period should not exceed 4 hours for an occupied space or 24 hours for an unoccupied space. No person should be allowed to enter an unoccupied space unless it has been tested/retested within 4 hours. The 24 hour requirement is an extension of NFPA 306&hyph;1988 2&hyph;6.1 which states that ``Work authorized by the Certificate must commence within 24 hours unless otherwise noted on the Certificate.'' This should be extended to competent person testing as well as Marine Chemist testing, especially since the role of the competent person is one of monitoring conditions of spaces. Even if a space is unoccupied it represents a hazard from explosion or unauthorized entry. The 4 hour requirement for occupied spaces is needed to ensure that spaces are not entered unless the on-duty competent person has first hand knowledge that the conditions of a tank have remained unchanged from those of initial testing and entry authorization. NIOSH recommended OSHA set the frequency of testing, but rather than specifying as a minimum time interval, they listed the factors that should be considered in determining how often an atmosphere must be tested (Ex. 6&hyph;14), NIOSH suggests that OSHA specify the frequency of atmospheric testing. The frequency of atmospheric testing depends upon a number of factors. These factors should be listed in the standard (such as nature of hazard, temperature within tank, type of work in tank, elapsed time, unattended tanks, work breaks, residue volatility, etc.). Testing intervals should be established according to these factors as determined by the following NIOSH-recommended hierarchy: (1) Marine Chemist, (2) Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) or Certified Safety Professional (CSP), or (3) Coast Guard Authorized Person [§1915.11]. Furthermore, NIOSH suggests that `competent person' [§1915.7], as defined by OSHA, is not trained sufficiently to determine testing frequency. At a minimum, NIOSH suggests that testing be done at `time of entry' and continuously or periodically during occupancy, particularly if conditions are changing. Bay Shipbuilding (Ex. 6&hyph;15) commented, Frequency of testing must be based on the area conditions and complexity of the hazard. Ventilation capability is also a major factor in hazard control. Once an area has been made safe, and air quality can be maintained with natural or mechanical ventilation, there are no further steps needed unless the condition is modified by some events such as a spill, leak, or injection of an environmentally altering element. Otherwise, the only thing to do is to continue monitoring (which is cost prohibitive); or base the checks on the HMIS scale for health, flammability, and reactivity of the product. The higher the HMIS rating, the more frequent the checks. The American Waterways Shipyard Conference (AWSC) (Ex. 6&hyph;23) commented, The requirement to frequently test the confined spaces is already defined by the nature of the work, i.e., the changing of work shifts, etc. There is no need to further define the term in the regulation. Independent Testing and Consultation (Ex. 6&hyph;24) commented, There is no way to define all of the parameters which will decide how often a tank or compartment should be tested. The Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person can indicate on the certificate, how often the space is to be tested. The wording in 1915.15 (d) and (f) should therefore be changed to `as frequently as necessary to ensure. *␣*␣* Bath Iron Works Corporation (Ex. 6&hyph;28) commented, No easy definition exists for all circumstances requiring additional `frequent' testing. This is a situation which requires the judgment of the Marine Chemist, based on his knowledge of the last three cargoes, their properties and the effectiveness of the cleaning procedures used. Some cargoes, such as alcohols, light fuel oils, etc., leave no harmful residues after adequate tank cleaning and ventilation. Under such situations, testing every 24 hours is adequate. Other cargoes leave residues, or, particular tank coatings partially absorb cargo residues, only to release vapors slowly over time, regardless of how the cleaning operations were conducted. These conditions require atmospheric testing more frequently. Long term experience at Bath Iron Works dealing with Diesel Fuel Marine (DFM), JP&hyph;5, and several preservative coatings have shown no changes in atmospheric conditions from one 24 hour period to another. In these cases, the Coast Guard guidelines of testing once each 24 hours is adequate.
