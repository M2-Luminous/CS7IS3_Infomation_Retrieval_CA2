The improvement in the financial situation contributed to the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. Increase in the money release slowed down. In the first half of the year, because of the overly rapid increase in investment, large amounts of money were released continually. In the first half of the year the net money release amounted to 52.8 billion yuan, representing an increase of 55 billion yuan over the same period last year. With the implementation of macroeconomic regulation and control measures, the situation of excessive money release improved on a monthly basis after the beginning of July. In July-September the cumulative net money release amounted to 21 billion yuan, representing a decrease of 19.2 billion yuan from the same period last year. The main reason was the increase in the credit and commodity recovery capacities. Consumption funds increased in a calm manner. Urban and rural savings deposits increased significantly, thereby providing stable sources of funds for banks' support of economic development. In January-September the net growth in urban and rural savings deposits amounted to 232.1 billion yuan, representing an increase which was 57.6 billion yuan larger than the same period last year. In this respect, the third quarter saw an increase of 107.7 billion yuan, an increase which was 66.6 billion yuan larger than the same period last year. The main reason was that the central bank substantially raised the interest rate for deposits twice, thereby arousing residents' enthusiasm for savings; in this way residents' savings deposits which had declined for a time grew again, thereby stabilizing banks' savings sources. State banks increased their credit supply, thereby forcefully helping satisfy the key needs of the development of the national economy. In the first half of this year bank lending of various types increased by only 99.3 billion yuan, representing an increase which was 36.3 billion yuan smaller than the same period last year. In the third quarter, after the banks adopted measures "to eliminate irregular practices and open legitimate channels," the People's Bank of China issued 100.8 billion yuan in loans to specialized banks; over the same period state banks' loans of various types to enterprises grew by 100.3 billion yuan, representing an increase which was nearly 30 billion yuan larger than the third quarter of last year. Those funds were mainly used to satisfy the funding needs of the state's key construction projects and produced good results. Specialized banks' disbursement funds grew rapidly, thereby alleviating payment difficulties. After the beginning of July, the situation where specialized banks' disbursement fund rate was lower the legally required disbursement fund rate was changed through cleaning up inter-bank loans in violation of regulations and vigorous efforts to secure deposits. By the end of September specialized banks' disbursement fund rate had exceeded 7 percent, and banks at various levels had increased their payment capacity. The state's foreign exchange reserves increased. At the end of September the state's foreign exchange reserves totalled $19.62 billion, representing an increase which was $3.617 billion smaller than the same period last year; but the rate of decline was lower. The amount of foreign exchange reserves represented an increase of $177 million over the end of last year, thereby changing the situation of net decline in the previous several months. The RMB exchange rates were stable and kept at a basically proper level, thereby providing a good environment for foreign trade. Since the beginning of the third quarter our country's macro financial control has produced results, and financial operations are getting normal; the financial disorder which existed for a time has been resolved. The trends toward overly rapid increases in investment and prices have been suppressed. In carrying out macro financial control in the period to come, we must both consolidate the results achieved and create conditions for the various important reforms to be carried out by the state next year, so as to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy.
