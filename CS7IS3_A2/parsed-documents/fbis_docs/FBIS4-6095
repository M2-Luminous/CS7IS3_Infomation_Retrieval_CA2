The defections bring to 11 the number of lower house members who have quit the LDP in four days. Those who defected from the LDP on Monday are Koji Kakizawa, Seiichi Ota, Shokei Arai, Taku Yamamoto and Shizuo Sato. The five told a news conference they plan to set up a new parliamentary group soon with two independent lower house members. Riki Nakamura, an independent, dissolved a parliamentary affiliation with the LDP to join the group and another independent, Sanae Takaichi, is also planning to join them, they said. "We decided to quit to accelerate the current development by our action," Kakizawa said at the press conference. Kakizawa and the other four who quit the LDP on Monday have backed former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe as a replacement for outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced on April 8 he will resign over a financial scandal and a Diet stalemate. Kakizawa said the seven will call on other LDP lawmakers to join their group so as to realize their policies together. Five other LDP lower house members who quit the party Friday, formed a new party Monday called New Party Mirai (Future). Another LDP lower house member, Kenji Kosaka, also left the party Monday, saying he will join Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key party in the coalition.
