Meanwhile Jordan announced the arrest of the members of six "Afghan Arabs" cells in the context of its investigations to uncover those who carried out the bombing operations in Amman and to determine the extent of their link with al-Ma'ayitah's assassination. Sources have said that members of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council who are said to be responsible for al-Ma'ayitah's assassination, are living normally in Jordan. Libya has denied any link with al-Ma'ayitah's assassination as reported in Amman. However, reports that Libya was behind the assassination have started a crisis in Jordanian-Libyan relations. [passage omitted] Reports in Amman linked Libya's support of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council to the extent of its involvement in al-Ma'ayitah's assassination, especially as the Jordanian monarch, King Husayn, pointed to the role of an Arab capital in the incident. But Libya hastened to deny any link with the incident, stressing its good relations with Jordan. A Libyan source said that these reports are designed to harm these relations. Some observers believe that Syria is currently trying to resolve matters between Jordan and Libya. The Syrians believe that any Jordanian pressure on Tripoli in this connection would weaken the latter's position in the worsening Lockerbie crisis. At any rate, it seems that Jordan is trying to identify the clues to this issue outside Jordanian territory, as the information available has not indicated that Jordanian security services have taken any actions against members of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council or made any arrests in this connection. It seems that it is seeking to get hold of all clues in the light of the investigations with those suspected of carrying out the assassination operation in question in Lebanon, and to determine whether they have any link with members of this organization in Jordan.
