The discussions focused on the security situation in the country and the results of the security measures that have been taken in all Lebanese areas in the wake of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre in Zuq Mikha'il, the attempt to bomb the French cultural center in Ghadir, and the wave of rumors that accompanied these developments.

We now hear the resolutions passed at the meeting read by Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Fadl Dahir, secretary of the Internal Security Council: [Begin Dahir recording] His Excellency Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri chaired a security meeting at his palace at noon today. Attending the meeting were the defense minister, interior minister, the public prosecutor, the legal investigator into the Sayyidat al-Najat Church bombing, the commanders of the security agencies, and the envoy of the Syrian security and intelligence department operating in Lebanon. During the meeting, the conferees reviewed the security situation in the country, the results of security investigations, and the accompanying sweeps and detentions. The meeting addressed the following topics: 1. The meeting reviewed the results of the investigations by the security agencies of the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church and the ensuing sweeps and detentions that targeted suspects and other defendants in bombings, according to legal arrest warrants. These sweeps covered most Lebanese areas and camps without discrimination from Sidon to 'Akkar. The sweeps, which were carried out by all Lebanese security agencies and occasionally backed by units of the Syrian Arab forces, resulted in the arrest of 127 people. 2. The conferees stressed the Lebanese people's right to resist the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon and western al-Biqa', noting the importance of the resistance's heroic acts that undermined the Israeli enemy army and its agents in the border strip. The conferees then discussed the ramifications of the appearance of gunmen in Ba'labakk on Friday [11 March], which is considered to be a flagrant violation of the law. They also reviewed the measures taken by the military public prosecution office against those who broke the law, particularly since the negative effects of these violations overshadowed the measures of the security agencies tasked with investigating the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church. 3. His Excellency the prime minister stressed the need for the security agencies to continue their interrogations and security measures until the networks of terrorism and sabotage, which threaten the country's security, are uncovered, particularly since the Lebanese judiciary supervises all these measures. Al-Hariri pointed out that the general amnesty law pardons former criminals but does not prevent the security agencies from investigating previous or subsequent crimes to preserve the country's security. The public attorney said that the general amnesty law was based on the principle that amnesty can be rescinded if a person commits new crimes similar to previous ones. Accordingly, all these criminals remain under watch and can be hunted down for all crimes, including the pardoned ones. At the end of the meeting, al-Hariri expressed his satisfaction with the work of the security agencies and urged them to continue their work and be strict in their interrogations and measures against all violators and criminals, no matter to which party they belong.
