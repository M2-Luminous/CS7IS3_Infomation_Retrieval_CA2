When answering questions privately put to him during a break in the State Duma he said he did not exclude that Russia might resort to the veto if the Security Council voted on the issue of bombardment. According to Gaydar, "there always exists a temptation to interfere into a conflict and to display decisiveness. However, this often turns out to be a compensation for an inability to see the conflict's roots and to settle it, a compensation for one's own political helplessness." "I think that the international community must not take this path. Radical unilateral decisions have never brought relief to anyone," Gaydar emphasized.
