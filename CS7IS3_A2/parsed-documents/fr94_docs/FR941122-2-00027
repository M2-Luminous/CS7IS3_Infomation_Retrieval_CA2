FR941122-2-00027 FR941122-2-00017 [Docket No. TM94&hyph;4&hyph;34&hyph;002] Florida Gas Transmission Co.; Tariff Filing November 16, 1994. Take notice that on November 14, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) tendered for filing to become part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheet: Substitute Eighth Revised Sheet No. 8A FGT states that on May 2, 1994, FGT filed in Docket No. TM94&hyph;4&hyph;34&hyph;000 (May 2 Filing) to suspend its Annual Unit Take-or-Pay Surcharge (TOP Surcharge) effective June 1, 1994. This filing was subject to a supplemental filing to be made by FGT to reflect actual balances pertaining to its collection of the take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down costs (Southern Fixed Charges) billed by Southern Natural Gas Company (``Southern'') and to make any related tariff changes required. On May 18, 1994, the Commission issued an order (May 18 Order) accepting FGT's May 2 filing subject to the supplemental filing by FGT. On September 12, 1994, FGT made the supplemental filing (September 12 Filing) in compliance with the Commission's May 18 Order which detailed the Southern Fixed Charge account balances by customer, proposed certain changes to Section 25 of FGT's General Terms and Conditions (GTC), and reinstated the TOP Surcharge to recover the outstanding Southern Fixed Charge account balances owed FGT by certain customers. Several parties protested FGT's September 12 filing 1 (protesting parties). On October 3, 1994, FGT filed an answer (October 3 Answer) to the protests in order to clarify certain misunderstandings and misrepresentations contained in the protests. 1 Florida Power & Light Company; Florida Power Corporation; Florida Cities; Industrial Gas Users of Florida (IGF); and filing collectively Coronet Industries, Inc., Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Rinker Materials Corporation, and the U.S. Agrichemicals Corporation. On October 28, 1994, the Commission issued its Order Accepting and Suspending Tariff Sheets Subject to Refund and Conditions, and Granting Waiver (October 28 Order). The October 28 Order accepted the tariff sheets submitted wit FGT's September 12 Filing, subject to refund, and directed FGT to provide additional information and documentation regarding the determination of the remaining charges in response to the protesting parties' concerns. FGT is filing concurrently herewith the information in compliance with the October 28 Order. FGT states that in compiling the detailed information provided in the compliance filing FGT discovered certain minor errors which affected the recoveries from two customers, Consolidated Minerals (Consolidated) and Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC). Because recoveries affect the memorandum account balances and carrying charge calculations which affect the flowthrough cap calculations, FGT has recalculated all of the schedules submitted with the September 12 Filing. Because of the impact of the adjustments to the recoveries from Consolidated and OUC, the unit surcharge rate proposed to become effective December 1, 1994 changed from 12.73 ¢ per MMBtu to 12.72 ¢ per MMBtu. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with §385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before November 23, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate actions to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary.
