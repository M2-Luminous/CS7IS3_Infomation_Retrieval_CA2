U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, host of the first Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) finance ministers meeting, promised there will be no "arm twisting" from Washington. "APEC is pioneering a model of consensus-building which I believe we can adopt here," Bentsen said in opening remarks to the group's first of two closed-door discussion sessions Saturday. The APEC ministers sat down to swap experiences of how their countries are promoting economic growth. The discussion came after spending Friday getting to know each through informal bilateral and multilateral contacts. "Overall, there were no sharp disagreements during the course of discussion," U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers told reporters. Summers said there was a general consensus among APEC ministers of the importance of "market forces" in promoting economic growth and the flow of capital to developing countries in the region. The APEC ministers were scheduled to wind up the two-day event with a joint press appearance Saturday afternoon where Bentsen was to release a "chair's summary" of their behind-the-door deliberations. APEC, a loosely organized group set up in 1989, groups Japan, the United States, Canada and Mexico along with some of the world's fastest growing economies in East Asia. The 17 APEC members, rising to 18 with the addition of Chile this fall, account for half of the world's economic output and generate 1 trillion dollars in trade among them. The United States, which proposed the finance ministers meeting at the APEC summit held last November in Seattle, has sought to ease the flows of capital investment and promote more open financial markets in the region. The fast-growing countries in the region acknowledge that they need a bigger inflow of foreign capital to develop their economic infrastructure, but are wary of pressure to open their financial markets at a pace they see as too fast. "There is no question that we must encourage the flows of international capital into our countries," Indonesian Finance Minister Mari'e Muhammad said in a paper describing Indonesia's policies to promote private capital inflows. Developing countries "need a temporary breathing space" to build their own financial service sectors, Malaysian Finance Minister Ibrahim Anwar told reporters. There was persistent concern within among Southeast Asian members of the APEC group that they might be forced to conform against their wishes in the search for common APEC financial policies. "Given the diversity of our cultures, political systems, and economic backgrounds, we can only (accomplish APEC goals) through open and honest dialogue," Muhammad told his APEC colleagues Saturday. Hong Kong, a freewheeling haven in east Asia, however, believes that the road to prosperity lies in less government intervention. "Free enterprise offers the best means of ensuring allocation of resources to the most efficient and profitable business ventures," Hong Kong's Treasury Secretary Donald Tsang said. Tsang argued that a noninterventionist policy does not mean the government "just sits back and does nothing." "The government must create and maintain a socioeconomic environment that is conducive to business growth," he said. Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said financial markets should be open but advised his APEC colleagues that market opening measures should be carried out in a "balanced manner." "Too much impatience won't be good," Fujii said.
