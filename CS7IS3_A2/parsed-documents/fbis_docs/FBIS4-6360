This should not be allowed to happen; it is the duty of both the Thai and Cambodian people to prevent a repeat of history. A feeling of rift is re-emerging between Thailand and Cambodia because Cambodian Government leaders have kept on, unfairly and without substantiation, accusing Thailand of giving help to the Khmer Rouge and its leaders. The Thai Government, through its Foreign Ministry, has done the right thing in denying the charges and rejecting the condemnations by the Cambodian Government. It has thus given an assurance to the Thai people that neither the government nor the military has in any way committed an improper act, as alleged by the Cambodian Government. Without any clarification from the government, the Thai people could become perplexed by the negative information from the Cambodian Government and doubt the integrity of their own government and military authorities. Before announcing the statement denying the accusations by the Cambodian leaders, concerned cabinet ministers and security officers -- the foreign, defense, and interior ministers, and high-ranking security officers -- held a joint meeting at the Foreign Ministry. Although such a joint meeting should have taken place a long time ago, it was a prompt and commendable action taken by the administration, which had an effective psychological impact on the people. The government should display more of this kind of coordination in its work. The government's statement made clear that Thailand had not helped the Khmer Rouge leaders to escape into Thailand, or had given support in any form to the Khmer Rouge to launch attacks against the Cambodian Government troops. It stated that the accusation made by the Cambodian Government was unfounded. The Thai foreign minister called upon the Cambodian Government to show the evidence to Thailand since the Cambodian prime minister claimed that he had pictures to substantiate his accusations. It is now the responsibility of the Cambodian Government -- either First Prime Minister Prince Kromluang Norodom Ranariddh or Second Prime Minister Hun Sen -- to produce the evidence of Thailand giving help to the Khmer Rouge. If there is no proof for the accusation, the Cambodian Government will be discredited. Through his condemnations of Thailand, Prince Ranariddh has stirred up in the Thai people a negative feeling toward the Cambodian leaders. Prince Kromluang Norodom Ranariddh should not forget that Thailand once served as a refuge for him when his own country was ravaged by war.
