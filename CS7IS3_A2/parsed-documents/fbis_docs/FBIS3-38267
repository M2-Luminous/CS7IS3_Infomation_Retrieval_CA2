Diez and L.R. Aizpeolea report: "Gonzalez Increases His Power in Curbing Guerra"] [Excerpt] Madrid -- Felipe Gonzalez, secretary general of the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party], has more freedom of action today than he had 48 hours ago. The clear defeat for the Guerraists (with 28 percent of the delegates to the federal congress) by the renewalists and integrationists (72 percent) at the provincial congresses prior to the March congress gives the Socialist leader a much freer hand to design an Executive Committee to his liking. The victorious renewalists offer Gonzalez freedom for his political activity. The losing Guerraists were demanding a presence in the power apparatus, but their defeat will prevent them from setting conditions. Even so, the supporters of the party's "number two" were disguising their disappointment with the idea that the PSOE is approaching the 33d congress "utterly divided." Renewalists and integrationists have succeeded in winning a majority in 14 of the 20 Socialist federations, the Guerraists in just six. The big surprises were Andalusia and Murcia, fiefs traditionally controlled by supporters of Deputy Secretary General Alfonso Guerra, where the renewalists or Felipeists have prevailed. The Felipeists' representation is now 72 percent, since their nine federations have been joined by those which formally call themselves integrationist. This is the case with Valencia, the Basque Country, the Canary Islands, Catalonia, and the Foreign Federation (party members living abroad). Their leaders -- Joan Lerma, Ramon Jauregui, Jeronimo Saavedra, Raimon Obiols -- are Felipeists but have received a Guerraist minority in their ranks. The provincial congresses of Madrid (52 delegates) and Leon (20 delegates) will be held next week. With these and others pending in the local associations of La Coruna (three) and Lugo (one), the process prior to the the 33d congress will have been completed. In this situation, the Felipeists now have 585 delegates, against the 226 delegates of the Guerraists. Guerra's supporters were disappointed yesterday at having achieved a result very distant from their aims, which they put at 40 percent of the representatives. Their calculations failed them over the past three days because of the mirage of the outcome in the votes in the local associations, prior to last weekend's provincial congresses. The unexpected loss in Andalusia and Murcia -- which account for almost one-third of the 887 delegates to the congress -- has made them reduce drastically their optimistic forecasts, now that the party members have voted secretly. The renewalists have experienced the situation differently. The fact that the powerful Andalusian federation is swelling their ranks is regarded as the most important success in this whole struggle, since it was Guerra's fief. The Guerraists won 35.3 percent of the Andalusian votes, as against 64.7 percent for the renewalists, which means that the latter will send 149 delegates to the congress, against 81 for the Guerraists. Unexpected Triumph The renewalists' satisfaction has been rounded off by their absolutely unexpected success in Murcia, where the Guerraists have become a minority by two votes. The renewalists have also triumphed in their traditional fiefs, such as Castilla-La Mancha. Even an alternative list put forward in Toledo by Fernando Mora, secretary to former Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera, was swept aside. Yesterday, in light of the results, Castilla-La Mancha premier and prominent renewalist Jose Bono stated: "Unity, which will undoubtedly prevail at our congress, will no longer be achieved through impositions. Because renewal has won, integration will be possible." Gonzalez and Guerra followed the weekend's process expectantly. Nothing is known about the "number two," but something is known about the secretary general. Gonzalez will continue with his view that his role is that of arbitrator, and it is now up to him to reduce the tension which this process has created in his party. Over the past few days, Gonzalez has expressed his desire to have sufficient freedom to design an Executive Committee of integration with which he can work comfortably. With these results he has achieved this. With the argument that the less power Guerra has, the less pressured Gonzalez will feel, the renewalist leaders deem it good for their strategy that the Guerraists have lost ground over the past few days. From this viewpoint, Alfonso Guerra will no longer have sufficient strength to impose all the henchmen he would like to have in the new Executive Committee, so his future depends on what Felipe Gonzalez decides. Over the next few days the Socialist leader will continue to hold meetings with all regional party secretaries in order to learn their views on the situation following these internal elections and on what the next Executive Committee should be like. So far he has met with renewalist Jose Bono, Basque Socialist Party Secretary General Ramon Jauregui, and Valencian premier Joan Lerma. The last two men, both renewalists, will lead delegations under the integration label, since prominent Guerraists figure in a minority in their ranks. After meeting with Gonzalez a few days ago, Lerma also met with the deputy secretary general. Gonzalez wishes to settle the debate on the lists immediately, and redirect the PSOE's concern to the political reports. Last Thursday, he clearly said that he will disclose no more names of the Executive Committee's future members until the March congress. Gonzalez has remarked that the many international delegations which will be attending the congress are very interested in learning what the Socialist Party's proposals are after 11 years in power.
