Glagolev (deceased) and A.V. Timofeyev, Russian Science Center ``Kurchatov Institute''; UDC 621.039] [Abstract] Recuperation of the plasma energy in fusion reactors by direct thermonuclear-to-electric energy conversion is considered, a method of connecting the recuperator trap to a closed dragon trap being proposed which is simpler than the conventional use of a bundle diverter. The recuperator is a curvilinear adiabatic trap which contains a mirror machine identical to those in the dragon trap. The method of connecting the two traps utilizes the peculiarities of plasma diffusion within the dragon, the latter confining three groups of charged particles: 1) drift particles in its toroidal segments, 2) ``superbanana'' particles confined between locks in its curvilinear collision-radiative electron lenses, 3) particles confined in its axisymmetric mirror machines. The key to the proposed method are the different modes of their diffusion, those restrained in a mirror machine diffusing in the classical mode across the magnetic field while drift and ``superbanana'' particles setting in the toroidal dragon segments diffuse in the neoclassical mode. Diffusion of electrons and of ions is analyzed quantitatively according to theory. The relevant plasma parameters are evaluated on the premise that the frequency of ion-ion collisions is always lower than the frequency of electron-electron collisions owing to heavier mass of ions. A recuperator has two electrodes mounted one at each end for extraction of electric energy. The confining magnetic field is the one between the electron lenses in the dragon. During the recuperation process charged particles become quickly confined in the mirror machines of the dragon and are drifting here in crossed fields from the center of the dragon outward. Recuperation requires that particles have more energy for l longitudinal motion than for transverse motion, in which case ``superbanana'' particles in the mirror machines become converted into drift particles. These are then recuperated by means of electrodes inserted into the locks of the mirror machines, relocating the electrodes into these locks from locks in the electron lenses having simplified the device and reduced its size. The particularly important initial stage of the recuperation process is analyzed on the basis of two equations, one relating the rate of change of kinetic energy to the electric potential gradient and one representing the law of magnetic momentum conservation. Separately is considered rotational conversion of energy and its effect on the recuperation process, whereupon an approximate expression is derived for the efficiency of recuperation in such a system.
