Extending a warm welcome to M.J. Qhobela, visiting foreign minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho, Rong described the visit as the first major contact between the two countries after they renewed diplomatic relations early this year. The visit shows that the Lesotho Government pays attention to its relations with China, Rong said, adding he believes the visit will help enhance mutual understanding between the two peoples and the friendly cooperation between the two countries. Rong appreciated the "one China" stance of the new Lesotho Government and its efforts to normalize bilateral relations. He thanked Qhobela for his contribution to the restoration of Sino- Lesotho ties. China and Lesotho are both developing countries, Rong said. China holds that all countries, small or big, poor or rich, weak or strong, should live in equality and develop ties with one another on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence. Briefing Qhobela on China's domestic situation, Rong said that in the past decade and more, China has been pursuing a policy centered on economic construction, and its economic growth has been rapid. Qhobela said the renewal of diplomatic ties between Lesotho and China is a historic event. Despite the long geographic distance, the two countries are linked together by common interests and the Lesotho-China ties have bright prospects, he said. Qhobela told Rong that this was his 4th trip to China and that he and his party had witnessed great changes here. Lesotho will benefit from China's experience over the past decade, he said. Qhobela and his party arrived here on April 10 as guests of Vice- Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
