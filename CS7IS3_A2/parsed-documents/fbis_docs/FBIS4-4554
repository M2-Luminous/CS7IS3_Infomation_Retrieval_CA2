FBIS4-4554 "dreas064__a94005" FBIS-EAS-94-064-A Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Reaction to U.S. Report on Trade Barriers Reaction to U.S. Report on Trade Barriers Industries Refute Content OW0304053194 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 2 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0304053194 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Japanese industries have unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. Government's having listed 43 items deemed to be Japanese trade barriers in its "1994 Report on Foreign Trade Barriers." The telecommunications, medical equipment, and electric power industries, which are newly cited in the report, especially do not agree with its contents, saying: "The U.S. Government is mistaken in its understanding of the facts" (as stated by the Federation of Electric Power Companies). This is because the amount of procurement of foreign goods by nine electric companies sharply increased to $440 million in 1992 from $210 million in 1990, and U.S.-made products accounted for 80-90 percent of the total. It can be said that of the 43 items listed in the U.S. report, "such items as telecommunications and medical equipment -- which are newly listed in the report -- as well as automobiles, computers, and supercomputers -- which were main topics at the economic framework talks -- are the most probable targets of the Super 301 provision of the Trade and Competitiveness Acts" (according to the Japan Machinery Exporters' Association). Meanwhile, Takayoshi Masuzawa, managing director of the Communications Machine Makers' Association, stresses: "Although trade imbalances in the field of communications equipment as a whole still exist, the excess of net exports of such products as facsimile machines is now decreasing, due to an increase in local production abroad." Regarding the cellular phone issue, the managing director also points out: "The introduction of the `urikiri system' [lifting the ban on direct sales of cellular phones to consumers] in April will promote price and service competition, hence it will facilitate the access of foreign makers to the Japanese market." The Japan Electronic Industry Development Association points out: "The Japanese computer market is an extremely free market in which imports have been totally liberalized and tariffs have been abolished. Procedures for government procurement of supercomputers are transparent." The association does not try to conceal its dissatisfaction, saying: "It is hard to understand the U.S. report, which completely ignores Japan's efforts and its results." In response to the U.S. pointing out the supposedly closed nature of the Japanese auto industry in its business dealings, Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association [JAMA], says: "It is not true that we discriminate against foreign automakers and makers of automobile parts. We have no intention to do so in the future as well." He adds: "It can be gathered from the report that the Clinton administration is still taking a hardline position on policymaking toward Japan." However, the actual situation is that each industry is failing to come up with concrete measures to prevent the United States from accusing them this September of engaging in unfair trade practices. The automobile industry announced its midterm purchase program of foreign auto parts in late March. With JAMA playing a leading role, the industry has also spelled out new plans to increase imports of finished cars, including a plan to establish a grievance committee. It is trying to coolly react to the U.S. report, saying "there is no choice but to steadily implement these plans, (as stated by JAMA). Since the electric power industry is now working out such measures as the disclosure of information on its plans to procure materials as well as the simplification of procedures for procurement, it intends to introduce these measures as an answer to the U.S. demand that Japan open its markets.
