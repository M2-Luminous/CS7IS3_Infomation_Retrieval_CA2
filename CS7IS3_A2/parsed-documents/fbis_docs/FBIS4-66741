Open your ears and listen to me. The United States considers Kashmir a disputed region and we have said that the oneness of Kashmir will not be affected. In other words Kashmir will not be divided." When the U.S. assistant secretary visited Delhi, she was greeted with black flags. The fundamentalist Indian Hindus believed that she was trying to stop the brutalities that the Indian military was committing on the Muslims in Kashmir. How could Kashmir be India's integral part if this happened? However, later when Mr. Rao and some important cabinet members talked with Madam Raphel or rifle, she openly said that she will stop the terrorists from terrorist activities in Kashmir to resolve this issue and that Pakistan will not be allowed to provide help to them. Thus, Madam Raphel has said these things, and now the deputy secretary of state is also coming to India, or has arrived there before my column is published, to make India happier and charm it further. Some people say that this victory does not belong to the government of India but to the black flags behind which India, the Indian government, and Kashmir could not be seen. Also, showing black flags makes white people's color paler and perhaps the Indian government had paraded these black flags as part of its diplomatic effort. Madam Raphel had to say that the freedom fighters are also violating human rights. In other words, it is not the Indian army alone that is violating human rights. Justice demanded that Madam Raphel should say that India should recall its military from Kashmir. What right did the Indian military have to be in Kashmir after the United States declared it a disputed region? Will the Kashmiri freedom fighters squash their heads by hitting them on the wall if the Indian army leaves? Madam Raphel said in an interview with Doordarshan that Kashmir cannot be considered an integral part of India forever. However, showing her black flags was like showing a red flag to a bull in a bullfight. The United States was like a bull in the past and the former Soviet Union was like a red flag. Madam Raphel also said that she had made it clear to Pakistan that the United States will be unhappy with its providing assistance to the "separatists" or the freedom fighters. Pakistan really stopped giving help to the Kashmiri freedom fighters. It means that if any aid is to be given, it must be given to the Indian military, and the United States will provide it if needed. It does not want to make India, which is a large country, unhappy at all. Later, it will want Pakistan also to become an integral part of India. Mr. Qazi of Jamaat-i-Islami and other religious parties know that jihad should be called on Kashmir. By this jihad they mean to provide economic aid to Kashmiri freedom fighters. They have collected 20 million rupees for this purpose. Do they think that they will ask their elected government to give this money? Since the United States has its word that it will stop giving assistance to the freedom fighters in Kashmir, will these parties provide this assistance to Kashmiris on their own? They cannot make their elected government do what they want and are not able to send these money on their own. Therefore, our advise is to start a jihad in Kashmir and the United States! Perhaps, the United States will help them in this jihad. The situation in Kashmir now is such and that United States is supporting India so much that it is proper for Madam [Bhutto] and her cabinet members to say that this situation is not the kind that we can let the United States or India lead us by our noses. Therefore, the government should take the opposition in confidence at this critical point and make a decision so that India and the United States cannot interfere in Pakistan's autonomy. If the Kashmir issue is not resolved according to the wishes of Kashmiri people, the United States and India will succeed in making Pakistan an integral part of India or dividing it up in several parts. This is the time to be brave and courageous and to tell the United States bluntly that we have had agreements with you in the past and have suffered your friendship. You were involved in dividing Pakistan into two countries also. We are not going to take "dictation" from some major power because Pakistan is an independent nation. Therefore, if you think that we will present Kashmir to India in a silver platter because we are afraid of you, then it is your vain imagination. If you continue to insist on our obeying your order, we have to say, "Cat, we mice are better off without your help."
