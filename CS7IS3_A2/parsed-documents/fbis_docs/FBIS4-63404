He said that operating in Russia is the regime of colonial democracy where the U.S. dollar dominates, English is commonly used and Russian culture is deteriorating. Zyuganov believes that events are developing in Russia along three lines: Russia is turning into a mafiosi-criminal state, the country is on the brink of a civil war or the coalition of left-wing and patriotic forces may come to power. Stressing that a civil war in a country which has 27,000 nuclear warheads could cause a catastrophe, Zyuganov expressed hope that the situation will develop along the third channel. He said that representatives of the Communists, the Agrarian Party and other opposition organizations had managed to stand at the head of local bodies of power in 70 territories of the Russian federation. He said that only a "constructive program" could become the basis for civic peace in Russia. Such a program would include a change of political course, with priority given to power engineering, agriculture, science and culture, combating crime, the elimination of social inequality, the scrapping of privatization and the restoration of the Union. He believes that the country is now like a nuclear reactor which is being overused. Under these conditions, he said, operators must be sure to press the right buttons at the right moment, otherwise there may be an explosion, said Zyuganov. He also gave a characterization of certain well-known politicians. He said that Yegor Gaydar had settled into the wrong office and found himself unable to look out the window and introduce corrections in the course of reforms. Anatoliy Chubays, he said, deceived everybody with the privatization campaign and is "now selling out Russia wholesale and retail." He said that later generations will denounce Gennadiy Burbulis for being the cause of the Soviet Union's break-up. Zyuganov said that the state post was too difficult a job for Ruslan Khasbulatov. And that only at the second stage of his political career he understood his mistakes but it was too late to correct them. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy resembles a younger brother of Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and in essence the LDP platform differs little from what the present executive power is doing, he said. Zyuganov also said that at the moment the Communist Party has 550,000 members which is two times more than in all other parties. The scale of public opinion leans to the left, he emphasized. About 500 people listened to the speech by the leader of the Communist Party leader. Two-thirds of the audience were elderly people rather than students, despite taking place in the Moscow State University..
