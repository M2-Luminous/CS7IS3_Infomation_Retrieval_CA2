The party chairman had not yet gone to bed after midnight because of the election excitement, and our correspondent managed to interview him on the telephone. [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Good evening, Mr. Chairman. [Horn] Good evening. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] How satisfied are you with the election results? [Horn] I am very satisfied. They are very good and exceed expectations; at least they exceed what I had seen and heard to date. So I am pleased that we did not work in vain. [Correspondent] The political analysts are considering to what the success can be attributed. Two alternatives have emerged. The first is that with very calm, very restrained political activity, the party, which four years ago ended up in the depths, was able to get back to its feet. Do you agree? [Horn] I naturally agree with that. However, those who are evaluating us should recognize that this meant very hard work for us. [Correspondent] According to the other opinion, four years ago the people voted against something. Now, however, after they have experienced the feeling of freedom and independence, they are turning to social issues. [Horn] That is not how I judge it. Of course, the question at hand also involves the significance of social issues, but economic policy is at least as important. So is the sorting out of relations with the neighboring countries, as is the European political culture which the Socialist Party has represented to date. Finally, let me add: We did not express hatred toward anyone, nor did we want to (?exclude) anyone. We also (?said) that no matter how sharp the differences of view were, it was necessary to seek the possibility of normal relations. [Correspondent] We have spoken with a correspondent from French television's second channel, and he said that this sweeping victory, this confident victory, that the MSZP achieved would be convincing for the West as well. [Horn] I had no doubts that the West had confidence in the Socialist Party. Indeed, allow me to add: More than one Western statesman, big financial experts, and entrepreneurs said that if the MSZP came to power two things would be certain. One was that it would form a government using people with expertise. The other was that its policy would be predictable. I believe that the West can be pleased with these election results. [Correspondent] Very many people are saying now, mainly those who have been in government positions until now, that they hope the reforms that have been started will not come to a halt. [Horn] They should have no doubts. It is completely certain that reform and transformation will continue. The essence here is that we must set ourselves to the task more cleverly in many areas. It is always necessary to consider that this country in many respects is taking the road not taken. Many things must be tried out. But one thing must never be forgotten: It is not the people who are the guinea pigs. It is necessary to work in a manner so that the people live better and can secure a normal life for themselves and their children. I apologize for my voice, but it is still not 100 percent after the operation. [Correspondent] A final question. We now can ask, very quietly, whether the chairman of the victorious party could gain the position of prime minister based on the results of the election. [Horn] In the final analysis, the question of whether or not I will be prime minister will be decided by the MSZP. I have never been intimidated by the job, but I have never considered this to be the primary concern. The important thing, rather, is for this party to be able to realize a program covering economic, social, and all other areas, one which takes reality as its point of departure, one which is in harmony with the interests of society and the great majority of the people. [Correspondent] Many thanks for the conversation and I wish you a speedy recovery. [end recording]
