"Political speculations based on rumours and malevolence about the health of Boris Yeltsin look extremely ugly and unpatriotic. This does not correspond to the Russian character," Kostikov said in a statement on Tuesday. "I have to tell those who would like to use the question of the health of the president for their political intrigues and ambitions that the health of Boris Yeltsin allows him to reliably and resolutely run the country during the term of office fixed by the constitution, and in case of state necessity and the choice of the people, also outside this term," the spokesman stressed. He was evidently referring to those political forces who hope to replace Yeltsin in case he steps down because of health reasons before his term of office expires in 1996. According to the constitution, early presidential elections become inevitable in this case. Kostikov confirmed that the president had suffered from a strong cold of late and said that Yeltsin had to breach the advised medical regime to hold talks with visiting British Prime Minister John Major on Tuesday. The spokesman added that Yeltsin had not yet recovered completely and thus the presidential "state of the nation" address to parliament may be postponed.
