The economic framework talks have broken down, and the United States is preparing to impose sanctions against Japan. The yen is also appreciating. While the yen exchange rate is determined by the economic fundamentals on the long term, the United States has no intention at all to restrain yen appreciation, and there are reports that it is even secretly applauding Japan's predicament as a result of a strong yen. The Japanese economy, which has just shown feeble signs of an upturn at the beginning of 1994, is now faced again with total uncertainty. The breakdown of the framework talks will surely bring enormous damage to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Who is to blame for what happened? In the first place, was such a scenario really inevitable? I believe it could have been avoided. The framework talks are not a venue for discussing numerical targets alone. There are three areas of negotiation: macroeconomic policy (that is, economic stimulation measures), microeconomic policy (that is, numerical targets for specific sectors), and Japan-U.S. cooperation in global issues, such as environment and population. With regard to global cooperation, although this has only been reported on in an obscure section of the newspapers, Japan and the United States were able to reach a satisfactory agreement. As to microeconomic policy, there was little possibility of reaching an agreement. This issue derived from the fact that at the Miyazawa-Clinton talks in 1993, the two leaders had somehow hammered out a rhetorical compromise although they really had different things in mind. Nevertheless, the U.S. argument was not persuasive under the principle of free trade. Even in the United States, economic experts were mostly opposed to the U.S. position. During the bilateral negotiations up to late 1993, the USTR was the only one taking a tough position, while the other economic departments in the U.S. Government were even embarrassed to say such things to Japan. They thought Japan would never compromise under the circumstances. The negotiations were going nowhere. However, in January, after the United States consolidated its position on the negotiations with Japan, naturally, it adopted a unified tough line. At that point, even if an agreement could be reached in the microeconomic field, it would have amounted to nothing more than Japan sharing the pains with the United States. Therefore, the only way to save the framework talks was in the macroeconomic area. In fact, the Japanese and U.S. negotiators I contacted were saying, "If only Japan can satisfy the United States in the macroeconomic aspect...." I had believed all along that Japan would do something in this area. I am not really an expert in economics, and it was not an area that I should be meddling in. Moreover, I thought, saying that economic stimulation measures were necessary in consideration of relations with the United States might have the wrong effect. So I refrained from saying anything. Large-Scale Tax Cut Could Have Been the Way Out Specifically, at that time, Japan was talking about a tax cut of from 5 to 7 trillion yen. Even if this was not increased to 8 trillion yen, 7 trillion yen plus something extra would certainly have enabled the United States to boast of winning a major concession from Japan. If an agreement could be reached in both the macroeconomic and global aspects, it would have been possible to put off the microeconomic area for future discussion. Since the U.S. economy has entered a recovery period, it was fully reasonable to expect that in six months' time, the United States would be in a mood of "not taking such a tough stand against Japan." Furthermore, since even U.S. economists are divided on the numerical targets, Japan could expect that the momentum for pursuing these targets would be lost. In addition, Japan would be given six months' time to actively campaign in such a direction. To say the least, since there was no hope for solving the microeconomic issues, it was the only strategy left. I thought that was what the government would do because that was the only possible way. In fact, even now, when I ask the officials involved in the negotiations, they reply that, "Since it was impossible to agree in microeconomics, there was supposed to be a solution in macroeconomics." In other words, the proper strategy was not implemented even though everybody knew about it. But why? The original plan to implement 6 trillion yen tax cuts for three years was 100 percent the Finance Ministry's idea, and there was not a trace of any effort to save Japan-U.S. relations with a little extra policy measures. This could have been because the political authorities were not fully aware of the seriousness of the problem, or because the lack of awareness on the part of the bureaucrats made them resist any such measures. The fact is, the United States was dissatisfied because "this was 1 or 2 trillion yen less than expected." Nevertheless, the United States decided to see the tax cut plan as "one step forward." With that, it was at least possible, despite serious reservations on the part of the United States, to lay the groundwork for avoiding an open breakdown in the framework talks. The Social Democratic Party of Japan eliminated even this possibility. Similarly, the Liberal Democratic Party could have opted to forget party interests and political maneuverings for a while and support the government, but it chose to just laugh at the Hosokawa administration's failure. A Mistake Not To Be Repeated Thus, Japan was forced into a confrontation with the United States with nobody taking the responsibility. This reminds us of the Pacific war. If Japan had obtained the United States' blessing with an 8-trillion-yen tax cut, and rid itself of the fear of yen appreciation, the mood prevailing in Japan today would have been entirely different. Under the existing circumstances, we can expect more corporate bankruptcies and unemployment. Who will take the political responsibility for the victims of this? It is hard to say what Japan should do next. It depends on what the United States will do. Yet, for sure, the prospects are not bright at all. One lesson we should never forget is that in the future, if changes in the international situation again call to question the true worth of the Japan-U.S. alliance, Japan should never again pass over the chance to restore the relationship of trust between Japan and the United States.
