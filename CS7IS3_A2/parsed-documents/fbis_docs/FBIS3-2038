Greater emphasis should be placed on exchanges between nongovernmental sectors. They can explore various investment and cooperation opportunities. When asked by a reporter about China's experience in economic reform, he said: China has been quiet successful in its economic reform. Over the past 15 years, a market economy has been gradually instituted in China and the economic growth has continued. Meanwhile, the basic socialist system has remained unchanged. He added: In the process of reform, although China has learned from some advanced experiences of foreign countries, it has proceeded from the realities in the country and taken its own road.
