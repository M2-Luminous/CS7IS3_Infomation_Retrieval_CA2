This was revealed by the Mongolian President, Mr Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, in a reception accorded to him at the inauguration of the Indo-Mongolian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Indo-Mongolian Friendship Society. Mongolia is into its third year of democracy and has opened up its economy to foreign investment. Seventy years of communist rule had isolated them from the rest of the world and the country grew up in the shadow of neighbouring Russia and China. Mongolia has a population of 2.2 million and a land area of 1.5 million square kilometers. Being a rural economy with animal husbandry and agriculture as its mainstay, it is looking for technological support from India in mining and processing of their vast resources in coking coal, silver, copper, gold and molybdenum, building construction and joint exploration of petroleum and uranium, power, communications and rail and road construction in the infrastructure sector. Mongolia imported over $399 million in 1992 and can form a market for Indian tea, medicines, kerosene, automobiles, textiles, chemicals and fertilizers. Joint ventures and projects are still in the negotiation stage, according to a member of the trade team and they hope to finalise them soon. Meanwhile, the Mongolian President today visited the century-old Bombay stock exchange and witnessed the trading activity. The Mongolian delegation was received by the executive director of the BSE [Bombay Stock Exchange], Mr A.N. Kolhatkar, and the president, Mr G.B. Desai.
