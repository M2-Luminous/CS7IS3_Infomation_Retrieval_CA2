FBIS4-9598 "dreeu083_i_94009" FBIS-EEU-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA UNICEF Spokesman on Conditions in Gorazde UNICEF Spokesman on Conditions in Gorazde AU2904124294 Paris AFP in English 1200 GMT 29 Apr 94 AU2904124294 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Sarajevo, April 29 (AFP) -- Gorazde is "basically a ghetto" which can expect "serious health problems" over the summer as a result of the destruction of the town's sole water purification plant, an aid worker said Friday [29 April]. Although all the town's population, estimated at more than 50,000 people, had shelter, there was "very serious overcrowding" with the town's three remaining schools -- two others were completely destroyed -- used as collective centres, Ryan Grist, of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), said after a five-day visit. There were two sources of good water where people had to spend long hours queueing: "the problem is not quality but quantity." Though there was "a lot of destruction" in the town, Gorazde was "not a Vukovar", the eastern Croatian town that was almost totally flattened by three months of Serbian shelling in late 1991. However in the areas reached by the Serb offensive, "every house was gutted," Grist said. On Wednesday [27 April], during a visit to the Gorazde, UN commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina General Sir Michael Rose said there was "not as much destruction as (he) expected." On reports that the number of casualties during the three-week onslaught on the town had been inflated, Grist commented: "There was complete terror and horror; if I'd been there, I too would have exaggerated." Following the first evacuations of the wounded from Gorazde Monday, UN sources suggested that the numbers of killed and wounded might have to be revised downwards by as much as two thirds. The representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Peter Kessler, has consistently defended his organisation's estimate of more than 700 killed and almost 2,000 wounded. A Nordic battalion has located "a further 70 to 100 seriously wounded people in difficult access regions" of Gorazde who he hoped would be evacuated out of the town Sunday [1 May]. They were "apparently heavily wounded" and would be transferred to the city centre Saturday [30 April], he said. Many of those evacuated to Sarajevo in a three-day operation earlier this week were seriously affected by infection and malnutrition, Kessler said. Up to 25 were to be urgently evacuated to France, Ireland and Denmark Saturday, depending on their condition. A 14-truck UNHCR convoy carrying 68 tonnes of wheat flour and family packages left Belgrade early Friday and was expected to arrive in Gorazde later in the morning, Kessler said. He added that following several "administrative delays" imposed by Bosnian Serbs in eastern Bosnia, his organisation had reminded them of their obligation to allow unhindered freedom of movement for humanitarian convoys.
