An emergency rule implementing these measures was published on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6222), under section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act. At its April 1994 meeting the Council voted to extend the emergency rule for another 90 days (59 FR 24965, May 13, 1994). A proposed rule to implement these measures was published in the Federal Register on May 4, 1994 (59 FR 23044). A complete description of, and justification for, the management measures, including editorial changes to regulations addressing GOA halibut bycatch amounts, was discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule. Additional information also is available in the EA/RIR (see ADDRESSES ). Public comment on the proposed rule was invited through May 31, 1994. One letter of comments was received within the comment period and is summarized and responded to below in the Response to Comments section. Response to Comments Comment 1: Splitting the halibut bycatch limit between the shallow-water fishery complex and the deep-water fishery complex splits the limit between a well-observed fleet with 100-percent observer coverage (mainly in the deep-water fisheries) and a poorly observed fleet with 30-percent observer coverage (mainly in the shallow-water fisheries). Because the 30-percent boats have greater latitude to take an observer, the bycatch data collected for the shallow-water fisheries would be biased and, therefore, less accurate than the data collected for the deep-water fisheries, thus jeopardizing the management of the halibut bycatch limits. This action would degrade the scientific basis for halibut bycatch management and is contrary to national standard 2. Response: Consistent with national standard 2, NMFS continues to monitor the groundfish fishery using the best information available. Opportunities do exist in the 30-percent observer coverage fleet for vessel operators to manipulate observer coverage to reduce or increase coverage in different fisheries. However, NMFS has taken measures to increase observer coverage in the groundfish fleet to improve the accuracy of catch monitoring. A recent amendment to the Observer Plan (59 FR 22133, April 29, 1994) changed observer coverage requirements for vessels required to obtain 30-percent observer coverage. The amendment to the Observer Plan limits the manipulation of observer coverage by requiring vessels to carry an observer during at least 30 percent of their fishing days in each calendar quarter in which the vessels participate for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish. These vessels are also required to have an observer on board the vessel during one trip in each fishery, as defined in the Observer Plan amendment, in which they participate. These measures should reduce the potential for manipulation of observer coverage and increase the amount of observer data available for the management of the specific fisheries. Comment 2: Processors are not required to report harvests such that NMFS can reasonably attribute shoreside catch to a given target with its appropriate bycatch. Currently, one target species is assigned per week, even though vessels delivering to a plant may have targeted several different species. This system cannot be used to monitor scientifically a separate shallow-water fisheries halibut bycatch limit and is inconsistent with national standard 2.
