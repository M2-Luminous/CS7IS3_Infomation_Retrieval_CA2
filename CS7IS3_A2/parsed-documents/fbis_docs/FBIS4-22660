That is, of course, provided that the new parliament does not begin its own activity by revoking all the accomplishments of its predecessor, and provided that the newly constituted government does not shatter to smithereens the delicate little porcelain bridge which has just recently connected Ukraine with the world's financial whales. In the opinion of Serhiy Osyka, deputy minister of foreign economic relations and trade, there are two realistic ways to introduce a sound monetary unit--a quick way and a slower but more durable way. The choice must be made now. [Vorontsova] Serhiy Hryhorovych, to what extent was the question of forming a stabilzation fund under the hryvnya roused from its slumber during the latest visit by the president of Ukraine to the United States? It is certainly a well-known fact that this problem has been under discussion in the IMF [International Monetary Fund].... [Osyka] Indeed, this question has been worked on for several years now; without a sound currency it is impossible to carry out an effective economic reform. The requirements set forth by the IMF are directly tied in with the need to restore our money to good health: in its volume a stabilization fund of whatever currency must not exceed the value of a country's imports during a period of three to four months. In and by itself, our decline in production is forgivable, but its sum-total was a bit too much. The stabilization fund can be formed along various lines. It can be done not only by enlarging and increasing our exports, but also by changing their quality. Because Ukraine, of course, Ukraine is not merely a traditional producer and supplier of metal. If--thanks to joining GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and signing a memorandum on cooperation with the EC [European Communities]--our high-tech goods (helicopters, rockets, and space satellites) can be introduced onto the world market, our state's hard-currency funds will grow sound very soon indeed. And that would also apply to the stabilization fund. [Vorontsova] And so it could be said that the absence of a sound currency in Ukraine has brought about not only the economic crisis, but also the lack of appropriate international documents. Without the latter even the best Ukrainian items will not see the world any farther than our republic-level center for exhibits and fairs. Isn't that correct? [Osyka] That's the way matters stood until very recently. A breakthough occurred literally during the last two months--first and foremost, after the change in the American policy with regard to Ukraine as a result of Kravchuk's signing the trilateral declaration in Moscow. Work is now proceeding on the preparation of credits from the IMF--something which we have not succeeded in obtaining for almost two years now. The first few steps have been taken toward cooperating with the Americans in the high-tech field. In and by itself alone, the launching of commercial satellites would bring in billions of hard-currency units within a very brief period of time. This change in the stance taken by the United States has likewise brought about a new policy with regard to Ukraine on the part of the "Big Seven" states. It has also evoked interest from the countries of Southeast Asia--countries which have very good future prospects and which are developing at a tempestuous pace. Prospects are opening up for the introduction of new credit lines and for expanding our own trade possibilities by means of selling abroad those items which we were unable to sell previously because of certain political and legal obstacles. [Vorontsova] But the domestic economic situation in our state has remained unfavorable: The reforms are marking time, privatization has just begun, and one hears complaints from economic experts to the effect that inflation is being warded off by artificial means.... [Osyka] I would not assert these things so categorically. Where do you get the idea that we don't have privatization? And what about the housing fund, and even available housing? And what about the leasing of enterprises, many of which often are converted into properties owned by the collectives involved? But the only realistic remedy against inflation is to increase the mass of goods. It can be increased in two ways. The first is calculated to take a 10-year period: This involves modernizing and renovating our production facilities, as well as restructuring the economy itself. The second way is faster: It solves the problems by political and legal methods--via privatization, when a certain quantity of goods of the requisite commercial quality have appeared on the market. The money supply would then form a kind of enclosed circle or loop and be full in the financial sense. Such a method would ensure an abrupt stabilization of the monetary system. Money would be put to work, and other motivation for persons to work would begin to appear. [Vorontsova] In emphasizing the prospects for the political and legal way, you indicated that cooperation with GATT and the EC would be on a new basis.... [Osyka] Until Ukraine becomes a member of GATT, it will be confined by numerous tariff barriers and administrative restrictions from selling its own best goods. After we have joined in this agreement, we will become a full member of the world economic space. Certainly, new problems will continue to arise. For example, lowering our import tariffs will further exacerbate the position of those enterprises of ours which turn out products which cannot compete with better ones from abroad. But we simply cannot go on subsidizing such enterprises. GATT has 117 members. It is not just a club for the great trading "whales," but also contains 2/3 of the countries with transitional types of economies--a category to which Ukraine likewise belongs. The GATT mechanisms provide for a balancing of interests between large, small, developed, and almost backward countries.... As to the prospects for cooperation with the EC, a system of versatility would be set up, i.e., the attitude toward our products on the market would have to be the same as for those economic entities of the EC member-countries. At the latest round of talks with the EC there was a discussion of possible cooperation between the Ukrainian National Space Sgency and the European space agencies. [Vorontsova] Wouldn't that aggravate our mutual relations with Russia? [Osyka] No. Because, of course, both GATT and the EC have worked out precise mechanisms for regulating the relations in the free-trade zones and the customs unions. Russia itself will join GATT quite soon, and if we lose time, we could remain an outsider in relations with our Eastern neighbors.
