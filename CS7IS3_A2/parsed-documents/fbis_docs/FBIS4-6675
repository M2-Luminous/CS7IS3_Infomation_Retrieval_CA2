He indicated his basic intention to appoint a Shinseito member as chief cabinet secretary, saying: "The relationship between chief cabinet secretary (and prime minister) is like being bound by a common fate. We hope that a person who is on friendly terms with the new prime minister will be named as chief cabinet secretary." In concrete terms, it is believed that he made the remarks while keeping in mind Hajime Funada, former director general of the Economic Planning Agency, and other Shinseito members. In this connection, a Komeito leader said on the same day: "It is appropriate to appoint a Shinseito member as the chief cabinet secretary." He indicated that if the number of cabinet posts occupied by Shinseito members increases, it is better to adjust the allocation of cabinet posts rather than that of the chief cabinet secretary. A Democratic Socialist Party leader agreed with them.
