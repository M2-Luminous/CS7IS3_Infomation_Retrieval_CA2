FR940812-2-00199 FR940812-2-00072 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34493; File No. SR&hyph;CSE&hyph;94&hyph;6] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change to Amend and Extend the Pilot Program on the Exchange Relating to the Preferencing of Public Orders by Approved Dealers and Other Proprietary Members August 5, 1994. I. Introduction On June 24, 1994, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Incorporated (``CSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to extend through May 18, 1995, its pilot program which governs preferenced trading. The Commission originally approved this pilot on February 7, 1991. 3 In connection with this extension of the pilot, the Exchange has proposed certain changes to its rules. 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28866, 56 FR 5854 (Feb. 13, 1991) Notice of the filing of this proposal appeared in the Federal Register on July 1, 1994. 4 No comment letters were received. 5 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission has determined to approve the proposal on a temporary basis through May 18, 1995. 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34285, 59 FR 33992 (July 1, 1994). 5 While no comments were received in response to this proposal, in response to the Boston Stock Exchange's Competing Specialist program several SROs expressed views regarding the CSR Preferencing program as structured at that time. Concerns raised included: reduced incentive to place agency limit orders on the CSE due to high costs; immediate execution of agency at-the-market and marketable limit orders on CSE at the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') BBO without an opportunity for price improvement; and the failure of CSE preferencing dealers to place their limit orders on the CSE book. II. Description The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend and extend the existing pilot program of the Exchange relating to the preferencing of public agency market and marketable limit orders by approved dealers and other proprietary members. The Commission originally approved the pilot in February, 1991, 6 and subsequently extended the pilot several times. 7 The current approval expires August 6, 1994. The Commission's staff requested that the Exchange seek a limited extension to coincide with the recently approved Boston Stock Exchange's (``BSE'') competing specialist pilot program 8 so that the Commission can consolidate its future review of the preferencing programs of the various exchanges. 9 6 See supra note 3. 7 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 29524 (Aug. 5, 1991), 56 FR 38160; 30353 (Feb. 7, 1992), 57 FR 5918; 31011 (Aug. 7, 1992), 57 FR 38704; 32280 (May 7, 1993), 58 FR 28422; and 33975 (April 28, 1994), 59 FR 23243. 8 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34078, 59 FR 27082 (May 25, 1994) (``BSE Approval''). The BSE pilot was approved for one year expiring May 18, 1995. 9 The Commission recently approved a CSE proposal implementing information barrier procedures for Designated Dealers (``DDs''). See Securities Exchange Act Release No 34449 (July 27, 1994). The term ``Designated Dealer'' means a Proprietary Member who maintains a minimum net capital amount and who has been approved by the Securities Committee to perform market functions by entering bids and offers for Designated Issues into the system. See CSE Rule 11.9 (a)(3). The DD status obligates the dealer to guarantee execution of all public agency market orders and agency limit orders up to 2,099 shares. The CSE preferencing program allows market makers that meet certain qualifications to interact with their own order flow with respect to those orders as long as the individual market maker satisfies, among other things, best execution and other obligations designed to protect customers. 10 The rule is intended to provide market makers with the ability to retain and execute their internal order flow at the national best bid or offer (``NBBO''), provided the public limit orders on the book at that price have been executed. 11 10 For a description of the CSE Preferencing program, see supra, note 3: See also CSE Rule 11.9 (l), (m), and (u). The CSE is totally automated and utilizes a competing market maker system. Its members transmit orders, make markets, receive instant executions and reports through remote terminals or computer interfaces from around the country. The limit order book is open on the CSE and a market maker or broker must display his best interest if he or she wants to trade. 11 In a 1990 letter, the CSE wrote: [a]t all times, the CSE market makers and brokers are subject to being ``hit'' by brokers representing public orders or by professionals on or off exchange floors. In addition, public orders are guaranteed executions at the NBBO for up to 2099 shares, and market makers often display sizes in excess of that number which are subject to be taken at the literal flick of a switch. No other exchange trader, whether he be a market maker or specialist, is so exposed or out on an electronic limb. We believe that the preferencing rule makes a small dent in this electronic competitive disadvantage and will encourage well-capitalized market makers to learn the system and ultimately to provide deeper electronic makers. See letter from Frederick Moss, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, CSE, to Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, dated November 14, 1990. The proposal amends CSE rules, effective through May 18, 1995. 12 As part of a recent analysis of its preferencing program, the Exchange has reviewed the Division of Market Regulation's (``Division'') five recommendations in Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments which are directed toward all market makers in listed stocks, including third market makers and firms internalizing order flow. 13 The Exchange, as a result, proposes to codify the Division's recommendations by amending or clarifying current CSE Rules. 12 In approving the initial pilot, the CSE agreed to several limitations or requirements, which will continue to apply. These conditions limit the number of issues (350) in which a preferencing dealer may be registered; require the Exchange to provide certain information to the Commission; prohibit preferenced trading for index arbitrage purposes when ``circuit breakers'' are in effect; and prohibit the preferencing of any order which the preferencing dealer has purchased from the customer for a direct cash payment. 13 See Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments (``Market 2000''), Study III, p. 14 (Jan. 1994). First, the Exchange proposes to add interpretive language to CSE Rule 12.10, the Exchange's ``best execution'' rule requiring members, as part of their Fiduciary obligation to provide best execution for their customers' orders. This new obligation requires a member to expose to the national market system all or a representative portion of any limit order which is priced either on or between the NBBO, unless (1) the order is immediately executed, or (2) the customer expressly requests that the order not be exposed. Second, the CSE is concerned that dealers should not trade ahead of customer limit orders. CSE rule 12.6 currently provides that no member may buy or sell a security for its own account when it holds an unexecuted customer market or like-priced limit order in that security. 14 In order to encourage all members to place public agency limit orders on the CSE book, the Exchange proposes to amend CSE Rule 11.10(e) to eliminate the transaction charge on public agency limit orders. 14 One way for members to comply with this requirement would be to place their customer limit orders on the CSE limit order book. Third, the CSE is proposing to codify that if a dealer holds a customer buy order and a customer sell order that can be crossed, the dealer should cross those orders without interposing itself as dealer. While the CSE maintains that it historically has interpreted its Rule 12.6 to require the crossing of like-priced customer buy and sell orders, to remove any doubt, the CSE proposes to make that requirement explicit. Fourth, the Exchange proposes to codify that dealers should establish and adhere to fixed standards for queuing and executing customer orders. This will facilitate CSE enforcement of standards to maintain the integrity of its market. Fifth, consistent with the ITS trade-through and block policies, dealers will continue to be prohibited from trading at a price outside the ITS BBO without satisfying the market interest at the price. Finally, in order to gauge the impact of the preferencing program on the CSE and on the national market system, the Exchange has agreed to provide the Commission with quarterly reports similar to those required of the BSE as part of its competing specialist pilot. These reports will provide the following information:
