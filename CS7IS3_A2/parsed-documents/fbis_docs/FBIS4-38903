Nobody among the Russian military was injured, according to the headquarters of the Russian border guards in Tajikistan. It said that during the operation held on 31 May and 1 June the troops combed the areas adjoining the Pyandzh section of the Tajik-Afghan border to neutralise opposition militants of the so-called "Pyandzh-Kumsangir front." The militants often shelled Russian border posts and mined border areas. The headquarters also said that opposition militants are concentrating on the Afghan territory in the villages of Andzhiz and Yalur close to the section of the Moskovskiy border detachment. The military warned that they may fire on the opposition strongholds on Afghan territory to suppress the militants if the latter attack Russian border guards or Tajik government forces. "Adequate measures will be taken. Enemy strongholds will be eliminated regardless of their place of location," the military said.
