He said that the United States are proud of their contribution to Poland's success and stressed that they are the biggest foreign investor in Poland. Talbott disclosed that apart from issues related to economy his talks focused on Poland's efforts to enter the European security structures. The American politician added that the "Partnership for Peace" programme is a way leading to NATO but added that the date of Poland's admittance into the organization remains an open question. Talbott expressed the conviction that Poland appreciated the significance of her participation in the "Partnership for Peace" programme. He explained that the programme aims at stepping up Poland's integration with NATO and that the creation of mechanisms allowing for the transition from the era of divisions and competition to the era of integration and cooperation remains at the foundation of the programme. Talbott recalled that Poland's security and independence of other countries of eastern and central Europe are of special significance for the United States. He stressed that the American administration was of the opinion that there can be no spheres of influence in this part of Europe and the countries in this region should maintain equal-footing relations, irrespective of their potential.
