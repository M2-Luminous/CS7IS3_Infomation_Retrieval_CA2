As we know, the main rivalry that has developed with respect to laying the pipeline, which promises huge profits, is between Russia and Turkey. Although this issue also affects the interests of Armenia, Georgia, and Iran, these countries can only indirectly influence the selection of a plan from among those available. The Turkish plan envisages the laying of pipeline along the routing Kazakhstan-Azerbaijan-Iran-Turkey, following which the oil will leave the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan in tankers and travel westward. In agreement with this routing on the whole, the West has expressed the desire that the pipeline pass through Armenia instead of Iran. This would preclude its dependence on the unpredictable Iran. The routing proposed in the Moscow plan differs radically from the Turkish proposal and entails laying the pipeline from Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan across the Northern Caucasus to Novorossiysk, where tankers would transport the oil to designated delivery points. Whereas Ankara's program seemed preferable to the West over the initial period, Russia's increased influence over the past year is presently forcing a more serious look at the Novorossiysk version. As a counteraction to this version, Ankara is now presenting before diplomatic and political circles the issue of review of the treaties on use of the Straits, providing justification for this by virtue of concern over the ecological state of the straits in the Bosphorus and Dardanelles and Sea of Marmara, and over the safety of the population of Istanbul situated in the path of the oil tankers. Ankara has already been attempting for a long time now to effect a review of the Montreux Convention and obtain greater control over the Straits. The Turkish arguments have become more convincing following the collision of two Cyprian tankers in the immediate offshore area of Istanbul, as a result of which significant quantities of oil spilled into the sea. Turkish firefighters required three days to extinguish the flames, and the oil has not yet completely come to the surface. Turkish diplomats are trying to use this pretext in the best way to reinforce their demands for a review of the convention and for an immediate reduction in the volume of oil transported through the Straits. Turkey's Minister of Foreign Affairs H. Cetin has already declared that tanker movement through the Straits will be reduced. This wholly contradicts the points stipulated in the Montreux Convention. Such a position would inflict a strong blow to Russia's economic and political interests, and in returning to its prior geopolitical space, Moscow can hardly be expected to tolerate a disregard for these interests on Turkey's part. The latter realizes this full well and, in order to avoid leaving Moscow out of the game, has proposed a new variant--initially deliver the oil out of Novorossiysk to Samsun, and from there to Ceyhan. This routing would allow the Turkish side to control the significant section of the pipeline that passes through its territory. During the days of the uproar over the accident in the Bosphorus, when the Novorossiysk version was threatened and chances once again appeared for the Baku-Ceyhan routing, explosions resounding in Batman again reminded everyone of the Kurdish factor--one of the main arguments against the Turkish alternative. This is the fourth such instance occurring in the southeastern region of the country. The first three took place along the Shrnak segment of the Baghdad-Ceyhan pipeline, and the damage they caused did not turn out to be very significant only because the pipeline has not been operational since the Gulf War. The disruptions in Batman have turned out to be far more substantive. According to American sources, the damage comes to about $60 million. A very large-scale oil production combine, built in 1955, is situated near this little city, with its 60,000 inhabitants. What occurred in Batman provides a weighty argument against exporting oil across Turkish territory. As a result, serious factors currently stand in the way of both sets of plans. Whereas Turkey may attempt to exert pressure in the Straits issue, it cannot ignore the problem with the Kurds. The lack of desire and inability of Turkish leaders to resolve the Kurdish problem over the course of decades is once again threatening the country's economic progress. At one time terrorist acts inflicted an extremely serious blow to the development of tourism, which brings in tremendous revenues. But the obstacles that stand in the way of the Russian routing are surmountable. There need only be renewed discussion of the provisions of the Montreux Convention and a decision made. And so, following serious rivalry over influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia, as a result of which Ankara had to hang its head and quit the region, we now await a new and important struggle surrounding the question of status of the Straits.
