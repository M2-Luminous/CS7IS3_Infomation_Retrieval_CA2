Many of them have retuned after the graduation. As CRI's [China Radio International] (Zhao Jianpu) discovered, China has just set up an information system to help make it the best use of these talented young people. Here is (Tian Hong) with the details: China has just set up a worldwide computer network to collect and give information for both the country's talent hunters and returned students. (Gong Changshun) from the China Service Center for Scholarly Exchange says the information system will be a great help for the country in retrieving these talents. [Gong in Mandarin fading into English translation] Gong Changshun says the system has come just in time as more and more students are finishing their courses and returning home. The official says since 1978 when China began its open-door policy, the country has sent many people abroad for advanced studies. Also a large number of others have gone abroad privately-funded. Statistics show that so far the number of returned students have reached 70,000. More than 140,000 are still studying abroad. Gong Changshun says both the returned and those who are still abroad are concerned as to how they can best serve their country. But many of them have not found suitable positions, due to a lack of information. [Gong in Mandarin fading into English translation] Gong Changshun says the computer network covers most parts of China and every Chinese embassy and consulate abroad. Due to the network, information about the supply and demand of these talented young people can be obtained immediately. In this way, people can not only find more choices for their skills, but also can effectively be introduced into joint-venture projects to aid the country's economy. The official says that most talent hunters and students who have returned or are still abroad are welcome to join the scheme. The hotline number of the network is 205-1306, that is 205-1306. For China Radio International, this is (Tian Hong).
