The realization ratio of inter-Korean trade -- the ratio of the amount of trade actually realized to the amount the government approved in advance -- reached an all-time high of 93.9 percent last year, according to the KFTA. The ratio was only 53.7 percent and 57.9 percent in 1990 and 1991, respectively, before soaring to 81.2 percent in 1992. A KFTA official said, "you can say the period between 1989 and 1992 was a mock-up stage for inter-Korean trade, but from last year the trade entered into a stable period." An official at Samsung Co., which recorded the most trade with the North last year, said, "South Korean investment in the North was put off after the inter-Korean working-level contact ruptured. But trade is still going on."
