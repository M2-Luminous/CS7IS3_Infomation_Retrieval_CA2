The way MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS sees it, today will witness the signing of an edict on the creation of an Administration for Information Support of the Russian Federation President's Staff. A likely appointee to the position of the administration's head is Petr Filippov. (He is now in charge of the analytical center for socioeconomic policy). The administration's structure calls for three departments: a department for work with the press, a department for work with television, and an analytical department. Some 40 people will be on the payroll. Quite possibly, accusations of open propaganda and agitation will be showered on the future administration. Indeed, it sets as its goal not just a mechanical transfer of information to the mass media, but also its analysis and interpretation. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has managed to learn that the immediate plan of the future administration's work includes summing up and analyzing all information coming from the regions. Also planned are regular conferences in Moscow of the heads of regional press services with representatives of the president.
