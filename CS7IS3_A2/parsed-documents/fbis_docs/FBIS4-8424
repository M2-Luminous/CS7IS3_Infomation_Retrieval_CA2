[Kulin] Economic integration and adjustment to the European Union's [EU] legal system are the primary tasks, and NATO membership and the establishment of a joint defense system may be a consequence of these. [Gal] For us, the question is how to join Europe because it is clear that we have to join. It is impossible not to join. [passage omitted] Joining Europe is concomitant with the acceptance of a certain value system, our Hungarianness has to be adjusted to certain forms of behavior. Fortunately, a process of decentralization has started in Europe, the regions and links within the regions are playing an increasingly important role. This kind of integration ensures that national characteristics will not disappear. The most important question of European membership is how we can integrate ourselves with the least amount of sacrifices and making the most of the advantages. [passage omitted] [Kover] I also believe that there is no alternative to Western integration and orientation. Neither isolation -- which is advocated by some extremist parties -- nor Eastern orientation are feasible ways. In my view, NATO membership is not primarily justified by security policy arguments in the narrow sense of the word. It is not because we have anything to fear either from the Romanians or the Serbs that we should join as soon as possible, rather, because NATO membership is a guarantee for investors of the developed Western world. [Gal] I agree that NATO membership would be a kind of guarantee, at the same time, Hungary's security also depends on the size of foreign interest in our economy. Gaining membership in the EU will be a long process, therefore, it would be worthwhile to consider whether political and economic membership could be separated from the point of view of scheduling. The political institutions have a greater willingness to accept us. [passage omitted] [Oszy-Toth] The leading politicians of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] are talking about the danger of left-wing restoration while the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is advocating democratic socialism. Can Zoltan Gal tell us the difference between the so-called democratic socialism and the already known versions (existing, flourishing, and so on) of socialism. Is restoration really possible? [Gal] At the most, threatening with the danger of restoration can only achieve momentary successes at our opponents' campaign meetings, but no serious political force can believe that this could happen in Hungary. We are part of and we endure world economic processes that we cannot much influence. People who want restoration here are simply fools. [passage omitted] Democratic socialism is not an emphatic part of our written program, however, it has turned into a campaign issue because our political opponents have mentioned it so many times. The chairman of the Socialist International spoke about this during his recent visit to Hungary. The MSZP is part of this world movement, its politics are in accordance with this. We naturally represent the ideas of democratic socialism. In our view, democratic socialism means some kind of critical attitude to all that we call capitalism or social market economy. We start from the premise that this social system is not the best one. A world that carries an extreme amount of contradictions within society produces rich people and millions who are pushed to the periphery of society. We aim to continuously criticize and reform this system. [passage omitted] [Kulin] I agree with Zoltan Gal in that it can only appear in campaign speeches that the MSZP's coming to government would mean restoration in the sense that the central planning system would be brought back and the political structure concomitant with this would be reborn. We are afraid of something completely different and we think that the MSZP's governing is dangerous and should be avoided. The transformation in Hungary and the changeover to the market economy indeed started in the socialist framework, before the change of the regime in 1990. The social basis of the changes was limited to a political-economic elite. If the elite of this period came to power, they would halt the process of bourgeois transformation in Hungary. The MSZP's basis today is an elite who were the recipients and beneficiaries of the last decade of socialism on one hand, the rest of them being Hungarian citizens living on wages and salaries who would vote for the MSZP purely on the basis of their sentiment for the socialist ideology. In other words, out of nostalgia rather than conscious choice. The political background supporting the MSZP is of a much worse quality than what is represented by the party's political elite. [passage omitted] [Oszy-Toth] Various coalition speculations have been revealed before the elections. What are your views on the election chances of your parties and with whom would you form an alliance? [Kover] I would not like to start guessing the chances because many things can happen under the current circumstances with still a month before the elections. A good prediction now may prove completely wrong tomorrow. Naturally, I trust the effectiveness of the liberal agreement that was made by four parties, including the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. I also trust that this bloc, and the Fidesz within it, will be a determining force in the next coalition. As a matter of fact, the Fidesz's national committee or congress will decide on coalition matters. This does not mean that different views cannot exist within the Fidesz's board or party leadership as regards the coalition. [passage omitted] [Gal] In my view, we would need a certain "grand coalition" in the social sense of the term. This means that the political forces should come to an agreement on certain basic issues. We spent the past four years questioning even each other's existence. I believe that these elections will make it clear that, in addition to the conservative-national and liberal views, the value system represented by the left-wing parties cannot be questioned in this country, either. I agree with Kover in that it would be too early to make guesses because we do not even know the results. We are preparing for governing in coalition and we accept the responsibility of governing. Our strategic goal is to replace the current coalition and to make it impossible to govern by ignoring us, as has been done in the past four years. I mainly see a possibility for cooperation with the liberal side. For me, a Christian democratic party or movement that approaches the problems in the way the pope does would be attractive. In my view, a coalition with a socialist, liberal, Christian democratic, and Christian social attitude would be feasible. [Kulin] I find it important to emphasize two principles when assessing the coalition chances. We will not under any circumstances ally ourselves with extreme forces. However, we consider all parties that are sincere about the political struggle against the socialist alternative as potential coalition partners. I am very sorry that one month before the elections, groups that cannot clearly decide whether cooperation with the Socialists is a possibility for them still exist among the liberal political forces. In my view, the postponement of this decision spoils the historical chances of liberalism in Hungary.
