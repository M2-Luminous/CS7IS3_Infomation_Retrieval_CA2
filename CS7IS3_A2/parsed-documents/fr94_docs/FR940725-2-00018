The Amended PR Agreement revises the existing partial requirements arrangement between the parties to broaden the types of power supply arrangements that AMEA may obtain.

The TCS Agreement makes available to AMEA other transmission and complementary services that are, or may be, required in conjunction with resource purchases by AMEA or with other transactions in which AMEA may desire to engage from time to time. The rates, terms, and conditions applicable to these services are set forth in exhibits appended to the TCS Agreement, many of which utilize formula rate methodologies and procedures.
