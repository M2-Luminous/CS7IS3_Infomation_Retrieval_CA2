In a joint operation on 9 June, Tucuman police and Argentine Federal Police detained Diaz Reategui, 36, at a hotel in Tucuman, 1,412 km northwest of Buenos Aires. He had been meeting with 10 fellow countrymen, who managed to escape. Tucuman Federal Judge Ricardo Maturana, who is hearing the case, asked the Interpol office in Peru to deny or confirm Diaz Reategui's testimony. The sources noted: "Diaz Reategui coordinated his visit with his followers. They probably crossed the border on forged certificates of residence and visas from Paraguay to Argentina, via Buenos Aires, from where they traveled to other provincial capitals like Cordoba, Jujuy, Salta, and Tucuman." The court sources added that the Peruvian Upper Huallaga region, where the former Shining Path member was operating, "is a region where the world's largest coca plantations exist, a region where cocaine paste is processed and subsequently refined for marketing by the Colombian `cartels.'" The Argentine Federal Police Press Division added that the Shining Path cell, of which Diaz Reategui was a member, "had been tracked for about one year." The Tucuman police are still tracking the other 10 people who accompanied Diaz Reategui on the day of his arrest and are attempting to determine what the former Shining Path member and his followers were doing in Tucuman and in other provinces.
