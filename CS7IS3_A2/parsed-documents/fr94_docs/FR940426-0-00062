FR940426-0-00062 FR940426-0-00012 E. Date of Effectiveness A sponsor is required to file an amendment to Form ADV to include the necessary wrap fee brochure or brochures, to deliver the wrap fee brochure to existing wrap fee clients, 41 and to begin to deliver the wrap fee brochure to prospective wrap fee clients, by October 1, 1994, approximately five months after the adoption of the amendments. 42 41 See Section I.D supra. 42 The Proposing Release requested comment whether a 120-day transition period would be appropriate. A few commenters stated that a 180-day transition period would be more appropriate. II. Cost/Benefit Analysis Several commenters raised concerns that the form and rule amendments as proposed, particularly the requirement for a separate wrap fee brochure, could result in additional costs for sponsors that may be passed on to investors. The Commission has modified the amendments in part because of these concerns, but continues to believe that the cost of a separate wrap fee brochure is outweighed by the benefit to investors of improved disclosure about wrap fee programs. The Commission has narrowed the scope of the terms ``wrap fee program'' and ``sponsor.'' As a result, certain advisers that would have incurred the costs of the wrap fee brochure under the proposed amendments will not incur any costs as a result of the amendments, and other advisers will incur reduced costs because fewer of their programs are subject to the amendments. The Commission has also liberalized the use of stickers, which should reduce the cost of updating the brochure. The Commission does not believe that the cost of a separate wrap fee brochure need be substantial. The brochure need not be professionally printed, and professionally printed brochures generally can be updated by sticker, rendering frequent reprinting unnecessary. 43 43 One commenter suggested that sponsors would find professional printing necessary for marketing purposes. Many sponsors, however, currently deliver Part II, rather than a printed document, to clients as their brochure. Many sponsors that use Part II presumably would deliver a typewritten wrap fee brochure to wrap fee clients. III. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis A summary of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, which was prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603, was published in Investment Advisers Act Rel. No. 1401. No comments were received on this analysis. The Commission has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, a copy of which may be obtained by contacting Eric C. Freed, Office of Disclosure and Investment Adviser Regulation, Division of Investment Management, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. IV.
