FR940516-0-00068 FR940516-0-00017 Bureau of Consular Affairs 22 CFR Part 41 [Public Notice 2005] Visas: Documentation of Nonimmigrants Under the Immigration and Nationality Act Visa Fees AGENCY: Bureau of Consular Affairs, DOS. ACTION: Interim rule. SUMMARY: This rule adds a surcharge provision to part 41 title 22, Code of Federal Regulations. The amendment to the regulations authorizes the Secretary of State, pursuant to the provisions of section 140 of Public Law 103&hyph;236, to collect a surcharge for processing applications for machine readable nonimmigrant visas and machine readable combined border crossing cards. This surcharge is herein referred to as the ``MRV surcharge''. The authority vested in the Secretary of State mandates appropriate amendments to the nonimmigrant regulations. DATES: Effective date: May 16, 1994. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on or before June 15, 1994. addresses: Comments should be submitted to Chief, Legislation and Regulations Division, Visa Services, Washington, DC 20520&hyph;0113. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen K. Fischel, Chief, Legislation and Regulations Division, Visa Services, Washington, DC, (202) 663&hyph;1204. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 30, 1994, the President signed into law Public Law 103&hyph;236, State Department Authorization Bill for Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995. The provisions of section 140 of this law grant the Secretary of State the authority to collect a surcharge for the processing of applications of machine readable nonimmigrant visas and machine readable combined border crossing cards. Such authority is new and requires appropriate amendment of the visa regulations at 22 CFR 41.107. Current Authority Section 281 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides that the Secretary of State shall establish fees for the issuance of nonimmigrant visas based upon reciprocity. Pursuant to this section of law, the Secretary of State where practicable prescribes a fee to be imposed upon nationals of a foreign country that corresponds with all the visa related costs charged U.S. citizens by that foreign country. The Department's implementing regulation, at 22 CFR 41.107(a), restates the statutory principle authorizing the Secretary of State to collect nonimmigrant visa issuance fees based on reciprocity. As a reciprocal charge, the fee prescribed by the Secretary reflects the total costs imposed by a foreign state on U.S. nationals. If no costs are incurred, no fee is prescribed. The fees collected pursuant to section 281 are remitted to the general funds of the U.S. Treasury. MRV Surcharge Section 140 of the State Department Authorization Bill authorizes a surcharge to be imposed for machine readable visas and border crossing cards notwithstanding INA 281 and the regulations at ยง41.107. This new fee may, therefore, be charged for processing applications for machine readable visas, independent of fees prescribed pursuant to reciprocity under the provisions of section 281 of the Act. Moreover, surcharges collected pursuant to section 140 may be retained by the Department up to $107 million for FY 94 and FY 95 combined. The regulation at section 41.107 is being amended to authorize the collection of this surcharge separate from and in addition to any other fee. The amount of the surcharge and justification for that amount are subjects of a separate regulation being promulgated by the Under Secretary of State for Management. Interim Rule In order to implement the provisions of section 140, Public Law 103&hyph;236, the regulation at ยง41.107 is being amended to authorize the Secretary of State to collect the surcharge, separate from or independent from and in addition to any other fee, for processing applications for machine readable nonimmigrant visas and machine readable combined border crossing identification cards and nonimmigrant visas. The implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provision for post-promulgation comments, is based upon the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and 553(d)(3). The authorization for the collection of a processing fee for machine readable nonimmigrant visas and machine readable combination border crossing cards mandated by Public Law 103&hyph;236 takes effect on April 30, 1994. This rule must take effect upon publication to ensure that the Department maximizes surcharge revenues for the balance of FY&hyph;94. The Department will be relying on such revenues to fund accelerated installation of an imposed visa processing and issuing technology at consular posts. The installation of such technology has become a high priority for the United States in light of the World Trade Center bombing and increasing concern about visa fraud and alien terrorist activity in the United States. This rule is not considered to be a major rule for purposes of E.O. 12291; nor is it expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In addition, this rule does not impose information collection requirements under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. This rule has been reviewed as required by E.O. 12778 and certified to be in compliance therewith. This rule is exempt from review under E.O. 12866, but has been reviewed internally by the Department to ensure consistency with the objectives thereof. List of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 41 Aliens, Nonimmigrants, Passports and visas, Fees, Surcharge. Accordingly, 22 CFR part 41, is amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for part 41 would continue to read as follows: PART 41_[AMENDED] Authority: 8 U.S.C. 1104. 2. Sec. 41.107 is amended by adding paragraph (e) to read as follows: ยง41.107 Visa fees. * * * * * (e) Visa processing surcharge. In addition to the collection of the fee prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, a consular officer shall collect or ensure the collection of a surcharge for the processing of applications for machine readable nonimmigrant visas and for machine readable combined border crossing cards in the amount specified by the Secretary of State from such applicants as the Secretary of State shall designate. Such surcharge is refundable only if, as a result of action taken by the U.S. Goverment for which the alien was not responsible and over which the alien had no control, the alien's application is not processed. Dated: May 4, 1994. Mary A. Ryan, Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11860 Filed 5&hyph;11&hyph;94; 3:24 pm] BILLING CODE 4710&hyph;06&hyph;M
