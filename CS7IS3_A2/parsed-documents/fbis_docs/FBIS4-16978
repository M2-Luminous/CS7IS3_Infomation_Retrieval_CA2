Boris Yeltsin said that there has been real collaboration with the Federation Council and the State Duma. "I have frequent meetings with Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan Rybkin, we discuss issues of concern to Russia, and we reach agreement in a calm atmosphere. This style of work has a positive effect on the general political improvement in the country," the president said. Boris Yeltsin confirmed that the signing of the Agreement on Civic Peace and Accord will take place on 28 April in St. George's Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace. About 140 organizations are expected to take part in the ceremony. The president called for the agreement to be signed by all branches of power, political parties, and public organizations. He believes that representatives of the power structures of the krays, oblasts, and Russian Federation republics should also sign the document. Of those political forces who have so far opposed signing the agreement, Boris Yeltsin said: "We will not insist on them signing this document." Russians, he added "will see for themselves what the words of such leaders and their programs mean in practice." The head of state noted that, so far, only the Communists have stated their opposition to signing the agreement, but "perhaps, this only applies to a section of their leadership," the president remarked. "We want this document to be a major political step, like in Spain, where a similar memorandum was also signed," he said. A special coordinating commission should monitor implementation of the agreement, the president believes. I think, said Boris Yeltsin, that the accords on military issues initialled in March 1994 create a legal and diplomatic framework for completing the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Latvia, and for resolving questions relating to this matter in a civilized manner. "They became possible as a result of sensible compromises and responsible attitudes, and they correspond to the real long-term interests not only of the peoples of our countries but of the entire region, of Europe as a whole." I hope "to have a meeting with Guntis Ulmanis in the near future where a package of the initialled agreements will be signed, which will become a turning-point in the relations between our two countries," Russian president said.
