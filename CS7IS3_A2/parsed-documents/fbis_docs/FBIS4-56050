Two days later, it held its constituent congress. The movement's leadership, composed of chairwoman Anna Galovicova, PhD, deputy chairman Lubomir Sausa, and secretary Imrich Ciffra, visited our editorial office yesterday to inform us about the plans and goals of this new political entity. The movement was established as a force of harmonization, whose task is to free us of emotional conflicts and campaign and post- election struggles. The HT wants to run in the early parliamentary elections independently, but it is not opposed to cooperation with other political entities either. It has launched a petition campaign to obtain the required number of signatures to participate in elections to the National Council of the Slovak Republic. [passage omitted]
