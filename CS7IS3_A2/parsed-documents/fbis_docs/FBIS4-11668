The movement, in a statement yesterday evening, held Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin responsible for this crime. The following is the full text of the statement: In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate, a statement issued by the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, Fatah: The new, hideous massacre that the Israeli forces committed on 28 March 1994 against a number of cadres and leaders of the Fatah's movement's organizational action in Gaza -- and which was carried out by an organized and premeditated plot -- confirms a determination to destroy the peace process. It was a direct assassination in which targets were picked out and monitored by special forces in order to hit the officials in charge of organizing our movement and dealing a blow to their role of struggle, whether on the peace process level or on the level of future building and development. Our movement, Fatah, while stressing its denunciation and condemnation of the crime targetted against them on the eve of the Cairo meeting aimed at taking measures to restore security and stability in Hebron, holds the Israeli Army leadership, headed by Defense and Prime Minister Rabin, responsible for this crime. We also strongly condemn the position the Israelis initially announced when they believed that those assassinated were members of Hamas and not Fatah. It is an exposed attempt to cause a division between Fatah and Hamas, jihad and the popular movement, al-Fidah, al-Nidal, al-Tahrir al-Filistiniyah, and others of our people's struggling forces. The attempt to divide the children of our people through killings and assassinations is rejected in principle. Our concern for the blood of the sons of our movement is the same concern for the blood and lives of all strugglers and all our struggling, steadfast, and persevering people. The Israeli Government's praise today of the criminal act and the precision of its execution proves Rabin's determination to impose a de facto situation that will impede the continuing implemention of measures serving the peace process. It is trying to impose realities on us that would lead to hammering a wedge between Palestinians and cause trouble between the children of our people. Our condemnation of the forces opposing peace imposes upon us the duty to protect our people by all means, including implementation of Resolution 904, which calls for international protection for our people, to take all cautionary and precautionary methods, and to make strong denunciations to put a limit to those criminal acts that legitimize the spilling of Palestinian blood. We remind our brothers that we face the same treatment as our Algerian brothers received by the secret army movement and the settlers in Algeria. It is being repeated on our Palestinian land with units of the Israeli Army conniving with armed settlers. [passage omitted]
