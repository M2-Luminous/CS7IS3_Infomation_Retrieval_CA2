Prior to his departure this morning for an official three European nation tour that will cover Austria, Germany and Romania, Li told the press that China's policy is to enable the economy to develop in a sustainable, fast and healthy manner. China has taken a series of macro-economic control measures since June last year in a bid to curtail inflation, the Chinese premier said. These measures included cutting back on the size of capital construction, controlling the fast growth of consumption funds, promoting agricultural production and the urban vegetable basket project and tightening the control over prices. "These measures have yielded positive results," he said. "The price hikes have begun to fall off over the past few months." Though China has not reduced the growth rate to the targeted nine percent, he noted, it has been slowed down. China's imports and exports have grown at a double-digit rate, far higher than that of the national economy. "This will no doubt contribute to the healthy development of the national economy and China's opening up," he said.
