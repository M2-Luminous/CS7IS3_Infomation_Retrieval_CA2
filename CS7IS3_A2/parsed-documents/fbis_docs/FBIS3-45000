Wang Shenghuai, Vice-President of Guangdong Textile Import and Export Corporation, said he hopes China and the U.S. will find a satisfying solution to this sensitive issue during the coming fourth round of talks on textile quotas scheduled from January 15 to 17. "If a solution can't be reached, we are planning to retaliate in order to make up our losses," he said. The U.S. announced last week its intention to cut quotas for China s textile imports by 25-35 percent in response to illicit transshipments of Chinese textiles bearing labels of other countries. The reduction would slash Chinese textile exports to the U.S. by almost $1.2 billion. Wang s company, a leading textile exporter to the U.S., is under great pressure if the cuts take effect on January 17. More than 20 percent of the company's exports are shipped to the U.S. The company has been doing textile business with U.S. companies for 16 years. For the past years, exports to the U.S. have been stable, with an annual average of $90 million, Wang said. Under the 25-35 percent cuts quoted by the American side, the company would lose 70 million yuan ($8 million) in profits this year. A recent study conducted on five of his factories that send the bulk of their products to the U.S. market showed more than 6,000 workers might be laid off. Businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan, especially those who have opened textile plants in the mainland, are now hesitating about doing further business in the area. "They are afraid of going bankrupt if the contracted goods are among the still-unannounced 88 types of products that are having their quotas reduced by the U.S.," said Wang. "The U.S. should have joined hands with the Chinese side to clamp down on illegal textile activities, rather than hurting innocent people," Wang said. "The Chinese Government has been tough and cracked down on illegal textile traders," he said. Two inspection teams from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) visited Wang's company last year, even though it has not been involved in any illegal trade. "It is unfair to cut our quotas," said Wang. On the other hand, Wang added: "China should learn from this not to rely on one country in its future world trade.
