Yesterday, Jorge Arturo Reina, first vice president of the legislative branch, arrived at legislative branch headquarters and said that "we cannot rule out the fact that democracy is always exposed to dangers and that there are always minds capable of hatching anything to destabilize democratic order." "I, however, think that the problem should neither be overblown nor minimized," he added, after denying that this is a "smokescreen." He said "that this is absolutely false because it was not planned by Honduran intelligence or the government. It was kindly passed on by a neighboring government (Nicaragua) to the Honduran Government." As for Private Secretary Lucio Izaguirre's hint that there are Liberals seeking to destabilize the government, Reina said he had not heard about it. But he clarified that "no one is conspiring in Honduras, there is no national goal to do so and much less within our political party," "The Liberal Party is more united than ever. It is normal for someone to voice his views within the Liberal Party, and this will continue to happen because we censor no one." As for the economic crisis and announced increases in electricity rates, the president's brother said that there is a need for ample and clear explanation on the real situation in the country to ensure that Hondurans are informed and support the thankless and bitter decisions that the government has to make.
