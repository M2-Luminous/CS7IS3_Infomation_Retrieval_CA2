The U.S.-Russian summit and the documents signed by the two sides indicated that although there is some progress in building up the U.S.-Russian "partnership," disagreements remain on a series of issues concerning their own respective interests. Clinton visited Russia after Russia had just elected its new parliament last December. The Moscow Declaration claimed that the U.S.-Russian relations had entered into a new stage of a matured strategic partnership. The first achievement of the visit is that Russia, the United States and Ukraine signed an agreement on eliminating nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil, removing the major obstacle that has been affecting Kiev's relations with Moscow and Washington. Ukraine is the third largest nuclear power in the world with 176 strategic missiles and about 1,500 nuclear warheads, all aimed at the United States. Russia is concerned about its nuclear neighbor too. After numerous rounds of negotiations, while pressing Ukraine, the United States and Russia also made certain compromises promising security and economic compensation. Ukraine's consent to eliminate the nuclear weapons in its territory served to finally relax the United States and Russia. Clinton pointed out that only after the United States and Russia have built up this "partnership" will it be possible for Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine to agree to eliminate their nuclear weapons. On bilateral relations between Russia and the United States, Clinton reiterated his support for Yeltsin and his reform policy. Meanwhile, Clinton also voiced his support for new political forces advocating "a market economy and democratic values" in Russia. The agreement further pushed bilateral trade and economic relations forward. Russia's agreement to sell 500 tons of uranium to America in the next 20 years settled one of the most controversial issues in the bilateral trade war of the last two years. Clinton also announced plans to lift most of the restrictions on Russia's commodities entering the U.S. market, a big gain for Russia which is working hard to become an equal trade partner with the West. Another important topic discussed at the summit was security. While Russia was worrying about NATO's granting membership to former Warsaw Pact countries and Baltic nations, Clinton appeased Russia with the "Partnership for Peace" plan which had just been approved at the NATO summit. To some extent, the plan has taken into consideration Russia's security interest and decided to achieve the integration of NATO and Middle and East European countries through different stages. Thus it put Moscow's worries to rest. It was commented that Clinton's visit didn't bring anything new into the bilateral relations. The disagreements between the two nations on certain important issues will continue to affect the development of the bilateral relations, such as the regional conflicts in former Soviet Union. Moreover, in regard to bilateral economic relations, Yeltsin reiterated that Russia doesn't count on America's aid but asks the United States to open its market and eliminate trade restrictions. In addition, the two sides have differences on the issue of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Russia's relations with three Baltic countries. The prospect of the "strategic partnership" between the United States and Russia depends on not only the Russian domestic political situation, but also on the stand the two sides will take on the above issues in the future.
