He told a report meeting on the current situation organized by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China today that the fundamental reason for the differences on the political system in Hong Kong is that the British side has changed its policy on the Hong Kong issue and adopted an uncooperative and even antagonistic stance in an attempt to maintain its influence after 1997. He noted that since the very beginning of the talks, the British side showed no sincerity and stubbornly stuck to its political reform bill that violates the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law of the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong and the relevant understanding and agreements reached between the two countries. Not long ago, the Hong Kong Legislative Council, under the control of the British side, passed that package, thus shutting the door to talks, he said. The British side went on to publish a white paper to disclose the detailed contents of last year's Sino-British talks without notifying the Chinese side, distorting facts and launching a round of fierce attack against China. In reply, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman revealed a large number of facts to show that the responsibility for the termination of the talks between the two sides rests totally on the British side. On the new airport issue in Hong Kong, Lu Ping said that the Chinese Government has always supported the Hong Kong Government's efforts to build a new airport. However, he said, the British side violated the memorandum of understanding reached between the two sides and passed a financial bill for the new airport which means a huge burden for the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Regional government. At present, he said, the Chinese Government is negotiating with the British side on the fourth budget of the bill in a bid to solve the financial issue of the new airport on the basis of the memorandum of understanding so that the new airport will be completed as much as possible before 1997.
