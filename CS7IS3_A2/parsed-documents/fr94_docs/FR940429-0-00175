FR940429-0-00175 FR940429-0-00015 Step Five: Calculating a Fair and Equitable Refund. Under the Amendments of 1992, NTI must calculate Susan's refund under State and accrediting agency guidelines, and under statutory pro rata requirements. NTI must then use whichever calculation provides the largest refund. In accordance with the June 8, 1993 Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, for all refunds other than statutory pro rata refunds, the student's unpaid charges must be subtracted from the amount the institution may otherwise retain. Therefore, in calculating Susan's refund under State and accrediting agency guidelines, $739 (from Step Four, above) must be subtracted from the amount NTI could otherwise retain. The State refund guidelines allow Susan a 20 percent refund (she withdrew after the 50 percent point but before completing 75 percent of the program), which means NTI is allowed to retain 80 percent of the institutional charges. Total institutional costs (from Step One, above) are $3620. Assessed at 80 percent, this allows NTI to retain $2896 [$3620×.80=$2896]. However, in accordance with the June 8, 1993 regulations, NTI must subtract Susan's unpaid charges of $739 (from Step Four, above) from this amount. Therefore, NTI is actually allowed to retain $2157 [$2896^$739=$2157]. Susan's refund under the State policy is $724, figured by subtracting the amount NTI can retain from the total paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) [$2881^$2157=$724]. The accrediting agency refund guidelines allow Susan a 25 percent refund (she withdrew after the 45 percent point but before completing 60 percent of the program), which means NTI is allowed to retain 75 percent of the institutional charges. Total institutional costs (from Step One, above) are $3620. Assessed at 75 percent, this allows NTI to retain $2715 [$3620×.75=$2715]. However, in accordance with the June 8, 1993 regulations, NTI must subtract Susan's unpaid charges of $739 (from Step Four, above) from this amount. Therefore, NTI is actually allowed to retain $1976 [$2715^$739=$1976]. Susan's refund under the accrediting agency policy is $905, figured by subtracting the amount NTI can retain from the total paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) [$2881^$1976=$905]. To figure Susan's refund under the statutory pro rata refund calculation, NTI must first calculate the portion of the enrollment period that remains (in accordance with §668.22(c)) by using the following formula for clock-hour programs: Hours Remaining in Period Total Hours in Period =Portion of Enrollment Period That Remains Susan's last recorded date of attendance was at the point of having completed 450 clock hours, so 450 hours remain in the program. NTI calculates that for Susan, 50 percent of the enrollment period remains [450 900=.50]. The statutory pro rata calculation allows Susan a refund proportionate to the portion of the enrollment period that remains: 50 percent. Total institutional costs (from Step One, above) are $3620. However, under the statutory pro rata refund calculation, NTI is allowed to exclude from this amount an administrative charge, not to exceed the lesser of $100 or 5 percent of the institutional charges (provided that the fee is a real and documented charge). Therefore, the $100 administrative fee charged to all NTI students can be excluded, making the total institutional costs for statutory pro rata purposes equal $3520 [$3620^$100=$3520]. (Had the administrative fee exceeded $100 or 5 percent of NTI's total institutional charges, NTI could only have excluded the allowable portion of the fee.) NTI could also exclude (from the total institutional costs) the documented cost of any returnable equipment that Susan failed to return in accordance with §668.22(c), and the documented cost of any unreturnable equipment that was actually issued to Susan (and kept by Susan) in accordance with 668.22(c). Total institutional costs are assessed at 50 percent, making Susan's initial refund equal $1760 [$3520×.50=$1760]. However, in accordance with the law, NTI must subtract Susan's unpaid charges of $739 (from Step Four, above) from her initial refund amount. Therefore, Susan's actual refund under the statutory pro rata refund calculation is $1021 [$1760^$739=$1021]. After calculating all of Susan's possible refunds, NTI must use the calculation which provides for the largest refund. In this case, the largest refund is provided by the statutory pro rata refund calculation: $1021. This refund amount must be returned, in Susan's behalf, first to the Title IV, HEA programs and then to Susan, in accordance with the allocation priorities in §668.22(g); NTI cannot bill Susan for any unpaid charges, because under the statutory pro rata refund calculation, those charges have been paid by Title IV, HEA program funds. Example # 3 Repayment Calculation Institutional Profile. United States Academy (USA) offers one- and two-year programs on a semester system; its academic year is 30 weeks long and divided into two equal semesters, each 15 weeks in length. USA participates in the Federal Pell Grant program and the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs. USA charges $800 tuition per semester. Noninstitutional costs are assessed by the semester at the following average rates: $3000 for living expenses and meals (USA has no on-campus housing or food service), $250 for books and supplies (not purchased through the institution), $600 for transportation, and $300 for personal miscellaneous expenses. (Noninstitutional cost assessments are amended as necessary based on individual student needs and circumstances.) Institutional Repayment Policy. In keeping with the local bookstore's refund policy, 50 percent of the books and supplies allowance is incurred at the time of purchase. All other noninstitutional (living) expenses are prorated based on the percentage of the semester completed. Student Profile. Sarah the Student, who lives in an off-campus apartment, enrolled for the winter semester at USA and began attending classes. She made a $400 cash payment toward her tuition costs. Her noninstitutional costs are adequately reflected in the institution's average student budget. Financial Aid Package and Disbursements. Sarah's financial aid package for the program consisted of a $1800 Federal Pell Grant and a $2000 Federal Stafford Loan. Sarah's first Federal Pell Grant disbursement ($900) was applied first to her tuition balance ($400) and the remaining $500 was then disbursed to her in cash. The first disbursement of her Federal Stafford Loan ($930_loan and origination fees have been subtracted) was also disbursed directly to her. Sarah officially withdrew after attending 4 weeks. Step One: Figuring Expenses Actually Incurred. Only noninstitutional costs are included in a repayment calculation. Institutional costs are treated in the refund calculation. (See Examples # 1 and # 2.) According to USA's repayment policy, 50 percent of Sarah's $250 books and supplies allowance was incurred at the time of purchase [$250×.50=$125]. The rest of her semester expenses, for living expenses and meals, transportation, and personal miscellaneous expenses, are prorated based on the percentage of the term completed. Total noninstitutional costs equal $3900 [$3000+$600+$300=$3900]. Because Sarah completed 4 of 15 weeks, these costs should be prorated at 27 percent [4 15=.266, rounded to the nearest tenth]. Therefore, Sarah's noninstitutional costs incurred equal $1053 [$3900×.27=$1053]. Step Two: Figuring the Total Federal Student Financial Aid (SFA) Disbursed as Cash. Sarah received $500 of her Federal Pell Grant in cash, and all of her first Stafford Loan disbursements, $930, in cash. However, in accordance with §668.22(e), the repayment calculation does not include any Title IV, HEA program loan amounts disbursed as cash, because those loan funds will have to be repaid by the student anyway. Therefore, a total of $500 cash disbursed is considered for repayment purposes. (As with the refund calculation, the repayment calculation does not include any Federal Work-Study funds disbursed as cash, because repayment of work earnings cannot be required. Notice that students Sam and Susan, from Examples # 1 and # 2 respectively, would not have owed repayments because they received no cash disbursements other than FFELP loan funds or Federal Work-Study funds.)
