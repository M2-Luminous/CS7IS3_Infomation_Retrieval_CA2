In a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali yesterday, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said that on 3, 17, 18, and 19 of January, this plane overflew large areas of Iraq and then headed back for its base in Saudi Arabia. The letter reiterated Iraq's belief that this plane is being used for purposes other than those specified by the Security Council and that its activity prejudices Iraq's security and sovereignty.
