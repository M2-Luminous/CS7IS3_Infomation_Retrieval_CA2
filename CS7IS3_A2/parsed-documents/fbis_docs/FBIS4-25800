Several years ago, the premier noted, the Italian Government took the lead among Western countries in readjusting its policies toward China and has taken positive steps toward developing Sino-Italian ties. This, he added, has resulted in the relatively fast growth of economic and trade ties between the two countries. "We hope this momentum of development will be sustained," he told a group of visiting Italian entrepreneurs from the General Confederation of Italian Industry (GCII). Li voiced the conviction that Italian entrepreneurs will exert themselves toward this end. China and Italy can cooperate not only in heavy industry, but also in the light and textile industries, and leather and food processing industries, where Italy has its unique technical advantages, Li said. Referring to it as a major influence in Italian economic circles, Li said the confederation has contributed to bilateral economic and trade ties. He also expressed the hope that the visit will yield fruit. GCII Chairman Luigi Abete told Li that Italy's economic cycle has entered recovery, which will surely provide better conditions for Italy-China economic and trade cooperation. The GCII consists of numerous medium and small-sized businesses, all keen on developing cooperation with China, Luigi said. The visit is designed to inform them more about China's development strategy as they determine key sectors in which to invest in China, he said. The Italian visitors are here as guests of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.
