Krasnov under the rubric "Air Forces Tactics: A Look at the Problem": "Aerial Battle at the Threshold of Changes"] [Text] Military hardware is upgraded in the Air Forces as in no other branch of the armed forces, and that has a direct impact on the development of their tactics. It is not difficult to assume, however, that these two interconnected processes will be accomplished in the future chiefly under the influence of the changes that are planned in the military policy of our state and the significant cutbacks in the size of the Russian Air Forces. Domestic science will have to resolve quite a few issues in this regard that affect, in one way or another, all areas of the military arts, including questions of improving the tactics of aerial battle. The most important of these, in my opinion, are the following. What enemy aircraft could our pilots encounter in battle? This question was as simple as could be during the times of grim confrontation between the Warsaw Pact and NATO: the tactical fighters produced by the United States and the Western European countries. But today we should also add to that... the domestic Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters, whose tactical flight characteristics are highly regarded by aviation specialists around the world. China and Germany, aside from the traditional buyers (more than 40 nations), have been displaying an interest in these aircraft. The FRG is moreover ready to buy MiG-29s that are not right off the assembly line; the Luftwaffe would also acquire aircraft from combat formations, replacing the engines and electronics on them with newer ones. They have calculated in the West that it would be more advantageous to put an improved version of the Russian MiG into service than to labor over the development of the expensive EFA Eurofighter. The continuing instability of the military-political climate in some regions, and especially the Near East, also cannot fail to be taken into account in this situation. Armed conflict broke out once more in the Persian Gulf in January, after all, with the active employment of aviation just as happened two years earlier. And who knows, perhaps soon Russian pilots will be taking part in peacekeeping actions by multinational forces in "hot spots" around the globe. They would likely then have to confront these same MiGs and Sukhoys... The program of testing of the new-generation F-22 fighter is moreover approaching completion in the United States. It possesses, in the opinion of specialists, the highest combat potential of aircraft in this class that are in service today with the air forces of the leading air powers. Failing to mention the fact that the Americans will try to win the world market for aircraft hardware in the future through the sale of this aircraft is to play the ostrich, sticking one's head in the sand at the sign of danger. The substance of the concept of the "likely adversary," as we see, is becoming more voluminous for our Air Forces, and it must consequently be used with a regard for new approaches to the tactical training of flight personnel in fighter aviation. Just which ones? It is still difficult to answer that question. Where will the battle be waged? We have lost a considerable amount of space with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the withdrawal of our troops from Eastern Europe, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The boundaries of our radar reconnaissance and warning of a possible air attack in some sectors have, as a consequence, drawn significantly closer to the groups of forces and important targets covered by fighters in some sectors. And that means that our likely adversary obtains a palpable advantage under these conditions. It cannot be ruled out that a number of Eastern European countries would not act on the side of the CIS in a military conflict in certain situations. The United States and its allies in NATO are moreover able to create strike forces of troops and air forces in any part of the globe in a short period of time. Suffice it to say that the plans of the American command envisage the redeployment of up to 1,500 combat aircraft from their continent to Europe in 20 days. The possibility of an attack on the part of an enemy with surprise mass maneuvers thus increases sharply in the event of the deployment of air strike groups along our western borders. The circumstance should also be taken into account that the entry into service on a mass scale of means of aerial attack manufactured using Stealth technology, strategic cruise missiles using conventional ordnance and other types of high-precision weaponry would lead to a significant change in their operational structure in operations and strikes. The latter would obviously not have strict time frames, and could be carried out in waves for a prolonged period from various directions, accompanied by strong electronic suppression of troop command-and-control systems and weapons to as much as theater depth. The opportunities for the timely entry of fighters into battle from a status of ground alert duty and the intercept of an airborne enemy in the distant approaches to the targets they are covering are sharply restricted under those conditions. The sole way out of this situation, in my opinion, is transition to a means of waging combat operations that is in this case not economical--fighter airborne alert status. What else can be done? How will the battle be waged? The fundamental rules that were devised and codified in local wars and armed conflicts in the last thirty years will obviously remain in force for the next decade as well, if not longer. There would seemingly be no need in this regard to discuss today the upheavals in air clashes between fourth-generation aircraft. But let us nonetheless try and answer a question: How, taking into account the cutbacks in our fighter aviation, can we achieve the maximum realization of the combat potential of the Su-27M and MiG-31, which--it is no secret--will in the near future constitute the foundation of the aircraft inventory of fighter and PVO [air-defense] aviation? How can we learn, in other words, to fight using skill rather than numbers? We will proceed therein from the fact that the tactics for waging aerial battle by the crews of those aircraft are founded chiefly on the use of the "recommendations" of on-board expert systems and the delivery of high-precision weaponry. The search for an airborne enemy by the crews of fighter interceptors could thus be accomplished through its preliminary detection by velocity, with the further tracking of several targets according to the ranges measured using the automatic selection of pulse repetition frequencies for the on-board radar and the depiction of symbols (corresponding to target range and speed) on a display in the cockpit of the interceptor. An on-board thermal direction finder and laser rangefinder could also be used for the concealed surveillance of the overall aerial situation. All of the subsequent measurements of range to the target are made using the on-board radar. Assessment of the tactical situation is performed, by and large, by the on-board expert system. After the detection of a group target, for example, it establishes the quantity and place of each aircraft in the group and determines their affiliation and priority without the intervention of the pilot, after which all targets are ranked according to the degree of danger and the most dangerous are put onto the display. The commander of the interceptor group must make the decision to enter into battle in the next stage. His plan could be as follows: having detected one or several targets, the pilots take up a tactically advantageous position with regard to the enemy and make a concealed approach to him. Each distributes the guided missiles on board the fighter against the targets assigned by the group commander, and tracks them until such time as his aircraft is at a distance from one of them that corresponds to the maximum permissible range of weapons delivery. It only remains to execute the missile launch and disengage, using vigorous maneuvers guaranteeing the safe evasion of possible return fire from the enemy. The group commander, depending on the situation and the results of the first attack, then either organizes another pass or assigns his subordinates the task of finding new targets. But how, say, can battle be waged if the enemy has both a quantitative and a qualitative superiority? This is far from a rhetorical question, if one takes into account the significant cutbacks in the funding allocated in the Russian budget for the continued development of the latest models of military aircraft. This problem is obviously in need of serious analysis. The basis for it could be a consideration of the combat tasks of fighter aviation. You will agree, whatever contemporary aviation systems it may be equipped with, that it will have to wage battle only for tactical supremacy in the air--that is, in a restricted area and in the most crucial periods of combat operations--using small forces, with the observance of the principles of mass and centralized application. If the likelihood of a large-scale war against Russia exists, then it is only potentially, in the long term. But local military conflicts are making themselves known even today, and require the appropriate level of readiness of our Air Forces. It must therefore be taken into account, when preparing them, that combat operations in local conflicts, as a rule, are of a localized nature; there is not always a clearly outlined front line; and, raids of enemy aviation are possible from various and most unexpected directions. Fighter aviation, aside from its basic "classical" tasks, will have to perform a new one as well in this regard--supporting the redeployment of mobile forces to the "hot spots." But if the prevailing geopolitical situation of Russia, the large spaces and the poor sophistication of the airfield network are taken into account, then in my opinion it is difficult to count on efficiency in the maneuvering of fighter units and their concentration in the threatened areas in the event a military conflict breaks out. Quite a few difficult-to-solve problems of this sort have unfortunately accumulated in the tactics of fighter aviation in our Air Forces, since it has gotten into a state of anabiosis, figuratively speaking, in its development. One unequivocal conclusion suggests itself here--although its basic provisions remain in force, the necessity would seem to have become urgent to expand them and bring them closer to the realities of the present day. At this stage, when the formulation of the military doctrine of Russia is approaching its conclusion, it is more desirable than before to devote attention to the theoretical elaboration and practical assimilation of questions of preparing and waging combat operations by its Air Forces, and first and foremost fighter aviation.
