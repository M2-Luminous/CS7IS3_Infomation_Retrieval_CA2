The first case is: Shen Taifu, former president of the Beijing Changcheng Machinery and Electric Science and Technology Industrial Corporation (hereafter referred to as Changcheng Corporation), took advantage of his position to embezzle public funds by resorting to fraud and other means. He also unscrupulously bribed state functionaries. Because he committed the crimes of embezzlement and offering bribes, he was sentenced to death according to law. Sun Jihong (Shen Taifu's wife), an offender in the same case, was also sentenced to 15 years of fixed-term imprisonment after being convicted of the crime of embezzlement. The second case is: Li Xiaoshi, former vice chairman of the State Science and Technology Commission, accepted bribes from Shen Taifu and other people, and also took advantage of his position to embezzle public funds. Because he committed the crime of accepting bribes and embezzlement, he was sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 20 years, a punishment for committing more than one crime. As everybody knows, the illegal fund-raising activities conducted by Changcheng Corporation has been a major financial case rarely seen since the founding of New China. The size of the capital raised by the corporation, the scope of such activities, and the odious consequences caused by the case are shocking. This has once again proved that in the process of reform, opening to the outside world, and building a socialist market economic structure, it is very important and necessary to adhere to the principle of "grasping two links simultaneously," persist in cracking down on serious economic crimes, strengthen the building of a clean government, and continue to launch the anticorruption struggle in a sustained way. We should educate the cadres and the masses by taking advantage of the negative examples involving Shen Taifu and Li Xiaoshi, and draw useful lessons from them. Under the signboard of establishing civilian-run collective enterprises and developing high science and technology, Shen Taifu played the sinister trick of accumulating wealth by unfair means by using high returns as a bait and taking advantage of the weaknesses of some people who hoped to get quick returns through investment and who were not familiar with financial investment. He was the loudest advocate in raising funds to develop energy-saving electrical machinery. For a time he became a dignified noted figure devoted to pushing reform and developing high science and technology. In fact, there was neither operation nor development in this so-called machinery and electric science and technology development enterprise, and Shen Taifu himself had no specialized strong points in this field. What he did was unscrupulously squandering the huge sum of money he had swindled. The case of Shen Taifu should serve to wake us up to this fact -- some economic criminals are very good at pretending. Under an impressive signboard, they can take advantage of loopholes in our work to market their treachery by fishing in troubled waters. The principle of opening up fund-raising channels to establish civilian-run science and technology entities is correct, but enlivening the economy must be done in an orderly manner, and breaking the law is not permitted in opening to the outside world. If we pay no attention to this point, we will be taken in by people with ulterior motives like Shen Taifu. We must support those people who are genuinely devoted to reform, but we must expose those who seek private gain and even violate laws and discipline under false pretenses. We must never let these people harm the country and the people and smear the reputation of reform. The masses should also improve ability to distinguish people, enhance their awareness of the legal system, and learn necessary economic knowledge in order to avoid being taken in. Using money to clear obstacles and get things done was Shen Taifu's habitual tactic. In this way senior cadre Li Xiaoshi became captive of "sugarcoated bullets." Li Xiaoshi was not unaware of Shen Taifu's sinister intentions, but he, out of greed, used his power and influence to clear the obstacles in support of Shen Taifu. What were hidden behind all of these were nothing but a succession of deals between power and money. However, the external cause can be activated only through the internal cause. "Things must first rot before they are infested with worms." The fact shows that Li Xiaoshi's embezzlement and bribe-taking did not start at the Beijing Changcheng Corporation case, and this was why he was instantaneously hit by Shen Taifu's sugarcoated bullets. The fact that Li Xiaoshi degenerated from a senior cadre to a criminal offender provides us with a penetrating lesson, which shows that powers in the hands of cadres, especially leading cadres, of some government departments can often easily become the target sought after by lawless elements. Each and every cadre must clearly understand that power in our hands is given by the people and cannot be sold out. Resisting the temptation of money and performing duties with honesty and self-discipline is the basic requirement of cadres. Should they lower guard and be swollen with selfish desire, they will make blunders sooner or later. It is also necessary to point out that in order to hoodwink the public and fabricate lies, Shen Taifu extended and succeeded partially in extending his sinister hand to some press units and other government departments. Through publicizing this typical case, we should educate journalists to strictly abide by professional ethics, to stop "paid news," and to safeguard the party's clean reputation in the journalistic undertaking. RENMIN RIBAO, as the organ of the party Central Committee, is determined to set a good example in stopping "paid news" and strengthening the construction of clean government, and we sincerely request the supervision by readers at large. Shen Taifu has been executed and Li Xiaoshi punished, and the judicial organ will, after verifying facts, successively deliver verdicts on some other people involved in the case. All of these can serve as a warning to certain people: It will be a miscalculation to exploit the opportunity of relaxation to invigorate economy and to try by hook and by crook to unscrupulously reap some profit. No matter how criminals conceal themselves and resist obstinately, they cannot escape the punishment by law in the end. We must resolutely implement the party Central Committee's plans on the anticorruption drive. Leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in complying with various regulations for honesty and self-discipline to ensure the achievement of more conspicuous results in the anticorruption drive. In the course of reform, opening up, and modernization construction, the fight against corruption is a protracted task and the warning alarm of anticorruption and advocation of honesty must sound continuously.
