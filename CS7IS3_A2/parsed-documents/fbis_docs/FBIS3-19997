Moellemann Says He Is Still Thinking About It; A Run for the FDP Presidium Is Risky"] [Text] Bonn, 11 Mar--The former Federal Minister for Economics Moellemann is preparing his ascent in the FDP [Free Democratic Party] leadership. At the present time, the North Rhine-Westphalia Land chairman is conducting talks with other land associations of the FDP and with members of the FDP Presidium to clarify his prospects of being elected into the leading circle at the national party congress in Rostock at the beginning of June. The Presidium position of Carola von Braun, who had to resign from the land chairmanship in Berlin after the "Figaro-Affair," must be filled. Moellemann is aiming in this direction and has let this be known. He previously belonged to the Presidium not as an elected member, but on the basis of his ministerial offices. His election to the broader national board was always more or less close. A year after his resignation as minister for economics, he now obviously sees the chance to benefit from a kind of reparation bonus. A timely place in the Presidium before the Bundestag electon could improve his prospects for something beyond that. Between 1991 and the beginning of 1993, Moellemann was considered to be a candidate for the chairmanship of the FDP. Most recently he has increasingly advocated an independent course for the FDP and differentiation from the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union]. Moellemann favors the election of the SPD's [Social Democratic Party of Germany] candidate Rau as federal president in May. Moellemann told this newspaper on Friday [11 March] that he has not yet decided, because until now he has "not spoken definitively with everyone." A conversation with parliamentary group chairman Solms has not yet taken place, because he has been too busy with the nursing care insurance. "I have informed party chairman Kinkel that I am considering it but have not yet decided." Moellemann said that he asked Rhineland-Palatinate Land Chairman Bruederle, who is economic minister in the Mainz coalition government under Scharping, about his intentions. Moellemann let it be known that he suggested to Bruederle that he be a candidate for the Presidium. But he answered that Moellemann should run. Bruederle referred to the fact that he had spoken with many FDP politicians and thereby mentioned that it is generally considered better for Moellemann to be in the Presidium than outside. Moellemann expressed his criticism of the composition of the leadership circle with the remark: "The Presidium can be strengthened." Moellemann first wants to wait and see whether and which other candidates will declare themselves. There is yet time until July. Before that he wants to concentrate on the fight in his land association. A land party congress in April will reelect the FDP leadership in North Rhine-Westphalia; the land list for the Bundestag election must be presented by the end of May. Sixteen of the 17 Bundestag deputies from North Rhine-Westphalia and two other candidates are competing for the at best 12 somewhat secure places on the list. Unity Through Tactics Moellemann is still annoyed with Kinkel about the events in the selection of the new Education Minister Laermann. Weeks ago Moellemann had indicated that he was "flabbergasted" over the fact that Kinkel and Solms had reduced the FDP from 12 to 5 to 7 percent after the election of the chairman last June and were nevertheless damaging "the largest battalions"--the Duesseldorf land association. He is upset with Kinkel for maintaining the "inaccurate" portrayal that after the resignation of Education Minister Ortleb the chairman had asked him whether he wanted to return only as a "gesture of courtesy." Nevertheless Moellemann signaled a truce on Friday: "I have no desire to keep on fighting with Kinkel." Because of the upcoming elections, the matter is becoming "too serious for the FDP." They must combine their forces, for there is no other way. Accordingly, he will probably keep his opinions about Kinkel to himself after the election Sunday [13 March] in Lower Saxony. Despite the disturbed relationship between Kinkel and the restless Moellemann, the party chairman appears to be convinced that in the election year neither of the two will allow himself to be played against the other. Solidarity is also a wise tactic for Moellemann at this time, because otherwise reverses for the FDP could be attributed to the obstructionist. Kinkel is obviously inclined to the view that it is more beneficial to tie the chairman of the large land association to decisions of the FDP Presidium. Possibly Kinkel sees this as the lesser evil in comparison with a constant source of trouble. Other members of the leadership, on the other hand, are alarmed or at least uncomfortable with the fact that Moellemann is about to build a pedestal for appearances as an "antipope." In the end, no one will dare to oppose Moellemann's candidacy if Kinkel is for it. Still, they are saying that "Moellemann must guard against hearing a call from the party that is not coming at all." But many are aware of Moellemann's organizational abilities, so that the warning sounds defensive. In the Bundestag group, Moellemann has gotten on the nerves of several deputies with his constant attacks against the "incompetent" Finance Minister Waigel (CSU). "Once again, we hear the entire national economic expertise," the people said derisively when Moellemann got going. Moellemann has realized more and more that he cannot change much with criticism from the outside; it would be easier in the party Presidium. But the game is full of dangers. It is said in the FDP: "A failure at the party congress would set Moellemann's ambitions back several lengths." On the other hand, they are making this prediction: "If there is no opposing candidacy to Moellemann in Rostock, that means a farther-reaching signal to the executive level." Experienced members of the leadership are saying: "If Kinkel says that he wants Moellemann's candidacy and others say that they cannot oppose him, then it will be difficult to predict the voting behavior of the delegates to the party congress in a mixture of feeling and intellect; it is one thing if the leadership recommends something but another thing whether the delegates will act accordingly." Until now the vacancy in the Presidium has been attributed to women and possible east Germans. The east Berliner Frau Paetzold occupied the spot and then lost it to Carola von Braun from all of Berlin. Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger now has bad cards; if she were to compete for the position, people would probably say that she is already in the Presidium because of her office. Wagner, the chairman of the FDP parliamentary group in Hesse, was defeated by Frau von Braun in 1991. Frau Wagner would likely have little chance now, because there are already two people from Hesse in the leadership body: the deputy chairman Gerhardt and treasury's Solms. It is considered conceivable that the deputy chairman of the Bundestag group, Weng, is thinking about whether he should run against Moellemann. For Weng, however, it may well be more important to plan to succeed Cronenberg, the vice president of the Bundestag, after the Bundestag election. If Kinkel were to want someone other than Moellemann in the Presidium--there is already a search among east German women--he would have to use his influence as chairman early. But that is considered unlikely; many consider Kinkel to be too unsteady and too weak for this. Little doubt is being expressed about Moellemann's talents; but it is said that too frequently he employs them for himself only. This is the impression that Moellemann has to fight against; but he can also count on the FDP needing him. Bearing in mind the poor results so far in the elections for the executive board and his reputation, his game is risky for Rostock but the view to what comes later makes the effort worthwhile for him.
