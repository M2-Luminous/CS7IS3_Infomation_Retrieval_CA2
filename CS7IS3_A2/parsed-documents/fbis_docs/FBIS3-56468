Gaydar's unexpected statement on the impossibility of staying in the new cabinet is the first manifestation of party affiliation in Russia's top organs of power and not a manifestation of the individual participation of particular politicians in them. [passage omitted] Two options remain for the development of events around the creation of a new government team. Since Ye. Gaydar intends to demonstrate firmness in his decision (advisers close to him are absolutely convinced of this and they rule out the possibility of political bluffing in this case) a government crisis could most likely arise, to overcome which the president will either have to embark on the risky step of proposing something like the outline for a coalition government or give the premier carte blanche. In the latter version it seems possible that a pro-Chernomyrdin will be created in the government and in parliament which, representatives of "Russia's Choice" believe, could be formed by the factions of the Communists, Agrarian Union members, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, the Democratic Party of Russia, and "Yabloko." The government team thus constituted would inevitably pursue a pro-inflationist policy and there would be no place in it for representatives of "Russia's Choice." It is not out of the question that with this development of events other Gaydar supporters would leave the government (A. Chubays remains in his post only by virtue of a party decision -- he cannot be responsible for the government's economic policy). After the president's meeting with the premier it became known that the "Russia's Choice" bloc does not intend to declare that it is in opposition to the government.
