He said: "We are building a civilization, whose main foundations are culture, insight, wisdom and the perfection of human thought." The leader's message at 23:58 hours local time, ushered in the new calendar year, 1373 [21 March] of the solar Hijra, which is in official use in Iran and Afghanistan instead of the Gregorian Christian calendar (1994). Monday the 1st of Farvardin is the vernal or spring equinox, a day celebrated as 'Nowroze' or New Year Day in Iran and several other countries. Ayatollah Khamene'i laid stress on ethical values and commitment to work in view of the fact that Iran enjoys a new system, lofty ideals and important objectives "which appeal to every just person. "The Iranian people with their bright culture rooted in history together with abundant material wealth, should under the circumstances, bring about ethical promotion", he added. Terming ethics and self-reform as "one of the secrets of the human move towards perfection", the leader said: "Whoever we are, and whatever our degree of knowledge, wisdom and perfection, we must supplicate to God to help us move towards further perfection". He also urged the nation to respect social regulations at all levels, and referring to commitment to work and discipline as "two important and essential factors in individual and social life", said the efforts of a nation dedicated to work always yield good results and guarantee the welfare of society. Ayatollah Khamene'i praised the families of the martyrs of the revolution and the imposed war, as well as the disabled, the former POWs and war veterans. He also saluted the soul of the father of the Islamic revolution, Imam Khomeyni. In the use of the resources of the country mines and industries have been activated and strengthened, and today Iran is an exporter of steel, copper and aluminum, three major elements for the industrialized world, he added. Rafsanjani pointed out that exports of the country during this period has almost quadrupled, and "if this movement continues, the second plan, God willing, can make us to a large extent independent of oil revenues...I think such successes are mainly because of the supports of the people and their presence on the scene." He said that for youth this year and in the future years there are new programmes, because "from the point of view of population our country is a young country, and our young forces require guidance and help so that they will be able to pass the course of the revolution well." The hojjat ol-eslam lauded the effective role played by Iran's Muslim women in the era of the revolution, and said "grounds for their added activity in the social affairs and this policy will continue to be exercised so that this year from the point of attention to the spiritual needs of our youths and especially women we will have a successful year." He was all praise for the Armed Forces and the unknown soldiers who serve the country and said their vigilance and sacrifice, saw Iran come out with flying colours during the era of holy defense (1980-88). The president spoke of big accomplishment in the heavy industries field and the procurement of raw materials for plants such as steel and petrochemicals. "We supplied all kinds of our needs for minerals, most of them can stand on their feet. We can control the market up to some degree, and we hope the shop keepers and the respectable traders will cooperate with us and will consider equity. We, too, will support them. "Of course, we agree with their balanced profit, and God willing, we will provide them with administrative facilities, especially for the people active in exports." He was hopeful that "with the support of self-sacrificing people and with the presence on the scene of the war disabled and the former POWs and their proud families and with the efforts of those who work for the people with sincerity," Iran is fully geared up to welcome the second five year plan and to embark on the tasks ahead. He said "fortunately, in the last weeks of this past year foreign exchange constraints that had been created because of the fall of the oil price were removed, and in the coming year we will live without any constraints. Next year we will find a chance to have more power on the market." Turning to problems on the world scene, Hojjat ol-Eslam Rafsanjani said the Islamic society is having much headache. "Still in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kashmir, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Karabakh, Iraq, Somalia and many other places Muslims have difficulties and this indicates the spite world arrogance has towards Muslims and Islam." He said Iran was trying its best to help Muslims and will continue to contribute towards the resolving of their problems. "Our foreign policy is nowhere clashes and strife, and I think problems can be solved by negotiations, peacefully and with cooperation," he was confident [sentence as received].
