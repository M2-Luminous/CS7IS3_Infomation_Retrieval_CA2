Addressing a national telephonic conference, Ren, president of the Supreme People's Court, said that spreading of corruption had been brought under control as a result of the anti-graft campaign nationwide. During the first four months of 1994, procuratorates throughout China investigated 19,000 economic offence cases, including 12,000 cases of embezzlement and bribery, according to participants in the conference, held by the Central Political Science and Law Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. During the first quarter of this year, courts at various levels tried 9,836 economic offence cases, including 2,591 cases involving at least 10,000 yuan each. During that period, the courts sentenced 7,130 accused to various prison terms for economic offences, and 102 of them were sentenced either to death or life imprisonment. The 7,130 accused included one vice-minister, nine at prefectural commissioner's level and 35 at county magistrate's level. Ren Jianxin, who is also secretary of the Central Political Science and Law Committee, said that in the second half of 1994, law-enforcement departments must speed up investigations of major economic offences, with emphasis on embezzlers, bribe-taking officials, swindlers in the financial sector and smuggling. "Leading departments of the party and government, judicial departments, law-enforcement administrative departments and economic administrative departments are the main targets," he told the conference. He also said that when there were new major economic offence cases, especially ones involving leading officials, they would be made public.
