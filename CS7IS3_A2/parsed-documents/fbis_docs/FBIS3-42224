One member of the victim's family, requesting anonymity, said the leader of the "Assembly of God" had felt he was "in danger since he brought to the world's attention in January the case of fellow Assembly of God pastor Mehdi Dibaj, originally a Moslem, who was sentenced to death for having converted." Hovsepian disappeared on January 19 while he was travelling by car to Tehran airport. Police photographs of his body, shown to the family, indicated wounds to the abdomen and chest. The body was found the following day in a street in the Eslamabad area, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) west of Tehran. However, the family said they were not informed of Hovsepian's death until Sunday, and they were unable to see the body, because it was buried unusually quickly at Tehran's huge Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery. On Monday they were granted permission to bury the body with a religious ceremony at a Protestant cemetery. No official account was given to the family about the circumstances of Hovsepian's death, the authorities saying simply that an investigation was in progress. Another relative who requested anonymity said Hovsepian "had no enemies -- the only problem was that he led the Assembly of God." "Our church is very active in trying to spread the message of the Bible, and the government asked us to stop propagating our religion," the relative said, adding that the authorities recently closed several of the Protestant sect's places of worship, after it refused to stop spreading the faith. The sect says it has some 3,000 members in Iran. Several of its members told AFP that the Assembly of God followers had been subjected to "pressure and intimidation" from the authorities throughout Iran in recent months. Relatives said Hovsepian's death was connected with his campaign to alert the world community to the case of Mehdi Dibaj, detained for nine years and recently sentenced to death, according to the Assembly of God, for having converted to Christianity. Dibaj was freed on bail on January 15 following international pressure, particularly from the Vatican and other European countries, including France. The Iranian authorities denied that Dibaj had been sentenced to death, and said he was simply accused of "offences against the Moslem Prophet (Muhammad) and Imam (Ayatollah) Khomeyni," founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
