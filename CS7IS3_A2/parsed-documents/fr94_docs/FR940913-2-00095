I. Introduction Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 on March 31, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE''), on June 1, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx''), on June 13, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc., on June 16, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''), and on June 27, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), respectively (each individually referred to herein as an ``Exchange'' and two or more collectively referred to as ``Exchanges''), submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') proposed rule changes designed to allow their members to designate certain short sales of Nasdaq 3 National Market (``NM'') securities 4 as bid test exempt sales in connection with the bid test applicable to short sales of such securities (``bid test rule'' or ``short sale rule'') recently adopted by the NASD and included in the NASD Manual, Rules of Fair Practice (``NASD Rules''). 5 On May 9, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 1; 6 on June 20, 1994, the Phlx filed Amendment No. 1; 7 on June 21, 1994, the Amex filed Amendment No. 1; 8 on June 30, the PSE filed Amendment No. 1, 9 and on August 3, 1994, the Phlx filed Amendment No. 2. 10 The CBOE proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register on May 18, 1994. 11 No comments were received on these proposed rule changes. This order approves the Exchanges' proposals and the Exchanges' Amendments. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 Nasdaq is a computerized system that provides brokers and dealers with price quotations for securities traded over the counter. 4 Nasdaq includes both Nasdaq SmallCap Market and Nasdaq NM securities. In July 1993, the NASD began referring to Nasdaq National Market System or Nasdaq NMS securities as Nasdaq National Market securities. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34277 (June 29, 1994), 59 FR 34885 (File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;92&hyph;12). 6 In Amendment No. 1, the CBOE removes the term ``NMS securities'' and replaces it with ``Nasdaq National Market securities,'' National Market securities,'' or ``NM securities.'' In addition, Amendment No. 1 confirms that surveillance procedures had been or would be implemented by the CBOE in order for the CBOE to be deemed a ``qualified Options exchange'' that satisfies the requirements of the NASD's short-sale rule (File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;92&hyph;12). See letter from Michael L. Meyer, Schiff Hardin & Waite, to Francois Mazur, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated May 9, 1994. See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34277, supra note 5. 7 See letter from Michele R. Weisbaum, Phlx, to Francois Mazur, Attorney, Division, Commission, dated June 16, 1994. The Phlx's amendment revises the term ``NMS securities, and refers instead to ``National Market securities'' or ``NM securities.'' Id. 8 See letter from Claire P. McGrath, Managing Director and Special Counsel, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Division, Commission, dated June 20, 1994. Amendment No. 1 corrects a typographical error made in the original submission. 9 See letter from Michael D. Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, to Francois Mazur, Attorney, Division, Commission, dated June 29, 1994. Amendment No. 1 requests the Commission to find good cause for accelerating effectiveness of the PSE's proposal. 10 See Phlx Amendment No. 2. Amendment No. 2 revises the proposal to allow a Phlx specialist to designate all the Nasdaq NM securities underlying the options or index options which the specialist has been allocated as ``designated'' NM securities. Under the original proposal, Phlx specialists were limited to designating twenty such securities. 11 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34049 (May 12, 1994), 59 FR 25971. II. Description of Proposals A. Introduction The Exchanges have submitted substantially similar proposals to the Commission to amend their respective rules 12 so as to coordinate them with the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice relating to a bid test applicable to short sales of NM securities traded through Nasdaq. 13 The proposals require Exchange members who initiate, accept, or transmit for execution, or execute sales of NM securities for the account of another Exchange member, to designate such sales as long sales, short sales, or bid test exempt sales. Accordingly, NASD members who receive orders to sell NM securities from or for the account of Exchange members will have a basis to determine whether such sales are short sales subject to or exempt from the bid test. 14 12 CBOE Proposed Rule 15.10; Phlx Proposed Rule 1072; Amex Proposed Rule 957(d); and PSE Proposed Rule 4.19. 13 The NASD bid test prohibits broker-dealers from effecting short sales, for themselves or their customers, at or below the ``bid'' when the current ``inside'' or best bid is below the previous inside bid. 14 An executing NASD member is required to make a good-faith determination whether an order is long, short, or bid test exempt. Thus, an NASD member is prohibited from effecting a short sale for the account of a customer or for its own account directly or through the offices of a third party for the purpose of avoiding the application of the short sale rule. Further, an NASD member is prohibited from knowingly, or with reason to know, effecting sales for the account of a customer or for its own account for the purpose of avoiding the rule. It is the belief of the NASD that NASD members' activities to circumvent the short sale rule through indirect actions such as executions with other members or through facilitation of customer orders while being protected from loss are antithetical to the purposes of the rule. See NASD Rules, Article III, Section 48.
