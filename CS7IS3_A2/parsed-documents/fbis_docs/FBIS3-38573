During a demonstration of the European Movement in Switzerland, the head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday evening [1 February] that there is "no realistic political alternative" to the European Union [EU] and that Switzerland should participate in it. Increasingly, Europe is having to confront problems which extend beyond national borders. International crime, drug trafficking, and trade and environment policy cannot be resolved at regional or national level, the Federal Councillor said. The EU is still far from perfect, he acknowledged, mentioning a bureaucracy which is still too dense and the failure of the negotiations on the Yugoslav conflict. Nevertheless, it is a stabilizing factor called upon to play a central role. The future of the EU lies in a structure which respects minorities and which functions in a decentralized and federalist manner. It is here that Switzerland can make its contribution, Flavio Cotti stressed. A greater commitment by our country will not lead to the weakening of the Swiss identity. On the contrary, in greater Europe, Switzerland will continue to make decisions on its future itself. Moreover, it will become more sure of itself and more open to the world, he said.
