In view of this apprehension, Talbott will exert pressure on Pakistan and India to end the race to manufacture nuclear weapons and missiles. The VOA commentary also expressed doubts about the success of Talbott's visit because no country in the subcontinent can instantly sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. They might not even be ready to have their nuclear installations inspected. This is why the United States anticipates a growing danger of a nuclear threat in the subcontinent. The question is why the United States is not trying to find out the reasons behind this serious threat. It has become well-known throughout the world that India has repeatedly been threatening a limited war on the Kashmir issue and trying to establish a justification for it by alleging that Pakistan is "abetting terrorists." Two wars had already been fought in the subcontinent on Kashmir, and every time it was India which started the aggression. At first, in 1948 it captured the Muslim-majority state of Kashmir adjoining Pakistan by deviating from the predetermined agenda on the partition and independence of India. When this was resisted by the Kashmiris and Pakistan, then India went to the United Nations where the Security Council adopted a cease-fire resolution on the condition that the people of Kashmir would be given an opportunity to freely express their views on Kashmir's accession either to India or Pakistan. Although India had then accepted the resolution, for the last half a century it has been avoiding a plebiscite while claiming Kashmir is an integral part of India. Four years ago, the Kashmiri people indigenously launched a crusade to get rid of the Indian yoke of slavery. India is awfully baffled by the success of this struggle and it is quite possible for her to embark on an onslaught against Pakistan anytime as she did in the past. India has equipped itself with the most modern, dangerous, and destructive weapons. It expanded its blue water navy exceeding its legitimate defense needs. It has been given the target of control in the Indian Ocean region. [sentence as published] It did not stop there. India turned itself into a nuclear power. It has been confirmed by CIA records that India possesses enough enriched uranium to produce 20 to 100 bombs. India's entire attention is now focused to the production of long-range missiles as carriers of nuclear warheads. It is conducting experiments in this regard. The irony is that India has not accepted any global restriction on its nuclear program nor is it ready to sign the NPT. Pakistan has every right to do everything to ensure its defense. It can be said with full confidence that if India did not dare wage a war so far, it was because of Pakistan's nuclear program. Still, the Pakistani nuclear program is being made a target of criticism by the United States and anti-Islamic powers. The United States has even suspended economic and military aid to Pakistan so as to exert pressure. It is refusing to supply the F-16 planes to Pakistan although Pakistan has already paid for them. It is being proposed now that Pakistan will have to cap the nuclear program and sign the NPT in future. Pakistani Army Chief General Abdul Waheed is currently visiting the United States. He has repeatedly made the position clear that Pakistan is always willing to abandon its nuclear program. It has repeatedly said that a solution to the nuclear issue should be found on a regional basis and India should also be included in the NPT so that at least a nuclear confrontation in the Indian subcontinent can be averted. However, India not only rejected the regional solution, it has also termed the NPT contrary to its national interests. In fact, it is not in Pakistan's interest either to sign the NPT without determining the balance of power between Pakistan and India and securing a guarantee for it. It is becoming more and more difficult for Pakistan to counter India with conventional weapons. And in this age, we cannot face India depending only on our faith in God, because our faith in God has also dwindled. The fact is that so long as the Kashmir issue remains unresolved and a permanent peace agreement is not concluded simultaneously, there will always be a threat of aggression from India. Therefore, if the United States is interested, even slightly, in establishing peace in the subcontinent, then it becomes obligatory on the part of the United States to allow the Kashmiris an opportunity to express their views as provided by the Security Council resolutions. Obviously, at a time when the Kashmiris are engaged in a jihad against the Indian troops, their verdict will be in favor of accession to Pakistan. The key to the establishment of peace in the subcontinent lies in this verdict.
