This type of missile is used by ground soldiers to shoot down low-flying planes and helicopters. The Army said the missiles are 100 percent efficient. According to General Gilberto Serra, head of the Army Social Communications Center (Cecomsex), the Army used part of the $100 million it has allocated to purchase Russian armaments to purchase the missiles. "We purchased the missiles because it was good business. We are conducting studies to manufacture them locally, but it takes a country 10 years to develop the appropriate technology for that type of equipment", the general said. Serra said this is the first time Brazil has purchased weapons in Russia. The deal was made possible thanks to an agreement signed between the Industry and Commerce Ministry and the Russian Federation providing for the import and export of the most diverse kinds of products manufactured in the two countries. In the next four years the trade exchange between Brazil and Russia should reach $2 billion. The Army General Staff is analyzing what other kinds of military equipment could be purchased in Russia with the remaining $100 million allocated to the Army by that international trade agreement. "Our interest is in purchasing as much as possible with as little money as possible. The Igla missile has already been tested under battle conditions, and it is one of the most modern in the world," Gen. Serra said. Negotiations between the Brazilian Army and the Russian weapon industries started in September of last year, when Minister Zenildo de Lucena visited Russia. The Army informed Armed Forces members about the purchase of the 112 anti-aircraft missiles and 56 launchers on 27 May. Each missile is 1.68 meters in length, and missile and launcher together weigh 18 kg.
