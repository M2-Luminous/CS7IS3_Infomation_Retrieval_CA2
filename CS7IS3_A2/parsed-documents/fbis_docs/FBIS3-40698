Darawishah is the indubitable representative of the intermediate generation in the politics of the Israeli Arabs: His roots are in the Labor Party of the military government. His refuge is in the Islamic movement. The election results and the departure of SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] gave fateful strength to Darawishah's influence. With it, Rabin has a closed bloc. Without it, there is no bloc and there is no government. Darawishah wags his finger and threatens Rabin that if he does not appoint him minister, he will take the finger from him. Darawishah, members of Labor and Meretz whisper, is nervy, an extortioner, and irresponsible. Nervy because he knows that Rabin cannot seat an Arab alongside of the government table. There is a security problem, and there is an even more difficult problem--the reaction of the Jewish public opinion. An extortioner because he is attacking Rabin at a moment of weakness. Irresponsible because he is endangering the accord with the PLO, which most Israeli Arabs, including Darawishah, himself, support 100 percent. Essentially, the coalition is now telling Darawishah, and through him, all Israeli Arabs: You have a choice--either peace or equality. You will not get both together. The truth is that, more than teaching us about defects in Darawishah's character, the crisis is teaching us about the difficulty of Jews in making order out of there confusing, impossible relation with Israeli Arabs. When the Likud was in power, he turned them, ideologically, into part of the population of the territories. Arabs from Taybeh were treated the same as Arabs from Nabulus. We are speaking of one problem, an internal problem. Both of them will live to win under the government of the Jews. From a practical aspect, the Likud worked in the opposite way: They did their best to distance the Israeli Arabs from the influence of the territories. Every piece of information regarding the association of Israeli Arabs to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was received with great shock. The smell of betrayal hovered in the air. The Labor Party came and turned everything upside down: According to the global view, they are trying to change the Palestinian problem from an internal to an external one. The key word to the solution is "withdrawal." The negotiating partner is Tunisia. The goal, as Rabin formulated it, is that they will live their lives, and, we, separately, will live our lives. If there is any logic to conducting policy, even security policy, the work would have had to break into the separation of Israeli Arabs from the Arabs of the territories. Up to here, the PLO--and from here on, the State of Israel. The Israeli Government will not conduct the politics of Nabulus, and the PLO will not conduct the politics of Baqah al-Garbayah. In reality, the opposite is occurring. Ahmad Tibbi, an Arab citizen of Israel, recently earned the official title of presidential adviser to the president of the State of Palestine. Tibbi is a shrewd, political veteran and a superior speaker. His advice certainly contributed to the peace process. But, it is difficult to understand how an Israeli citizen could serve in an official role in a foreign system and to still come, in the authority of this role, into the prime minister's office. If Ahmad Tibbi is needed as an adviser to his head of state, it is fitting to appoint him as Rabin's adviser. This is the proper message that the Israeli Government can currently deliver to its Arab citizens. Darawishah represents a similar dilemma. Recently, knowledge of the attempt by government factors to convince 'Arafat to influence Darawishah to cease his threats were published. An unpleasant smell is rising from this information. If 'Arafat is Darawishah's landlord, Darawishah has no place next to the table of the Israeli Government. In contrast, if the citizens of Israel in Nazareth and Rahat and 'Ar'arah are Darawishah's emissaries, they and not an angel, they and not a seraph, they and not 'Arafat, then he is not an extortioner or nervy, any more so than Ya'aqov Shefi, Menahem Prosh, Shlomo Benyizri, or any other member of Knesset who is arguing over his vote with the prime minister.
