"History will make it known that we're the terminators of graft and vote bribery," Ma said in a speech to the group. As of Sunday, 398 suspects, including 13 speakers, nine deputy speakers, and 184 councilors -- a third of all sitting councilors -- had been charged for either buying votes or accepting bribes in the elections for speakers and deputy speakers of the 23 county and city councils. The ruling Kuomintang won all speaker and deputy speaker seats. Ma asked the group to keep rooting out corruption to make sure the June and July elections for village and township chiefs will be clean. Meanwhile, the prosecutor's office in the central city of Taichung charged Councilors Chen Jen-hsun, Chen Jui-teh and Ho Wen-hai with accepting bribes worth between NT$7 million and NT$7.4 million (US$261,200-US$276,120) from Speaker Kuo Yen-sheng in exchange for their votes in the March 1 election. The prosecutor recommended 30 months in jail for the three defendants if they are found guilty. Twenty-nine people have now been charged with graft surrounding the Taichung City Council election.
