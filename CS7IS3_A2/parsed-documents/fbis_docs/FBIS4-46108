Quoting military sources here who were informed of the North's movements by the United States Government, YOMIURI said, "there is a possibility North Korea would soon test-fire a second missile following the launch of the Nodong-I missile in the East Sea in may last year." According to the YOMIURI report, many trucks, launchers and other vehicles have been sent to the detected launch site and vessels were swarming around ports along the east coast, apparently to determine the landing point of the missiles to be launched. Asked why the North would try to test a new missile when the international community's attention is already focused on its suspected nuclear weapons program, the sources said, "the action seems to be timed with the warm seasonal weather conditions in the East Sea and we do not believe North Korea has any particular political intention of influencing nuclear negotiations." The TOKYO SHIMBUN carried a similar story, quoting Foreign Ministry officials as saying that "we obtained information that North Korea is preparing to test-launch a missile in the East Sea." The officials said the information had been supplied by the United States, adding, "the missile to be launched by the North this time appears to be a revised version of the Nodong-I missile," according to the TOKYO SHIMBUN. "Washington and Pyongyang are likely to hold a third round of high-level talks soon, regardless of the attempt by the North to test-launch a missile," according to the officials, who hinted they had the impression that Washington considers the North's missile launch as a separate issue from the talks. The North's Nodong-I that was test-launched in May last year has a range of 1,000 km.
