Mr. James Ngumo, who is THE STANDARD bureau chief in Nakuru, and Peter Rianga, the paper's correspondent based in Kisii, appeared before the senior principal magistrate, Mr. William Tuiyot, but were not allowed to plead to the charge as consent to prosecute them has not been given by the attorney general. The court remanded them in custody until 31st March when they will renew their application for bail. They were accused that with subversive intention they published a report in THE STANDARD Wednesday [16 March] edition alleging that tribal clashes had erupted in Molo division, during which nine people were killed and hundreds displaced, a report calculated to promote hatred and enemity between different communities.
