FBIS4-54742 "dreeu086__a94035" FBIS-EEU-94-086-A Daily Report 3 May 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Radio Director Reports on `Critical Situation' Radio Director Reports on `Critical Situation' AU0305200594 Prague CTK in English 1731 GMT 3 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0305200594 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- Since last July, Slovak Radio (SRo) has received no state subsidies provided for by the law, SRo Director Vladimir Stefko told a press conference today. Although the law describes SRo as a "national, independent, public, informational, cultural and educational corporation", it monthly lacks 8 million korunas ($258,000) necessary for fulfilling its duties, Stefko said. If the critical situation is not solved, SRo could face a collapse in a short time, he added. He pointed to the unnatural number of inspections, invectives, demands for staff changes and other interferences with the independence of SRo by state power. The previous government of Vladimir Meciar deprived SRo of 120 million korunas ($3,8 million) by direct interventions alone, he said. The situation sharpened last September, when SRo had to resort to drastic measures for economic reasons. It abolished one of the three broadcasting circuits, almost halted the production of its own drama programs, regular popular programs were replaced by music, the broadcasting time was shortened, all investments were stopped. There is no more money for the modernization and maintenance of the equipment. The existence of the two SRo orchestras is also threatened, Stefko said. Last year, SRo had to dismiss 160 editors and creative workers. The monthly wage of those remaining dropped by 1,500 korunas ($48), and now it is an average of 4,500 korunas ($145). Stefko compared the subsidy of 30 million korunas (about $1 million), earmarked for SRo by the present government with "the first pill of aspirin offered to a patient running a temperature of 40 degrees."
