Why is the Social Democratic Party [SPD] continuing its criticism? Are the Social Democrats bad losers? [Klose] No. The new federal president has been democratically elected. The discussion must now end even though our candidate has lost. We will cooperate loyally with the new president. The SPD respects the result. It reflects the current situation of political forces, which we have to change in the upcoming election. That is all. [Kleine] Nevertheless, the leading SPD officials continue to criticize the electoral process and Roman Herzog.... [Klose] We should stop it. Even though there was some irritation after the speech of the future president, we must now stop criticism. Our political opponent is Helmut Kohl and not Roman Herzog. [Kleine] Was the SPD not too sure that its candidate would win the election? [Klose] Due to the majority situation I was always convinced that we would have a fair chance as an outsider -- but not more. [Kleine] SPD Chairman Scharping regards the Free Democratic Party [FDP] as superfluous after its recent behavior in the federal convention. Does this end the speculation about an SPD-FDP coalition after the Bundestag election? [Klose] Scharping meant that in a political sense -- and he was being polemical. Of course we were upset about the FDP's behavior. Yet the next elections have to show how much the FDP is worth. Right now, the FDP is not in a good shape, it is a political lightweight. [Kleine] Herzog was hardly elected when voices were raised in the SPD calling for a direct election of the president. Does the SPD now really want to change the electoral procedure? [Klose] No. We will not simply change a longstanding SPD position two days after the election. The discussion was a result of the initial, understandable disappointment about the defeat. [Kleine] The Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] now has the right to nominate a new judge to the Federal Constitutional Court as a successor to Roman Herzog, and the SPD has to agree. Will you now pay back the CDU for its rejection of Herta Daeubler-Gmelin last year? [Klose] The CDU/CSU will indeed have to ask the SPD's support for its candidate. We had to experience the same last year the other way round. In the past the CDU/CSU did not always accept each candidate, and we will not do so, either.
