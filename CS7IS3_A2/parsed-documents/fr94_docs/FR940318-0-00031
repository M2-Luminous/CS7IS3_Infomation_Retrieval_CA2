FR940318-0-00031 FR940318-0-00006 15. Section 124.311(f)(4) is revised to read as follows: §124.311 8(a) competition. * * * * * (f) * * * (4)(i) In a sealed bid acquisition, upon the receipt of offers, the procuring agency shall submit to SBA a list of offerors ranked in the order of their standing for award (that is, lowest bid, second low bid, etc.) with the total evaluated price for each offer, differentiating between basic requirements and any options. (ii) In a negotiated acquisition, the procuring agency shall transmit to SBA the offeror determined by the procuring agency to be the apparent successful offeror. Such a referral generally shall be made at the time the procuring agency transmits the 8(a) contract documents to SBA for signature, unless the contracting officer has made a responsibility referral to SBA under FAR 19.809. In the case of such a referral, SBA shall determine eligibility when the responsibility referral is made to SBA, and may determine responsibility both at the time of the referral and at the time of award. (iii) Eligibility shall be determined as of the date of a Participant's submission of its initial offer which includes price. In addition, eligibility is determined for each competitive 8(a) acquisition independent of other 8(a) acquisitions for which a Participant has submitted an offer, but for which no award has been made. Example. Participant X has an approved 8(a) support level of $1 million. To date, X has received no 8(a) contract support. X submits offers that include price on five separate 8(a) competitive procurements (each with a $500,000 base year). The $1 million support level is not an eligibility bar to the Participant receiving any or all of the five acquisitions for which it submitted an offer because at the time that it submitted its offers, it was eligible to receive each contract independent of the other four contracts. In this example, it is possible that X is ultimately awarded all five contracts, even though the five taken together would be in excess of its applicable support level. Once awards have actually been made in excess of the $1 million support level, any subsequent offers would be made in the face of ineligibility. * * * * * 16. Section 124.311 is further amended by revising the introductory text in paragraph (f)(5), redesignating paragraphs (f)(5)(iii) and (f)(5)(iv) as paragraphs (f)(5)(iv) and (f)(5)(v), respectively, adding a new paragraph (f)(5)(iii), and revising the first sentence of newly redesignated paragraph (f)(5)(v) to read as follows: §124.311 8(a) competition. * * * * * (f) * * * (5) Within 5 working days after receipt of the procuring agency's request for an eligibility determination, the SBA will determine whether any firm identified is eligible for award of the contract, including: * * * * * (iii) If the procurement is to be restricted within a particular stage of program participation or a particular geographical area, whether the firm is within the required stage of development or location; * * * * * (v) If the firm is in the transitional stage, whether it has exceeded its approved business support level by more than 25 percent (or will exceed such level if it is awarded the contract at issue), and whether it has achieved its competitive business mix targets under 124.312.␣*␣*␣* * * * * * 17. Section 124.311 is further amended by adding the following new paragraph (i) to read as follows: §124.311 8(a) competition. * * * * * (i) Award to firms whose program terms have expired. A concern that has completed its term of participation in the 8(a) program, as set forth in §124.110, may be awarded a competitive 8(a) contract if it was a Program Participant eligible for award of the contract on the date specified for receipt of offers contained in the contract solicitation. §124.321 [Amended] 18. Section 124.321(h)(2) is amended by removing ``two'' and adding ``five'' in its place. 19. Section 124.321(h)(3) is amended by removing ``September 30, 1991'' and adding ``September 30, 1994.'' §124.601 [Amended] 20. Section 124.601(c) is amended by removing the reference to a ``§121.9'' and adding ``§§121.1601&hyph;121.1608.'' §§124.602, 124.604 and 124.605 [Amended] 21. Sections 124.602(f), 124.602(g), 124.604, 124.605(a)(3), and 124.605(c)(1) are amended by revising the phrase ``Office of Program Eligibility'' to read ``Division of Programs Certification and Eligibility'' wherever it appears. §§124.602, 124.604, 124.607 and 124.608 [Amended] 22. Sections 124.602(g), 124.604, 124.607(d), 124.608(a), 124.608(b) introductory text, 124.608(b)(1), 124.608(b)(3), 124.608(c), 124.609(a), and 124.609(b) are amended by revising the term ``OPE'' to read ``DPCE'' wherever it appears.
