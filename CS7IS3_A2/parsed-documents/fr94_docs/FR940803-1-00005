FR940803-1-00005 FR940803-1-00002 These provisions are: (1) The assessment of imported cotton and cotton products; and (2) termination of the right of producers to demand a refund of assessments. An amended Cotton Research and Promotion Order was approved by producers and importers voting in a referendum held July 17&hyph;26, 1991. Proposed rules implementing the amended Order were published in the Federal Register on December 17, 1991, (56 FR 65450). The final implementing rules were published on July 1 and 2, 1992, (57 FR 29181) and (57 FR 29431), respectively. This proposed rule would increase the value assigned to imported cotton in the Cotton Board Rules and Regulations 7 CFR 1205.510 (b)(2). This value is used to calculate supplemental assessments on imported cotton and the cotton content of imported products. Supplemental assessments are the second part of a two-part assessment. The first part of the assessment is levied on the weight of cotton produced or imported at a rate of $1 per bale of cotton which is equivalent to 500 pounds or $1 per 226.8 kilograms. Supplemental assessments are levied at a rate of five tenths of one percent of the value of domestically produced cotton, imported cotton, and the cotton content of imported products. The agency adopted the use of the average price received by U.S. farmers for Upland cotton as a benchmark for the value of domestically produced cotton. The source for this statistic is ``Agricultural Prices'', a publication of the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the Department of Agriculture. Use of the average price figure in the calculation of supplemental assessments on imported cotton and the cotton content of imported products yields an assessment that approximates assessments paid on domestically produced cotton. The current value of imported cotton as published in the Federal Register (57 FR 29431) for the purpose of calculating supplemental assessments on imported cotton is $1.160 per kilogram. Using the Average Price Received by U.S. farmers for Upland cotton for the calendar year 1993, which is $0.543 per pound, the new value of imported cotton would be $1.197 per kilogram. An example of the assessment formula and how the various figures are obtained is as follows: One bale is equal to 500 pounds. One kilogram equals 2.2046 pounds. One pound equals 0.453597 kilograms. One dollar per bale assessment converted to kilograms A 500 pound bale=226.8 kg. (500×.453597) $1 per bale assessment =$0.002000 per pound (1 500) =$0.004409 per kg. (1 226.8) Supplemental assessment of 5/10 of one percent of the value of the cotton converted to kilograms Average price received=$0.543 per pound or average value=$1.197 per kg. (0.543×2.2046) 5/10 of one percent of the average price in kg.=$0.005985 per kg. (1.1970×.005) Total assessment per kilogram $1 per bale equivalent assessment=$0.004409 per kg. Supplemental assessment+ $0.005985 per kg. total assessment per kg.=$0.010394 Since the value of cotton is the basis of the supplemental assessment calculation and the figures shown in the right hand column of the Import Assessment Table 1205.510 (b)(3) are a result of such a calculation, these figures would be revised. These figures indicate the total assessment per kilogram due for each Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) number subject to assessment. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1205 Advertising, Agricultural research, Cotton, Marketing agreements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 1205 is amended as follows: PART 1205_COTTON RESEARCH AND PROMOTION 1. The authority citation for Part 1205 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 2101&hyph;2118. 2. In Section 1205.510 (b)(2) and (3) are revised and a new paragraph (b)(10) is added to read as follows: §1205.510 Levy of assessments. * * * * * (b) * * * (2) The 12-month average of monthly average prices received by U.S. farmers will be calculated annually. Such average will be used as the value of imported cotton for the purpose of levying the supplemental assessment on imported cotton and will be expressed in kilograms. The value of imported cotton for the purpose of levying this supplemental assessment is $1.197 per kilogram. (3) The following table contains the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) classification numbers and corresponding conversion factors and assessments. The left column of the table indicates the HTS classifications of imported cotton and cotton-containing products subject to assessment. The center column indicates the conversion factor for determining the raw fiber content for each kilogram of the HTS. HTS numbers for raw cotton have no conversion factors in the table. The right column indicates the total assessment per kilogram of the article assessed. Any line item entry of cotton appearing on Customs entry documentation in which the value of the cotton contained therein is less than $220.99 will not be subject to assessments as described in this section.
