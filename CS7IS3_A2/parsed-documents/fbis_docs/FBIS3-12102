We have learned from the answers he gave Chilean journalists that the terrorists sentenced to life imprisonment will, under no circumstances, be released and that within the framework of the Peace Accord there will be no negotiated future integration of any subversive organization into the legal political spectrum. Unless our memory fails us, during a news conference he gave during recent trip to Colombia, Fujimori again denied that any advantage will be granted to the Shining Path members currently in prison and who wanted to hold their Second Congress. This column has evaluated the Shining Path's internal letters and documents, circulated with the approval of the SIN [National Intelligence Service]. Because these documents acknowledge the achievement of progress within the Peace Accord, a reflection on the president's remarks is required. His remarks would seem at first glance to be an open and public denial of the progress that has been achieved and the provisos that have been reached between the president's emissary (Agent 002) and the Shining Path leadership in that "... prisoners of war and political prisoners will be released one at a time whether or not they have been sentenced." This is indicated in one of the clauses of the Accord that is being discussed inside the prisons. The possibility of holding the Second Congress has also been discarded. The document containing the summons for this congress was published in full some weeks ago by LA REPUBLICA. If this assumption is true, then the Feliciano Group argument, which consider the Peace Accord negotiations to be government "rubbish," are fully strengthened. Thus, the president's remarks scrap the SIN's "psycho-social" maneuver -- or at least end it -- and therefore the planned objective has been achieved, in other words, the uncovering of the split that occurred within Shining Path. Another hypothesis could be applied: That the "psycho-social" objective of the president's remarks is to confuse and thereby hide the real intentions and exact content of the negotiations with the imprisoned terrorists. This would not be the first time one thing has been said and the contrary implemented. In view of the importance, responsibility, and cost to be endured, we believe the topic of peace in the country should be discussed within the sphere of a great national consensus that can overcome daily disagreements between the opposition and the official sector. One condition alone is needed for this: Crystal clarity over what is said and what is done. This is a simple duty that should be taken up by all Peruvians who want a true peace, in other words, eternal peace.
