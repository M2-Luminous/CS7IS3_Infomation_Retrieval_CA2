FR940405-1-00116 FR940405-1-00013 The Occupational Safety and Health Act gives the Secretary the right to promulgate standards to assure employees safe and healthful working conditions. Employers must comply with the standards which the Secretary promulgates. The Act defines an employer expansively as a person with employees in a business affecting interstate commerce. The Agency believes that the proposal as written will protect employees from the risks of poor indoor air quality. Where the owner of a business is not the owner of the space where such business operates, the owner or landlord of the building will probably also be an employer within the meaning of the Act and the definition contained in this proposal. This is so because the building owner or operator will generally have employees (either on site or off site) and will be engaged in a business affecting interstate commerce. In such cases the situation will be construed to be a multi-employer worksite. Such situations are quite common in the context of construction sites. The Agency does not believe that there is any reason to treat nonindustrial multi-employer worksites differently from construction multi-employer worksites for purposes of compliance. OSHA has a long history of enforcing OSHA standards in multi-employer worksites. Nothing in this proposed rule would change the position that the Agency has taken in cases such as Anning-Johnson (4 OSH Cas. (BNA) 1193, Harvey Workover, Inc., 7 OSH Cas. (BNA) 1687 and in its Field Operations Manual (CPL 2.45 CH&hyph;1, Chapter V&hyph;9). As a general matter each employer is responsible for the health and safety of his/her own employees. However, under certain circumstances an employer may be cited for endangering the safety or health of another employer's employees. In determining who to hold responsible, OSHA will look at who created the hazard, who controlled the hazard, and whether all reasonable means were taken to deal with the hazard. It is contemplated that in those cases where there is a multi-employer worksite that the affected employers will divide up the responsibilities in the manner in which they make the most sense. Those who have information at their disposal that is required to be kept under the proposal will make use of the information or make it available to whoever will need that information in the discharge of their duties. For example, the building engineer may have possession of the schematics of the ventilation system. The engineer would make them available to the person responsible for maintaining the system as well as the person responsible for developing the IAQ Compliance Plan (if that is not the same person). The proposal is designed to promote the efficient resolution of indoor air quality problems and will not result in duplicative efforts. There is nothing in the proposal, for example, that would prevent the building owner (who is an employer within the meaning of the Act) from gathering the required information from the various lessee/employers in the premises, developing, and implementing an IAQ Compliance Plan which would be shared with the various employers occupying the premises. In addition, it may be more efficient for the building owner to develop and maintain the records required by the proposal, again sharing them with the various employer-tenants. The Agency believes that the co-operative interrelationships which the performance oriented proposal permits will avoid duplication of compliance activities even within multi-employer worksites. The term ``HVAC system'' means the collective components of the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system including, but not limited to, filters and frames, cooling coil condensate drip pans and drainage piping, outside air dampers and actuators, humidifiers, air distribution ductwork, automatic temperature controls, and cooling towers. This definition also intends to focus on those HVAC system components whose failure, degradation, or misuse would adversely impact indoor air quality. The term ``Nonindustrial work environment'' means an indoor or enclosed work space such as, but not limited to, offices, educational facilities, commercial establishments, and healthcare facilities, and office areas, cafeterias, and break rooms located in manufacturing or production facilities. Nonindustrial work environments do not include manufacturing and production facilities, residences, vehicles, and agricultural operations. The term ``Renovation and remodeling'' means building modification involving activities that include but are not limited to: removal or replacement of walls, ceilings, floors, carpet, and components such as moldings, cabinets, doors, and windows; painting, decorating, demolition, surface refinishing, and removal or cleaning of ventilation ducts. The terms ``HVAC system'', ``Nonindustrial work environment'', and ``Renovation and remodeling'' are defined to clarify and illustrate the parameters under which obligations of the standard are incurred. For example, the definition of ``HVAC system'' lists what OSHA believes to be typical components of such systems which directly affect indoor air quality. These components are enumerated since provisions under the standard propose to require employers to perform routine inspection and maintenance on those components. ``Renovation and remodeling'' is defined to inform the employer of the situations under which the standard proposes to require the employer to take special precautions when those activities take place. Indoor Air Quality Compliance Program: Paragraph (c) This paragraph proposes to require employers to obtain or develop certain written information that will facilitate implementation of measures necessary to prevent degradation of indoor air quality. Paragraph (c)(2) proposes to require the employer to identify a designated person to be given the responsibility of overseeing establishment and implementation of the written compliance program. Paragraph (c)(3) proposes to require the employer to establish a written IAQ compliance program to include at least the following information: a description of the facility building systems; schematics or construction documents locating building systems equipment; information on the daily operation and management of the building systems; a description of the building and its function; a written maintenance program; and a checklist for visual inspection of the building systems. Further, paragraph (c)(4) proposes to require that the following information also must be retained, if available, to assist in indoor air quality evaluations: as built construction documents; HVAC system commissioning reports; HVAC system testing, adjusting and balancing reports; operation and maintenance manuals; water treatment logs; and operator training materials. Paragraph (c)(5) proposes to require the establishment of records of employee complaints of building-related illnesses, as part of the written program. OSHA believes that written plans are an essential element of an overall compliance program since it will encourage employers to focus on indoor air quality and implement the necessary controls and measures to achieve compliance with the standard [Exs. 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;85, 3&hyph;412, 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502, 3&hyph;505, 3&hyph;529]. The development of documented safety and health programs and procedures is a well-established and common practice in industry, and requirements for written programs are typically found in other OSHA standards dealing with exposure to toxic substances. Written plans provide information to allow OSHA, the employer, and employees to examine the control methods chosen and evaluate the extent to which these planned controls are being implemented. Paragraph (c)(3) proposes to require the employer to establish written plans for compliance. Specifically, paragraphs (c)(3)(i), (c)(3)(ii), and (c)(3)(iii) propose to require general, descriptive information about: the facility, building systems, building function and building use patterns. This general building description is believed to be essential information of a building profile which is necessary for a basic understanding of the building systems and which is necessary to set the foundation for the operations and maintenance information required in other paragraphs.
