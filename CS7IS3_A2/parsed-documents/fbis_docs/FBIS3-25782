Wu arrived in Beijing Friday as head of a four-man SEF contingent to arrange the agenda of talks between SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Chiao Jen-ho and ARATS Vice President and Secretary-General Tang Shubei. Chiao will arrive here on Jan. 31. The Chiao-Tang talks will be the highest-level cross-Strait talks since the Singapore negotiations between SEF Chairman Ku Chen-fu and his ARATS counterpart, Wang Daohan, in April last year. Officials of the SEF and ARATS, the two intermediary organizations authorized by Taipei and Beijing to handle cross- Strait exchanges in the absence of official ties between the two, failed to reach any concrete agreements in three follow-up meetings to the Singapore talks. The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) earlier said that it hoped the Chiao-Tang talks would "create favorable conditions" for a second round of Ku-Wang negotiations. The SEF had earlier proposed that Chiao and Tang focus on four main areas of discussion: -- The effectiveness of the SEF and ARATS in promoting cross-Strait exchanges, such as in the implementation of agreements on the authentification of documents and compensation for lost registered mail; -- The results of the three follow-up talks to the Koo-Wang meeting; -- The implementation of issues agreed upon during the Singapore talks, including cross-Strait economic cooperation and cultural exchanges, and protection of Taiwan investors in the mainland; and -- Other issues of mutual concern, such as the repatriation from Taiwan of mainland hijackers and illegal immigrants, and the joint crackdown on drug and arms smuggling.
