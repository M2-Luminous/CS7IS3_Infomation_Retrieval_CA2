FR940930-0-00121 FR940930-0-00025 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AB83 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Endangered Status for the Plant Tetramolopium capillare (Pamakani) AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), for the plant Tetramolopium capillare (pamakani). Two extant populations containing a total of 12 known individuals of the species remain in the southwestern portion of West Maui. The species and its habitat have been variously affected or are currently threatened by fire and by habitat degradation and competition from invasive alien plant species. Due to the small number of existing individuals and their very narrow distribution, this species is subject to reduced reproductive vigor and/or an increased likelihood of extinction from stochastic events. This final rule implements the Federal protection and recovery provisions provided by the Act. It also makes operative State regulations that will protect Tetramolopium capillare as an endangered species. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: The complete file for this final rule is available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours, at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Pacific Islands Office, 300 Ala Moana Boulevard, Room 6307, P.O. Box 50167, Honolulu, Hawaii 96850. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert P. Smith, Field Supervisor, at the above address (808/541&hyph;2749). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background
