"The most important thing now is to save the state," he told journalists during RUKH's Fifth Congress. "If we `kill' the last authority, we'll allow both internal and external forces to do anything they want," he said. He also said that the elections of local governments on 26 June, in accordance with the current law, would disintegrate the country and lead to a federalization in its worst form. According to the law on local governments, the heads of the local councils will possess executive authority in all its entirety, and the institution of the president's representatives will be annulled. "This law was favored by the local bureaucrats who want to rule in the periphery," said Mikhalchenko. Earlier, RUKH leader Vyacheslav Chernovyl had supported the president's proposal on putting off presidential elections to a later date. Commenting on the agreements on economic integration within the CIS, signed in Moscow on 15 April, Mikhalchenko said that "in the absence of exact wordings, everyone is interpreting these agreements the way he likes." In his opinion, this is due to the fact that the CIS remains an association of unequal members.
