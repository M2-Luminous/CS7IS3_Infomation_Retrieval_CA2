"We sharply protest this insolent action which has undermined all efforts to end the crisis in the territory of former Yugoslavia by peaceful means," a statement stresses and adds that NATO's attack on the Srpska republic has further shaken the Serb people's confidence in the international community, which was at its lowest level anyway, due to the international community's partisan and biased attitude in the past. "With this act of aggression the international community has declared war on the Serb people, thus trying to force it -- under the threat of NATO's war machinery -- to accept solutions which are in the interest of the other two warring sides and detrimental to the Serb people," the RSK president warns. The statement goes on to say: ``The RSK people and leadership again express their full support for our brothers in the Srpska republic and their efforts to defend their freedom won in blood. ``Those who committed this thoughtless act will bear the blame for all the possible consequences of the bombing of the Srpska republic on the further course of the peace process in the territory of former Yugoslavia. "At the same time, we warn all the relevant international factors that the RSK will not tolerate any attempts to solve its future political status through pressure and threats, regardless from which side they come."
