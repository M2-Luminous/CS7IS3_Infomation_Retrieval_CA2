The daily JAKARTA POST said that Taiwanese Presidential Office spokesman Kramer Ting told journalists that Li and Suharto agreed that Indonesia and Taiwan should improve economic cooperation. Suharto also expressed appreciation for Taiwanese investment in Indonesia, the spokesman said. The two presidents met for 90 minutes at the Tampaksiring summer palace on the Indonesian resort island of Bali Friday. Despite the absence of diplomatic relations, Taiwan is the third largest investor in Indonesia, committing nearly four billion dollars over the past 25 years in the archipelago. Two-way trade was 1.42 billion dollars in the first half of 1993 and was a total of 2.62 billion dollars in 1992. The tightly guarded and closed meeting between Li and Suharto took place after a lunch attended by the presidents and the first ladies, a source here said. [passage omitted] Suharto arrived in Bali late Thursday, officially to visit the newly renovated state-owned Grand Bali Beach Hotel, which had burned down in January 1992. [passage omitted] Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said that Li's visit would not change Indonesia's One-China policy. He said that any meeting between Li and Indonesian officials, including Suharto, would be private capacities and should not be "exaggerated." [passage omitted]
