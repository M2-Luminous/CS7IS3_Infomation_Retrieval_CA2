"No final conclusion has yet been reached, so I would point out that based on our preliminary investigations, it is our judgement that the shot that killed Corporal Stephane Dubrulle on March 11 did not come from the Bosnian Serb side," Nerzig said. "In fact, we do have indications on a preliminary basis that the shot does seem to have come from the Bosnian Moslem side." Dubrulle was the 19th French soldier killed in Bosnia-Herzegovina since the beginning of the war. A total of 79 UN peacekeepers have died in the 23-month war.
