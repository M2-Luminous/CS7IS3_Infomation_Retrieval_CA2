His plane just landed in Tashkent airport. This is his first trip to neighbouring Uzbekistan this year. In 1993 the leaders of the two republics held five such meetings in Tashkent, Almaty, Kokchetav, Kzyl Orda and Chimkent. Those were not spontaneous or off-hand meetings. It is common knowledge that official contacts and the policy pursued by the two leaders who have already been recognised by the world will largely affect the situation in the entire Central Asian region. Each such meeting helps solve urgent economic and social problems and lay the foundation for building a common market in the region. These issues will feature prominently during the talks between Nazarbayev and Uzbek leaders. The sides are expected to sign a package of documents which will bring the two countries even closer together and provide a basis for stronger cooperation. It is symbolic that today's meeting between Nazarbayev and Uzbek President Islam Karimov has coincided with the first anniversary of the creation of the term "Central Asia" coined by the leaders of Kazakhstan and five Central Asian republics at their summit meeting in Tashkent last January. It was then that the Central-Asian-region notion was brought to life. Despite all economic hardships it has taken firm roots in the political lexicon. Although not all goals were fulfilled at that meeting, regional integration is beginning to take up real shape.
