Kostomarov; place and date not given: "Border Across the Vyshtynetskoye Lake or Russia Is Ready To Compromise"] [Text] As YANTARNIY KRAY has already reported, a working meeting of delegations of the Russian Border Troops and the Lithuanian Border Guard has been held. "The negotiations were constructive, we resolved all issues included on the agenda." This is how the head of the Russian delegation, Major General Aleksey Kozhevnikov, deputy commander in chief of the Russian Border Troops and chairman of the Department for Holding International Negotiations within the Russian Border Troops, assessed the recent developments. The priority directions in the continued cooperation have been detailed. This, in particular, includes exchanges of information, investigations in the interests of guarding the state border, the implementation of measures preventing the illegal transfer of weapons, drugs, and other goods banned for transborder shipments, and other illegal activities across the border and through border checkpoints, as well as the exchange of expertise in protecting borders and maintaining border control. It was agreed that to draft an intergovernmental agreement on cooperation in border issues, the Lithuanian side will file a report on these negotiations with the Lithuanian Government. If this position is approved, appropriate working groups will be formed. They will probably meet in July-August of this year. Anyone who attentively observes developments in relations between Moscow and Vilnius shares, of course, the viewpoint that one of the most complicated issues at the negotiations is the military traffic between Russia and Kaliningrad Oblast, which must cross Lithuanian territory. The protocol states that during the meeting the parties exchanged opinions on transiting goods across the territory of Lithuania to provide for the maintenance of the Kaliningrad Group of the Russian Border Troops. Major General Aleksey Kozhevnikov does not rule out that they will finally resolve this issue by singling it out from the entire block of military traffic issues. One more thing. Participants in the meeting agreed that it is necessary to install a direct telephone (telex) line between the Kaliningrad Group of the Russian Border Troops and the Lithuanian Border Guard, between units and some checkpoints, as well as between certain border outposts and checkpoints. I asked Major General Aleksey Kozhevnikov after the completion of the talks to answer some of my questions. [Kostomarov] Aleksey Vladimirovich, you mentioned that you recently signed some border agreements with Poland. Will the agreements with Lithuania be of a similar nature? [Kozhevnikov] They will differ due to some peculiarities in the conditions of the territory. Our border with Poland was established a long time ago, it is comprehensively equipped because for dozens of years it was guarded in cooperation with the Polish side. Our border with Lithuania is new, unequipped, and, in addition, has not yet been delineated. These days, according to the press, a special commission is dealing with the delineation issue. [Kostomarov] Is it also addressing demarcation issues? [Kozhevnikov] No, demarcation issues are still awaiting their resolution. A regular, seventh round of talks on delineation was held in Vilnius on 27-28 May. The parties agreed on the provisions of the planned agreement on state borders. There are, however, two moments which demand a rapprochement of positions. [Kostomarov] What are they? [Kozhevnikov] The first is the delineation of the economic zone and the maritime area. We should discuss the initial point from which we would proceed based on available international agreements. The second is connected with Vyshtynetskoye Lake. Before, there was an administrative border -- currently, it is declared the state border -- which ran along the Lithuanian shore. We are ready to alter this configuration. In other words, the Russian side can compromise in the interests of our friendly relations with Lithuania. At the same time, we asked the Lithuanian side to allow our ships to travel along the Neman -- Lithuanian territory -- to the Baltic Sea. At the end of the talks, however, the position of Lithuania changed somewhat. I believe that the commissions of the two states will establish a point of contact.
