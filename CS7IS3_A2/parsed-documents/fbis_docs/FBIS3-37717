Last week, three party officials -- Viktor Kobelyev, Vyacheslav Marychyev and Alexander Pronin -- spoke of their disagreement with actions and speeches by Party Chairman Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Deputy Speaker of the State Duma Aleksandr Vengerovskiy. Zhirinovskiy said that "no one stands to benefit from any disarray within party ranks." As an example, he pointed to the Russia's Choice Party which was defeated in the December election because of disunity despite an enormous financial backing and President Yeltsin's rule of the country. "We have unity, a policy and leader and the party's rating is going up at a breakneck speed," he said. The LDP leader warned that from now on, any conflicts must be resolved within the faction and should never be taken up with parliament. "What our opponents want is party infighting and we must not give them a chance," he said. Zhirinovskiy called to suppress any betrayal from within. "If you dislike it, put your party card and deputy mandate on the table and start from scratch in some other party," he told the LDP deputies. Zhirinovskiy also said that to avert a party split, the party chairman must be granted congressional powers in between party congresses offering for appropriate amendments to be made in party rules during the LDP's next forum in April. In his view, the party leader must be made responsible for all issues -- personnel, financial and others -- in between party congresses. The LDP's supreme council should play a consultative role while the party chairman "like Russia in the U.N. Security Council" must be allowed to veto down any council resolutions, Zhirinovskiy said. This brought no comment from council members. Zhirinovskiy said that from now on, his first deputy and editor-in-chief of the party sponsored "Liberal" newspaper Stanislav Zhebrovskiy would handle contacts with the LDP's regional branches (earlier, Viktor Kobelyev's area of responsibility). One other council member Aleksandr Vengerovskiy is to be responsible for day-to-day management of the party faction in parliament. The two disgraced party members, Viktor Kobelyev and Aleksandr Pronin, were conspicuously absent at the meeting while the third one, Vyacheslav Marychyev, left it five minutes after journalists. Eyewitnesses say there was "a tough male talk" in those five minutes with Marychyev demanding an apology from Vengerovskiy for having called him "a black sheep" in a recent TV interview. Marychyev told reporters that he would quit the party unless Vengerovskiy apologized.
