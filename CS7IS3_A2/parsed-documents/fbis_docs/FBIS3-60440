Minic report: "The Winter -- a New Challenge"] [Text] This winter the Yugoslavs will experience the sanctions in their full harshness, while our health will be the first to suffer the consequences of the sanctions. The experts of the Belgrade Institute for Health Care anticipate an increased number of those suffering from the infections of the respiratory organs, because of inadequate clothing and bad heating. Influenza, a respiratory infection, whose spreading is particularly benefited by closed rooms, such as are usually found in firms, is this year assisted by some new circumstances: A new sort of virus, but also a new sort of closed room -- the vehicles of public transportation. Only a small step divides influenza from pneumonia, which is the major complication, particularly in the case of the elderly, who chronically suffer from such diseases.... Flu Contracted on a Bus [subhead] Epidemiologists forecast that the overcrowding of schools and institutions of collective accommodation will result in an increase in cases of streptococcus infections, as well as of food poisoning, because, in the meantime, the systematic control of the production, transportation, and conservation of food supplies has ceased. An insufficient and low-quality nutrition brings about a general deterioration of the immunity of citizens. Some bleak forecasts have already come true: In the last two years in our capital there has been a growing number of mental, contagious, and so called insufficiently defined diseases, that is to say, cases without diagnosis. "In the period prior to the sanctions, that is from 1986 to 1990, the number of those who died of contagious diseases was 213 on average, two years later it was 272 (27 percent more), while in the first quarter of this year as much as four times more cases of death have been reported, relative to last year. The reason for worry lies with the fact that people are even dying of diseases that are normally quite curable if a correct therapy is implemented. This is to say, the main problem is the lack of medicines," Professor Dr. Svetislav Ristic, head of the Epidemiologic Department at the Federal Institute for Health Care, says. Prof. Dr. Teodor Bakovic, director of the aforementioned institute, says that the number of newly registered patients suffering from active tuberculosis has increased by 8.6 percent, as well as the number of those suffering from psychosis, which has increased by 3.8 percent. This figure refers only to the cases registered by general practitioners. The analysis of autopsy reports in the period prior to the imposition of the UN sanctions and after it, speaks convincingly for how endangered the health of Yugoslav citizens is. "The cases of infections have considerably increased in the time of the sanctions, particularly cases of pneumonia and sepsis as causes of death. In the period before the implementation of the sanctions, there were 20 percent of such cases, while after the implementation, the number of such cases has jumped to 42 percent. Before the embargo, infections as causes of death were reported in 31 percent of all death cases, while afterwards in almost 58 percent of cases," Prof. Dr. Vladimir Kanjuh from the Institute for Pathology with the Faculty for Medical Sciences, says. Diagnosis -- Unknown [subhead] Since the sanctions were implemented, the number of accurate diagnosis has sunk considerably. Until the end of 1992, 42 percent of diagnosis were correct, 39 percent were partly correct, while 19 percent were incorrect. With the deterioration of the conditions in the health care institutions, only 27 percent of diagnosis have been proven correct, 38 percent partly, while as much as 35 percent have been proven incorrect! There are many reasons for that: The reduced number of regular medical checkups, the lack of diagnostic instruments and medicines, problems in the field of disinfection and disinfestation.... Among the most frequent causes of death, apart from "traditional" diseases, the violent forms of death (suicides, murders, accidents) have also found their place on the scale. After a long time, anemia (poor condition of blood) has reappeared as one of the most frequent diseases, as a consequence of inadequate nutrition. We are no longer safe from diseases that can be prevented (by a vaccine), because the number of children immunized by the DI-TE-PER [against diphtheria, tetanus, and periostitis] has dropped from 88 to 70 percent, while those vaccinated against chicken pox have dropped from 88 to 76 percent, partly because of the shortage, partly because of malfunctions, and partly because of the difficulties of transport. All age groups are endangered, without distinction, while the prospects for the future are even worse. The study worked out by Dr. Viktorija Cucic stresses, among other things, that the conditions for carrying out scientific research will be reduced by 64 percent, the possibilities for specialization will drop by 61 percent, the chances for providing basic medicines by 46 percent, while conditions for keeping up the hygienic-epidemiologic level in health care institutions will be reduced by 38 percent. The consequence of these changes will be a decline in the birth rate, an increase in the infant mortality-rate, an increase in cases of cardiovascular diseases, ulcers, mental disorders, diabetes, tuberculosis.... The conclusion is quite unambiguous: Either the sanctions are lifted in the field of medicine, or we shall die out.
