This situation has permitted civilian authorities to carry out their normal activities and direct their efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the population. Soldiers continue to assist the civilian population by transporting and distributing supplies, blankets, and medicine to the affected towns. These actions are also being carried out freely by different social groups, the Red Cross, and nongovernment organizations. The Army will continue to participate in these humanitarian tasks and will assist civil institutions and organizations that require its assistance.
