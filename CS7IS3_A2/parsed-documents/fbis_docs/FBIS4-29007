FBIS4-29007 "dreas115bb_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-115 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 INTER-ASIAN AFFAIRS ASEAN To Cooperate, Not Compete for Investors ASEAN To Cooperate, Not Compete for Investors BK1306141694 Jakarta ANTARA in English 1011 GMT 13 Jun 94 BK1306141694 Jakarta ANTARA English BFN [Text] Nusa Dua (Bali), Jun 13 (OANA-ANTARA) -- State Minister for the Mobilization of Investment Funds who is also chairman of the Coordinating Board for Investment (BKPM) Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo noted here on Monday the six ASEAN member countries will not compete each other in inviting foreign investors. "On the contrary, they will even cooperate either in inviting foreign investors or investment among the ASEAN member countries," he told the press after inaugurating the ASEAN working group on the promotion of foreign direct investment here on Monday. He expressed the hope that the meeting would yield a mechanism for foreign investment among the ASEAN member countries aside from the foreign investors. "We need a certain promotion campaign among the ASEAN member countries in a bid to invite foreign investment since the competition is getting tougher," he said. He reminded the ASEAN countries on the need for them to anticipate the development of the world economy which tends to the regional groups such as North America Free Trade Area (NAFTA), the Unification of the Europe, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). "We should also anticipate the implementation of the General Agreement of Tariff and Trade (GATT) agreed last April," he said. Queried about the ASEAN's view on the government regulation No. 20/1994 which provide greater access for foreign capital in company ownership, geographical spread and sectoral business lines, he said that ASEAN welcomed the economic deregulation package. "The package can not be avoided, meaning that Indonesia should issue such a package, otherwise it will be left behind," he said. Indonesia should increase its competitiveness in the current globalisation era if it wants to be survived, he said. "The government regulation is one of our ways in consolidating with others to attract more foreign investors," he added. Speaking on the future composition of foreign investment, he said that Japan stood at the first position followed by Taiwan replacing Hong Kong which has been in the second position since 1967 to May 1994. He attributed to the impressive performance of Taiwan to the country's aggressive efforts to improve investment in Indonesia by among others sending business leaders who accompanied their president during his visit here recently. He also said that Taiwan's improved investment climate was also as a result of "go south action programme" which promoted investment to its neighboring countries in the south such as Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Deputy Chairman for Foreign Investment Affairs at the BKPM Sugihono Kadarisman said that a number of developed countries still exerted non-economic pressures such as human rights issues and the most favoured nations (MFN). Kadarisman said that the country will discuss a strategy to counter such pressures confronting Indonesia's serious efforts to promote foreign investment. Some 50 participants from ASEAN member countries are attending the two-day meeting.
