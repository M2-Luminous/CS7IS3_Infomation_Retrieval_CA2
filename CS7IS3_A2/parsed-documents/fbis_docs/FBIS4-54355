"We don't expect the LDP and the SDP to get together and form a new government," Michihiko Kano of New Party Mirai said in a lecture. Kano, who bolted the LDP with four others and launched the new conservative party in April, reasoned that it is "unnatural" for those with a different political philosophy to form a coalition. A coalition between the LDP and the SDP, long archrivals under the LDP rule that ended last summer, would "be against the principle of political reform," said Kano, a former director general of the Management and Coordination Agency. Noting the several months that will follow the passage of the fiscal 1994 national budget will be a critical stage for Japan's politics, he urged the formation of a "powerful" government to institute political, economic and administrative reforms toward the 21st century. Mirai has generally supported Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata from outside the cabinet.
