I must admit that we had invited the PAC [Pan Africanist Congress] and it acknowledged receipt of our invitation, but the gentleman or lady who was supposed to represent them is not here yet. Let me welcome the gentlemen here, Mr Mashatile and Mr Coetzer. Good evening and welcome to you gentlemen. Perhaps it would be wise to start with you Mr Coetzer and look at the history. This one might say is part of the history that your apartheid policies created. We saw some victims there, we saw some hardships which people went through. How do you explain this today? [Coetzer] Well, I don't think that one can really explain history, or explain it away. I think what is important is that we remember, first of all, that we tried to learn from history and the mistakes of the past and use these celebrations -- if you want to -- as a day of remembrance as well as a day of reconciliation. I personally have some vivid memories of that day. I was a 14-year-old boy growing up in Vanderbijlpark right next to Sharpeville. So it left some emotional impressions on me as well. I was lucky I grew up in a home where my parents taught me to respect people and I experienced Sharpeville in a certain way. And I think that we should join hands to ensure that our country never slips into that kind of situation again. [Morobe] So you're not trying to reap, perhaps out of people's tragedy, you're not trying to reap a point here by saying that you want to convert people's tragedy into reconciliation, how do you put that right? [Coetzer] Well, the fact of the matter is: If we're going to just relive the animosities of the past, then we will not build a new nation, and I think that is the challenge of today. It is to learn from the past and to construct a better future for all the children of South Africa. [Morobe] Let's come to Mr. Mashatile, I'll give you a chance just now. How do you read the day? [Mashatile] Firstly, let me say that we are shocked to hear about the death of 21 prisoners in Queenstown Prison today. I would like to firstly send our sympathies to the families of those who died, and hope that this matter will be given the necessary attention. Coming back to Sharpeville. Sharpeville to us is the day in which we remember the struggles of our people who faced the brutality of the National Party regime, and we are saying that it is a day in which we draw courage that our people fought relentlessly. They were facing a violent system of oppression, and fought all the way to ensure that today we are on the brink of a new South Africa. And in fact I want to say that today, in particular this year, we are seeing Sharpeville in a different context. Our theme today was Never Again and we are saying that in the future of this country never again shall people be brutally murdered as it happened in the past. Never again shall there be massacres of innocent people when they protest and have legitimate grievances, and we are saying that we mark this day today to close that chapter, the chapter of brutality and murder through state authorities. And we are saying that we are moving toward a new era, but we will always remember that we were under a system that ruled people through terror, through brutality and murder. [Morobe] What about the fact that now Mr. Coetzer here speaks of reconciliation, he wants to look back on the day as a day of reconciliation? Do you want to read that from now on? After the elections, how do you look at Sharpeville, the 21st? [Mashatile] Yes, we are for reconciliation. In fact, when our president came out of prison, the first thing that he said was that we should work for reconciliation. The pint I'm making is that we will always remember where we come from, and that Sharpeville has to be remembered not only as a particular day where we remember people who were killed -- the 69 people who were killed -- but as a reflection of the kind off system that we went through to go where we are going now, and of course after April the 27th we will be embarking on programs to ensure that we build a new country. Nation-building is our program, and we have a plan to ensure that when we say never again, it's not just a slogan but we're going to put in place mechanisms that are going to ensure that we don't only transform the political system, but the entire security systems and the police are going to be reformed to ensure that they are open and they are accountable to the communities so that the brutality of the past should never surface again. [Morobe] On the issue of reconciliation. Let me start by asking Mr Coetzer: What did the National Party today actually do to mark this day -- your role in this day? [Coetzer] I think it would be wrong for the National Party to try and -- especially at this point in time -- to get too directly involved, I think in what is a day of remembrance, I think in the present emotional situation would be a wrong step. I think the important thing for us at this stage is to look on the occasion of remembrance with dignity, to take a low profile, and to keep on reaching out the hand and say: Let's build the future, let's use opportunities in the future to create reconciliation. But I accept, yes, that we are coming to the end of an episode in our history, and it's important that one finishes those chapters and get it [as heard] behind us. [Morobe] When you say finish, I find it a little bit difficult in terms of... [pauses] we are talking here of massacres. We are talking here of.. [pauses] the whole attack was unleashed to the nation. If you say finish, are you infering that the people should forget what happened? [Coetzer] No, no, I'm not saying that we should forget. As I said right from the start, we should remember, yes, we should remember. And we should remember in such a way that we learn from the mistakes of the past. All of us have made mistakes. This was a horrible mistake. It was a tragedy, and yes, together we must ensure that those sort of tragedies don't happen in future again. So I'm not asking that we should forget. What we're asking for, is let's start building a joint future, and get the divided past behind us. [Morobe] When you're talking about building, we have seen people who have been maimed, we've seen what has happened. Now where are you going to start? Are you going to start by compensating the people? [Coetzer] Well, let me say as far as those sorts of subjects are concerned, at the national negotiations various mechanisms had been negotiated by all the major role players involved to ensure that there could be some redresses on some of the issues. That is something that has been negotiated. Remember now, if we're talking about compensation for instance, we're moving after the 27th of April toward a Government of National Unity for the next five years which will create the ideal platform for us jointly to address programs of reconciliation. [Morobe] But are you not seeing that as part of your responsibility now, also a gesture of showing what reconciliation is all about in terms of attending to...[pauses] some of them, I mean, since then they've never been able to lead a normal life. Wouldn't that be your responsibility as now the government? [Coetzer] Well, let me say there is a month left before the election. I think that it would be seen as cheap politicking if we tried to now quickly do something, and I think that would be wrong to try and use an occasion like this for narrow party political gain. As we've seen in the insert, I think that Sharpeville has already taken on a wider meaning. Sharpeville was triggered by the PAC, but it's not the PAC only that is involved in the remembrance any more, and I think that that is the challenge -- to broaden the base of remembrance. Each of us will remember it in our own way. The important thing is that we don't misuse this at this point in time just for points scoring. I'm not saying that anybody is doing that at this point in time. But I think to ask us to do something quickly now would be wrong. We've negotiated proper structures that can attend to this, and on a joint basis. We have 5 years of a Government of National Unity in front of us. The challenge is to build that national unity. [Morobe] Paul, Pieter Coetzer is talking about cheap politicking. Is the ANC not using this as part of the election campaigning -- cheap politicking on the whole issue of the Sharpeville massacre? [Mashatile] No, no. I mean, we have always remembered Sharpeville. It's not the first time today. We can never have any cheap politicking. I am saying that Sharpeville, in many respects, is a sad day for us because those who were killed are our people, killed in the context of their fight against oppression. We are saying today that we have to remember where we come from. We must remember that today as we are looking forward to a new Government of National Unity and so on, we must remember what brought us where we are. We are here because of our people standing up against brutal oppression, and therefore there is no cheap politicking. What we need to do today is to begin to say: How are we going to ensure, as South Africans, that what happened in Sharpeville on 21 March 1960 does not happen again. I'm saying the ANC has a plan to ensure that that should never happen again. [Morobe] Now the ANC has a plan. I asked Piet Coetzer whether they are going to compensate the people. What is the ANC's plan towards that? [Mashatile] Well, our plan is a bigger plan because what happened in Sharpeville happened because of a system, a system that was in place that ensured that police in this country were trained to protect that system and if need be, protect it brutally and use all sorts of methods, terror and so on. Now our plan, firstly, is to ensure that that system must go. The system of apartheid must go, you must bring into place a democratic system, bring about a new government, accountable government, a government of the people that will ensure that the security forces are there to serve the people. Once you have that plan in place, then you'd make sure that you never have police in this country that are going to do anything that goes against the people, but will do everything to protect the people. Now the bigger challenge for this country is to remove that system, and on 27 April we are saying that that system will be gone, and we'll have a new system that will then put into place that big plan that will be driven by the new government, of course, a Government of National Unity, as Piet Coetzer has said, to begin to build reconciliation, nation-building, but more importantly, to ensure that the kind of revelations that we are seeing today, of supplying arms to people by top generals does not take place. That is the plan that we have. [Mazibuko] Let me just stick with you again, Paul, here. Within the same context of a plan that you are mentioning, I've seen the (?agony) in Sharpeville today. The platform is being used more as a campaigning platform towards elections. How do you rectify the people's sorrow vis-a-vis the campaigning for votes? [Mashatile] Well, our campaign is part of our struggle. Election campaign, to us, is not a child's play. It's not a game, it's part and parcel of the continuation of the struggle that has been fought over 300 years, and therefore any platform, whether it is a funeral, whether it is a commemoration service of people who have died in this struggle, must be seen as part of that struggle. So we are saying today, when we talk about elections and a new government and a need to vote, we are expressing the will of those people who died in the course of this struggle, and therefore we have a duty to express that those people who died in Sharpeville were not going to steal some sugar somewhere. Those people were expressing the fact that they do not accept the system of oppression that imposed the pass system on them. This coming election is addressing that system, to remove it, therefore we must speak about elections in days like the Sharpeville day today. [Mazibuko] So you don't see any dichotomy in terms of politicking, or cheap politicking, as you used the term earlier? [Mashatile] No, no, because people died in context of struggle. If we don't talk about the need to vote in meetings like this, we will be betraying those people who had fallen in the course of the struggle, seeking this new change. So it is in the interests of the entire oppressed people to ensure that any given chance, whatever advances the course of the struggle must be on the top of our agenda. [Mazibuko] OK, let's come to you, Piet Coetzer. It comes back here to some people's minds -- they say all the National Party has done is now in the nineties, it's only taken us 34 years back. There were peaceful protests then, people were trying to express a desire. It's only now that you are coming back to that. In real terms, there is no real reform that you have come up with. [Coetzer] Well, let me say, first of all, in reaction to the question of ANC plans, and ANC plans for reconciliation. I think that's a dangerous approach. That's one of the mistakes we made in the past, and that was, that one party alone tried to make plans. Apartheid is already dead. We are already busy with reconstructing a future. A joint plan was made and negotiated at the constitutional negotiations. We're in the process of executing, jointly that plan. The pass laws were scrapped 9 years ago. In 1985 already the pass laws were scrapped. That is not an issue of this campaign. What should be an issue of this campaign is how we are going to reconstruct South Africa, how we're going to build a better future. I must say I find it a little bit disturbing if one party is trying to say that they alone will make plans. That is against the whole spirit of what was negotiated, against the whole spirit of a Government of National Unity. Yes, plans must be made, yes, some plans have already been made, and are waiting for execution by a government of national unity, joint plans. That's what we need now. [Mazibuko] OK, fine. Move on then to the issue of taking us 34 years ago. There were peaceful protests. [Coetzer] Yes. I say again, Sharpeville was a tragic mistake. It's not the only mistake that was made. There were other mistakes made, many mistakes made on all sides. But I don't think today that what South Africa needs is for accusations to be thrown across. That will bring us nowhere. What we must talk about is, what have we learned from the past, and... [Mazibuko, interrupting] What is it that you have learned from the past, because here we've seen... [pauses] your reply has been more repression when people came up with such protests, it's been more repression. What's your new reply now? [Coetzer] Well, what I'm saying is, one of the plans that have already been negotiated is a joint negotiated constitution that will take us to free democratic elections. One of the plans that has been made jointly is a Government of National Unity. The biggest mistake we can make -- and repeating the past -- is for one party on its own to try and make plans for everybody. The point is, we're going into an election that will ensure that we have a truly representative government, but a Government of National Unity, that should jointly build a new future. [Mazibuko] OK, gentlemen, I want you to give me -- I'm moving towards the end of this discussion now -- I want you to give me the plans of what you see for the day. What do you see after the elections if we commemorate or we have a day of remembrance, what do you see as 21 March under a new dispensation, perhaps the government of national unity? [Mashatile] Well, as I said earlier, the first step to us is that we must work towards elections, get everybody to vote for the party of their choice, and ensure that we bring into place a new government. That is the first step. That government will then begin to implement a plan to redress the imbalances of the past. When I talk about the plan, I'm not saying that there is no new constitution negotiated which is a joint plan; there's no Government of National Unity. All I'm saying is that when we go into that Government of National Unity we must have a plan as the ANC, and we welcome all other parties... [Mazibuko, interrupting] What is the plan? [Mashatile] Our plan is that we have to reform the security forces. We must ensure that we have a transparent and accountable police force; a police force that will work closely with the communities. We have already in fact started that process, we are discussing with a lot of people, including the South African Police, so that when the political system changes, we don't only change the political system, but we change all other institutions of the state that are going to be ensuring that the lives of our people change, and reforming the police is one of those plans. [Coetzer] I would like to return to Sharpeville Day per se, and you ask me how do I see Sharpeville Day in the future? I think that one must, first of all, see it in a broader context. I think that we need to sit down as part of the process of reconstruction and reconciliation after the election, and that is to reevaluate all our public holidays. I can foresee a day in the near future, come next year, when Sharpeville Day could be one of the public holidays, a day of remembrance. Yes, there are other public holidays like the Day of the Vow which is very important to Afrikaner people, that needs to be addressed. I think that we need to address jointly that whole broader issue and create a way in which we remain sensitive for one another's past and the things that are important to one another. [Mazibuko] Mr. Coetzer, I'm afraid I have to cut you there. We have completely run out of time. Thank you for coming through, Mr. Mashatile. [Coetzer] Thank you very much for the opportunity.
