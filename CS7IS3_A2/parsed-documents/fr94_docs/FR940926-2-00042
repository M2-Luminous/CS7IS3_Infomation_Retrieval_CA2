FR940926-2-00042 FR940926-2-00038 Food and Drug Administration [Docket No. 94D&hyph;0284] Miscellaneous Compliance Policy Guides; Revocation AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the revocation of three compliance policy guides (CPG's) because they are outdated. This action is being taken to ensure that FDA's CPG's accurately reflect FDA policy. DATES: Effective September 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Judith A. Gushee, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;236), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1785. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FDA is revoking three of its CPG's because either they no longer reflect FDA policy, or they have been superseded by more comprehensive guidance. The following three guides are being revoked: (1) CPG 7125.03 ``Sale of Prescription-legend Veterinary Drugs'' The information contained in CPG 7125.03 also is found in Compliance Program 7371.002, and the information in Compliance Program 7371.002 is more current and thorough than that contained in CPG 7125.03. Therefore, CPG 7125.03 is obsolete. (2) CPG 7125.10 ``Veterinarian Use of New Animal Drug Substances'' This CPG states that veterinarians may use within their practice whatever bulk drugs they may legally obtain, i.e., those that do not require a new animal drug application (NADA). This policy implies that the requirement for a NADA is the exceptional situation. In fact, in most cases, an approved NADA is required before bulk drug substances could be used by veterinarians to produce a finished pharmaceutical. This position was upheld in United States v. 9/1 KG Containers, More or Less, of an Article of Drug for Veterinary Use [Schuyler Laboratories, Inc.] , 854 F.2d 173 (7th Cir. 1988). Therefore, FDA is revoking CPG 7125.10 so that agency policy will not be misinterpreted. Furthermore, FDA is in the process of developing policy guidance pertaining to the compounding of drugs for veterinary use that will be issued in due course. (3) CPG 7126.02 ``Gentian Violet in Animal Feed'' In a memo dated August 16, 1991, FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) informed all district offices and all resident posts that this CPG was no longer CVM policy. CPG 7126.02 was not revoked at the time. That oversight is now being corrected. Dated: August 31, 1994. Gary Dykstra, Acting Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs.
