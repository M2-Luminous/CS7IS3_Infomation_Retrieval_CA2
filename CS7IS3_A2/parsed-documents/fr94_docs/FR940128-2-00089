FR940128-2-00089 FR940128-2-00055 [Docket No. TM94&hyph;3&hyph;17&hyph;001] Texas Eastern Transmission Corp.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff January 24, 1994. Take notice that on January 14, 1994 Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) submitted for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1 and Original Volume No. 2, the tariff sheets listed on Appendix A of the filing. Texas Eastern states that ordering Paragraph (A) of the Order Accepting Tariff Sheets Subject to Conditions (Order), issued in the above referenced proceeding on December 30, 1993, required it to make certain modifications to the tariff sheets previously submitted by Texas Eastern on November 29, 1993 to establish the revised Gas Research Institute (GRI) surcharges effective January 1, 1994. Texas Eastern states that in compliance with the Order, Section 15.4 of the General Terms and Conditions has been modified to define the method of calculating load factors for firm customers without a historical load factor for purposes of the GRI Surcharge. In addition, as required by the Order, Texas Eastern states that it has added a column to the affected rate sheets to reflect that the minimum GRI Surcharge is zero. The proposed effective date of the tariff sheets is January 1, 1994, consistent with the Order in this proceeding and the effective date of the tariff sheets they replace. Texas Eastern states that copies of the filing were served on firm customers of Texas Eastern and interested state commissions. Copies were also served on all parties to Docket No. TM94&hyph;3&hyph;17&hyph;000. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before January 31, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
