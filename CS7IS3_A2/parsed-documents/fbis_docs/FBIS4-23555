This morning the mediator, the observers, and government and UNITA representatives met at the Mulungushi Conference Center to discuss swearing in UNITA members of parliament. Although the outcome of the talks is not yet satisfactory, reliable sources have just told us that the government and UNITA are trying to find a solution to that and other issues. So, it is still believed that an agreement may be reached in Lusaka because there are no obstacles that cannot be overcome. Meanwhile, UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim this morning summoned Angolan and foreign newsmen to inform them about UNITA's official position regarding its participation in governing the country. Angolan journalists insisted that Valentim confirm or deny his statements to the TIMES OF ZAMBIA that UNITA would continue to demand that the government allocate it the Foreign and Interior Ministries. Valentim simply said, quote, I have no comments. I can just say that UNITA wants to govern Huambo and this position has already been officially presented to the mediators, unquote. Meanwhile, it has been reported that the government and UNITA will this afternoon continue the discussions to find solutions on the issue being discussed and come up with an agreement that would conform with the interests of the negotiators. Everything now depends on the goodwill of both sides.
