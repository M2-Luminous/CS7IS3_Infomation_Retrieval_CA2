He told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that, "with all due understanding for the problems of communications workers, to deprive television viewers cannot be the only way to solve the problems of the industry". Having mentioned that "Ostankino" was taking measures to reduce nighttime and daytime broadcasting, Shevelev does not believe, however, that such economical measures will help on a large scale. In his view, the solution lies in a search for ways to ensure a more efficient signal propagation in the Russian Federation and in the use of more advanced and economical technologies. According to Shevelev, introducing the payment of rent for television will improve the situation to a degree, a measure that will make television directly dependent on the interests of viewers at the same time. Shevelev sees the primary need to be a state program for developing the electronic media, which would determine a correlation between federal and regional television, prospects for developing cable networks, and other problems.
