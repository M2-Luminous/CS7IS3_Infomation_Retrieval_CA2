The deputies noted that the draft that was submitted is a codified act. Consequently, it must bring together all existing normative acts and have the logical structure of a whole concept, stability of legal norms reinforced in it, system, and coordination. From these positions it was noted that the need for the development of a codified act was not sufficiently substantiated and its conceptual basis was not sufficiently developed. The draft takes into account the position of only two laws--"On Protection and Support of Private Entrepreneurship" and "On Freedom of Economic Activity and the Development of Entrepreneurship." It does not take into account the provisions of other laws regulating entrepreneurial activity, antimonopoly legislation, or the Law "On Bankruptcy." Thus the draft generates additional contradictions in legislation. The peculiarities of various types of entrepreneurial activity (banking, insurance) are not taken into account. The opinion was expressed that it is necessary to get away from codification and adopt a number of individual laws--on licensing, on trade secrets--and to make changes in existing laws. Taking into account the results of the discussion and the serious remarks regarding the draft Law "On Entrepreneurship in the Republic of Kazakhstan," it was decided to return it for further work.
