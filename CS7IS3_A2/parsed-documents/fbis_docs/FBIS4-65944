The 10 points are illustrated for us by Daniela Calastri: [Calastri] A special group drawn from all the forces of law and order will collaborate with the Palermo Anti-Mafia Prosecutor's Office; another interforce group will take charge of tracking down the most dangerous wanted criminals; the citizens of Palermo will be able to make use of a toll free phone number directly linked to the police commissioner's office in order to give information useful to the investigators; supervision of the island will be reinforced by 100 men from the police special operations force and a similar number from the carabinieri; and the number of financial police will also be increased. These forces will join the 5,200 soldiers who are already in Sicily as part of the so-called Sicilian Vespers operation. The minister envisages that the number of men in this operation will rise to 7,200. In addition, the financial police will step up its investigations into illegal assets. As far as the law on supergrasses is concerned, Minister Maroni said that the government would try and strike a balance which reinforces the demands of the judiciary for safeguards against evidence tampering and manipulation of supergrasses.
