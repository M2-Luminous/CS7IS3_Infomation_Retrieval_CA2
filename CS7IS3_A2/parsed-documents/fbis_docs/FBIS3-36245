They merely adopted a protocol on the meeting, which stated a mutual wish of the two sides to hold another meeting in mid-February. The Kazakh side did not submit any documents to be discussed during the consultations but focussed on criticizing the projects drawn up by the Russian delegation. According to some experts, this is the reason why the two sides failed to arrive at a compromise solution concerning Baykonur's future. [passage omitted]
