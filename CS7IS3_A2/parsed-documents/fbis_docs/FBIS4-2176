Aho started an official visit to China today. The premiers concentrated on economic matters at their meeting. Aho hoped that China's willingness to curb the overheating of its economy would not have negative consequences for Finland's traditional cooperation projects. China's human rights policy was also discussed. Aho reiterated Finland's stance that human rights are universal and everybody must respect them. According to Premier Li, China wants to adhere to the principles accepted at the UN human rights conference last year. China is of the opinion that these principles give China the right to apply its own cultural traditions in this matter.
