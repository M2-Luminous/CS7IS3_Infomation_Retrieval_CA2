Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo faction has been battling with Roosevelt Johnson's Krahns. They have been fighting each other at the headquarters town of Tubmanburg, at the Po River Bridge, and most recently at Clay Junction, just outside Monrovia. The international peacekeeping force has been powerless to stop the conflict, and it has been unclear who was in control of Tubmanburg. Our correspondent, Nii Nartey Allison, has just been there and sent this report. Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo fighters are well in control of Tubmanburg. Koromah's field commander, Mohamed Dumbuya, said today in Tubmanburg that his forces are back in control of the highway town of Clay and were poised to seize the Po River Bridge getaway to ULIMO-controlled Bomi County. He said forces loyal to Alhaji Koromah were today tightening their grip on the villages of Sastown, Amadu Town, and Combat Camp, all of which around the Clay to Po River highway. Mr. Dumbuya said: We will fight until there is victory, even if we have to fight for the next 100 years. Meanwhile, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] chief of staff, General Femi Williams, urged the warring tribes in ULIMO to allow the free movement of peacekeeping troops in their areas as they had agreed to earlier. He said the roads are to be kept open without conditions and warned that ECOMOG will not entertain any further move by ULIMO that endangers the life and property of innocent people. The ECOMOG chief of staff also said: We will not relent in our efforts until a peaceful resolution of the ULIMO crisis is achieved.
