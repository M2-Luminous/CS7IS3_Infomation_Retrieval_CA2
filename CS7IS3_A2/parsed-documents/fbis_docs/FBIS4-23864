Addressing hundreds of supporters at a June 16 commemoration rally outside Durban City Hall, Mr Mokaba issued the warning in response to a dispute about the siting of KwaZulu/Natal's capital. The ANC would use its national majority to "break" the Inkatha Freedom Party if the IFP tried to do the same to the ANC in the province, he said. It should co-operate with the ANC if it did not want to see its leader, minister of home affairs Mr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, "packing his bags for home". "We were determined to march to Ulundi...but not as the capital." The problems of KwaZulu/Natal were of national importance and the ANC was "determined to rule every part of the country". ANC MEC [member of the executive committee] for roads, transport and traffic control Mr S'bu Ndebele told the crowd Ulundi was impractical as a capital because it was far from major urban areas. The ANC favours Pietermaritzburg. Local South African Communist Party leader Dennis Nkosi told the crowd: "Every student, every worker, every man and woman, young and old, must become part of the fight to make sure Pietermaritzburg becomes the capital." Three ANC MECs boycotted an Executive Council meeting at Ulundi this week and the party has vowed to boycott a month-end meeting of the provincial legislature. Durban Management Committee chairman Mr Peter Mansfield suggested his city as a temporary capital until the dispute was resolved, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reported.
