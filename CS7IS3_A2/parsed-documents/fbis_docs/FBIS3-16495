After all of 12 years' development, the four-engined An-70 transport plane has had its rollout, the ceremony, similar to the launch of a ship, that marks the beginning of the trial phase. Neither the An-70's 500-km range nor its 35-tonne freight capacity is its most striking feature. What is sensational is its ability to take off, fully loaded, from an unsurfaced runway only 600 m long. The An-70 is the latest in a long series of Antonov transport planes that includes the An-12 (NATO code: Cub), which for 30 years constituted the East Bloc armed forces' flying workhorse. In the seventies, the Soviet Air Force used to boast that its An-12 aircraft alone were sufficient to displace two entire armed divisions -- 14,000 men plus arms and equipment -- in one go over a distance of 1,200 km. The An-72 "Coaler," which put in a surprise appearance at the 1979 Paris air show, aroused particular interest. It was a curious-looking transport plane for short takeoff and landing runways with two jet engines mounted at the front of the wings. This unconventional configuration was designed to direct the exhaust plume over the upper surface of the wings, a technique that makes for a considerable increase in lift; the specialists refer to it as the "Coanda effect." The new An-70 exploits the Coanda effect in a modified form. It is not a jet, but a turboprop. Four Progress turbines built at the Saporoshje Works are each driven by two counterrotating propellers with extremely broad, saber-shaped, curved blades. According to the engineering office, their airflow gives rise to a supercirculation phenomenon on the wings that doubles lift during takeoff and landing, shortening runway requirements accordingly. The eight strange, 4.5-m diameter propellers, which look more like large marine screw propellers, give the airborne aircraft a speed only marginally lower than that of a fast jet transporter. The designers thus calculate that, at an altitude of 8,500 m, the An-70 will be capable of flying 30-percent faster than the American Hercules or the Bundeswehr's Transall, although it will be half as slow again in the critical takeoff and landing phases. The An-70's hold measures 4 x 4 x 16 m, three times the capacity of the An-12 or Transall fuselage. The gigantic hold can accommodate practically any military vehicle or weapon system. The An-70's system of digital on-board electronics meets western standards and is more advanced than that of the much-extolled MiG-29 supersonic fighter aircraft. The Russian Air Force is very interested in the An-70, and the aircraft may well take on great importance as a freight plane in view of the shortcomings of the railway system in the CIS states. The An-70, which western experts describe as technically brilliant, is scheduled to take off for its first test flight in April. What happens after that depends primarily on how relations between the Ukraine and Russia develop.
