Reforms require inputs. The "Hongyun" Company is a "starter [qi dong qi 0796 0520 0892]" of the BLIC for pooling input funds. With the special powers vested in it by the higher authorities, Hongyun gave play to the corporation's advantage in available resources in accordance with Beijing's urban master plan and the state industrial policy, thus allowing the re-exploitation of the BLIC's stock assets. Within six months, the "starter" activated the entire BLIC community. With the BLIC's change of identity, a definite goal came to be seen, i.e., ensuring the increasing value of state assets. Increasing value is possible only when the assets are in active operation. For assets to be adjusted from an idle state to an active state, inputs of capital are needed. Among the three major difficulties facing state enterprises, "lack of money" is a key problem. The BLIC used a weapon unique to the market economy, namely, the joint-stock system, and activated management of state assets. Before this, in fact, they had thought about how to make state assets active and had taken action accordingly. A large work force, a small amount of money, and an asset stock that was hard to activate were like three mountains pressing on the BLIC, making it hard to breathe. The most important inspiration they drew from Deng Xiaoping's remarks in South China in 1992 was that they must make efforts to emancipate their minds and change concepts, choose the right point of breakthrough, and break out of confinements. They looked back and reviewed a series of past reform explorations which had somewhat stepped beyond prescribed limits: Beijing No. 3 Glass Factory used to operate in a busy downtown area and caused pollution and disturbance to residents. It was only after it received foreign investment through equity participation that it could move from the downtown area to outside the city's No. 4 Beltway and embarked on a new phase of development from a high starting point. Beijing No. 2 Spectacles Factory stopped producing glasses and started doing business in the optical market . By doing so, it not only adjusted its industrial line according to the orientation of the market, but also materialized differential earnings from land [tu di ji cha xiao yi 0960 0966 4787 1567 2400 4135]. Beijing Lighting Equipment Factory also adjusted its structure according to the orientation of the market, revitalizing itself and achieving the optimal disposition of its assets.... Judged by the old standards, a large work force and numerous enterprises making little profit or at a loss were all burdens that were hard to get rid of. However, when viewed from a different angle, the stock assets of the BLIC are actually an enormous pool of resources. They had 56 enterprises within and along the No. 3 Beltway in Beijing, occupying a total of 1.3 million square meters of land. Once exploited, these resources would make an inestimable contribution to changing BLIC's situation when the development and renovation of Beijing reached a high tide. The BLIC drew up a new development strategy: backing away from the secondary and entering the tertiary, i.e., conducting industrial transfers on urban enterprises engaged in secondary industry in order of priority to exploit differential earnings from land and develop tertiary industry; and moving beyond the No. 4 and entering the secondary, i.e., moving production elements transferred from the urban area to outside the No. 4 Beltway in accordance with state industrial policy and the urban development master plan and developing secondary industry on a high basis. This is a major example of industrial transfer executed by way of the re-exploitation of assets. The number one task was to put capital into circulation. Methods of financing are many, but not for BLIC. BLIC at that time was a nominal enterprise, which was in fact merely an administrative organ without the authority to extend credit. Funding from the government was for the purpose of sustaining the corporation's administrative operations. Therefore, they had to resort to different channels of financing. They chose the mode of a limited liability company and raised large amounts of money from society at large by setting up joint-stock companies and obtaining the capital funds for the ongoing exploitation [gun dong kai fa 3340 0520 7030 4099] of assets. In July 1993, Beijing Hongyun Property Company Limited, which is held by BLIC, was founded by "special approval." The capital stock of Hongyun was 150 million yuan. Of this capital stock, 135 million yuan comprised corporate shares, of which 110 million yuan was subscribed by the five promoters. In addition, 25 million yuan was raised from designated legal persons from society at large and internal staff shares were worth 15 million yuan. In this way, the Hongyun Company managed to raise a total of 190 million yuan. "Money spent should buy in a new mechanism." If the Hongyun Company had not faced the market but had continued to operate in the mode of administrative management, the bridge it had built would not have led BLIC toward the modern enterprise system. The Hongyun Company is a product of the market economy. It was incorporated under the rules of a market economy and the degree of standardization in this company was fully affirmed by relevant personalities. In enlivening the state asset stock of BLIC as a whole, the Hongyun Company undertook the heavy responsibility of raising starter funds, implementing industrial transfer through ongoing exploitation, and accomplishing the re-exploitation of existing assets. To cater to this special mission, the municipal government decided to grant the Hongyun Company the right to (general) real estate development. In other words, the Hongyun Company could develop real estate in all BLIC enterprises and was authorized to transform parts of the urban area in complete plots. This economic entity, carrying the mission of activating state assets, began to operate by the rules of the market economy. The first project was the Beijing Match Factory. It was located in Beijing's Chongwen District, occupying 47,000 square meters of land. It had a work force of 868, with 500 retired workers. Heavy burdens and high operating costs caused the enterprises to suffer high production costs and low profits. It had started to operate at a loss in the first half of 1993. In the process of transformation planned according to the new approach, the factory was first moved outside the No. 4 Beltway and a new match factory operating under the joint-stock system was set up in conjunction with Tongxian County. Because a new operational mechanism was used, the work force was streamlined to about 300 and, in the meantime, a large number of contract workers were recruited, taking advantage of inexpensive labor from suburban counties. In the middle of February 1994, the new factory went into trial operation and the estimated profit rate for the whole year will be over 10 percent. On the site of the old match factory, the construction of a residential subdistrict, with a total floor space of over 120,000 square meters, began at the end of last year. The whole project will be completed in about two years. The total investment is 273 million yuan and income from sales will reach 344 million yuan. The transformation of the match factory was a big success, as well as a big sensation. A lossmaker had disappeared and, in its place, a new-type enterprise and a large tract of high-value property had been born. That is why Fu Lin [0265 2651], the director of the old match factory, vividly described the metamorphosis of his enterprise as "experiencing a rewarding death." Society's comment on this example was: "Move one spot, enliven the whole area." In less than a year since it started operating, the Hongyun Company has displayed extremely strong vitality: --It has completed the investigation of 32 BLIC enterprises located within the bounds of the No. 3 Beltway. Their properties have been reappraised and the results show that they occupy a total of 1.008 million square meters of land. According to Beijing's urban development plan, this amount of land can be redeveloped into 3 million square meters of commercial and residential floor space worth about 18.3 billion yuan and generating an estimated profit of 4.5 billion yuan. --Three projects, including the match factory project, have been started, with the total floor space under construction being 170,000 square meters. Returns had been quite handsome by the end of last year and shareholders are expected to receive satisfactory dividends. --It has pre-injected 87 million yuan of project funds into such enterprises as a battery factory, a light bulb factory, a general winery, a glass company, and the No. 1 Foodstuffs Company. This move has not only helped relieve a shortage of working capital in these enterprises, but has also laid the foundation for the development of future projects. The Hongyun Company's investments are extensive. Besides real estate development carried out in conjunction with the industrial transfers in its sector, it has also started equity participation in other fields. So far, the value of its equity investments in commercial circulation enterprises, the garment industry, real estate, and exchange markets has reached 20 million yuan. According to Li Xiaohong [7812 2556 1347], general manager of the Hongyun Company, the company's investment policy is: Invest in various fields, extend feelers in various directions, and establish many fulcra to distribute investment risks, adjust the orientation of operations whenever necessary, obtain market information, converge with domestic and international markets, and strive for stable returns. There are similarities and differences between the Hongyun Company's behavior and that of ordinary joint-stock companies. The similarities are that they operate in the same market environment, have decision-making powers in operations, and are developing their business according to the orientation of the market. Differences are that the Hongyun Company shoulders the heavy responsibility of activating state assets in a whole sector and in the meantime also has unshirkable social responsibility; therefore, it has secured government support and enjoys advantages in resources that ordinary companies do not have. Because of this special role that the Hongyun Company plays, BLIC sees itself as a starter for managing state assets and, relying on the strength of the market, uses it to transform the old system bit by bit with the new system, activate the reorganization of stock assets according to market orientation with new development in a step-by-step way, and eventually reach the goal of activating all of its state assets. Notable results were generated within a few months. Last year, the total industrial output value and sales income of the corporation increased by 6.8 percent and 24.2 percent respectively over the previous year, its profits and taxes increased 61.7 percent and 16.3 percent respectively, and the number of lossmakers and losses within the budget fell by 37.5 percent and 52.5 percent respectively. Its rate of profit increase was the highest in Beijing's industrial sector and among the highest in the light industry sector nationwide.
