In late 1993 the Ukrainian parliament ratified the Start I treaty, but with reservations which changed its essence. Meeting in Moscow Wednesday well-known political leaders, U.S. Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, the Russian Minister said that presence of nuclear arms on the territory of Ukraine would be discussed at the Moscow summit January 12 between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton. Grachev believes taking part in the summit will be Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk who will give a certain impetus to the possible solution. Nuclear weapons, believes the Minister, cannot be a subject of bargaining. This is dangerous, said Grachev. He said he has a hot line with U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin [as received]. Grachev has said on Wednesday, at 1600 he intends to discuss with his U.S. counterpart acute security problems.
