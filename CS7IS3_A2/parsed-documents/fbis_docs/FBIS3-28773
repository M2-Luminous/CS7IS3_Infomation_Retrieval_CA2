Under orders from U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, U.S. negotiators suspended a series of high-level negotiations with their Japanese counterparts scheduled for Wednesday. Kantor told reporters he decided to terminate the subcabinet talks which he said would "create more and more frustration among the negotiators of both sides if we continue." The Clinton administration has demanded that Tokyo make a firm commitment to reducing its massive current account surplus, which totaled 141 billion dollars last year, including a nearly 60 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States. In particular, Washington wants the Japanese to buy more foreign cars and auto parts, medical and telecommunications equipment, and insurance, the three industry sectors currently the focus of negotiations between Tokyo and Washington. Kantor's surprise move angered Japanese negotiators and left the task of hammering out any agreement to a direct showdown with Japan's foreign minister Tsutomu Hata, who arrived in Washington late Wednesday. Officials have set make-or-break trade talks for Thursday between Hata and Kantor. "I have brought no new proposals in my luggage," Hata told KYODO NEWS SERVICE while en route to Washington. "The situation is extremely critical. Both sides need to make mutual concessions, if possible," he said. Hosokawa is due to meet with Clinton on Friday, but Tokyo decided to send Hata to Washington a day ahead of schedule to give the stalled trade talks a final push. Senior Japanese officials who have been involved in negotiating with Washington were visibly annoyed by what they regarded as Kantor's high-handed negotiating style. "I suppose I can pack up and go back to Japan now," one disgruntled Japanese official said. Kantor, who met with a group of Japanese reporters at the white house on Wednesday afternoon, emphasized that his "get tough" strategy has the full support of the president. Clinton "has made it clear to us" that no agreement is better than a bad agreement, Kantor said. The impasse, both Japanese and U.S. officials say, centers on how to measure progress on foreign access to and performance in the Japanese market. Washington has insisted on using "quantitative measures" of progress, a step which Tokyo has rejected as anathema to free trade. Hata also reiterated Japan's opposition to the U.S. demand for import targets, saying, "we have to stick to our principles." Such measures would result in managed trade, which runs counter to the "ongoing deregulation" championed by the Hosokawa government, Hata said. Kantor admitted that "there may or may not be an agreement" by the time Hosokawa and Clinton meet on Friday and repeated a warning that the U.S. will "reevaluate" its economic relations with Japan if the talks collapse. He declined to specify what steps Washington would take other than to say, "we have numerous options." U.S. lawmakers who have backed the Clinton administration's aggressive trade policy on Japan were less reticent. "Super 301 is still the best approach to Japan," said senator Max Baucus, referring to the lapsed U.S. trade legislation which mandates trade sanctions against countries engaging in unfair trade practices. Baucus, the democratic chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Trade, said he has received "plenty of signals" from the Clinton administration that it will restore super 301 if trade talks with Japan sour.
