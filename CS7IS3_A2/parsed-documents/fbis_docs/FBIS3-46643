NODONG SINMUN today says this revealed the intention of the U.S. bellicose quarters to dominate and control this region by perpetuating the U.S. military presence there and intensifying military intervention in those countries which follow the road of independence. The news analyst says: The United States is reinforcing military forces in Northeast Asia, especially in South Korea, to control the Asia-Pacific Region. It is obvious that Larson had in mind the provocation of war on the Korean peninsula when preaching the need of the U.S. military presence and meddling in the region. The bellicose quarters of the United States openly reveal their intention to make a military adventure against the DPRK. The U.S. military is examining the deployment of U.S. nuclear submarines and unmanned spy planes around the Korean peninsula and scheming to build a "theatre missile defence system" together with Japan under the pretext of coping with the "nuclear and missile threat" from the DPRK. This move shows that the U.S. bellicose quarters have not yet given up their ulterior intention to impede the DPRK-USA talks and stifle the DPRK with strength. If they think military threat and pressure can work on the Korean people, it is a miscalculation. They must renounce the anachronistic ambition for dominating the Asia-Pacific Region and stop the anti-DPRK campaign.
