"In the light of the information made available, it is clear that it was the correct decision and the Serbs should not be surprised. The UN Security Council has decided that the United Nations may ask for air support -- and this is what has happened. The UN forces in the region have felt themselves hard pressed and have therefore asked for air support," the Danish foreign minister said. He stressed that the Serbs are the aggressors who are forcing their way into an area which the United Nations has already described as a safe area. The Danish foreign minister also said that the Serb aggression has come at a surprising point in time when "there was a hope that more peaceful developments were underway. And then suddenly the Serbs launch this massive attack on one of the safe areas." A spokeswoman for UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said yesterday evening that the general secretary had not hesitated to use force in the defense of the Muslim enclave of Gorazde. Nor will he hesitate to do so again, spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said.
