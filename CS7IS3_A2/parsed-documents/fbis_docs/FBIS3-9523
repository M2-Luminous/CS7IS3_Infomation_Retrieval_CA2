Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to send Turkish troops within the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces. During his meeting with the new commander of the 32,500 UNPROFOR troops in former Yugoslavia, French General Bernard de Lapresle, Kontic brought up the question of Butrus-Ghali's readiness to deploy troops from neighbouring Turkey, a former occupation force in Yugoslavia. Kontic also underlined the good cooperation between the Yugoslav Government and UNPROFOR and said that Yugoslavia highly estimated UNPROFOR's role and its contribution to the prevention of further destructions, conflicts and suffering in the former federation, it is a statement of the Federal Information Ministry notes [sentence as received]. Nevertheless Kontic also pointed to the errors made by some parts of UNPROFOR, particularly in the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) which had also been mentioned by U.N. Secretary General Butrus-Ghali in his latest report to the U.N. Security Council. The RSK was declared a U.N. Protected Area in March 1992 according to the plan of the special U.N. envoy for former Yugoslavia Cyrus Vance, following clashes between the local Serbs and the Croatian authorities set off by Croatia's forcible secession from the Yugoslav Federation in mid 1991. Butrus-Ghali said that in Croatia and the RSK the conflicting sides are accusing UNPROFOR of partiality. He exemplified this by four Croatian incursions into the RSK when the peacekeepers were unable to protect the Serb civilian population. Kontic emphasized that the Yugoslav Government urges the extension of the UNPROFOR mandate in accordance with the Vance plan until a political settlement is found for the U.N. Protected Areas. During the talks he also stressed Yugoslavia's firm orientation towards a peaceful and political solution to the crisis in former Yugoslavia. The meeting between Kontic and De Lapresle was attended by the new UNPROFOR Director for Civil Affairs, Brazilian Diplomat Sergio de Mello.
