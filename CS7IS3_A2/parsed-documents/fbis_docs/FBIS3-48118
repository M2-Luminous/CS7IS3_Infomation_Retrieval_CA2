The "working group" session on investment is part of the wide-ranging framework trade talks the two countries have been holding to increase access and sales of foreign goods and services in Japan. Officials from the two countries were also meeting separately in Washington on the access and sales of auto parts in Japan. Japanese officials characterized the latest session on investment issues as preliminary, noting that the investment sector is not on the "priority list" that must be completed by the February 11 summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. Discussions were limited primarily to a presentation of matters of concern both to the U.S. and Japan on investment issues. Among the issues the U.S. raised were excessive government regulation on foreign direct investment and problems foreign investors face in the acquisition of Japanese corporations. Washington has charged that Japan deliberately blocks the entry of foreign capital into Japan, which U.S. officials said has caused a "substantial loss of potential exports" from foreign firms to their Japanese subsidiaries. According to U.S. figures, Japan hosted about 12 billion dollars in foreign direct investment in 1991, representing only 0.7 percent of the world's stock of inward direct investment. By contrast, the U.S. hosted 414 billion dollars, or 22 percent, of the stock of inward direct investment. The corresponding figure for the European Union -- as the former European Community is now known -- was 714 billion dollars, or 38 percent, U.S. officials said.
