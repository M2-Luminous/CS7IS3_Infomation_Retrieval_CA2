Experts and chemists of Dinandro's Division of Research and Control of Chemicals said that the sulfuric acid reportedly used by about 37 small shops and battery factories in Huancayo does not reflect the number of products they put on the market. According to police calculations, these industries buy an average of 70 tonnes of sulfuric acid, which is essential for making drugs, every month. With that amount they could make at least 45,000 batteries. Their production is, however, no more than 444 batteries. Dinandro came to the conclusion that 80 percent of the sulfuric acid bought by some of these factories is sent to the narcotics labs located in Palmapampa (Ayacucho) and in the Upper Huallaga. They explained that the drug cartels have studied the geographic location of Huancayo, which has a permanent transportation flow between the capital, the central mountain range, and the jungle, and have made this their nerve center for the supply of precursors for their labs making cocaine base and cocaine. Fooling the Authorities One of the ways of evading police control is to declare their companies bankrupt after having made large purchases of precursors for three or four months or, in some cases, almost six months. Thus, after having bought at least some 100 or 120 tonnes of sulfuric acid, and having profited during this period of time by no less than $100,000 in business with the Upper Huallaga and Palmapampa "companies," they declare that they have gone bankrupt, and destroy their accounting and purchase books, thus preventing the use made of the precursors from being investigated. There have been cases, however, in which from the same line of business--battery manufacturing plants--they obtain more permits in the names of their wives, children, and relatives, who agree to join the game. They also go to the police precincts to report losses of sulfuric acid in transport, and that 60 to 70 percent of the tonnes being transported had been lost as a result of leaks in the containers. Recently they have been stating that less concentrated sulfuric acid (with a 1.25 density) is sold as "battery liquid" in settlements in which batteries are used because they have no electricity. Demanding Exemption Recently, the Huancayo battery manufacturers have asked the Industry, Tourism and Integration Ministry to declare the Verification Act void. Dinandro experts and chemists assert that this request will benefit the drug trafficking cartels and their suppliers because they can thus obtain the precursors without any difficulty, and will be able to increase the amount of cocaine and cocaine base production. According to Dinandro sources this would be enormously easy, as the regional office of the Industry, Tourism and Integration Ministry has no trained employees to evaluate the precursors and control them.
