FR940725-0-00010 FR940725-0-00002 One commenter requests that a statement be added to the proposed rule to indicate that the AD is considered to be interim action. The FAA acknowledges that this AD is interim action, as specified in the preamble to the proposed rule. The manufacturer has advised that it currently is developing a modification that will positively address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD, and that the modification should be available within approximately 24 months. Once this modification is developed, approved, and available, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking. One commenter requests that the proposal be revised to require that operators report results from all inspections and tests, rather than only initial inspections and tests, and that these results be used to justify adjustments of inspection intervals or cancellation of inspections. The commenter offers no justification for this request. The FAA does not concur. The FAA is interested in the initial inspection results for the purpose of determining the present state of thrust reverser systems throughout the fleet. Since the actions required by this AD are considered to be interim action and terminating action is imminent, the FAA finds that gathering information for the purpose of adjusting inspection intervals and cancelling inspections is not needed and would pose an unnecessary burden on operators. One commenter requests that the FAA review the probability calculations made by Boeing in determining that an unsafe condition exists. The commenter states that if the probability of inadvertent thrust reverser deployment is lower than 1 in 10 9 flight hours, an AD would not be required. The commenter points out two factors that would reduce controllability: deployment of an outboard thrust reverser, and deployment of that reverser during climb. Neither of these factors was accounted for in the probability study that Boeing presented to the operators. In addition, for Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80C2 engines, deployment of a single thrust reverser sleeve half is possible, and deployment of a single sleeve half was assumed to have the same effect on airplane controllability as full (both halves) deployment of a thrust reverser. The FAA does not concur. The analysis presented by Boeing to the FAA states clearly that the effect of deployment of an inboard thrust reverser, or the effect of deployment of a single outboard thrust reverser sleeve, had not yet been quantified. At that time, Boeing and the FAA recognized the need for further study. However, in light of the experience gained during investigation of the accident discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, Boeing had identified design deficiencies that needed to be addressed as soon as practicable to ensure the safety of the Model 747 fleet. The FAA did not determine that an AD was warranted solely on the basis that a particular probability threshold of 1 in 10 9 flight hours had been exceeded. Rather, the FAA based its determination on the fact that design deficiencies exist that could lead to an unsafe condition (reduction in or loss of controllability of the airplane), which can be compensated for by periodic inspections and tests until a design change becomes available. Since the issuance of the proposal, Boeing has issued Revision 1 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletins 747&hyph;78A2112, dated March 7, 1994; 747&hyph;78A2113, dated March 10, 1994; and 747&hyph;78A2115, dated March 4, 1994. (The original issues of these service bulletins were cited in the proposal as the appropriate sources of service information.) These alert service bulletin revisions reclassify the service bulletin type from standard to alert, recommend certain revised compliance times to coincide with operators' maintenance schedules, and revise certain test procedures. The FAA has reviewed and approved these alert service bulletins and has revised the final rule to reflect these latest revisions as additional sources of service information. In addition, the FAA has revised the final rule to specify the appropriate paragraphs of the Accomplishment Instructions of these alert service bulletins for performing the actions required by this AD. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified for these airplanes, at which time the FAA may consider further rulemaking. There are approximately 286 Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 39 Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by Pratt & Whitney PW4000 series engines of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 48 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators of Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by Pratt & Whitney PW4000 series engines is estimated to be $102,960, or $2,640 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.
