Nevertheless, the government could do nothing to withdraw the decision because when contracts were given to British companies, the government was assailed by baseless allegations by the British mass media and even some political leaders of that country. "As such, if we do not give contracts to British companies, there will be no accusations. Should we give profits to the British companies so that they (the media and some political leaders) can hurl accusations at us?" he told reporters here Friday. Trade Union Congress (TUC) General Secretary John Monks was reported to have written to British Trade Minister Richard Needham to express the concern of trade unions about the damaging consequences for jobs in British industry if the current restriction on the involvement of British companies in government projects imposed by the Malaysian Governemnt was not lifted. News reports today said TUC also wrote to the Malaysian Trade Union Congress (MTUC) to seek its help in appealing to the government to withdraw the decision. [passage omitted] Asked to comment on the TUC concern, Dr. Mahathir said it should urge the newspapers in Britain -- the source of the problem that led to Malaysia's action -- to stop publishing lies about the country rather then asking help from the British Government and MTUC to resolve the situation. By right, they should urge their newspapers. We ask for very little... That is, don't tell lies, he added. Dr. Mahathir said Malaysia's request was not difficult to fulfil because all that was needed was courage to tell the truth. Say what is true. If people are not involved in bribery, don't say there is bribery. If it is a loan and not a grant, say it is a loan and not a grant. He said, however, that the mass media in Britain appeared to consider telling lies as forming part of press freedom. Malaysia does not agree with that view because press freedom was limited to reporting the truth and did not extend to making false allegations or condemning someone, he added. If they (the newspapers in Britain) continue to do so, it is difficult for us to consider the interests of the workers in Britain. We must give priority to our nation, he said when asked if the government would withdraw its decision should MTUC make an appeal on behalf of TUC. Dr. Mahathir was also asked if he would write to THE SUNDAY TIMES, London to seek that it correct its report containing the allegations of bribery made against Malaysian politicians and himself by reporting the truth. It's of no use for me to write to THE SUNDAY TIMES which does not in the least feel at fault because they are the one who started all this, he said. He added, however, that THE FINANCIAL TIMES (London) had asked him for an explanation of the cabinet decision. I received a letter from THE FINANCIAL TIMES, not SUNDAY TIMES, asking me to give my views. I might give some explanation. He said Malaysia's action had nothing to do with allegations in the British press about a linkage between Malaysia's purchase of military equipment from Britain and British aid for construction of the Pergau hydroelectric dam in Kelantan.
