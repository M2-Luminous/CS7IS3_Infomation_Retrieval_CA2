[Grela] The estimated figure for this year is 42 trillion zlotys [Z]--that is, $2 billion. [Kwasniewska] And how much does it cost for an employment office to attend to one unemployed person? [Grela] In 1993 it cost approximately Z400,000--that is, just over Z30,000 per month. On average, last year in Poland the Employment Fund spent Z11.7 million on each unemployed person. To add these costs up, one unemployed person costs Poland Z12.1 million a year. It is estimated that this year the amount could rise to Z14.5 million. [Kwasniewska] Is this much or little? [Grela] Compared with other countries, these costs are low. Among other things, this is related to the national income level. On the other hand, we record very low expenditure on active forms of combating unemployment. This year 13 percent of the total sum allocated to unemployment expenditure will be spent on it--and we know that there are countries in which 50 percent of the available funds are used in this way. [Kwasniewska] We have not yet discussed the other, associated costs of unemployment, which are, perhaps, less easy to measure and more difficult to evaluate or illustrate in statistical terms. Nevertheless, they are extremely burdensome.... [Grela] Indeed. They involve the losses and disadvantages suffered by society in general as a result of the fact that 3 million Poles are unemployed. These costs are probably five or six times as high as the total value of the financial resources at the disposal of the Employment Fund. Professor Kabaj estimates that, in 1993, they amounted to Z150-180 trillion. These costs affect society at many levels and are the result of social pathology, family breakdown, lack of motivation to work, restriction of future prospects, and so on. [Kwasniewska] The employment office is the first "contact point" for the unemployed. How can its work be made more efficient and effective? [Grela] When the funds are insufficient, we must make choices and establish a hierarchy of priorities. Consequently, we decided to invest in regional rather than voivodship employment offices and to allocate the sum of Z17.5 billion for their needs. Of course, that sum is far too low when set against the existing needs. However, we cannot afford more at the present moment. It will also be necessary to reform the very structure of the employment offices and to get rid of the excessively developed system of departments, sections, and so on. I believe that I have the moral right to make such decisions. I began with myself. When I first assumed this post, I carried out a reorganization of the Employment Office's central structures. There were more departments here than at the Ministry of Labor itself, so we had an unimaginable degree of "managementization" (25 percent) and a truly excessive proportion of consultants. So I reduced the number of executive management positions because they constituted mere organizational decoration and had absolutely no justification from the viewpoint of the nature of our work here. However, the range and definition of our tasks and duties have, of course, remained unchanged. I believe that similar changes should be introduced in regional and voivodship employment offices. [Kwasniewska] On average, how many unemployed are there per employment center officer? [Grela] About 300. However, there is great differentiation in the figures here--which is entirely unjustified. This is another thing that is causing me much concern. In some employment centers, there are on average 170 unemployed per officer, and in others more than 400. This means that people work harder there for the same salary. Obviously, this requires some adjustment. [Kwasniewska] In effect, the employment office has two roles to play: economic and social. Which of them is it better equipped to play? [Grela] It fulfills its role in the social sphere reasonably well. We pay unemployment benefits to those without work, we refer them to public works, and so on. However, we must now move on to a higher level of activity. That is, we should stop talking about the labor market policy and start talking about an employment policy. In other words, we must protect existing jobs and create new ones. Our first line of action should be to guarantee job security. To this end, we should place more emphasis on developing our employment agency operations, career advisory service, and vocational retraining schemes for the unemployed. We should also develop loan schemes for new individual business ventures. All these projects do not require huge sums of money at all, and they can be easily made more effective using the employment office restructuring funds available from the budget now. Another line of action we should pursue is that of placing greater stress on the organization of public works, emergency works, and a whole range of seasonal and temporary jobs. This could also provide steady work for a considerable number of unemployed. We have another project connected with this line of action, but the problem is that there is no legislative basis for allocating money from our budget for it. Some countries that have had many years of experience in dealing with the problem of unemployment operate job-seeking skills programs, which consist of bringing groups of unemployed people together and training them in how to apply for new jobs and present themselves to potential employers. They also brief them on existing employment legislation and regulations, changes in the labor code (for example, new regulations affecting women returning to work after maternity leave), and so on. [Kwasniewska] The Polish Psychological Society runs similar "training groups...." [Grela] Indeed. And if they show that something like 40 percent of the young unemployed do indeed find jobs after attending their courses, it may well provide the necessary stimulus for the creation of further special schemes of this kind by, say, employment clubs. [Kwasniewska] Have any particularly intensive schemes been introduced in areas where unemployment is more rife than elsewhere? For example, in Western Pomerania? [Grela] So far, we have not had any spectacular successes in these areas. The basic assistance we are able to extend to those regions is that we are able to direct more resources there from the Employment Fund. On the other hand, investors are still rather reluctant to locate their capital there, despite considerable tax concessions and other advantageous schemes open to them. As a result, this year we plan to concentrate mainly on extending our assistance in the financing of infrastructural investment projects in regions where unemployment is a particular threat. In addition, a special government-trade union task group appointed by the Office of the Council of Ministers' Sociopolitical Committee will soon begin to identify the regions requiring special help. [Kwasniewska] How many unemployed do we have today? [Grela] The latest figure stands at 2,889,000. April was the third successive month in which the number of unemployed fell (by 64,000). It is still possible that this is a seasonal phenomenon, which usually occurs with the approach of summer. But, at the same time, it is certainly the consequence of making better use of the funds allocated to public and emergency works schemes and other similar employment projects. For example, in February of this year, we financed only 25 percent of job offers from the Employment Fund resources, whereas in both March and April the relevant figures were 40 percent. [Kwasniewska] What about school leavers? The summer vacation is approaching, and so a new generation of college and university graduates will be leaving their educational establishments soon.... [Grela] This problem truly gives us nightmares. As soon as they get their entitlement to benefits in the fall, we want to provide jobs for them. It would be a shame to waste all of that intellectual and career potential.... Apart from that argument, it is terribly demoralizing for young people who, having graduated from their schools, have nothing better to do than sit at home aimlessly.... [Kwasniewska] Local initiatives could work wonders here. [Grela] I keep saying: Unemployment is a problem for all of us. Also for parish authorities. Without cooperation with local milieus and self-government structures, employment offices will be unable to discharge their obligations properly. At the moment, they are still too isolated in their fight against unemployment and have to bear the lion's share of that burden alone. One solution here would be to galvanize various nongovernmental organizations and associations into action. Examples of various initiatives among the "grass roots" prove that we ourselves can do much for "our own" unemployed.
