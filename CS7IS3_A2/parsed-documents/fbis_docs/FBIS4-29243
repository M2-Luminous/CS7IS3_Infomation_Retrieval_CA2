FBIS4-29243 "dreas116_c_94022" FBIS-EAS-94-116 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 North Korea Rimpac Exercise Military Act `Against' DPRK Rimpac Exercise Military Act `Against' DPRK SK1506062294 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0840 GMT 14 Jun 94 SK1506062294 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0840 GMT 14 Jun 94 Korean BFN [Unattributed talk: "Dangerous Military Action Aimed at Us"] [Text] The recent situation surrounding the Korean peninsula is moving into an ill-boding direction with each passing day. As reported, the Rimpac military exercise participated in by the armed forces from the United States, Japan, and South Korea is being staged on the waters of the West Pacific Ocean close to our country, and this exercise which began at the end of May, will continue for 50 days until mid-July. The exercise is being mobilized by the U.S. naval forces as its main force with some 60 additional naval ships and 200 airplanes and vast forces of over 25,000 troops from participating nations. Our attention is drawn to the fact that, for the first time in history, naval forces of the United States, Japan, and South Korea are staging joint operations and forming one single fleet. This is an intolerable, reckless, military action when considering the fact that the U.S. imperialists are perpetrating arms reinforcement maneuvers in South Korea under the pretext of so-called sanctions against us and laying the blame on the nonexistent nuclear issue. The fact that the military bosses of the United States, Japan, and South Korea, who have been holding frequent conspiratorial conferences of aggression against us, have gone so far as to stage joint operations by organizing a joint naval fleet this time, vividly shows that the tripartite military alliance that was formed long ago with the United States as its main axis and with the aim of crushing our country and other socialist countries in Asia, has entered a practical stage. Our people are watching with vigilance the U.S. imperialists' intention to persistently perpetrate the military action against our Republic through these joint operations that have become more unscrupulous, and strongly condemn the Rimpac-94 military exercise. As reported, the DPRK Foreign Ministry, in its spokesman's press statement of 23 May regarding the recent moves of the situation surrounding the Korean peninsula in an ominous direction, called upon the United States not to cling to military action, but to respond to our peaceful initiatives. The dangerous military situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula and the area surrounding it, shows that our proposal for negotiations to establish a new solid peace-guarantee system which will replace the military armistice mechanism in our country, is correct and timely. Nevertheless, the U.S. imperialists are further expanding and strengthening military pressure on us through the Rimpac exercise in a bid to subdue us by force. This is proven by the open remarks by an official of the Japan Defense Agency that the Rimpac-94 exercise is a political message to North Korea's nuclear program. In particular, we cannot overlook the fact that the British paper SUNDAY TIMES of 5 June revealed that U.S. President Clinton was reviewing a plan to move the Rimpac military exercise site from the Pacific near Hawaii to the East Sea of North Korea in a bid to apply pressure on North Korea. The U.S. imperialists are threatening and blackmailing us by mobilizing the multinational armed forces from Japan and South Korea. By so doing, the U.S. imperialists attempt to extremely aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula and, thus, to invent an excuse for a military adventure against our Republic. The U.S. imperialists will gain nothing from us through the Rimpac-94 exercises. The United States should not cling to the adventurous military action against us by mobilizing their follower countries, but should respond to our peaceful initiatives. The U.S. imperialists should clearly know that any sanctions, pressure, or action for aggression does not work out in our Republic which treasures the country's sovereignty and the nation's dignity. They should behave with discretion.
