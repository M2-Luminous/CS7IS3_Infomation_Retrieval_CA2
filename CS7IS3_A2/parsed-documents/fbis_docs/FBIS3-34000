In a message to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the issue, 'Abd-al-Majid denounced the Israeli measures, which constitute a major obstacle to the peace process. He asked the United Nations to play its moral and legal role in taking care of nations under occupation, including the Palestinian people. The Arab League secretary general stressed that Dr. Butrus-Ghali's efforts in this regard will have the greatest effect on Arab and world public opinion. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid also sent a message to Rawhi al-Khatib, the Arab mayor of Jerusalem who was deported after 1967 and who resides in Amman, explaining the Arab League's efforts and contacts on the issue.
