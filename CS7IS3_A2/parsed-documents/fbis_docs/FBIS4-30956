[Anyzova] The deputies of the Czech parliament today approved an agreement negotiated between the Czech Republic and the Republic of Slovakia concerning free trade. As Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy stated, this agreement will gradually liberalize bilateral trade, and by the end of the two-year transition period -- in other words by 1 January 1996 -- all tariff and nontariff barriers to trade in all industrial products, with the exception of private cars and certain other items, will be removed. Parliament also approved the statute of the National Property Fund of the Czech Republic [FNM]. According to this statute, the fund will have the right to set up joint-stock and trading companies and to invest in them. Following that, however, parliament did not approve the National Property Fund budget for 1994. Three votes were lacking for the budget to be approved. The question thus presents itself whether parliament really has so much against it or whether the required number of deputies were not present at the final vote, in particular those from the governing coalition. At present, the deputies are debating the state's final accounts for last year.
