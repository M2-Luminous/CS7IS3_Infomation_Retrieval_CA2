He also made it clear that the PCI- PDS [Italian Communist Party-Democratic Party of the Left], though temporarily reprieved through lack of evidence, would also get it in the neck. While the Bottegone [PDS headquarters] is refraining, at least for the time being, from answering back, the bandwagon [League nickname] is shooting pointblank against Italy's most famous public prosecutor. The latter, the champion of the thief hunt, the magistrate who had always been incited by the League, yesterday shot them down in flames by indicating that the League had also eaten a slice of bribe city pie. A communique which the League immediately issued yesterday started by saying: "We did not behave like the others." It then attempted to refute the accusations made by the public prosecutor in his final report. This was the first strike. In a TV broadcast, Di Pietro publicized a copy of a letter signed by League Forli section secretary Bellettini -- a letter requesting a meeting between [League Secretary] Bossi and [former Enimont official] Carlo Sama. "This was," the communique pointed out, "a request for publicity, which Bellettini thought could be made more official by speaking of a `private meeting.'" There is, then, the question of the 200 million lire received by [League official] Alessandro Patelli. In the hearing, the League complained, Di Pietro forgot to mention Bossi's "counterstatements" (whereby the bandwagon's leader made known the decision to hand over the 200 million lire to the magistrate). "Among other things," the communique went on to say, "this amount was stolen by the `usual unidentified persons,' who broke into the League's headquarters a few hours later because they, or their instigators, were hoping that this would lead to a denunciation which would stir up a scandal on the eve of the 1992 general elections." In any case, the 200 million lire cannot be considered a bribe: "No exchange of favors on the League's part was involved. If anything, this was a simple administrative misdemeanor, which can be defined as a donation that was not entered in the accounts and that therefore could be subject only to a fine." However, it is one of Di Pietro's sentences ("The League behaved like all the other parties") which made League supporters go into a rage. In their view, this was clearly "a political consideration, which would undermine the basic objectivity of any legal proceeding, and certainly of this one in particular." They explained their reasons by means of a theorem: "If the League had behaved like everybody else, bribe city would have never exploded." The indignant conclusion was: "Di Pietro should think things over." League Deputy Marcello Lazzati stressed the point: "There is nothing new. The League has nothing to do with all this and anyone saying the opposite is making assertions which are not only slanderous but also historically false."
