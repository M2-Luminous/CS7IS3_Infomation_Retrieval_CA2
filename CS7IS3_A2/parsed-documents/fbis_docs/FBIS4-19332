The street was crowded with official cars waiting for [Prime Minister] Ciampi's "professors," gathered for the last operative cabinet meeting. It was 1200 hours and there was a demob atmosphere in the council. Piazza Montecitorio [square outside lower house] was packed. The "freshmen" were swarming in the streets around the Palazzo Chigi waiting for the initiation ceremony to begin. Smiles, witticisms, and euphoria. Meanwhile, inside the palace, attention was focused on the race for the ministries. What kind of team will [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi field? The Marco Van Basten [soccer hero] of the team, the outstanding technocratic minister wanted by many deputies, would be [Clean Hands Judge] Antonio di Pietro at the Interior Ministry. However, the judge involved in the Clean Hands trials has made it known that he has no intention of hanging up his judges robes. Now, people are banking on last-minute attempts to get him to accept the Interior Ministry or Justice Ministry. With Di Pietro ruled out, the list of candidates for the Interior and Justice Ministries looks especially political. Raffaele Costa (Center Union) and Francesco D'Onofrio (Christian Democratic Center) will run off against Clemente Mastella. If Roberto Maroni (from the wing of the League touting for ministries) becomes deputy prime minister charged with institutional reforms and antitrust issues (so that he can closely mark Berlusconi), then the choice of Irene Pivetti as speaker in the Chamber of Deputies has lowered the odds on [Liberal member] Alfredo Biondi taking a ministerial post. Will he end up at in the Justice Ministry? The grapevine of names comes on top of the plans to reduce the number of ministries, grouping them together according to their functions. The new government should have 14 or 15 ministries. Forza Italia economist Antonio Martino has suggested merging the Budget and Treasury Ministries into a superministry of the economy. He was thinking of Mario Monti, but the Bocconi [Milan Independent Catholic University] rector has already said "no, thank you." The great power game is in full swing. However, in reality, between Forza Italia, the League, and the National Alliance there has, as yet, been no contact about the ministerial structure. People are talking about programs. Berlusconi has not ruled out bringing in people from outside. In recent days, it is said that [former Prime Minister] Giuliano Amato has been asked how he would feel about taking over at the Foreign Ministry or the Treasury. Then an attempt would be made to place a technocrat like [Segni Pact economist] Giulio Tremonti in the Finance Ministry, and Lamberto Dini, currently Bank of Italy general manager, in the Treasury. However, the League's Giancarlo Pagliarini is also in the running for an economic post, and he, together with his party colleague Vito Gnutti (Labor) and Maroni, look set to make up the Lombardy delegation. [League ideologue] Gianfranco Miglio is the dark horse in this race. [Radical leader] Pannella is in line for a ministerial post, as is, perhaps, [Christian Democratic Center leader] Ombretta Fumagalli (Post and Telecommunications). The National Alliance is also preparing for office. The names being bandied around on the right are Domenico Fisichella (Public Prosecutor), Publio Fiori (Health), and Giuseppe Tatarella (Transport). Among Berlusconi's closest advisers, Antonio Martino looks to be in pole position for the Foreign Ministry. [Forza Italia ideologue] Giuliano Urbani, if he is not made institutional reform minister, could be charged with coordinating government action as under secretary to the prime minister's office.
