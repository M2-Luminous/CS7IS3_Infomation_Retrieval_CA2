Hu Jintao, Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and principal of the Central Party School, spoke at the opening ceremony today. He emphasized: In studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we should combine theoretical study with practice, and concentrate efforts on two issues -- to master the theoretical system and to use the theory to solve existing major practical problems. Only when we have grasped the scientific world outlook and methodology can we assess the situation in a correct way, achieve unity in thinking, have the overall situation under control, tackle major problems, enhance our foresightedness in our work and do it in a more scientific manner, brush aside difficulties, and continually promote the reform and open policy and the socialist modernization cause. Ding Guangen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and Secretariat, presided over the opening ceremony. Ren Jianxin, Secretariat member of the CPC Central Committee, attended the ceremony. In his speech, Hu Jintao said: All localities and departments have done a tremendous job in implementing the central authorities' general principles and plans for the work of the whole party. While the general situation is good, there are still certain problems and difficulties in China's social and economic lives. Therefore, we should, first, be clearly aware of the problems and difficulties on the road of advance, noting both their objective existence, as well as the advantages for solving problems and difficulties. We should neither treat them lightly nor forfeit our confidence in solving them. Second, we should seek a scientific way for solving problems. We should step up investigation and study and accurately identify the crux of problems. We should actively and conscientiously probe for solutions through reform and development. He said: We should take bold steps in probing for solutions to the existing problems under the guidance of scientific theories. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is profound in meaning and wide in coverage, has given an incisive exposition on a series of fundamental issues related to the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics, including the adherence to one central task and two basic points; correct handling of the relationship between reform, development, and stability; the persistence in being tough with both hands; and the CPC's internal improvement as the key to solving problems in China. Problems which Comrade Xiaoping has repeatedly emphasized that we must solve properly, things which he has reminded us time and again that we must pay attention to, and tendencies which he has periodically admonished that we must guard against are still of great guiding and practical significance today. In a sense, theoretical level decides leadership quality. This is particularly so for the party's senior leading cadres. If we want to implement the party's basic line comprehensively and accurately, to grasp the overall situation of the work of the whole party and country, to do all tasks well, and to consolidate and develop the good situation, we must study theories with a greater sense of urgency and more conscientiously so that we can enhance our theoretical level and more effectively carry out our leadership responsibility. He said: The present basic task for the whole party in further studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is to grasp the theory's scientific system and use it to solve existing prominent problems through profound study. The theory is a comprehensive system. Without studying and mastering the ideological views and principles of the theoretical system, it is impossible to truly understand and correctly use the theory in practice. To really master the theory's scientific system is no easy task and cannot be accomplished overnight; it requires protracted and unremitting efforts. The sole purpose of study is to use the theory as a weapon for guiding and correctly identifying and solving practical problems in reform and construction. This year, we have launched a great number of comprehensive coordinated reform programs focused on the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. The reform programs, which involve readjustment of the pattern and relations of interests in various sectors, will tackle many deep-seated problems and will be rather difficult. In the process of deepening reform in all fields and expediting the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, it will be a real test for our party committees and leading cadres at all levels to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development; to ensure social and political stability; to comprehensively implement the party Central Committee's policies, decisions, and plans; and to properly handle the relations between reform, development, and stability. At present, we should take effective measures to solve problems unfavorable to further reform, development, and stability. Discussing the question of strengthening and improving party building, he said: The key to adhering to the party's basic line for 100 years lies in the party. The key to creating the overall environment for seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability also lies in the party. If we do not strengthen party leadership and further promote party building, we can go nowhere. We will accomplish nothing if we fail to implement the party's basic line in the light of realities and if we deviate from the overall interests of reform, development, and stability in promoting party building alone. We must keep abreast of the demands and tasks of the new situation and must improve the party ideologically, politically, organizationally, and in its style so as to solve the existing problems in party building and increase the party's cohesive and rallying power and fighting capacity to provide more effective guarantees for reform, development, and stability. Responsible comrades from the departments concerned Zeng Qinghong, Zheng Bijian, Zhao Zongnai, Wang Jialiu Zheng Keyang, Chen Fujin, and Zhou Ziyu were present at the opening ceremony.
