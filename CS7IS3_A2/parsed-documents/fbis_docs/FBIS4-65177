As long as the SPD only deals with right-wing extremists, but not also with left-wing radicals and the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS], the CSU does not see a basis for a joint course of action, Waigel said before journalists after a session of the CSU Executive Committee in Munich. Moreover, the CSU does not need an exhortation. Unlike any other party, it is struggling against the Republikaner "politically and with all legally available means."
