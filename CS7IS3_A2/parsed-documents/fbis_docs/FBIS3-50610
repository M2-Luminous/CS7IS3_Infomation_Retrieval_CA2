Here is another edition of "Straight Talk" today, Tuesday [21 December], this time from Santiago de Cuba Province -- specifically, from the Radio Rebelde studios here in Santiago de Cuba Province. With us are journalists Dania Sanchez Parra of the National News Agency [AIN]; Mario Romaguera, a reporter from the SIERRA MAESTRA newspaper; and Carlos Sanabria Marrero, a Radio Rebelde journalist here in Santiago de Cuba. The topic: speculation and the theft of food products. And, like we promised, as of today we will refer to the letters of several listeners. We begin with a letter from Ramon Sarmont Martinez who lives here in Santiago de Cuba. He specifies that the people who steal big quantities do not do it because they are hungry. They do it because they want to get their hands on thousands of pesos in just a few days. He adds: Nor will we side with those who reach agreements with the people in the small produce markets to later sell the sacks of potatoes, boniato, or yuca on the black market. We know that there is a big tangled mess behind all this. Meanwhile, other small produce markets are empty. The discussion is now open, here on the Straight Talk program, in Santiago de Cuba. Carlos Sanabria Marrero. [Sanabria] Well, I think this listener from Santiago de Cuba is very correct in what he has said to the Straight Talk program. I think, Juan Carlos, that indeed the products, mainly agricultural, are lost and diverted from the very moment they come out of the fields, off the farm, and during the moving of the products by the State Collection Enterprise from the fields to the central warehouse. From that point, there is another redistribution to the different markets by cart, as it is being done here in Santiago de Cuba. During that whole process the products are being diverted. Logically, one market could be affected more than another, and then there is this resale at exorbitant prices which hurts and irritates the population. One could even encounter a situation where when one gets to the market the staples that correspond to one's needs are lacking. Where did these products end up? Who took it? It was not the consumers, but the people involved in this task and many administrators, as this listener has stated. [Roque] Listener, Ruben Sarmont Martinez presents a situation that could be seen from Santiago de Cuba's particular point of view. But I must say that is something that happens throughout the country. It is a situation that repeats itself in the other provinces. Nevertheless, from this letter, we can see the problems that exist due to the speculation on and theft of food products. Dania Sanchez Parra from AIN is here with us in Santiago de Cuba Province. [Sanchez] Yes Roque, I agree with this listener. He said that most of these thefts do not respond to a true need of the person who commits the crime. It is greed and the desire to get rich quick. I would like to focus on something Sanabria said: This is a chain. The chain begins from the source of these products or their arrival at the port, through the distribution network, until it reaches the market. This greatly damages the economy. It is a great loss. The losses are not as few as they appear. It is a chain and each link's role is very important. [Roque] Analyzing this, we could probably conclude that on one hand you have theft, but what are the causes? Hunger? There also is a lack of control. There also is negligence by the responsible authorities. We are going to continue discussing this topic here on Straight Talk, directly from Santiago de Cuba. [Roque] Our guests on this occasion are Dania Sanchez Parra, from AIN; Mario Romaguera, a reporter from the SIERRA MAESTRA newspaper; and Carlos Sanabria Marrero, a reporter from Radio Rebelde here in Santiago de Cuba. We continue with our debate: Speculation and the theft of food products. Mario Romaguera. [Romaguera] I agree with the listener in all his points. I have experience in this area as a reporter. On several occasions, I have denounced the sale of food products in Santiago de Cuba, products that are produced by local industries, such as bread, sausages, marmalade, and a series of other products. These activities go on the streets of Santiago de Cuba in the area of Central Street between Street No. 4 and the bus station. This area includes two areas with a large flow of people in addition to people going to the provincial hospital and the maternity hospital. [Roque] Carlos Sanabria Marrero, we were analyzing the causes, but we must also find, as I said, the reason why these acts take place. Why is there speculation? Is it just because of necessity? [Sanabria] I do not think it is just necessity. There are many people, as the listeners have pointed out, that do not need to steal or speculate. They do it to get rich and, logically, because the consumer wants the product. Everyone knows the situation our country is currently going through. I reiterate, I believe the main responsibility lies on those people responsible for making sure these situations do not occur. These products do not have difficulties while they are in storage. The difficulties begin once those products leave the warehouse. We need to make sure those products are reaching their final destination. We can see this in the situation of the State Collection Agency. Since there still is no control, no one can verify that the products reach their final destination, instead of being diverted and reaching destinations they should not reach. That is where these difficulties come from, problems that irritate the population. When someone tells you that you have to pay 5 pesos for a plantain, which he probably stole from the state, you will probably buy it because of need, but undoubtedly it will end up affecting you, your family, and the country's economy. [Roque] This is a topic that has many angles. Listener Maria Geudes Alfonso writes to us: In my opinion, theft and fraud in the sale of products to the population are not just seen on streets and on the black market; it originates in the stores, markets, and restaurants. She adds: I do not wish to be specific, but I think it is necessary that you analyze and talk about this topic so that these shameful things that victimize the consumer and force him to bear and put up with this are known. We will hear from Dania Sanchez Parra from AIN. [Sanchez] Yes, when merchandise arrives at its first reception point, before reaching the distribution network, it is already on the black market and there are already possibilities of obtaining it--before the state has made it available to the population. Other factors are negligence and lack of control, evils greatly affecting our economy. [Roque] How do we combat this? I am sure this is a question that many listeners are asking. Mario Romaguera. [Romaguera] Juan Carlos, it is evident that the first thing we need is a truly serious corps of inspectors. It is clear that we need a truly serious corps of inspectors. [Roque] It would be another corps of inspectors, right? [Romaguera] Yes, another one. [Roque] When are we going to assign this new group? We have placed inspectors in different areas of the food industry, agriculture, the collection area, and the whole system, and we still do not have the results we want because these products are still being sold on the black market. This irritates the population who purchase these products out of need. I think it is time to take other measures if we see that the current ones do not have good results. [Romaguera] Another solution could be the immediate expulsion of those inspectors who allow this to happen and the expulsion of those administrators and workers who divert the goods. I must state that not all workers are bandits who divert resources. There is a network of workers who commit these violations. I say violations, to use a kinder word. [Roque] We must find a solution. It is evident that this problem cannot continue, especially today when the special period is sharp, with the situation at the end of the year, and the situation of the new year. It is very difficult. No one can make predictions, but we are approaching very difficult times and we must face this. How can we face this situation? Dania could you please comment on this. [Sanchez] I do not think the solution is to create new mechanisms, because we already have many mechanisms. [Roque] Too many. [Sanchez] Yes, many. I would talk about being demanding of those mechanisms, because as you can see we have too many. We are talking about administrators and distributors. We are talking about the role of the inspectors and the receiving units, and I believe there still is much more to be said. I would also say that we need more social action. Everyone has a great responsibility. This task belongs to each member of our society, and it is important that each link of this chain does its part harmoniously. [Roque] This is an important point, because in this struggle against speculation and theft the people are the main players. It is the people who must face the situation. [Romaguera] Juan Carlos, people need support. They must be helped. I will give you an example. Many times hamburgers are sold without bread. Then some quack appears on the street -- and this is something I have seen for myself in Calvario in front of the Santiago de Cuba funeral home -- screaming or chanting: I have hamburgers with bread. Where did he get the bread, especially when the bread used for hamburgers is a special type. How did he get that bread. This is something the SIERRA MAESTRA newspaper has been denouncing in reports I have written, as well as by reporters like Rafael Carela and Jose Ignate. Action needs to be taken in this sense. [Sanabria] I agree with what you and Dania have stated. I believe a raid should be carried out block by block, where every person knows who is who, where the presidents of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution [CDR] knows everyone, where the CDR president's neighbor knows his neighbor. I believe that if we combat this from the very base, many of these problems could be eliminated. I believe the battle has to be fought block by block, because when the people fight the battle we win. [Roque] Dania, we have 30 seconds left in the program. [Sanchez] Roque, it is not going to be these actions that are going to solve this problem. It will be the systematic efforts and the awareness that we cannot build socialism that way. [Roque] This has been Straight Talk from Santiago de Cuba. The topic has been: speculation and theft of food products. I thank Dania Sanchez Parra, from AIN; Mario Romaguera, from the SIERRA MAESTRA newspaper; and our journalist Carlos Sanabria Marrero, here in the Radio Rebelde studio in Santiago de Cuba.
