Over 90 percent of the participants pronounced for Moldova's territorial integrity, stated today to the National Radio Mihai Coscodan, chairman of the Republic Commission for running the poll, Moldovan vice premier. Coscodan said the poll will be a heavy blow for separatists in Tiraspol and Comrat. Previously, Ovidiu Badina, director of Sociological Service for Researching the Public Opinion and Market (SCOP), told BASAPRESS that the scientific value of this poll is null since the two rules essential for any poll are not respected -- the question is not formulated exactly; it consists of several components and it is not clear to which of the answers "Yes" and "No" refer.
