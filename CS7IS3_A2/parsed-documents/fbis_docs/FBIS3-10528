The point is that since it is thought that Cardoso will be nominated as a presidential candidate by his party, it is reasonable to begin speculating on who will administer the economic plan. The difference between the stock exchanges and the speculations in Brasilia is that in the former ones investors are concerned with gaining or losing cruzeiros based on real assets; while in the latter case the players are making speculations without knowing the balance that the auditor of "Brazil company" (that is, the president of the Republic) will present, and exerting pressure on Mr. Itamar Franco, through daring bids, to make him accept either this or that candidate who appeals most to the new-style technocrats or the new-generation politicians. As always, Brasilia does not live in the real world. While the politicians debate whether a minister is leaving to become a candidate, they forget that the economic plan's success lies mainly in the credibility given to it by the economic agents. It is evident that in the past few months such credibility was not given to the economic team as a whole, but to the finance minister. We are not trying to discredit the university professors that counsel Minister Cardoso, but the truth cannot be hidden. There is only one truth: After defeating resistance inside and outside the administration, after scoring accomplishments and consenting to minor defeats on several fronts, Cardoso is the indicated person to administer the economic plan, which is a much more difficult task than creating it because he will have to confront the labor unions, the price increases that can be considered sabotage, the temptation to call on the "old lady" (Sunab [National Supply Superintendency]) to control whether prices are within the average increases of the previous four months or if there have been abusive hikes, and those who think it is much easier to freeze prices than to live with the market fluctuations. Even understanding that the party leaders keep an eye on the presidential race, we cannot forget that the defense of the economic plan's rational part will allow the presidential race -- which has great political and social meaning -- to develop normally. A failure of the economic plan will affect the electoral atmosphere in such a way that the election campaign will become a real "battle" (in the past, candidates simply ran for elections); a success in the economic plan, even if partial, will make the attacks the candidates will throw at each other at least civilized, as expected by the public. A failure will mainly favor those who fish in troubled waters, while a success will favor those who defend democratic normalcy. Speculations about who will replace the finance minister only help wear out the economic plan. How many people used to ironically say before Provisional Measure No. 434 was published that the plan would be a great election campaign? How many politicians disapproved the provisional measure in case Minister Cardoso left his post, called by the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] to run against Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva? However, if the minister leaves his post to become a presidential candidate, the public will believe the economic plan had electoral purposes; consequently, it will be easy to discredit the economic plan, something that will benefit a few speculators in the stock exchanges or in other alternative circles like in the campaign to discredit the regime. To suppose that the execution of the economic plan will be the same without Minister Cardoso is to be extremely naive. For months Minister Cardoso worked hard on the most difficult part of his task, which was to convince President Itamar Franco not to break contracts or impose a price freeze. This was possible thanks only to the personality of Minister Cardoso and his undeniable influence on the chief of state. Whoever was to replace the finance minister, no matter how much political support he may have, would have to go through the daily ordeal of first convincing his aides and then the president himself to impose his views, without being sure of having the same prestige as his predecessor. Once outside the government, it will be useless for Fernando Henrique Cardoso to try to influence President Itamar Franco or his Juiz de Fora intimate circle. Whoever goes outside, remains outside. When accepting President Itamar Franco's invitation to become finance minister, Fernando Henrique Cardoso knew he made a choice deep down: to postpone his personal political plans, replacing them with the valuable task of re-establishing the country's confidence in its currency. Now, he must stick with this task until the end, under the penalty of becoming another former finance minister who gives his opinion about his successors' savior economic plans in the future.
