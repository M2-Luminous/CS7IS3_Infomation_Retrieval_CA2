FR940405-1-00115 FR940405-1-00013 Other OSHA health standards have adopted similar requirements with respect to those proposed in this Notice regarding the designated person. For example, final standards for chromium (57 FR 42102) and lead (58 FR 26590) require that a technically knowledgeable ``competent person'' be on site during construction activities, which often involve multiple employers. OSHA concluded in those standards that designating a person to act on the employers' behalf to ensure compliance with various provisions of those standards, was necessary because of the need for continual site characterization and analysis to identify the hazards present and the types of control measures and remedial actions that are effective. For these same reasons, OSHA proposes requirements for designated persons under this notice. The term ``Designated smoking area'' means a room in which smoking of tobacco products is permitted. The Agency believes that establishment of ``designated smoking areas'' is necessary to prevent employee exposure to ETS in workplaces where smoking is not prohibited. Provisions are included in this proposal addressing design, construction and operation of such areas to meet this purpose. The term ``Director'' means the Director, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or designee. The term ``Employer'' means all persons defined as employers by section 3(5) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 including employers (such as building owners or lessees) who control the ventilation or maintenance of premises where employees of other employers work. For purposes of the proposal, an employer is also defined as a person who exercises control over the ventilation systems in the workplace. Control over the ventilation systems is a multi-faceted concept: it includes maintenance, recordkeeping and the development and implementation of the indoor air quality compliance plan. While responsibility for various aspects of the ventilation system encompasses many duties, the proposal does not necessarily contemplate that all of the duties will be performed by the same person. The proposal is flexible in that regard and responsibility for the various aspects can be shared by various persons depending on the circumstances. In many instances the employer will either be the owner of the building where the workplace is located or will be a long term lessee, responsible under the lease for the care and maintenance of the property. In these cases, the owner/employer would take care of the ventilation system by designating knowledgeable persons within his employ to the necessary tasks or by hiring competent contractors. In other cases, there will be a number of different businesses all located in separate leased space within the same building. In these instances the various employer/lessees would probably share responsibility for compliance with the proposed standard. For example, each individual lessee might be obligated to provide the building owner with a description of the work activity planned for within its particular leased space, including the number of employees or visitors expected, the hours of work operation and any situations where air contaminants may be released into the workplace air. Air contaminants might reasonably be expected to be released into the workplace air as a result of the installation of new furniture or wall coverings, any painting or remodeling scheduled to take place or any pest extermination activity within the premises. Each employer would, of course, be responsible for reporting to whoever is in charge of the ventilation system, any employee complaints or signs or symptoms that may be related to building-related illness. The building owners or whoever is in charge of the maintenance of the ventilation system would be in a position to develop standard operating procedures for the building systems as well as special procedures for emergencies and maintenance. In addition such a person would be in a position to know or develop an appropriate maintenance schedule and to gather relevant documents to assist in the care and maintenance of the ventilation system, such as diagrams of the system, manufacturers manuals, and inspection guidelines and schedules for the proper maintenance of such systems. The same person might also be responsible for maintaining and operating the HVAC system to provide the required air ventilation rate and desired relative humidity. The proposal is designed in this performance oriented manner to afford affected employers the flexibility to assure the establishment and maintenance of a system to provide healthful indoor air quality in the most sensible and efficient way possible considering their particular circumstances.
