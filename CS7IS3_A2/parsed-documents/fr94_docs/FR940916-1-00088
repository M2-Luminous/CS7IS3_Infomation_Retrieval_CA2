FR940916-1-00088 FR940916-1-00016 FRA recognizes the unique characteristics of some commuter and passenger trains that repeat the same trip several times a day without breaking up the consist. Because the trains in these types of operations are not broken up and remain connected to an air supply continuously, it is unlikely that their air brake equipment would deteriorate beyond federal requirements in one day if they were in proper working order at the beginning of the day. Thus, FRA believes that trains that repeat the same trip more than once a day need only be required to have an initial terminal brake test, performed by a qualified individual, prior to the first departure for that train each calendar day. FRA also agrees with several commenters that the MU equipment, currently used by many commuter operations, is unable to conform to many of the standards established for freight operations. Consequently, FRA believes that commuter railroads operating MU equipment should develop and enforce written inspection, maintenance, and test procedures for this equipment to ensure the systems will operate as intended. FRA further recognizes that the inbound inspection required pursuant to ยง232.14, which requires the bottling of air, is contrary to most railroads' operating procedures requiring the brake pipe to be left open on standing cars. FRA feels that this requirement is unnecessary in present-day operations and could actually cause a train to roll away due to a brake release. Although several parties commented that piston travel requirements are no longer necessary due to the development and use of automatic slack adjusters, FRA believes that piston travel still is an important component that must be kept within certain operating limits. If automatic slack adjusters function properly, then the railroads should have no problem maintaining piston travel within the required limits. Currently, the only way to ensure that a slack adjuster is working correctly is to measure the component it is adjusting. If a device is developed that can reliably monitor the brake cylinder, as one manufacturer indicated, then parties can petition the FRA for a change in the standards at that time. FRA will continue to require 100-percent functional train brake systems at initial terminals. As there were no major objections raised, FRA proposes to retain the ``85-percent'' requirement previously contained at ยง232.1. The BRC was the only party which requested that the percentage be increased, based on their contention that initial terminal inspections were not being performed by qualified individuals. However, FRA believes that the qualification standards proposed below, adequately address this party's concern. Furthermore, as previously stated, FRA does not feel railroads are currently performing initial terminal inspections as well as they should be and, thus, we do not believe it would be appropriate, at this time, to allow alternatives to the initial terminal inspections as requested by several commentators. C. COT&S Requirements Prior to January 1, 1992, railroads and car owners were required to maintain freight brake equipment in accordance with a periodic clean, oil, test, and stencil (COT&S) schedule. This schedule varied from 10 to 16 years, depending on type of brake control valve. At the conclusion of the equipment changeout, a single car test was performed to verify the integrity of the entire brake system. Prior to 1982, this same single car test was required on each car when on a shop or repair track and the date of test so stencilled on the car. This was known as an ``In Date Test'' or IDT. Cars which had been last tested in less than 90 days were excluded from the test requirement. In 1982 the IDT was abolished, and only a simple application and release test of the brakes was required when on the shop or repair track. Certain brake (sticking, inoperative, etc.) and wheel defects (overheated, built-up tread, etc.) did require the single car test. In 1990, several improvements were made in test procedures to reduce the incidence of undesired emergency brake applications and leakage which could cause wheel damage. These improvements were incorporated into the full single car test and in a new abbreviated test, identified as a ``Repair Track Air Brake Test.'' At that time the repair track test was required each time a car was on a shop or repair track. The full single car test is required when the brake control valves are replaced. As these comprehensive tests were phased in, the COT&S requirements were abolished. The effectiveness of these new tests was evident by the increased replacement of brake components which were determined to be defective. Leakage at angle cocks and cutout cocks was the primary source of problems. In order to determine whether there is a need for time-based COT&S requirements, FRA sought comments, in the ANPRM (57 FR 62556), from interested parties regarding the problems associated with the elimination of the COT&S requirements for freight equipment and whether COT&S requirements are necessary for passenger equipment or are alternatives available. The AAR and several of its member railroads contended that the new single car test is much better than the old time-based COT&S and turns up many more defects due to the increase in air pressure to 90 pounds. The AAR stated that their studies show that a car is on the repair track 1.7 times a year and, thus, on average every car will receive a single car or repair track test at least one to two times a year. The AAR also stated that in 1992 1.1 to 1.4 million single car or repair track tests were performed by the railroads and that three times as many brake valves were changed out in 1992 as compared to 1991. In addition, the AAR reported that the railroads spent in excess of $7.5 million to upgrade their equipment to perform the enhanced single car test. Several railroads provided figures on the number of cars in their fleets receiving single car and repair track tests, and provided data comparing the number of brake components that were changed out in 1992 with the number of components changed out in 1991 under the old COT&S requirements. In all cases the data showed an increase in the number of components changed out, which the railroads attributed to the improvement of the single car test and were presented as support for their contention that the improved single car and repair track tests are more effective than the old, time-based COT&S requirements. Several railroads also commented that there is no need for FRA to establish brake maintenance requirements separate from those established by the AAR. These commenters stated that significant improvements in brake maintenance have been made by the AAR without increased regulation. These parties also noted that the AAR has its own engineering staff and laboratories and has expertise of all the railroads and, thus, is in the best position to determine the best practices for maintaining the brake systems.
