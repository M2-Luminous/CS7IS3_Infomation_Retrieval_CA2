FR940919-0-00036 FR940919-0-00011 II. This Action Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). The Governor of Colorado submitted the Telluride PM 10 SIP in a letter dated March 17, 1993, and the Telluride PM 10 contingency measures in a letter dated December 9, 1993. As described in EPA's proposed action on this SIP (59 FR 32397&hyph;32405), the Telluride moderate nonattainment area plan includes, among other things, technical analyses, control measures to satisfy the RACM requirement, a demonstration (including air quality modelling) that attainment of the PM 10 NAAQS will be achieved by December 31, 1994, and enforceability documentation. Further, EPA proposed to determine that major sources of precursors of PM 10 do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels in excess of the NAAQS in Telluride. 3 3 The consequences of this finding are to exclude these sources from the applicability of PM 10 nonattainment area control requirements. Note that EPA's finding is based on the current character of the area including for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. In this final rulemaking, EPA announces its partial approval of those elements (excluding the quantitative milestone element) of the Telluride PM 10 SIP, which were due on November 15, 1991 and submitted on March 17, 1993. Further, section 110(k)(4) of the Act authorizes EPA to approve a plan revision based on a commitment of the State to adopt specific enforceable measures by a date certain, but not later than one year after the date of approval of the plan revision. Hence, EPA announces its conditional approval of the quantitative milestones element of the Telluride PM 10 SIP based on the State's commitment, dated April 21, 1994, to adopt control measures for Telluride by November 30, 1994 that are necessary to demonstrate maintenance of the PM 10 NAAQS. Section 110(k)(4) provides that any such conditional approval shall be treated as a disapproval if the state fails to comply with such commitment. 4 4 If the State fails to comply with its commitment, this conditional approval of the quantitative milestones element will become a disapproval upon EPA notification of the State by letter. EPA subsequently will publish a notice in the ``Notices Section'' of the Federal Register announcing such action and explaining its implications. If this conditional approval is converted to a disapproval, the sanctions clock under section 179(a) of the Act will begin. This clock will begin at the time EPA issues a final disapproval or at the time EPA notifies the State by letter that a conditional approval has been converted to a disapproval. The quantitative milestone element of the Telluride SIP is deficient in that it does not demonstrate that the second quantitative milestone_continued maintenance from 1994 through 1997_will be achieved. EPA conditionally approves this element of the SIP in light of the State's commitment to adopt additional control measures necessary to provide for continued maintenance. The State has indicated that it intends to address the maintenance issue by proposing for adoption additional control measures to maintain the PM 10 NAAQS through 1997. In an April 21, 1994 letter from Thomas Getz, Colorado Air Pollution Control Division (APCD), to Douglas M. Skie, EPA, the State made the following commitments: (1) maintenance control measures and any related SIP revision will be proposed to the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission (AQCC) by July 21, 1994; (2) a public hearing on such regulations and SIP revision will be held by October 20, 1994; and (3) the adopted regulations and SIP revision will be submitted to EPA by November 30, 1994. The effective date of such measures must be November 1, 1995, but could be as early as December 1, 1994. Upon adoption and submittal to EPA, these additional control measures for maintenance will be evaluated for their adequacy in allowing the area to demonstrate maintenance through 1997. On August 16, 1994, EPA only partially approved the State's nonattainment new source review (NSR) permitting regulations for the Telluride moderate PM 10 nonattainment area (among others) because the State did not submit NSR permitting regulations for sources of PM 10 precursors in Telluride and because EPA had not yet found that such sources did not contribute significantly in Telluride (see 59 FR 33213). In this final rulemaking, EPA is now finalizing its finding that major stationary sources of precursors of PM 10 do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels in excess of the NAAQS in Telluride. The consequence of this finding is to exclude major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors in Telluride from the applicability of PM 10 nonattainment area control requirements, including nonattainment NSR permitting requirements. Thus, the State's nonattainment NSR regulations for Telluride area now considered fully approved. In this final rulemaking action EPA also announces its full approval of the PM 10 contingency measures that were due on November 15, 1993 and submitted by the State on December 9, 1993. In addition, EPA amends the nonattainment area boundary description for Telluride in order to clarify the original description. Please refer to EPA's proposed rulemaking (59 FR 32397) and the TSD for that action for a detailed discussion of these elements of the Telluride plan. EPA finds that the State of Colorado's PM 10 SIP for the Telluride moderate nonattainment area meets the Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM), including Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), requirement. Colorado's SIP revision for Telluride contains control measures for sources of wood and coal burning. The State has demonstrated that by applying control measures to this area source, Telluride will be in attainment by December 31, 1994, and it does not appear that apply further control measures to these sources would expedite attainment.
