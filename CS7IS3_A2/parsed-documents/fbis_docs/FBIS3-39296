"Our embassy in Paris has been asked to contact the French authorities at the Foreign Ministry and the Agriculture and Fisheries Ministry. It will express regret at the tighter border controls that are doing major damage to Norwegian fish exports," Foreign Ministry press spokesman Ingvar Havnen said. The French customs authorities are now demanding that customs documents and veterinary papers be in French, and veterinary checks at the border have been tightened up with the result that a number of tests are being carried out on Norwegian fish. Analysis of these tests takes up to five days, and consequently the French authorities have made sure this bureaucracy amounts to an effective obstacle to the sale of fresh Norwegian fish at an acceptable price. Norwegian fish exporters will now try to clear their fish through Danish or German customs so as to avoid France's bureaucratic customs authorities. The Foreign Ministry expects that Norwegian fish exporters will keep themselves well informed about the situation in France through their business contacts and their own employees involved in transport. "We do not therefore want to give any general advice about what they should do," Havnen said. Despite the fact that Norwegian fish trucks were emptied of 10 metric tons of fish under the eyes of the French police, the ministry does not have the impression that the police are neglecting to do what is possible to protect Norwegian fish trucks.
