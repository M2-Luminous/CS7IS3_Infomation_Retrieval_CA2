Chairman of Georgia's Border Department Viktor Lordkipanidze told Interfax that a special Georgian commission was set up to demarcate the border between Russia and Georgia. He also announced that the economic border with customs offices was to be defined next week. The Georgian customs office will be located in Gantiadi and the Russian one in Adler. The motorway customs offices will be located in Gantiadi, Roki, Mamisoni and Kazbegi (Georgia) and in Adler, Nizhni Zaramag and Verkhny Lars (Russia). Lordkipanidze also said that talks were underway on the demarcation of the state border. The final variant will be chosen with due account taken of both countries' interests, he said. He said that the customs offices would be opened in the near future, perhaps earlier than a political decision on the issue would be taken.
