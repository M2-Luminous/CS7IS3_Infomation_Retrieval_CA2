Each one is worse than the other. We want to present genuine Islam, adding nothing and omitting nothing. Adding means more human heresy and superstition and omitting means deleting some elements of the revelation that might inhibit its desired impact and give heretic tendencies the upper hand over correct guidance. At any rate, we will not move an inch from that stance. Unsound piety can only be rectified by authentic piety, and exceeding the bounds and wastefulness can only be cured by moderation. The ungrateful can sometimes pursue detestable courses; they might assail guides with their sharp tongues. Abu-Nuwas [Abbasid poet] was a drunk. When a cleric advised him to abandon this habit, he said: Tell him who claims to be knowledgeable that he learned something and missed a lot. Ignorant as he was, Abu-Nuwas did not say that God permitted drinking or that the Koran has not prohibited drinking, as a contemporary man of law has claimed. This saying is very true of that man of law: I was one of Satan's soldiers. When I climbed up in status, Satan became one of my soldiers. More surprising is that such people are being called to cure terrorism and deviousness. I saw on television images of individual and couple dancing; these images are damned by chaste and straight people. But the actors and actresses taking part in these animal-like festivals have been recruited in a campaign against the veil and descent clothing using the theory that women who display their charms are ethical while others who wear long dresses are evil. Can terrorism be fought by actors and actresses? Since when does the leadership of social reform grow in such surroundings? Where are the thinkers, mentors, and men of knowledge? The fire of temptation cannot be extinguished this way; it glows further just like fire does when fed with oil. The masses were enraged when these artists talked about religion, although they were ignorant about its teachings. This is not surprising, since man cannot give what he does not have. It is ridiculous that his excellency "Sayyid, the Boy Servant" [reference to comedian 'Adil Imam, whose film "The Terrorist" is showing in Cairo] should be called to fight terrorism and assist the police in their difficult task. If the culture of some religious people is faulty, it is established scholars, and not farcical artists, who can correct it. If Charlie Chaplin of England managed with his wit and movements to make people laugh, could this actor preclude the role of literature, philosophy, religion, and major institutions in guarding rights and welfare and enhancing the nation's message?
