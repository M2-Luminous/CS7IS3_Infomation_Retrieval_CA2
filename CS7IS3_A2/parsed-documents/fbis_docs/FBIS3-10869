The purpose of this second stage is to sign the peace agreements. Ruiz has been in the headlines because of the death threats he has received and the demands of certain San Cristobal de las Casas conservative groups' that Ruiz leave the San Cristobal de las Casas diocese. Ruiz said the meetings with the EZLN rank and file are in depth and serious. If this is so, the delegates would return in two weeks and the beginning of the talks would be announced 24 hours beforehand.
