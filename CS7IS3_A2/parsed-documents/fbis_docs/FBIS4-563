It is called the Grouping for Solidarity [Groupement pour la Solidarite -- GPS], with Mr. Achi Koman as its president. Mr. Achi Koman tells our correspondent David Mobio everything about the GPS. [Begin Koman recording] There are 19 political parties that formally signed the charter of the GPS on Thursday, 31 March 1994 at the city mayor's office. This newly constituted GPS professes to be a centrist party. What does that mean? On the political scene there is a very strong party, which is the ruling party, on the right; there is another party on the left, which is relatively strong, which is trying to impose its hegemony there. We believe that politically there is a third place in Cote d'Ivoire to be filled, and that is the center, and this is what the GPS has done. All political parties which reject unrestricted capitalism or communism should be able to join the GPS, that is, locate themselves in the center in order to be able to practice what we call economic pragmatism. Since ideologies do not work anymore, all political regimes are converging toward the center, and are today practicing economic pragmatism. This is the economic basis of our union. We stayed out of all the groupings that had taken place before, because from our experience we know that when unions are formed, in the beginning things are rushed and they lead to a lot of misunderstandings. Mistakes and bitterness follow. There have been unions before -- there was the Coordinating Committee, the Convention -- which broke up -- the Collective of Eight, the Union of Democratic Forces, the Ivorian Democratic Conference, the Federation of Democratic Forces, there were a lot of unions -- and all these unions failed. So when we met on 12 February, we set up a working committee, which comprised representatives from all these various unions which had failed. Each representative brought what he experienced in each of these unions. Why did these unions fail? The answer to the whys of the failure of these unions enabled us to draw up the constituent charter for the GPS, which is helping us to avoid all the things that caused the failure of the other unions. We believe we have been able to outline the framework of this union so as to enable it really to achieve the objectives assigned to it. In actual fact, the other unions which were formed had never outlined any major political objectives such as we have -- that is the first thing; second, the unions which were formed previously never had as their objective the formation of a strong union through the encouragement of the various member political parties in weaving a network of solidarity within that union. People just meet and agree on who will be the leader and then say there will be leadership by turns. Such leadership by turns does not allow leaders to actually manage the union, but rather try to draw benefits from the union for themselves. These are some of the factors that caused the failure of these unions. We have placed in the forefront-- and this is what is important -- the major objectives of the GPS, which are national solidarity, the unification of Africa, and the assertion of an African cultural identity. Consequently, we came together around an objective, not around party interests. [end recording]
