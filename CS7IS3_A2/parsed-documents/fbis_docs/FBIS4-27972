Mohan: "World Support Needed"] [Text] Phnom Penh -- The failure of the much awaited Pyongyang peace talks has reiterated one vital point, that the Khmer Rouge will remain as recalcitrants. It is now time for the world community, particularly the signatories of the Paris Peace Accords to rally support for the often embattled Royal Government of this nation. The Royal Government, under the leadership of First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, has proven to the world community that they truly desire peace with the Khmer Rouge, national unity and reconciliation. However, the Khmer Rouge guerrillas have chosen to spurn peace talks with ceasefire conditions of their own, despite agreeing to unconditional peace talks called for by His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk. The international community should not delude themselves in thinking that their responsibility to this nation is over, with the end of the United Nations mission and the elections. They have a bigger role to play in ensuring that the hand that fought for democracy which brought bitter enemies together and a nation reborn from the brink of disaster, remains alive. They must ensure that supporters of the Khmer Rouge, who include those who warn or demand other nations not to provide military help to a supposedly corrupt nation, are made to tow the line. Popular or unpopular support for the Khmer Rouge must stop at all cost. There is a Royal Government elected by the people and the Khmer Rouge had chosen to stay away from this process. Which nation in the world is not corrupt? Neighbouring countries of this Kingdom have been corrupt as well and the Government is fond of telling the world at large that they often cannot control their army. The Khmer Rouge cannot survive or mount fresh counter attacks against the Royal Government army without outside support, including economical support. Is economics a better price to pay than the human life and misery that they have been undergoing? If the answer is 'no', then the world community should regroup, and mount one cohesive and massive campaign to wipe out the Khmer Rouge or force them to mend their ways. If military action is the only way, as proven by the Royal Government, then support them. The Royal Cambodian Government Armed Forces [RCAF] have proven in the past that they are capable of holding their own against the Khmer Rouge, despite being poorly armed, equipped, underpaid and poorly disciplined. If the world community could resolve this and do it fast, then the RCAF have the chance of bringing about national unity, peace and reconciliation, an attempt which talks have failed to produce. We cannot afford another Bosnia in South-East Asia or a Somalia. The Royal government needs aid and vital assistance fast and the world community, particularly the signatories of the Paris Peace Accords, owe it to this nation to ensure that peace is maintained and that the nation progresses. The Khmer Rouge will continue to make allegations, launch terrorist campaigns and cause panic and fear. They should not be allowed to fulfill their unwavering desire to return to power and in the process, persecute thousands or millions more. A military solution is now the answer as talks have failed.
