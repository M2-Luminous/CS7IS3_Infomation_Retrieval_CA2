The security situation has begun to improve, he said. In a statement to AL-HAYAH he discussed the future of the oil sector and cooperation with the oil companies. He called for the establishment of "security guards in order to protect companies' operations and enable them to operate under normal conditions." The Yemeni minister said revenue from oil since 1990 totalled about $2.5 billion and daily production at present is 310,000 barrels per day [bpd]. He said Yemen has signed a letter of intent with French companies for the development and modernization of Aden refinery. The following is text of the interview: [Taqiy-al-Din] What is the present average oil production and what are the expectations with regard to future production? [Bin-Husaynun] Oil has a long history in Yemen. Exploration operations go back to the thirties, but because of the situation then and due to the policies pursued in the area the companies did not wish to get involved in oil exploration operations in Yemen, neither in the northern or southern parts. Recently a number of companies started work in the north and the south. After unity, the number of companies reached 30 nationalities. We produce oil only in three areas: 1. Ma'rib al-Jawf, or what we call Ma'rib al-Jawf basin where the Hunt Company is operating. It produces 180,000 bpd. 2. In Shabwah, Nimr Petroleum Company produces between 6,000 and 7,000 bpd. 3. In Hadramawt, specifically in al-Masilah, where Canadian Oxy and its partners produce 20,000 bpd. Thus our production reaches 310,000 bpd. There are great possibilities to increase production when new fields are discovered, particularly since some companies have now reached the stage of drilling and evaluating the wells capacity. [Taqiy-al-Din] Reports indicate that evaluation of new wells has been completed by the French Total Company in sector 10 of Shabwah. Is it possible to give us an idea about the reserves in the Jannah and Shabwah areas, and how will Total Company transport the oil which it will produce from the field it is operating? [Bin-Husaynun] The Total Company, as an operator company, has helped us to find two discoveries, the first was in Biqa' No. 5--in Jannah--where the reserve could reach 335 million barrels, according to preliminary estimates. The second is in east Shabwah or sector No. 10 where there is an estimated 200 million barrels of reserve. The company is now carrying out an estimate of the quantities of reserve distributed among a small number of wells. A study is now being carried out of the quantities that can be extracted from the Jannah area or in the eastern sector of Shabwah. Negotiations are under way between the companies and the ministry regarding concluding the evaluation and beginning an estimation of what can be produced. Negotiations will soon begin between the government, the companies, and the companies owning the pipes in order to link production from the Jannah field to the line of Shabwah or the line of Safir. The al-Nimr Company is operating in Shabwah. With regard to sector 10 in east Shabwah, we are now trying to link the Canadian Oxy line, which is the al-Masilah line. Negotiations are under way between the companies and sector 10. The production line will be linked to the al-Masilah line and sector No. 5 will be linked to either of the lines: either to Shabwah line in which al-Nimr company is operating, or to Safir line where the Hunt Company is operating. [Taqiy-al-Din] What type of oil is this? [Bin-Husaynun] The oil in Jannah is light, and in sector 10 is similar to that of al-Masilah. It is low in sulphur and desired by the world refineries. [Taqiy-al-Din] You gave us a figure about the recently discovered reserves in both sectors, but what will their daily production level be? [Bin-Husaynun] According to information available to us so far, we can today produce from Jannah field 25,000 to 30,000 bpd. If we can now link the transport lines it would be possible to begin production quickly, and within four to six months maximum we can begin production. We can produce from sector 10, 15,000 to 20,000 bpd. We have another plan with Total Company to step up drilling operations in order to increase the number of wells in the sector. We have extended the company's license for another two years in order to provide the sector with a greater amount of data. In which case production can begin within a shorter period of time than required in Jannah, because it is very near. If we agree on a dialogue between the companies that will carry it out we can begin within three months. [Taqiy-al-Din] Are the new contracts with companies based on production sharing? [Bin-Husaynun] Yes, they are based on production sharing and the provisions of the agreements that were signed after unity, totalling 26 agreements, are good for both the government and the companies. In some contracts the rate reaches 23 percent for the company and 77 percent for the state. At the same time the state obtains 10 percent of the rights before the production costs (agreements concluded before the unity). Agreements concluded after unity vary, such as, the contract with Canadian Oxy is 66.7 for the state and the rest is for the company. Agreements with Total Company are based on the same rate. In the agreement with Hunt Oil the company obtains 60 percent of the division, but the state has 50 percent rights of Hunt's share. [Taqiy-al-Din] What about Elf Aquitaine company resuming exploration? [Bin-Husaynun] Alif Akitan has been operating in the Sayr Hazar sector, which is a big sector. Suspension of exploration is up to the company. The company claims that there are problems in the border area concession area, but we are now discussing those matters. The company will probably resume its work shortly, God willing. The sector in which the company carried out some substantial work in the past years is large. We are now discussing the resumption of work in the same sector. Discussions are in progress, and we believe the company might resume its work by the end of this year. [Taqiy-al-Din] An incident occurred in the Total operation area and one person was killed. What was the cause of this incident? [Bin-Husaynun] An incident occurred in the camp following which the government took measures and arrested a number of people accused of perpetrating the incident. Such incidents do take place in certain areas. But this incident did not obstruct the company's work. Last year some experts were detained. All these incidents occured because of disputes over employment or nonemployment of citizens. But what is important is that the situation has improved and the government is devoting great attention to the companies. We might set up highly mobile security units that will be stationed at company sites so they can operate normally. [Taqiy-al-Din] What about the project that has been agreed upon to modernize the Aden refinery? [Al-Husaynun] Two days ago we signed an agreement with a group of a French companies consisting of Foster Wheeler, [?Sijilik] and [?Francegi] to carry out an economic study for the modernization and development of the Aden refinery, which will be submitted to the ministry. Negotiations will be held with the companies regarding obtaining financing for the modernization which, if agreed upon, can be completed in two stages. The refinery is old and its production capacity is 170,000 bpd. We have previously modernized Aden refinery and spent $140 million to build an oil plant, reservoirs, and dockyards. We now have signed an agreement with the Malaysians who will provide $50 million worth of electric power equipment in return for refining charges. We hope to reach an agreement with the group of companies which we contracted to carry out the study at a cost of $400,000. Thus we will begin the plant modernization if an agreement is reached. Modernization means building refining units that are compatible with the modern installations available in the oil sector, i.e., is higher productive units than the ordinary ones. What we propose to do at the first stage is to operate the refinery at its present capacity level, that is 8.5 million tons a year or 170,000 bpd. In subsequent years production will increase to 250,000 bpd. Modernization of the refinery will cost between $500 million to $600 based on the preliminary studies for the two stages. But the cost estimate was done before some of the modernization work which we carried out. The cost will be divided over stages, the first of which will be about $250 million to $300 million, and the balance will be allotted to the second stage. [Taqiy-al-Din] From where will you get the finance for this project? [Bin-Husaynun] We do not propose to enter into commercial financing using commercial loans. We are not ready to obtain high interest loans. But we are ready to obtain easy payment loans, repayable by services offered by the refinery, such as refining, storing, or anything else. We might obtain interest free loans repayable by a daily quantity of oil. This is what (?Alif) Company wishes to do if we agree on the conditions. We might also enter into partnership with the French companies. We will receive the study within four years. [Taqiy-al-Din] How do you view the political situation in the south, bearing in mind that you are a southerner? [Bin-Husaynun] I would like to say that the unity has been achieved. It has been realized calmly and through a brotherly, democratic, and peaceful dialogue. Unity has long been the dream of all the Yemeni It has come to stay and will remain. [Taqiy-al-Din] What about the vice president going into seclusion. This seclusion is causing concern over the situation. [Al-Husaynun] First, I am against going into seclusion, but I am for the clarification of the issues and problems that are important for the people and for their daily life. I am for entering into direct negotiations in order to solve the problems.
