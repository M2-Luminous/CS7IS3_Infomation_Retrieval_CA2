These individuals indicated that Xi Yang spied on and stole state banking and economic secrets. This was proved by solid evidence and confessed to by Xi Yang himself. Xi Yang's crime was very serious. However, in view of the fact that he confessed his crime and repented, in the first trial on 28 March, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People' Court ruled on the case and meted out a light sentence, sentencing Xi Yang to 12 years in prison and depriving him of political rights for two years. Xi Yang did not accept the judgment and has filed an appeal. The Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court has already transferred the case to Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court for the second trial, which is currently underway. According to the briefings, the 38-year-old Xi Yang, a native of Jiangsu's Taicang County, was transferred from an Army unit to a civilian post in May 1983. Between April 1984 and June 1992, he was a reporter with the XINTIYU [NEW SPORTS] journal under the jurisdiction of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission. Later he was deputy director of the editorial department of JIANKANG ZHIYOU [FRIEND of HEALTH] under the aforesaid journal. In June 1992, Xi Yang left for Hong Kong because he had inherited property from his grandfather there. In August of the same year, he was employed as a reporter for the China page of Hong Kong's MING PAO daily. According to Xi Yang's confession, in view of the fact that he had worked and lived in Beijing for many years, MING PAO specifically designated him to constantly conduct activities in Beijing. In June and July of 1993, Xi Yang was active in Beijing under the pretext of covering the Sino-British talks and the founding of the Preliminary Work Committee for the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In actual fact, he was not a bit interested in covering the topic that was registered on his application; rather, he focused his energy on establishing ties, doing his utmost to pry into major state banking and financial secrets based on the requirements of a responsible person from MING PAO, and according a "plan" formulated beforehand. He did not submit applications for news coverage to the related departments according to the regulations, but resorted to illegitimate means and incited his friend Tian Ye, an employee of the People's Bank of China, to steal and provide him with voluminous state banking and financial secrets, which included an unpublished People's Bank of China deposit and loan interest modification plan, the bank's secret policy decision on participating in the international gold trade, and other important secrets. Instigated by Xi Yang, Tian Ye stole an important document marked "secret," which he delivered to Xi Yang so he could make a photocopy. Based on the requirements of MING PAO, Xi Yang wrote an article based on the stolen state banking and financial secrets and delivered it to MING PAO for publication. As a result, the compromise of these secrets has had serious consequences for the national economy. Reports have indicated that Xi Yang and Tian Ye acted surreptitiously when carrying out the above-mentioned activities. To avoid attention, they did not meet at the Jianguo Hotel, where Xi Yang was staying, but often met on a street corner; they did not shake hands when they met, nor did they bid one another farewell when they parted. On 31 July, Tian Ye arranged a meeting with Xi Yang through a pager, and at approximately 1700 that afternoon, they met in the street east if Beijing's Changan Mall, where Tian Ye nervously told Xi Yang that the People's Bank of China was investigating the incident of MING PAO's publication of state banking and economic secrets. Xi Yang said to Tian Ye: "We are the only ones who know about each other; there should not be any trouble." "I will not betray my friend." "When you have things in the future, do not use the phone, use the pager to contact me as much as possible." Xi Yang also suggested that, when Tian Ye goes to work on Monday, 2 August, Xi Yang would call Tian Ye through the pager, and if Tian Ye is okay, he should call back through the beeping pager, to say he is safe. Xi Yang also said some words to comfort Tian Ye. Thereafter, Xi Yang used the pager and the telephone many times to ask whether Tian Ye "had any trouble." A relevant person from the Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau said: Facts have indicated that Xi Yang and Tian Ye themselves knew that what they were doing was using illegal means to steal and spy on state banking and economic secrets, that their behavior had violated the state criminal code. Furthermore, Xi Yang also admitted "knowingly breaking the law" in his repentant letter, in which he pleaded guilty." Therefore it was never a case of "mistakenly trespassing into a restricted zone" as alleged by Hong Kong's MING PAO and others. After the incident took place, MING PAO repeatedly asked Xi Yang to return to Hong Kong as soon as possible, and this indicated that MING PAO also knew about the nature of the incident. This case is purely a criminal case and is not related to normal news gathering activities by reporters. Since last year, more than 1,000 Hong Kong reporters have gone to the interior to cover news, and no problem of this kind has emerged, except with Xi Yang. We can see that the boundary between normal interviews conducted by reporters and illegal stealing and spying on state secrets is very clear and understandable to Hong Kong reporters. According to reports, the Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau deemed that Xi Yang was suspected of jeopardizing state security and violating the "PRC State Security Law." Therefore, it summoned him in accordance with the law on 27 September 1993 and detained him in accordance with the law on 28 September 1993. On 7 October of the same year, with approval from Beijing Municipal People's Sub-Procuratorate, the security bureau placed him under arrest. Article 4 of the "State Security Law" stipulates that "any organization or individual who carry out behavior which jeopardizes the state security of the PRC must be prosecuted by the law," and "stealing, spying on, purchasing, and illegally providing secrets" are behaviors which jeopardize state security. Tian Ye was also detained and arrested in accordance with the law. After investigating in the case, the Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau handed it over to Beijing Municipal People's Sub-Procuratorate on 23 September 1993. After investigating in the case, the Beijing Municipal People's Sub-Procuratorate instituted proceedings at the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court on 14 December 1993. The Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court sent copies of the prosecution letters to Xi Yang and Tian Ye, and told them that, as the accused, they have the right to defend themselves, and may hire defense attorneys for this purpose. Xi Yang and Tian Ye both said they did not want to hire anyone but would defend themselves in court. According to Article 111 of the PRC Criminal Procedure Law, "the people's courts shall conduct the adjudication of cases in the first instance in public. However, cases involving state secrets or the private affairs of individuals are not to be heard in public." The cases of Xi Yang and Tian Ye involved state secrets, therefore, in accordance with the law, the court did not try them in public. During the trial process, Xi Yang pleaded guilty and repented for his crime. In the Statement of Confession and Repentance, he himself wrote: "The fact that I violated the law has caused undue losses to the state's economy and has brought undue interference to the state's current policy of macroeconomic regulation and control. As a Chinese citizen who lived on the mainland for many years, I committed the above illegal offense which has caused such a loss to State interests, and the nature of this problem is serious." After trying the case, the court maintained on the basis of verifying the facts that Xi Yang, in disregard of state laws and regulations on news coverage, pried into and stole state banking and financial secrets and published them in Hong Kong's MING PAO, thus violating the national criminal code. According to the Supplementary Provisions on Punishment for Those Committing the Crime of Releasing State Secrets, "one who steals, pries into, buys, or illegally supplies state secrets to a foreign establishment, organization, or person is to be given, where the case is serious, a prison term of 10 years or more, life imprisonment, or the death penalty and will be deprived of his political rights." A person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court pointed out: Xi Yang's crime was particularly serious. Considering the comparatively good attitude of Xi Yang, who pleaded guilty and repented for his crime, the court leniently sentenced him at the first trial to a term of 12 years in prison and deprived him of his political rights for two years in accordance with the law. Tian Ye also had a comparatively good attitude and was leniently sentenced to a term of 15 years in prison and has been deprived of his political rights for three years. The penalty meted out to them is appropriate. On 28 March 1994, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court announced in public their first-trial sentences and immediately sent the notices of judgment to Xi Yang and Tian Ye. According to the PRC Criminal Procedure Law, they could lodge an appeal within 10 days after the second day of receiving the notice of judgment. Tian Ye did not do so, while Xi Yang, who did not accept the first-trial sentence, did lodge an appeal. The Xi Yang case has now been passed to the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court for a second trial. The person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court stressed: The principle we follow is that we base our cases on facts and use the law as the criteria. Xi Yang's crime is supported by irrefutable facts. Moreover, he pleaded guilty himself. This is something that no one can reverse. Reporters' normal news coverage is completely different from prying into and stealing state secrets. The law forbids obstinately equating the criminal act of prying into and stealing state secrets as normal news coverage. Trying to confuse the public by saying that black is white will not work in China or any other country.
