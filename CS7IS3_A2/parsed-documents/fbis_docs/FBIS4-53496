He said the future of the Asia-Pacific [region] and the world in the next 20 years rests on having a stable triangular balance among the U.S., Japan, and China. However, in the last few months U.S. policies seem at odds with this objective. Speaking at [words indistinct], Mr. Lee said the U.S. has been showing a certain limit of (?view). He gave as an example U.S. pressure on Indonesia and Malaysia on their labor policies, which had led to riots in Medan. The senior minister said the U.S. policy toward China is more mystifying as it threatens to derail China's economic reform by cutting off MFN [most favored nation status]. He said if the U.S. tries to thwart China's growth, China will surely want to return the compliment when they can do so. Mr. Lee said China does not have to become an ally of the U.S. for world peace and stability, but it should not be made into an adversary. As for China, Mr. Lee said with its enormous potential, Beijing can afford to reassure its neighbors that it is a friendly and nonexpansionist power, and China can do so by making its intention and capability more transparent.
