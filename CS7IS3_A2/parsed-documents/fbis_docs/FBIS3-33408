It is unacceptable that they are denouncing at this time the possibility of fraud in an event which, like the elections, is still being organized. "We are all observing how the Supreme Electoral Tribunal is working and to report fraud is rather ridiculous. I am inclined to think that what the FMLN is seeking is international publicity," the president stated. Cristiani recalled that the Mission of UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal) is overseeing the process. "Perhaps the FMLN already feels defeated," he stressed. Meanwhile, Cristiani rejected FMLN statements that the government had not consulted with it on the recent Peace Culture Forum. FMLN Coordinator Shafik Handal said "the Peace Culture Forum, organized by the government in coordination with UNESCO, lacks legal validity because the FMLN was not taken into consideration during its planning." President Cristiani stressed that "the government did not need to consult with a particular sector on all its actions. In the case of the FMLN, consultations could have been made during the peace negotiations, but that is over now. FMLN members have formed a political party, like other groups, and must act accordingly. Let Shafik Handal make a big fuss, poor Shafik, but the government should not have to inform him of every one of its actions," the president highlighted. Cristiani pointed out that the organization of the Peace Forum was supported by different groups. He added that even an international assembly held last year in Salvador Bahia, Brazil, agreed to support El Salvador in holding that event. Cristiani made the aforementioned statements at the Camino Real Hotel, after participating in the inauguration of the National Seminar of Science and Technology, organized by the National Council of Science and Technology with the assistance of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of El Salvador.
