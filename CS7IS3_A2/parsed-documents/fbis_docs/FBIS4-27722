Acting Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar welcomed Soskovets at the airport. Deputy Defence Minister Wan Abu Bakar Mohamed is the minister-in-attendance. Soskovets, who is accompanied by several senior officials, is here to witness the signing of a multi-billion ringgit contract between Malaysia and Russia for the purchase of 18 MIG-29 air superiority jet-fighters. The signing will take place Tuesday, at the Finance Ministry. Soskovets is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Defence Minister Najib Razak. He will visit the Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia (PORIM), Airod Sdn Bhd [Company Limited], the country's privatised aircraft inspection, repair and overhaul depot, and a local telecommunications firm, Sapura Holdings. Malaysia will buy 18 MIG-29 aircraft, codenamed Fulcrum by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), to beef up the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) long-term air defence programmes. The payment for the deal is expected to be made in hard currency and palm oil. The signing of the agreement between Malaysian and Russian officials, to be witnessed by Anwar, Najib and Soskovets, is the culmination of a year-long negotiations due to the strict conditions imposed by the Malaysian Government over the purchase of the aircraft which played a high profile during the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace (LIMA) exhibition in north- western peninsular, last year. The RMAF will be the first in the region to fly the Fulcrum, the twin-engine jet-fighter manufactured by the Mikoyan Design Bureau, Moscow.
