The relations between China and Japan are very good [hen hao]. The two countries' cooperation is developing in all fields in a sustained and steady manner, especially in the economic and trade field, in which the momentum of development has been maintained by the two countries. If I remember correctly, the volume of Sino-Japanese trade in 1993 hit a record high. We hope that Mr. Hata's visit, which will be the first high-level visit between China and Japan this year, will promote mutual understanding and promote the development of Sino-Japanese relations.
