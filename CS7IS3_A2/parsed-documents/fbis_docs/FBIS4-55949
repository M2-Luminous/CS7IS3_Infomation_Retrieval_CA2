It would be interesting to know how this wise suggestion came about. Perhaps it is based on the comparatively harmless example of North Carolina or North Dakota, but an analogy may also be sought with North Vietnam, North Korea, Northern Cyprus, or North Yemen -- all countries that are artificially divided. It is not so difficult to predict the Greek reaction to this proposal, which in principle suits Skopje's theses and adds fuel to the flames that have flared up around the name of the new republic. However, this does not at all mean that Kiro Gligorov and his comrades-in-arms will accept the U.S. proposal, despite the fact that they could not wish for more -- Bulgarian Macedonia is already part of the republic, while the Greek part looks as if it is simply artificially separated from the small homeland. It will be interesting to see if there is any official Bulgarian reaction to the name of "Northern Macedonia," which in principle also includes eastern Macedonia -- in other words, the Blagoevgrad region. Skopje's appetite for our lands and the "2 million" Macedonians in Bulgaria is no secret to anyone. To prevent this, at least in words, one should ask for Macedonia to be called "Northwest Macedonia," or again, if we follow the trends in the world, we should ask for the name of "Vardar Macedonia" to be adopted. However, because the Vardar River also flows further to the south, perhaps it would be more accurate to use the name of "Upper Vardar Macedonia." However, everyone knows that the Greeks do not want the name of Macedonia mentioned at all. In this case, nothing remains but to call the country "Upper Vardar," something like Upper Volta. All this may well sound like mockery, but it is interesting how people from across the ocean find the courage to attempt to impose their way of thinking, without even taking the trouble to familiarize themselves with the historical tangle surrounding the Macedonian question. According to political circles in Washington, the package of measures proposed, with the addition of the new name, is the best solution, and Athens should accept it. Athens will state its view on this, despite Washington's optimism, but will Sofia say something too?
