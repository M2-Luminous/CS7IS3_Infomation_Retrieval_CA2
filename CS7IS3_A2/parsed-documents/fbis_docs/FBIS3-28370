Official statistics obtained yesterday showed end-December local debt was P148.312 billion over the P508.278 billion borrowed from local sources in 1992. If the $34 billion foreign debt stock, roughly equivalent to P9.18 trillion, were added to the domestic liability, the total country indebtedness would reached a staggering P9.836 trillion. Data indicated that bulk of the local liabilities, P624.181 billion or 95.06 percent, was incurred by the national government. The balance was borrowed by government corporations amounting to P4.038 billion and P28.371 billion by the monetary institutions. On a month-on-month basis, though, borrowings of the government corporations as well as that of the monetary institutions dropped slightly by P14 million and P14.456 billion, respectively. On the other hand, the national government's liabilities widened by a hefty P196.949 billion from the previous month's level of P427.232 billion. . According to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) [Central Bank of the Philippines], expansion in the NG [national government] domestic debt stock was caused by its decision to absorb a substantial amount of liabilities of the old Central Bank through the issuance of the P220 billion worth of bonds to the BSP. The BSP said that an aggregate of P226.95 billion has already been inputted in the end-December liabilities. Of this amount P176.952 billion was in Treasury bills and P50 billion were Treasury notes. While the increment was substantially lower by P30 billion from the amount inputted to the national government liabilities in December, this amount was however, paid to the BSP for the advances it made for the national government in the past.
