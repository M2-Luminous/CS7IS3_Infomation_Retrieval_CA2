The meeting, which will be held at the Transport and Communications Ministry in the fourth week of June, is a positive sign, and the two countries may be able to reach a new aviation agreement soon, the source said. "The meeting shows that this time we're getting closer to key points of the agreement, especially on seat and cargo capacities, but Thailand will maintain its position on the equal capacity principle," the source said. Thailand and the U.S. aviation industry have been deadlocked for three years because they differ on the allocation of cabin and load factors. The United States supports an "open skies" policy while Thailand holds to the principle of "capacity pre-determination." The Thai delegation will be led by Transport Permanent Secretary Mahidon Chantharangkun while the U.S. team will be headed by Carl Candiff the State Department's head of special negotiations for transport affairs. The source said the United States wants to increase flights to Bangkok after the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam. Washington envisages more US tourists and businessmen travelling to Vietnam via Bangkok. Thai Airways International [THAI] has no plans to increase flights to the United States in the short term. THAI flies to the United States four times a week on the Bangkok-Los Angeles route. U.S. airlines Delta, Northwest, and United Airlines operate a total of 21 flights a week to Bangkok. Last week Thailand and Vietnam signed an aviation agreement to increase their seat capacities. According to the Director-General of the Civil Aviation Department, Dr. Sisuk Chantharangsu, the agreement will create a new destination for THAI at Danang besides Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh, which the airline currently services. The agreement increases the seating capacity for both countries from 2,350 seats per week by an additional 620 seats, Mr Sisuk said. THAI flies to Ho Chi Minh City seven times a week and to Hanoi three times a week. Vietnam operates seven flights a week on the Hanoi-Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh-Bangkok routes.
