The world has seen great changes since the ending of the Cold War with the disintegration of the former Soviet Union. How to face the new challenges and make NAM become more effective through adjustment becomes a focal point of discussion during the four-day 11th NAM foreign ministerial conference. U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's envoy to the conference spoke on behalf of Butrus-Ghali that the Non-Aligned Movement, as other world organizations, came to a cross-road and needs to reaffirm its duty in today's world. The envoy asserted that as an inter-continent movement, NAM can play a special role in the international political sphere. Delegations to the conference confirmed that as an important forum and channel for maintaining the interest for developing countries, NAM also has its own function. Its principle of independence, self-determination, non-alignment, non-blocking and maintaining world peace, disarmament and establishing new international economic order still has vitality. The ministers pointed out that the NAM countries should strengthen its coordination and take unified stands on major international issues, in a bid to produce more voice in the United Nations and strengthen negotiating power in dialogue with the developed countries. It is widely agreed that peace and development are still two major task for the NAM. Egyptian President Husni Mubarak said at the conference opening ceremony that facing the challenges posed by the changes in the world, the Non-Aligned Movement is required to stand up as representative of the whole developing world and strengthen its coordination with Group [of] 77. As for security issues, many delegates to the conference expressed concern over the fightings and conflicts in some developing countries. They called for peaceful and political means for solving the conflicts and fightings in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, Rwanda and Yemen. Ministers said the developing countries witnessed sluggish economic growth due to historical reasons, unfare trade [as received] and debt problems. Thus they should make persistent efforts to build a new international economic order. They called on the movement to promote South-South cooperation and South-North dialogue and has closer contacts with Group 77. Govind Narain Srivastava, Indian delegate to the conference, said the end of Cold War does not mean that the Non-Aligned Movement has outlived its utility. He said, "It is widely agreed that although political items will continue to attract attention of the movement, the major focus will, certainly, be on the economic issues." As the gap between the developed and developing world widens, the movement shall have to assign maximum priority to the economic contents and take concerted action for economic prosperity, he added. Though the ministers said the movement should strengthen coordination among its member states in economic field, most of them believed that the NAM would play a greater role in the political sphere. The conference concluded with the issuing of the "Cairo Declaration," which will be the guidelines for the approach of the 109-member movement toward political and economic issues of interest to NAM countries. The Non-Aligned Movement was established in 1961. South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo participated in the conference and his country was accepted as NAM's 109th member state.
