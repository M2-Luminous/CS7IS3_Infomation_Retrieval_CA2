According to him, at present the special envoy of the U.N. Secretary General for Tajikistan, Ramirez Perez-Bollon, is in Tehran. Later he is planning to go to Islamabad. He is expected to visit Dushanbe on 25-27 May. The U.N. deputy Secretary General for political issues, Marek Golding, is to arrive in Tajikistan's capital together with him. "The U.N. officials will indicate the final date and place for the talks, since earlier we agreed that these questions belong to their competence," Olimov said. As he said, the Tajik leadership has "enough good will to continue the negotiating process." "At the moment the state of inter-Tajik dialogue provides reason for cautious optimism," the foreign minister said. According to him, the main thing is that the "negotiating mechanism has been switched on, and the two sides agreed to continue their peace dialogue." "We stand for carrying out the talks in a constructive channel, not in the channel of continued confrontation," Olimov pointed out. At the same time he deplored the "regular insinuations launched into the news media by some members of the Tajik opposition." "The allegations that the leadership of Tajikistan wants no peaceful settlement, that it is interested in building up Russian military presence in order to crush the opposition, are totally groundless," the foreign minister stressed. According to him, the "factor of Russian influence" in Tajikistan has "largely cultural, not military, foundations." "Unfortunately, last year we had to involve Russian troops in the guarding of the Tajik-Afghan border in accordance with the CIS collective security treaty. We had to resort to that measure. Russian troops were stationed in Tajikistan to ensure the safety of our republic and protect its sovereignty, not to threaten someone," Olimov said. "When the threat to security in Tajikistan stemming from the opposition militants entrenched in Afghanistan ceases to exist, the issue of Russian troops will get resolved by itself," he noted. "Unfortunately, armed opposition groups persist in launching regular sallies from neighboring Afghanistan. This is a fact we cannot get away from. In our view, some people are too eager to destabilize the situation in Tajikistan and resolve this issue by military means. They are using the threat allegedly stemming from Russian troops in our republic as a cover for this," Olimov said. The leadership of Tajikistan "is in a peaceful mood, and it is trying to ignore the speculations concerning the "Russian factor," the head of Tajik diplomacy pointed out.
