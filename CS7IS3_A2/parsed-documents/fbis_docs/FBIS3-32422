Conference organizers invited the delegates to commit themselves in a patriotic spirit to untangle the crisis. Jean Luckenson reports: [Begin recording, in Creole] We have patiently set out today to seek a solution to the crisis the country is experiencing. It is perhaps one of the gravest crises ever experienced in our national history. We must find a solution, an effective remedy to this cancer gnawing at our society at the end of this century, because the times are grave. We need peace in a Haitian society that is examining its future. Today, our concern is an urgent solution so that coming generations do not judge us. These statements were made by Fritz Bissereth, CARENA national coordinator, in his speech opening the national conference at about 1100 on 6 February. [passage omitted] Bissereth went on to say we must set aside our divergences or political opinions, regardless of sector, so we can find an urgent solution within the next 48 hours. After the opening speech, the audience stood up to observe one minute of meditation. A delegation then placed a spray of flowers before the altar of the homeland. The high point in this rally today was the statements of the delegates and the various resolutions they introduced. Of the 100 [invited], 65 guests representing political parties or socioprofessional organizations were present. Divergent opinions were presented in the delegates' statements. Some opted for the application of Article 148 of the country's fundamental law; others demanded [the application of] Article 149. National Coalition spokesman Carl Denis asked for a clean sweep, as a true solution, or a triumvirate or five-member consultive council. For his part, the representative of the National Rally Party [PARAN] has withdrawn because, in his opinion, there is no presidium managing this national conference. According to the PARAN representative, Frantz Gerard Verret, the CARENA members are acting as sole sovereigns whereas, in principle, the National Assembly should be making decisions. [passage omitted] The panel was made up of the Reverend Aurel Chery; Gabriel Miracles, representative of the Autonomous Organization of Haitian Workers for the union sector; Max Beauvoir, representative of National BODE [BODE Nasyonal, voodoo organization, expansion unknown]; Manfred Antoine, representative of the people's sector and the National Front for Change and Democracy; Dr. Rony Durant, representative of the Higher Institute of Political and Juridical Sciences; and Colonel Wilson Eustache, representative of the Army. We should tell you that the representatives of the resigning government were not present, nor was the diplomatic corps. The rally took place in a very calm atmosphere. The room was very crowded. We saw a big national flag and slogans advocating peace and reconciliation. On the whole, this was the situation at the Holiday Inn. Jean Luckenson for Signal FM. [end recording]
