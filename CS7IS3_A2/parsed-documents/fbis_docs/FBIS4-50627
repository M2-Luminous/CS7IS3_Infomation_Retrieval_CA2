He also answered reporters' questions. Wu Jianmin said: On 17 May, Qian Fu [Chien Fu] claimed in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan that Taiwan was prepared to accept South Africa's dual recognition of the two sides across the Taiwan Strait. This is yet another plot of the Taiwan authorities aimed at creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" in disregard of the overall interests of the Chinese nation. He said: There is only one China in the world. The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. This is a fact universally recognized by the United Nations and the international community at large. It is precisely on this basis that China has established diplomatic relations with 158 countries in the world. He pointed out: It is futile for the Taiwan authorities to try to end Taiwan's isolation in the world by way of "dual recognition." The only right choice is for them to go along with historical tide by helping bring about national reunification at an early date. Wu Jianmin said: The Chinese Government appreciates the position of South African President Mandela and the African National Congress to pursue a one-China policy and their pledge to [Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 1552 GMT on 19 May transmits a correction changing "their pledge to" to "will"] address their relations with China in accordance with the practice of the United Nations and other international organizations. We believe that relations between China and the new South Africa will develop in an all-round way on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. Following are Wu Jianmin's answers to reporters' questions: A reporter asked: According to a report, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is ready to strengthen its relations with China. What is China's attitude toward the organization? Is China willing to join the organization? The spokesman answered: We have taken note of the relevant report. We are maintaining good cooperative relations with many members of the organization, and we are also ready to join the organization in exploring ways to expand cooperative relations. We believe developing cooperative relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is beneficial to both sides. Question [Q]: King Sihanouk has once again proposed a round table meeting in Pyongyang, and invited Chea Sim, Ranariddh, Hun Sen, and Khieu Samphan to attend the proposed meeting. What is your comment on this? Answer [A]: We highly appreciate and support King Sihanouk's efforts in realizing national reconciliation and maintaining peace and stability in Cambodia. We sincerely hope that setting store by their national interests, the Cambodian leaders of various parties will, with the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, make joint efforts for national reconciliation. Q: According to a report, on 18 May U.S. Congressman Smith and others asserted that China is continuing to export prison labor products to the United States. What is your comment on this? A: This is sheer fabrication. Regarding the export of prison labor products, China and the U.S. have signed a memorandum of understanding on prohibiting import and export trade in prison labor products. China has acted in strict compliance with the memorandum. Not long ago, China and the United States also signed a statement on cooperation for the implementation of the memorandum. Both the Chinese and U.S. sides share the view that the two documents are being implemented smoothly. Ulterior motives motivate some people to spread lies and vicious slander on this issue. Q: A meeting of the Sino-British Hong Kong Airport Committee will be held on 20 May in Hong Kong. What are the Chinese side's expectations for this meeting? Is there a hope for the two sides to reach an agreement on financial arrangements for the new airport? A: The Sino-British Airport Committee will hold a meeting in Hong Kong on 20 May. The Chinese side, as always, in accordance with the memorandum of understanding on the new airport, will make continuous efforts so that the two sides can reach an agreement on financial arrangements for the new airport at an early date.
