Col Ongkon said he had been informed by Banteay Meanchey Governol Gen Duong Khem of the request to postpone the talks because his side has not yet completed the relevant paper work. The Khlong Luk-Poipet checkpoint has been closed since April 9 following fighting between Cambodian government forces and Khmer Rouge guerrillas. In most cases, shells and gunfire strayed across the border threatening Thai traders. Sa Kaeo Governor Kasem Chaiyasit yesterday met Thai traders to inform them of the postponement of the talks. He also told them of a plan to renovate Ban Rong Khlua market which was destroyed by fire on April 8. The checkpoint closure has hit the border trade and doubled consumer prices to Cambodians in Battambang, Siem Reap and Banteay Meanchey provinces. Informed sources said that most traders wanted the border reopened so that trade could resume as usual. Some influential traders however wanted it closed indefinitely in order that they could engage in smuggling. Thailand last month told Cambodia it wanted the checkpoint to be permanent with both countries stationing immigration officers on a permanent basis. It also wanted Cambodia to guarantee safety and security in the region of the checkpoint and to agree to the setting up of a special committee against crime along the border.
