FR940405-0-00048 FR940405-0-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;150&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8864; AD 94&hyph;07&hyph;06] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, that requires inspections to detect cracked or fractured H&hyph;11 steel bolts, replacement of discrepant bolts with ones made of Inconel 718 material, and eventual replacement of all H&hyph;11 steel bolts installed at certain critical locations with Inconel 718 material bolts. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracked and fractured H&hyph;11 steel bolts installed at certain critical locations of the airframe structure. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the failure of attachment bolts in critical locations, which could lead to severe airframe damage. DATES: Effective May 5, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of May 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tim Backman, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANM&hyph;120S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2776; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on December 15, 1993 (58 FR 65567). That action proposed to require inspections to detect cracked or fractured H&hyph;11 steel bolts, replacement of discrepant bolts with ones made of Inconel 718 material, and eventual replacement of all H&hyph;11 steel bolts installed at certain critical locations with bolts made of Inconel 718 material. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the proposal. Two commenters request that the applicability of the proposal be revised to exclude Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes. These commenters state, and the manufacturer has confirmed, that these airplanes were delivered without H&hyph;11 steel bolts installed. The FAA concurs. Since issuance of the notice, the FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;51&hyph;2048, Revision 1, dated January 27, 1994, which excludes Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes from the effectivity listing. Since these airplanes were not delivered with H&hyph;11 bolts, they are not subject to the addressed unsafe condition. The FAA has revised the final rule to exclude Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes from the applicability, and to reference this latest revision of the service bulletin as an additional source of appropriate service information. Additionally, the FAA has revised the economic impact information, below, to reflect the exclusion of Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes.
