Military Hardware"] [Text] Veniamin Pavlovich Yefremov was born in 1926. He came to the Scientific-Research Electro-Mechanical Institute (NIEMI) in 1945, after completing the Moscow Communications Tekhnikum. He completed the evening division of the Moscow Electrical Engineering Institute of Communications without leave from his job. He became the chief of a department in the field in 1958, and has headed NIEMI since 1968. V.P. Yefremov has been a General Designer since 1983. Currently, while remaining General Designer, he has been heading the Anteypromeksport concern, of which NIEMI is the lead organization. V.P. Yefremov was awarded the degree of doctor of technical sciences in 1966; in 1986 he was elected a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, and in 1992 an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences. V.P. Yefremov is the principal designer of the Krug, Osa, S-300V and Tor air-defense missile systems and a number of upgrades for the ground forces PVO [air defense] troops. V.P. Yefremov was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, and has been awarded Lenin (1967) and State (1984) prizes along with five medals for his contributions to the cause of creating domestic arms. [VPK] Veniamin Pavlovich, how do you personally assess the air-defense missile weaponry developed by NIEMI? [Yefremov] NIEMI is the leading enterprise in the field of air-defense missile armaments for the ground forces. We have developed four types of SAM systems--the Krug, Osa, S-300V and Tor--each of which is an original. All of these systems have been upgraded a number of times. The first SAM system developed by request of the ground forces was the Krug system. High mobility is a distinguishing feature of that system. The deployment or shutdown time does not exceed 20 minutes. This is provided for by the fact that all of the SAM system gear is accommodated on highly mobile, tracked self-propelled vehicles and are joined by radio links. This system entered service with the ground forces in 1966. SAM systems comparable in mobility were not being developed anywhere at that time. The system replaced the S-75 SAM system with the ground forces; its deployment time was several hours. High mobility of a SAM system has much significance for the ground forces. It also has great significance in supporting combat operations with the employment of high-precision weaponry. A second feature of the SAM system is autonomy. Its own radar set was created as part of the system for that purpose, for the detection of airborne targets, and is also accommodated on a tracked vehicle. The properties of mobility and autonomy are manifested to an even greater extent in the second SAM system, the Osa, which was developed at the institute. This is the first SAM system in the world in which all of the elements are located on a single self-propelled platform. It must be said that the similar Mauler SAM system was being developed at the same time in the United States, but its development was never completed. The acquisition radar in the Osa SAM system operates while on the move and tracks the targets with autotracking, with the launch of the SAMs taking place after a brief halt. The system can advance with the battle formations of the troops, providing defense for them against means of air attack (SVN). The Osa SAM system entered service with the ground forces in 1972, but it remains quite effective to this day. The Tor SAM system was created to replace the Osa; the entire process of combat operations is performed in automated mode in it. The launch of the SAMs is performed vertically from the body of the self-propelled vehicle for the first time in a system of this class, which makes it possible to reduce to a minimum the operating time of the system and increase its effectiveness in battle with airborne targets that appear unexpectedly. The possibility of simultaneous firing on several airborne targets was also made a reality in the Tor SAM system. Other types of SAM systems in this class do not have that trait. Finally, the S-300V SAM system entered service with the ground forces in 1982. This is a multichannel SAM system, the most powerful weapon in the ground forces today. It was developed to fight not only aerodynamic targets, but first and foremost operational-tactical and tactical ballistic missiles. The S-300V surpasses the Patriot SAM system in this regard, supporting not only a more powerful SAM with a highly effective warhead, but also having a special acquisition radar as part of the SAM system. Another advantage of the S-300V is its high mobility. All of the combat elements are placed on highly mobile, tracked self-propelled vehicles. The high effectiveness of the Tor and S-300V systems was demonstrated in the Oborona-92 exercises conducted in November of 1992.

Investments are needed in order to maintain that status, however. The loss of our leading position is threatened otherwise. [VPK] What shape is NIEMI in today? What is the personnel situation? [Yefremov] NIEMI, as many other defense enterprises, is experiencing difficult times today. The main cause of that is insufficient financing and a lack of clarity with regard to state orders. Some 1,500 specialists, roughly 25 percent, have left the institute. There were three waves: first the specialists under 30 years of age left, then those 30--35, and then those 35-40. Specialists of the highest grade remain, but their ages are 40 and up. There are very few young people. This means that the principle of succession is being violated. If we are not able to restore the principle of succession in 1993-94, then the enterprise will lose its traditions, its style and, as they say, its look. We are taking steps in three areas to keep that from happening. The first area pertains to the selection of the priority projects in the defense field. We have been able, taking into account a series of organizational measures, to raise the average pay at the enterprise. It is, however, still markedly inferior to the pay at commercial structures. The second area consists of selling models of our weapons aboard. The third is the joint development of systems for civilian and military purposes with foreign firms. The second and third areas, in my opinion, could provide an opportunity to restore the potential of the enterprise, bring back those who have left and attract young personnel. We have created the Anteypromeksport concern. It includes virtually all of the enterprises that are active in the development and series production of the types of SAM systems that we have been talking about. We are hoping to be able to resolve a number of urgent issues with the help of the concern. [VPK] Can the necessary financial resources be obtained through the conversion of some of the enterprise? [Yefremov] Conversion does not only provide funds for most defense enterprises, it requires considerable expenditures as well. If you were to take, say, a tank plant, its conversion to national-economic products would require the replacement of the basic process equipment. Even the transition of an enterprise in the radar field to, for example, microwave ovens entails considerable technical difficulties. It must be taken into account that the psychology of the designer and the industrial engineer in the defense field is markedly different from the psychology of an industrial engineer and a designer in the production of national-economic goods. This is conditioned by the different scope of production of the items and their reliability, servicing and cost. It is probably somewhat easier to implement conversion at aviation enterprises, i.e. where dual-purpose technology is used. It must be kept in mind, however, that the nature of the production of goods for the national economy and for defense differs substantially. The pursuit of conversion first requires a definition of the principle of defensive sufficiency for the state, the military doctrine and the required quality and quantity of armaments. The enterprises have to be selected for the production of defensive hardware proceeding from that, which should become the backbone of the military-industrial complex and which would be expedient to have under state ownership. The military-industrial complex (VPK), in that case, would be subjected to the competition of the market and the effects of individual entrepreneurial structures to the least extent. The remaining enterprises in the VPK are being converted to the output of goods for national-economic purposes and, where necessary and expedient, could take orders in defense fields as well. [VPK] What international exhibitions has the enterprise taken part in? What are the successes in the concluding of contracts? [Yefremov] NIEMI has taken part in four international exhibitions over the last two years. The Tor SAM system was shown at Manila in 1991 and Le Bourget in 1992. The modern ground forces air-defense weaponry, including the S-300V and Tor SAM systems, was shown for the first time at the Mosaeroshow-92 at Zhukovskiy. We demonstrated only mock-ups of our systems and showed films about them at the exhibition at Afiny.

American businessmen wanted to buy two of the Tor SAM systems, but we did not agree as we are trying to sell an entire lot at once. Negotiations are continuing today on the procurement of our SAM systems by various nations. Interest increased considerably after the Oborona-92 exercise, at which representatives of foreign military circles were present. The systems made a great impression on them. We will take part in an arms show at Abu Dhabi in 1993. A firing of the Tor SAM system is being proposed there. I feel that we will resolve the question of the sale of our systems abroad in the first half of 1993, and will be able to rectify the financial situation of the institute and the association. [VPK] Talk is being heard that you are encountering a large obstacle on the part of the government in trying to sell the systems abroad. [Yefremov] This is complex issue. The government, on the one hand, is not impeding this trade. We are trying to sell defensive weaponry, and there can be no moral condemnation from that standpoint; the government even has a vested interest in that trade. We received basic permission for the sale of the S-300V system on 4 July 1992, and this question was resolved even earlier for the Tor SAM system. A state monopoly, on the other hand, exists in the trade for this good. It seems to me that the prices should be coordinated among the governmental bodies and the producers. [VPK] What business relationships are taking shape between you and American specialists and businessmen? [Yefremov] The United States is displaying a great deal of interest in our projects. As I mentioned already, we received a proposal from U.S. businessmen for the sale of the Tor SAM system. We have made several trips to the United States at the invitation of various organizations, and taken part in various seminars and discussions on theoretical issues. Specialists in the United States are interested in what we think on a number of scientific and technical problems. A group of our specialists is now being sent to the United States, where they will discuss questions of the employment of the Tor SAM system to fight drug-trafficking groups and the design of phased antenna arrays (FAR). The Americans feel that we are underestimating the dangers of the drug trade, and our country will still be running into this. It must be said, with regard to phased antenna arrays, that the specialists are attracted by our engineering ideas, which make it possible to create inexpensive FARs. (The discussion took place in the middle of December. The group has since returned, having conducted their talks successfully.) [VPK] What relationships link the institute with the PRC? [Yefremov] Representatives of the PRC are also displaying a great deal of interest in our hardware. The Chinese Republic wants to re-equip its army, and is seeking a solution to that issue. The air-defense weaponry of the PRC army is by and large obsolete, but China is still not able to procure modern weaponry in large quantities abroad; it is thus trying to find another solution to the problem. There is a desire, in particular, to develop their own SAM systems with the participation of foreign specialists. Our institute has received a proposal to take part in such projects. Negotiations are currently underway. [VPK] The defense industry in the Soviet Union, as the rest of the national economy, was structured according to the sector principle, and was consolidated around the Military-Industrial Commission under the Presidium of the Council of Ministers. What do you see as the principles for the organization of the defense industry and the management of the defense complex under contemporary conditions? [Yefremov] The sector structure of the defense industry (electronics, electrical engineering, aviation, nuclear etc.) headed by the Military-Industrial Commission, in my opinion, was the most efficient. Highly skilled personnel and technologies in this area were concentrated in the defense industry, on the one hand, and the presence of the commission made it possible, on the other, to organize interaction among the sectors. The planned management of the economy made it possible, by and large, for USSR Gosplan to organize all sectors of the national economy and formulate targets for five years. The monitoring bodies of the government evaluated the activity of the sectors and the largest enterprises for the fulfillment of the five-year plan. This system, of course, required a certain quantity of highly skilled bureaucrats. There were, however, both a target and government bodies seeking its attainment. The leading capitalist countries borrowed from us the idea of planning the development of their economy, especially in the military realm. A program for the development of more than twenty new types of dual-purpose technology, for instance, has been planned and approved at the Congressional level. The SDI program in the United States is a vivid example of planning in the military realm. The structures for the planning and management of the defense industry were destroyed during the so-called times of restructuring and democracy, and the Ministry of Industry that was created proved to be a monster that was unable to do anything. A Committee for the Defense Industry has now been created, which it seems to me will unite the former sector ministries and the military-industrial commission. The idea is not a new one, but it could be asserted in advance that this is a positive step compared to the existing situation. Planning and strict monitoring of the fulfillment of plans on the part of government bodies should undoubtedly exist. An army still exists, and a defense complex in industry and the bodies for managing it should also exist, i.e. the army and the defense complex of industry are inseparable. COPYRIGHT: Vooruzheniye.
