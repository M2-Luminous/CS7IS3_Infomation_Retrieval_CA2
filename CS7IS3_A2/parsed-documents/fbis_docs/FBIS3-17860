This was reported to INTERFAX on Tuesday by the South Ossetian leader Ludvig Chibirov who pointed to the high turnout. A total of 80 of registered voters cast their ballots. The second round of voting is scheduled for April 10. Chibirov will also run the second time because there are five more candidates in his electoral district. Meanwhile, an aide of the leader of Georgia, that does not recognize the republic, has described the elections as illegal. In an interview Vazha Khachapuridze said they were aimed at the separation of South Ossetia from Georgia. He said the step contradicts the trilateral Dagomys agreements and could aggravate the situation. "International experts will pass their verdict on the lawfulness of the elections", the aide said.
