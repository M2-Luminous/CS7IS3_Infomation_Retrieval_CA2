Joulwan, NATO supreme allied commander Europe, backs a diplomatic solution for solving the Bosnia crisis. In any case, it is up to the United Nations and not NATO to decide on procedures and actions in the Balkans, the U.S. four-star general told BERLINER MORGENPOST. Joulwan rejected the view that NATO is doing too little in Bosnia. After all, the alliance is monitoring the flight ban over Bosnia as well as deploying ships to ensure an effective embargo imposed on rump Yugoslavia. In addition, NATO has 16,000 troops in Bosnia under U.N. command.
