The statement said the suppression of Hanchongnyon angers the people as it is an anti-national act. The inaugural ceremony of the second-term Hanchongnyon as a reasonable independent mass organisation was a very legitimate meeting, said the statement, adding that the invocation of the "National Security Law" charging Hanchongnyon with the "tendency toward benefiting the enemy" is an open suppression to stifle Hanchongnyon.
