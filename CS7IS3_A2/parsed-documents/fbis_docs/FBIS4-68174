What in the world was Libya's foreign minister doing in Paris? The mystery remains 48 hours after he left France. Although the Libyan Embassy in France and the French Foreign Ministry vigorously state that 'Umar al-Muntasir's visit was definitely a "private" one, his short stay in Paris is still raising controversy. Yesterday, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua's comment that he had not been "informed" about this visit only added to a general feeling of skepticism. It is indeed nothing short of incredible that the interior minister would not be aware of the presence in Paris of a member of Colonel al-Qadhdhafi's government. Especially in view of the fact that Mr. al-Muntasir's visit had been scheduled at least 10 days earlier, according to both the Libyan Embassy and the Foreign Ministry. A transit visa was issued to him by the French Embassy in Tripoli before he left for South Africa, where he attended Nelson Mandela's swearing in ceremonies. Versions differ as to 'Umar al-Muntasir's time of arrival in Paris: either very early on Sunday morning, via a South African Airlines flight from Johannesburg, or the day before. And he left in the afternoon of the next day [16 May] for Tripoli via Tunis. His stay of some 30 hours, or more likely the whole weekend, in the French capital raises some major questions: What did he do, who did he see, what did he talk about? It is known that 'Umar al-Muntasir stayed in the Crillon Hotel, which often accommodates foreign ministers on an official visit to France. First question: Who took care of the logistics of the Libyan minister's visit? According to "reliable sources" of AFP, that would be...Adnan al-Khaskji [presumably al-Khashoggi], the prominent Saudi Arabian businessman, who reportedly acted as a middleman to ensure the informal visit took place smoothly. However, the Libyan Embassy firmly denied al-Khaskji's involvement yesterday, stating that it alone had made arrangements for the minister's stay. At any rate, the embassy could hardly acknowledge any participation from the Saudi Arabian, as it would imply that, through its foreign minister, Libya may have been trying to negotiate some arrangement with the Americans or with the Mossad (Israeli intelligence service). More prosaically, the lawyers representing the victims of the bomb attack against the UTA DC-10, Messrs Levy and Szpiner, are convinced that there is a connection between Mr. al-Muntasir's visit in Paris and the case they have been working on. The airliner exploded in 1989 while flying over Niger, killing 170 people. The bomb was presumably planted by Libyan terrorists. "Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere has almost completed his investigation," insisted Jean-Paul Levy; "This is why they (the Libyans) are getting restless!" The lawyers, who were informed about the Libyan minister's visit on Monday night, cannot see another explanation for the successive visits to 'Umar al-Muntasir's room in the Crillon Hotel by "Adnan al-Khaskji, by one of the French lawyers defending the Libyans in the DC-10 affair, and by British and American businessmen." "The pro-Libyan lobby has a lot of clout," says Mr. Levy. "We are faced with states and international companies that are eager to do business with Libya." It is true indeed that 'Umar al-Muntasir had "no formal contact" with French political figures. [passage omitted]
