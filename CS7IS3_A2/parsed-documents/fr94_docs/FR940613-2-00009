FR940613-2-00009 FR940613-2-00004 Period of Investigation The period of investigation is September 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994. Such or Similar Comparisons We have determined that the merchandise covered by this investigation constitutes a single category of ``such or similar'' merchandise. Best Information Available Because Thy-Marcinelle failed to respond to our questionnaire, we based our determination on best information available (BIA) pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act which provides that the Department shall use BIA when a party refuses to provide requested information. In determining what rate to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions for those respondents who did not cooperate in an investigation. According to the Department's two-tiered BIA methodology outlined in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate From Belgium, 58 FR 37083 (July 9, 1993), when a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company the higher of (1) The highest margin alleged in the petition, or (2) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation. (See Allied Signal Aerospace Co. v. United States, 996 F. 2d 1185, 1191&hyph;92 (Fed. Cir. 1993).) Because there were no cooperative respondents in this investigation, we are assigning to all exporters, as BIA, a margin of 52.34 percent, the highest margin calculated in the petition (adjusted for methodological errors as explained in the initiation notice). Suspension of Liquidation In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of steel wire rod from Belgium that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margin, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/producer/exporter 1Margin percentage All Companies 52.34 ITC Notification In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry before the later of 120 days after the date of this preliminary determination or 45 days after our final determination.
