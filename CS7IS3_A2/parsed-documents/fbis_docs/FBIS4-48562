In a statement issued in Lilongwe, spokesman for the MCP said in the capital city UDF supporters carried a mock coffin of His Excellency President Ngwazi [paramount] Dr. Kamuzu Banda, while six houses of MCP supporters have been destroyed in Balaka. The spokesman said a house belonging to an MCP functionary was stoned in Blantyre, while some village headmen and chiefs have been threatened with burning of their houses and dethronement in Nsanje, (Jaturu), and other districts in the southern region. The spokesman said such acts and threats were unwarranted and called on the president-elect to put an immediate end to them. He said the MCP would hold the UDF and its leaders responsible for any damage to property and harm to the MCP supporters. The spokesman, however, reassured all MCP supporters not to feel intimidated by anyone because, he said, they are equally protected by the law and Constitution of this country.
