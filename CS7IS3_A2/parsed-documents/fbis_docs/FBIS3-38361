Addressing the India special session of the World Economic Forum at Davos in Switzerland last night, Mr. Narasimha Rao said there is a national consensus in the country with regard to the reforms and what is needed now is development of the power, transport, communication, and road network for the next phase of liberalization. He assured them of safe and good returns and reiterated his government's commitment to remove all obstacles. He told the business community that laws, wherever needed, will be modified to protect the interests of all concerned and the bureaucratic controls will not be allowed to come in the way. A select gathering of about 300 noted chief executive officers of corporations, academicians, journalists and intellectuals participated in the India session. The commerce minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, chaired the session. The finance secretary, Mr. Montague Singh Aluwalia, and the chairman of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, Mr. A.N. Verma, attended. Our correspondent S. Sudharshanam reports from Davos that, replying to questions at the India session, the prime minister dispelled doubts of foreign investors about the liberalization program of the Indian economy and assured them that the process is irreversible. He told them liberalization is a deliberate attempt and choice to globalize the Indian economy. He said his government is politically stable to carry forward these reforms. Earlier, the commerce minister apprised the business community of the health of the Indian economy and the results achieved after the introduction of economic reforms two years ago. Expressing similar sentiments in his address at the closing symposium of the World Economic Forum, the prime minister cautioned against internationalization of transborder export of terrorism, clandestine encouragement of religious fundamentalism, and local issues. He said these would result in anarchy and total cessation of developmental effort of many developing countries. Mr. Narasimha Rao also warned the world community against linking the transfer of technology to extraneous, unreasonable, unwarranted conditionalities, and said these are threatening the basic fabric of many developing countries. He said internationalization of local issue, low cost proxy wars, and recourse to blackmail of various kinds are on the rise, and thus anarchy and total cessation of developmental efforts stare many developing countries in the face. The prime minister made it clear that India will not accept conditionalities in developing peaceful technology. The prime minister called for a cooperative global effort to fight poverty and widespread illiteracy. He expressed the hope that a literate world can be ensured in the first quarter of the coming century and called for determined efforts to achieve the result. Expressing concern over religious fanaticism and hatred, Mr. Rao said that challenge is to create and strengthen the desire for a better life in society.
