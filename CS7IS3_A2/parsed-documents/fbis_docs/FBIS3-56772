The Russian and American representatives drew the attention of world public opinion to an important item of the Moscow declaration, signed by the Presidents of Russia and the United States, in which they have reaffirmed their support to the United Nations Organisation and called for joint efforts to strengthen the U.N. peacekeeping role. Vorontsov and Albright stated in part: "Both presidents have stressed the need to strengthen the U.N. ability to keep the peace and prevent conflicts. They made it incumbent on our two governments to work jointly in order to improve the mechanism in this sphere. We express mutual satisfaction, and this is particularly important, that our two presidents have called for a Security Council meeting at summit level to mark the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. "It is clear that by making this statement, both Russia and the United States thereby recognise and prize the central role played by the United Nations, particularly, the U.N. peacekeeping operations and efforts to safeguard international peace and security in this increasingly chaotic and unstable world." The Russian and American representatives also stated that they would cooperate closely in the effort to ensure the success of the U.N. Security Council meeting at summit level, proposed by the Presidents of Russia and the United States.
