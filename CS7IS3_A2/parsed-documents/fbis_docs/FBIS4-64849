UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is meeting Ali Alatas and Durao Barroso, the Indonesian and Portuguese foreign ministers, respectively. At meetings in New York last September, both countries pledged to take measures to ease the situation in that former Portuguese colony, which was annexed by Indonesia in 1975 right after it became independent. The occupation of East Timor has never been recognized by the international community. Several organizations have blamed Indonesia for human rights abuses there.
