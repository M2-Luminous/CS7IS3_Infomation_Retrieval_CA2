Usov (Nuclear Reactors Institute, RNTs [expansion not given] ``Kurchatovskiy institut''); received Dec 29,1991; UDC 621.039.577] [Abstract] The article examines construction principles of universal space platforms [USPs] using thermal emission nuclear electric power units [NEPUs] with thermal and fast reactors and electric reactive drives [ERDs] as applied to a ``Proton'' carrier rocket. Due to their compactness, the possibility to substantially increase the output during 15 to 20% of the total flight time, and small disturbances to spacecraft motion it is expedient to use thermal emission NEPUs in USPs. As far as their mass, overall dimensions, cost and performance characteristics are concerned, NEPUs have important advantages over photoelectric units. The article lists NEPU components and describes their parameters. Two versions of orbital injection are examined a single launch (the USP is launched into orbit together with the special purpose equipment module) and double launch (the USP and special) purpose equipment module are launched independently and then joined in a radiation safe orbit. Power supply of the special equipment module can also be done remotely by directional power transmission in the centimeter wave band. Capabilities of a spacecraft with USPs using various capacity thermal emission NEPUs for a flight to a stationary orbit, wherein a ``Proton'' rocket is used for launching into a low (about 200 km) orbit and a special purpose acceleration module is used for transferring the spacecraft to a radiation safe orbit (around 800 km), are discussed. The mass and dimensions of the special purpose equipment module are estimated. The data presented in the article justify the promising character of application of power propulsion complexes with thermal emission NEPUs for solving practical problems of space exploration.
