Moreover, they have also provided the best teaching material for economic circles to study and explore the Marxist economics of New China, and provided a scientific guide for us in striving to found a socialist market economy. China's socialist reform has gone through a short course, but its brilliant achievements have gone down in the annals of mankind. The initiator of this unparalleled feat is Deng Xiaoping. The chief designer of this magnificent edifice of the socialist market economy with oriental national style is Deng Xiaoping. It can be said without the least exaggeration that without the initiative of Comrade Deng Xiaoping there would have been no world-shocking changes in China. Without the guidance by the brilliant banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics it would have been impossible for China's reform to have made great achievements that have attracted worldwide attention. At present, China's great cause of reform has entered the stage of storming fortified positions of overall structural change. The road ahead is tough, but the reform cannot stop here, much less should we fall back. If we do not make progress, we are falling back, and falling back "can only be on the road to ruin." Now the targets and direction are clear, the road is open, and the plan of decisive battle will soon be put into effect. Under the new situation it is absolutely necessary and timely to study systematically and seriously Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, especially the theory on socialist reform. It can be affirmed that should China depart in future reform from the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and should China deviate from the course pointed out by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist reform, it would be difficult to build up the system of a socialist market economy and reform would even be led onto a wrong path. The cause of China's socialist reform can only take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, especially Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist reform as the banner and the guiding principle, and should by no means take any other theory as guidance. The guiding position of this theory of Deng Xiaoping's is not artificially established, but is an inevitable selection by history. After the victory of the democratic revolution, the Chinese people and the CPC went through a difficult and tortuous course, and paid huge cost determining how to build socialism in a country like China, which was backward in economy, culture, science, and technology. Useful explorations were made, too. Early during the period of the democratic revolution, proceeding from China's national conditions, Comrade Mao Zedong creatively put forward the theory on a new democratic society. After the founding of the PRC, during the period of the restoration of the national economy, we put this theory into practice, rapidly restored the national economy destroyed by a protracted war, and smashed the imperialist economic blockade, and the people lived and worked in peace and contentment. It seems that if we should continue making explorations along this idea, the new democratic society would probably be a road leading to socialism which we would inevitably follow. However, by mid-1950's the pace of transition of new democracy was quickened, and it was replaced by socialism "large in size and collective in nature." Afterward, the Soviet Communist Party's criticism of Stalin impelled the CPC to think back on the economic management system and the road of industrialization. The Eighth CPC Congress and Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Ten Major Relations" challenged the Soviet model of socialism, and put forward the considerations of reforming the management system. It should be said that in the international communist movement, the CPC's consciousness of reform was fairly early. If China should continue forging ahead along the road of the Eighth CPC Congress, the system of a socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics might have stood erect in the East long ago. However, this valuable experiment that had just begun soon died out, the development of the productive forces was replaced by endless political movements and escalation of ownership, "take economic construction as the center" was replaced by "take class struggle as the key link," and the objectively existing market mechanism was replaced by the "official's will." The ten-year long turmoil that neither wanted culture nor was revolutionary pushed all the more this rigid leftist system to the extremes, and declared "exercising all-round dictatorship" over commodities, market, and currency without exception. Finally, it did great damage to the productive forces and the national economy was pushed to he brink of collapse. After this unprecedented calamity of self-destruction ended, the whole party and the entire Chinese people thought seriously: How has this catastrophe has happened? How can we prevent its repetition? China was again faced with the problem of re-selecting the socialist model: Where to go. To go in for "whatever" and continue maintaining the old system, line, and policies, or to "seek truth from facts, emancipate our minds," and continue exploring the socialist road by combining Marxist fundamental tenets with China's practical conditions? Precisely at this important moment that determined the future and destiny of the party and the state, Comrade Deng Xiaoping upheld the brilliant banner of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and sounded the advance of all-round reform. Comrade Deng Xiaoping correctly summed up the successful experiences, frustrations, and lessons of the CPC in exploring the road of building socialism, and drew the experiences and lessons of the rise and fall, success and failure of other socialist countries, and led the Chinese people in the great practices of reform and opening-up to achieve another historical leap by combining the Marxist fundamental tenets with China's practical conditions of socialist construction. It can be said that the theory he founded on building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the continuation and development of Comrade Mao Zedong's "On New Democracy" and "On Ten Major Relations" in the new period. The reform he initiated is the direct inheritance and development of the reform experiment that the CPC started carrying out in the mid-1950's and was later interrupted. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics has opened a new chapter in the history of Marxist development. The reform he initiated has ushered in a new epoch in the history of mankind. Various socialist countries originally carried out the administrative mandate-type planned economy system according to the Soviet model. This kind of system had considerable superiority in mobilizing and concentrating limited resources on key construction projects, but lacked life and vitality. Since the 1970's, many counties have embarked on the road of reform with the market as orientation. There is no precedent yet that these countries have achieved success in reform, but on the contrary most of them have been bogged down in the quagmire of economic, political, and social crisis, and the people have no means of livelihood. This "therapy" and that "plan" invented by those foreign advisers and "brain trusters" all vanish like soap bubbles, and have become bitter fruits which they can neither swallow nor spit out. The economy and culture of China are far more backward than those of these countries, China's national conditions are more complicated, and therefore the difficulty of reform cannot be compared by that in these countries. However, China's reform has made universally acknowledged achievements. From 1978 to 1992, China's GNP increased from 358.8 billion yuan to 2,400 billion yuan, total import and export amount increased from 20.6 billion dollars to 165.6 billion dollars, per capita income of the peasants increased from 132 yuan to 784 yuan, per capita income of city and town staff and workers increased from 382 yuan to 1,826 yuan, the savings balance of urban and rural residents increased from 21.1 billion yuan to 1,380 billion yuan, and the life of the people is transitioning from enough to eat and wear type to comparatively well-off type. In the world today, many countries are going through recession and crisis, and only China's economy has since reform maintained a momentum of powerful and high-speed growth. The reason lies precisely in: We uphold "thinking independently and taking our own road," firmly believe that "one can never achieve success by copying indiscriminately the experiences and the model of other countries," and persist in combining the Marxist fundamental tenets with China's concrete practices. We have forsaken the Eastern dogmatism, and have also guarded against the disruption by Western dogmas. We have always placed Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist reform in a position of guiding principle for reform. The practices of reform require learning from the successful experiences of other countries, and the theories of reform should assimilate the scientific composition of contemporary Western economics. But learning from and using for reference cannot substitute for one's own creation, much less can foreign books replace Marxism of New China and serve as the guiding principles for China's reform. China must carry out reform; if not, "it can only be the road to ruin." China's reform can only be guided by the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and whenever we run counter to or deviate from this theory, reform will go astray. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on China's socialist reform is a scientific system gradually built up and developed in the practices of China's reform. This scientific system is the outcome by combining the fundamental tenets of historical materialism and scientific socialism with China's practical conditions, and has also assimilated the scientific composition of contemporary Western economics. It has the characteristics of practices, inheritance, openness, systematics, science, and criticism. It is rich and profound in contents, and various components parts are interrelated and constitute a complete scientific system. Only by studying systematically Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping can we fully comprehend Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist reform. Take the important parts, for example: Concerning the theory that reform must first straighten out the ideological line, uphold "emancipating the mind, and seeking truth from facts," proceed from China's national conditions in everything, be bold in making explorations through practices, and forsake book worship of every description, and concerning the dialectical relations between reform and upholding the socialist road. On the one hand "we must never take the Western capitalist road" in reform, and "if China with one billion people should take the capitalist road, it would be a disaster to the world, and it is pulling history back." On the other hand, if we do not carry out reform, "it can only be the road to ruin" and "poverty is not socialism." Concerning the theory that reform is the road we must follow in emancipating and developing the productive forces. "After the establishment of the socialist basic system, it is still necessary to change fundamentally the economic system that fetters the development of the productive forces," and "reform also means liberating the productive forces. In the past, we only talked about developing the productive forces under the socialist condition, and did not talk about the fact that it was still necessary to liberate the productive forces through reform. It was incomplete. We should completely talk about both liberating and developing the productive forces." With regard to the nature of reform, "reform is China's second revolution," and "we look upon reform as a kind of revolution, of course not the kind of revolution like `the Cultural Revolution.'" But "the nature of reform, like that of the revolution in the past, is also to remove the obstacles that hinder the development of social productive forces." Concerning the essence of socialism, "the essence of socialism is to liberate the productive forces, develop the productive forces, eliminate exploitation, remove polarization, and finally achieve common prosperity." About the central task of the socialist stage, "the central task of the whole socialist historical stage is to develop the productive forces." "To go in for socialism, the central task is to develop the productive forces," and we must always take economic construction as the center. Concerning the socialist fundamental principles, "one principle is that public ownership constitutes the main body, and the other is common prosperity. These are the socialist fundamental principles we must uphold." Regarding the compatibility of socialism with the market economy, and the integration of planning with the market, "there is no fundamental contradiction between socialism and the market economy," and "it is not the essential difference between socialism and capitalism whether there is a bit more of planning or a bit more of the market. The planned economy is not equal to socialism, there is planning too under capitalism; the market economy is not equal to capitalism either, there is also the market under socialism. Both planning and the market are economic means." "Planning and the market that serve socialism are socialist; those that serve capitalism are capitalist." "Both planning and the market are methods, and can be made use of so long as they are advantageous to developing the productive forces." With regard to the relations between reform and development, "grasp the opportune moment, develop ourselves, and the key is to develop the economy," "only development is a tough argument," "as long as we talk about performance, about quality, and go in for export-oriented economy, there is nothing to be worried about," and "China should strive to enter a new stage in economic development after every few years. Of course, we should not encourage impractical high-speed, but should be realistic and pay attention to performance, and make stable and coordinated development." "The law of China's economic development may still be advancing wave upon wave, with a leap and jumping over a new stage after every few years." Regarding the building of material civilization and spiritual civilization, we should stick to paying attention to dual tactics, and both tactics should be tough: "We should oppose corruption in the whole process of reform and opening-up." Concerning the relations between economic reform and political reform, and the tasks of political reform: "Now for every step forward made in economic structural reform we deeply feel the necessity of political structural reform. Without political structural reform we cannot continue making progress in economic structural reform, which would obstruct the development of the productive forces." "The political structural reform includes first of all separating the functions of the party from those of the government, and solving the problem of how the party can be good at leadership. It also includes decentralization and simplification of the administrative structure". "The purposes of the political structural reform are: Always maintain the vitality of the party and the state; overcome bureaucracy, raise working efficiency; mobilize the initiatives of the basic levels, and those of the workers, peasant, and intellectuals," and "develop the socialist democracy." About expanding opening to the outside world, we uphold maintaining independence and keeping the initiative in our own hands and self- reliance; oppose hegemonism and power politics. Concerning the exposition that reform must be carried out under leadership and in an orderly manner, and that it is necessary to maintain stability and a stable social environment, "to go in for reform and opening- up, the key lies in stability," "China's overriding problem is stability, and without a stable environment, nothing can be achieved;" "for the reform to succeed, it must be carried out under leadership and in an orderly manner," and "the central authorities must have authority." About the criteria for examining reform, we should uphold taking whether or not the reform measures are favorable to developing the productive forces of the socialist society, enhancing the overall national strength of the socialist country, and raising the living standard of the people as the basic criteria for deciding which measures to use and their success and failure. Moreover, there are also expositions about rural and urban reforms. These interrelated aspects constitute the basic contents of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the socialist reform. This complete scientific system includes the theoretical basis and the guiding principle of China's reform, its nature and tasks, its strategy selection and measures for implementation, its external environment and conditions, and its target model and orientation. A red line that runs through this scientific system is to achieve through overall reform a linkage between the socialist basic system and the operational mechanism of the market economy, and to integrate the superiority of the socialist system with the basic role of the market economy in optimizing resources allocation, thereby pushing the productive forces to develop at a rate faster than that under the capitalist system, and achieving common prosperity among the people. The core of this scientific system is to re-select through the second revolution a socialist model that conforms with China's national conditions and meets the requirements of the productive forces. We should strive to study and put into practice Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the socialist reform, whether the whole system or a particular thesis, completely and not one-sidedly, objectively and not subjectively as one pleases, accurately and not quoting out of context, and profoundly and not superficially. Otherwise, it will not only do harm to the reputation of the theory itself, but will be more detrimental to the great cause of reform. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the socialist reform and the great practices of China's economic reform have evoked a profound revolution in the history of Marxist economic theories, and have written a brand new chapter in the Marxist socialist economics. The reform is intensifying, and practices are developing. This theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's will be constantly enriched and become more mature. With this theory as the basis, it will be possible for us to found the Marxist socialist political economics with Chinese characteristics. Only with this theory as guidance will it be possible for us to deal with Western economics correctly, assimilate its essence, reject its dross, and make use of it without letting ourselves degenerate into Western dogmatism. The Chinese people have performed a spectacular world-shocking drama on the stage of reform, and created a miracle that links socialism with the market economy. So long as we base ourselves on China's practical conditions, thoroughly study a great deal of difficult problems brought up in the practices of reform, and seriously sum up the experiences of reform, the Chinese economists will surely make their own contributions to mankind.
