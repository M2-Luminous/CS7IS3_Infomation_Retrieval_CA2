It was slow progress, said Chikvaidze, although nothing had been lost and hope remained for ending the logjam in Georgian-Abkhazian relations. He said Georgia wanted more integration with the Commonwealth of Independent States and would be working to achieve this. It needed more integration from primarily the economic point of view. And Georgia would still try to keep its policies for Russia and other Commonwealth republics in balance and working for good relations between its own and other nations. In Chikvaidze's view, economic cooperation between Georgia and Russia would expand. Expanded cooperation and subsequent economic growth could well lead to the exchange of Georgian coupons for Russian rubles, said Chikvaidze and cited the Belarussian experience in that field.
