"We are implementing contacts with the United States on matters relating to the supply of modern equipment to Russia," Russian Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak, who is in the United States, said in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "The situation is complicated by the continuing existence of eight Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] restrictions on deliveries of this kind of equipment." A paradoxical situation is emerging: although Cocom is due to formally go out of existence on 31 March of this year, the restrictions on trade in modern technology that it has introduced will remain in force. "Once again we would like to recall that discrimination in trade has," V. Bulgak said, "a negative affect on our relations." On the whole, the minister said, cooperation in the area of communications between the two countries is constantly expanding. The number of telephone channels through which our countries can communicate has grown from 80 to 670. As early as 1995 there will be 1,500 of them and in two years' time there will be 3,000. As regards the development of a communications system in Russia, the main aim, in the words of the minister, is to attract foreign capital. American capital investments in this province have amounted to $40 million over two years, while, last year alone, the total amount of Western investment in Russia's communications system reached $250 million. The question of what was hindering the growth of American investments was discussed at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown. "The main barriers on the road to a growth in investments are psychological ones," the Russian minister said. "And Cocom still has influence, too." If we take a look at the very near future, V. Bulgak continued, then once the appropriate digital communications networks are set up, Russians will have access to the "information superhighway" -- a high-speed international computer communications system. "Here we need to solve the so-called `50 by 50 problem,'" V. Bulgak said. "We're talking about setting up 50 new telephone stations and the laying of 50 thousand km of new networks. The project is estimated to take 10 years and it will cost $40 billion to carry it out."
