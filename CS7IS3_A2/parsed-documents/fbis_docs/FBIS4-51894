FBIS4-51894 "dreas086_l_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-086 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 Philippines Clergy Group Secedes NDF, Form New Group Clergy Group Secedes NDF, Form New Group BK0405045394 Manila PHILIPPINE DAILY INQUIRER in English 29 Apr 94 p 16 BK0405045394 Manila PHILIPPINE DAILY INQUIRER English BFN [By Jesse Torres Jr.] [Text] A large group from the underground Christians for National Liberation (CNL) bolted from the National Democratic Front (NDF) this week. The breakaway group composed of priests, pastors, nuns and seminarians from the National Capital Region (NCR) have also formed the Organisasyon ng mga Kristiyano para sa Sambayanan (OIKOS) [Organization of Christians for the People]. "We are tired of the endless debate," OIKOS secretary general, Reverend Librado Espiritu, told Philippine News and Features (PNF). "It hinders our work from moving on. We believe we have to make a new organization and redefine roles." In a statement issued at its founding congress, OIKOS blamed those loyal to exiled Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) leader Jose Maria Sison for destroying the CNL. OIKOS said "the free space of intelligent, sober and comradely debate (in the underground movement) has become a suffocating vacuum." The statement also said "the noble CNL of 1972 has become a subservient slave in 1994." Espiritu explained that OIKOS is not "another force" in the leftist split, but a "distinct group" that offers an alternative. OIKOS recognizes the history, tradition, heritage and action of the CNL, Espiritu said. OIKOS is Greek for household. It is the root word for economics, ecology and ecumenism. In its biblical meaning, it covers the whole inhabited world. One of the most influential NDF member-organizations, the CNL recently split into pro-Sison and anti-Sison factions. Last week, Reverend Felipe Patricio, CNL national chairperson joined other NDF officials who have "rejected' the leadership of NDF chief Manuel Romero and spokesperson Luis Jalandoni. Former priest Jalandoni was himself a former CNL member. Despite the break, OIKOS adopted several of CNL's "fundamental tasks" including armed revolution. The group said it will continue to build mass bases, and serve in communities. It will also continue to aim to "unite Christians in the revolutionary movement" and help in its advance. Felipe de San Jose, former secretary general of CNL in Metro Manila, said OIKOS will help broaden, the "united front" and mobilize support for the revolution "under the leadership of the proletariat, not necessarily the CPP." San Jose said OIKOS will engage in parliamentary struggle, stressing that this is not secondary to armed struggle. "We don't want to equate revolution with war. We launched a revolution to stop war and the causes of war," he told PNF. He said five OIKOS members were running in the 9 May barangay [village] elections. OIKOS believes in a "theology of wholeness," in contrast to the theologies of liberation and struggle popularly espoused by Christian activists, San Jose called this a balancing of faith and ideology. "What we are after" he said, "is the goal, the vision of a society where there is equality and fraternity," beyond the victory of the revolution. Meanwhile, CNL spokesperson Reverend Wesley Fiore denied last Monday the claim by former CNL chair Fr. Felipe Patricio that a "Sison faction" has drawn the CNL into the internal rift of the Communist Party. In a press statement to the INQUIRER, Fiore said Patricio can no longer speak for the organization since he was expelled from the organization by the CNL's national council last 20 April. Fiore said Patricio was expelled for "conduct unbecoming of a CNL chairperson and a comrade" after he was accused of contempt for the CNL constitution and inciting the membership for rebellion against the national leadership of the organization. "It was unfortunate that Father Patricio was too eager to `meet the press' to create the illusion that the CNL is for the estranged `NDF democratic bloc' of which, it turned out, he has long been a secret member," Fiore said. "The CNL respects the private persuasion of Fr. Patricio but denounces his attempts before media to deliver the organization to a political faction, well intentioned perhaps, but alien to the CNL's principles," Fiore said. The NDF, the umbrella organization of underground leftist organizations, has also been rocked with debates on political line and revolutionary strategy and tactics which has earlier resulted to a split between "reaffirmists" and "rejectionists" in the CPP.
