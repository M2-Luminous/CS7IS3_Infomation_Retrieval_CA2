It is equally hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel during Sino-British negotiations on the building of the Chek Lap Kok airport. The simple fact of the matter is that the airborne conveyance of passengers and cargo has become a political football. The Hong Kong Government is poised to make yet another offer to the Chinese government designed to quell its anxieties on the accumulation of public debt for the purpose of building the airport. Slamming billions of dollars down on the negotiating table in the hope of securing a deal, the government is effectively undermining all its original plans for the project. In 1989, when then Governor David Wilson announced the plan for the new airport, he solemnly assured the public it would be largely financed by the private sector and would be open for business in 1997. Now it is clear that the bulk of the funding will come from the public purse and it seems increasingly unlikely that a single aircraft will brush its wheels along the carefully levelled runway in 1997. Large scale private financing has been virtually ruled out by China's insistence that capital should be collected without the subsequent accumulation of debt. With no guarantee of Chinese support, raising funds in the private sector is near impossible. Steadily the Government has moved to satisfy China's demanding fiscal requirements, but to no avail. In desperation Governor Chris Patten cries out for "China to take yes for an answer" in responding to British offers on airport financing. However, Patten and everybody else knows that the Chinese government will not take yes for answer because it is asking a different question. Put bluntly, the airport is being held hostage to the wider political dispute about the extension of representative government in Hong Kong. Until that matter is settled it is highly unlikely that other matters of substance will come close to a settlement. Even though this is widely known by the British, Hong Kong and Chinese governments, they plunge merrily through the charade of pretending they are talking about the airport when it is obvious that they have a completely different agenda. In 1991 the British Prime Minister, John Major, dispatched his special envoy Sir Percy Cradock to hold secret talks in Beijing aimed at breaking the impasse. Sir Percy returned triumphant, at least this was his version of events. Clasping a scrap of paper called the Memorandum of Understanding, Britain and China declared that an agreement had been reached. Sir Percy, on Britain's behalf secured this so-called agreement by the simple expedient of saying yes to everything China asked for. Yet, today, it is palpably clear that the agreement was hardly worth the paper it was printed on. There can be no agreements on anything of substance while Sino-British relations remain at their current low point. It is a cruel deception to pretend otherwise. The duty of all governments concerned is to acknowledge this reality and decide how they should move forward without hypocrisy. In the case of the airport this means proceeding with the project on public funds until such a time that the general atmosphere in relations improves. If it does not and the drain on resources becomes too onerous, the Government will have to stop building and leave it to the incoming administration to complete the job. At any rate let's get a move on. The solution we suggest is far from satisfactory but much closer to reality than anything we have heard emanating from so-called Sino-British negotiations. The likelihood is that the airport will open after the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is established. The British may feel cheated that their biggest monument will not be blessed by the outgoing sovereign power, the Chinese may be rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect. For Hong Kong it does not matter who opens the wretched airport, be it in June 1997 or July, after the takeover. The important thing is that it opens soon.
