Some of the animals, from Poland, were declared unfit for human consumption after they were killed at an abattoir in Birmingham. They had all been allowed through German border checks. Ministers, MPs, vets and animal welfare groups are angry about the shipments at a time when the German Health Ministry wants the EC to impose fresh curbs on British beef due to fears over mad cow disease. Mr Robin Corbett, Labour MP for Birmingham, Erdington, will table questions about the diseased sheep in the Commons tomorrow. The EC council of health ministers will meet in Brussels on March 30 to consider German demands for new EC restrictions on British beef despite scientific opinion that it is safe to eat. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the Minister of Agriculture, has told Mr Rene Steichen, the EC Farm Commissioner, that the German move could cause enormous harm to all beef producers in the EC if it destroyed consumers' confidence in beef. She has already indicated that Britain may claim compensation from Germany if it imposes a unilateral ban on British beef. Mr Keith Meldrum, the Government's chief veterinary officer, said yesterday: "I don't want to get into a tit-for-tat row. But some of the imported sheep were in such a poor way when they arrived at Dover that they should not have been allowed to start the journey from Poland. "Obviously we will be urging Germany and other EC countries to look again at their checking procedures to prevent further incidents of this kind." Mr Meldrum said that in one case a ewe gave birth when it arrived at the abattoir. But both it and the lamb were in such poor condition that they were slaughtered anyway. It is an offence under EC and British law to transport pregnant ewes for slaughter for food. British anger centers on four lorryloads, each of about 300 sheep, sent to Birmingham between Feb 17 and last week. Three came from Poland and one from Spain. Sheep in both the Polish and Spanish consignments were found to be diseased. Some of the Polish sheep, ageing ewes of between four and five years old, were found to be suffering from Caseous Lymphadenitis. This highly unpleasant disease results in internal abscesses, which could cause heavy losses among British flocks. The meat from these animals was condemned. The sheep were part of a growing trade in old ewes, shipped to Britain to provide cut price mutton for ethnic minorities. It sells for about a quarter of the price of meat from British sheep. The sheep are killed with a knife without pre-stunning under an exemption enjoyed by Muslims and Jews.
