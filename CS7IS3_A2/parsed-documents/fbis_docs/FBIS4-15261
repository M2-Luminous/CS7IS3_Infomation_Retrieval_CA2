Interestingly, the share of products intended for export amounted to as little as 5.2 percent of the arms manufactured. This was announced by Viktor Glukhikh, chairman of the Russian State Committee on the Defense Industry. He admitted that the number of arms importing countries had fallen to 26, that is to half of what it was at the time of the former USSR in 1990. Importantly, Russia has virtually lost an arms market in the Baltics, where arms now come from Israel. According to him, Moldavia [Moldova] is increasingly orienting itself in its imports policy toward Romania, while arms suppliers in China, Iran, and Turkey are actively working in the newly formed states of Central Asia. Still, Glukhikh thinks that the CIS market should be a priority for Russia. There is a considerable quantity of weapons there created on the basis of the former Soviet standards and arms systems which are being produced in Russia. To boost arms exports, the head of the State Committee on the Defense Industry thinks, one should arrange for supplies of spare parts for military hardware, servicing, repairs, and modernization of armaments delivered. These problems will be tackled as a package by the recently created "Rosvooruzheniye" state company.
