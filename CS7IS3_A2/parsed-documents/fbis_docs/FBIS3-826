Addressing a farm workers forum in the Senekal District on Sunday, Mr Lekota said an ANC government intended buying farms that were being put up for sale. These will in turn be resold to aspirant trained black farmers. He said these farmers would be assisted with equipment and implements. Mr Lekota said an ANC government would allow farmworkers to form and belong to labour movements. He said farmworkers would not have to work longer than 40-hours a week.
