Industry insiders say that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has received orders for five 300,000-ton very large crude carriers (VLCC) from Saudi Arabia's state-run oil company. Many shipbuilders around the world had competed for the Saudi Arabian VLCC fleet contract since it was announced in late 1991. In 1991, when the world shipbuilding market was booming, a VLCC was priced at 115 million U.S. dollars, but Mitsubishi cut its price to below 90 million dollars. The orders for five VLCCs, totaling 1.5 million tons, alone represent one-fourth of the 6.5 million tons of orders placed with Japanese shipbuilders in all of last year. Kawasaki Heavy Industries and other Japanese yards have received enough orders in the last month or two to keep them busy all year thanks to their stepped-up promotional programs and the yen's decline against the dollar. The sources say Korean shipbuilders, who enjoyed a sharp price edge over their Japanese rivals on the rising yen last year, must now cut their prices to compete with the technologically-advanced Japanese yards as the yen is now falling. Encouraged by their boom last year, Hyundai Heavy Industries and Samsung Heavy Industries are planning to expand their dockyards for building VLCCs, and this is feared to put domestic shipbuilders in cut-throat competition for the world VLCC market of about 20 vessels a year.
