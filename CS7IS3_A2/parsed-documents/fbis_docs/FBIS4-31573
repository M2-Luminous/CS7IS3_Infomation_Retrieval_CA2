How can one make politics with such a straitjacket around one's head? [Horn] To formulate what you said more precisely, let me say that I had the accident at the end of the election campaign, but it did not affect our election opportunities, and I am continuing my work with undiminished intensity. We are very busy and are now continuing our coalition talks with the Free Democrats. [Hochner] For a Western European party it would be unusual to win the absolute majority and then insist on a coalition partner. Do you want a coalition partner because you do not want to bear responsibility alone for the possibly tough economic measures that Hungary may have to face? [Horn] Perhaps this plays a certain role, but what is most important is the fact that Hungary needs a broad national basis and national consensus. We must put an end to the past practice of political parties attacking one another, instead of assuming joint responsibility for the country's difficult situation. We are convinced that we should form a coalition with the Free Democrats, and we hope that such a coalition will come about. This may mean that an entirely new relationship between the parties will develop. In 1989, the Hungarian Socialists and Free Democrats were virtually enemies, and now we have a chance to form a coalition. This is very important, has a symbolic significance, requires essential political activities, and may be a signal for other Central Eastern European countries. [Hochner] Are you planning to pursue a radically Western economic policy, as has been represented by Czech Prime Minister Klaus and was practiced in Poland for a long time, or will you try to pursue a central course to keep the sacrifices of the people, above all the lower social classes, within bounds? [Horn] Look, there are no worn-out roads, neither for the Czech Republic, nor for Hungary, nor for any other country. Here in Austria, the system developed over the centuries, whereas we must tear down the former system within a very short time. This is an unprecedented effort. Privatization in Central Eastern Europe is unprecedented in world history. We will, of course, follow the Western example. We would like to reach the status reached by Austria or the other Western European countries. However, we will pursue specific policies, and in so doing, we must consider the people's capacity for tolerance. We must not allow the transformation and democratic development to take place in such a way that the people's living standard continuously deteriorates. A line must be drawn somewhere, and I think the program of the Socialists, which can be coordinated relatively easily with the program of the Free Democrats, promises this, and most voters believe in our program. [Hochner] Your party is the successor party to the Hungarian Communists; it reconstituted itself. Aren't there in your party also representatives of the trade union wing, for instance, who would rather opt for a concept from the past and would perhaps prefer to return to the planned economy? [Horn] I do not know any politician in Hungary who was born after the spring of 1990. Somehow every politician was involved with the former system, including the opposition and the trade unions. But the trade union leaders, the whole trade union movement, underwent a transformation, and trade unions in Hungary today, including the large trade union federation with which we have an alliance, correspond to their Western European counterparts. The influence of the trade unions was represented only in a small segment of parliament. I do not think a government can be successful without having concluded a social partnership, a partnership with the representatives of employers and employees. If such a consensus does not come about on all problems of social policy, Hungary will face many social explosions. It is an existential problem for us to achieve consensus not only with trade unions but also with employers. [Hochner] In Austria, there is currently much talk about its possible EU [European Union] membership. In your view, when will Hungary be a member of the EU -- irrespective of the outcome of the referendum here? [Horn] First of all, I would like to say that I envy the Austrians. I envy them for several reasons, but above all because they can already vote this Sunday [12 June] on whether or not they want to become EU members. I wish Hungary were in this situation. I am convinced that Europe is facing specific challenges, and Europe is advancing on the road to integration, and those who stay outside and do not take part will be disadvantaged. As for Hungary, I am convinced that, if these four countries become EU members in 1995, we may realistically assume that we can start talks with Brussels on membership of the Central Eastern European countries, the so-called Visegrad states, early in 1997. Regrettably, we cannot expect membership before the end of this century, or this millennium. I would like to accelerate it, and if we could exchange some Austrian problems for our problems, we would readily take over your problems in exchange for our problems. But what is important is that we are both heading for a united Europe.
