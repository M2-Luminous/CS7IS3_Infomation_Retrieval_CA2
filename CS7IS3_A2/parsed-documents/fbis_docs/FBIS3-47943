The vote by the full house is widely seen as make or break for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's five-month-old coalition government. In a stand-up vote, the upper chamber's 35-member Special Committee on Political Reform approved the package of four bills, on which Hosokawa has staked his job, by 18 votes to 16. Committee Chairman Yubun Ueno declared, "I recognize the fact that a majority of committee members voted for the bills" soon after a rebel member of the No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Tomoichi Hoshino, surprised fellow LDP members by voting with the government. Hoshino's rebellion against the LDP party line was apparently totally unexpected, and television coverage showed vexed LDP panelists looking around to see what had happened or pointing accusing fingers at him. Hoshino said after the vote that he is quitting the LDP, which was ousted last August after 38 years in power. It remains unclear, however, whether the coalition can secure passage of the bills by a full session of the upper chamber in view of dissent among some legislators in its biggest party, the Social Democratic Party [of Japan]. The coalition, which hopes to have the vote by the full house on Friday, has a slim majority with a combined force of 131, compared with the opposition's 115. It needs 126 votes to be sure of winning. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Hosokawa's chief spokesman, said the government welcomes the panel's vote. He suggested at a news conference that the government is ready to accept further bargaining with the LDP to prevent it from voting against the package in the full chamber. At the outset of the panel session, a coalition legislator tabled a motion to dispense with a question-and-answer session. Ueno immediately put the motion to a stand-up vote. After the vote was tied at 17 to 17, Ueno used his casting vote to pass the motion. Kazuyoshi Shirahama, a legislator from Komeito, a key coalition party, then told the panel, "Now that a total of 60 days have elapsed since the package was forwarded to the upper chamber, it is high time for us to put this historic reform package to a vote." LDP Legislator Noriyuki Sekine warned, "If we pass it with only a slim majority, this legislation to completely redesign the mechanism of the electoral system that is the centerpiece of parliamentary democracy would disseminate causes for future problems in Japanese society." Haruko Yoshikawa of the Japanese Communist Party also expressed opposition to the bills. "The fact that the coalition nixed a motion seeking witnesses to be called to elucidate suspicions over payoff scandals involving general contractors as well as the scandal over Prime Minister Hosokawa's acceptance of 100 million yen from the Sagawa Kyubin Trucking Firm, shows it is not serious about stamping out money-dominated politics," she said. Yukio Aoshima of the small Niin Club said, "Although the real wish of the public is to rid Japan of political corruption, such as payoff scandals involving contractors, the coalition sidetracked this crucial issue by falsely arguing that altering the electoral system could clear up corruption." The committee vote came after eleventh-hour talks Wednesday between the coalition and LDP failed to achieve a compromise over LDP demands to modify the bills. The package calls for drastically redesigning the mechanism for electing members of the powerful House of Representatives of Japan's two-chamber Diet. It calls for the members to be elected through a mixture of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, in place of the current multiseat constituencies, as well as unifying politicians' various funds-raising channels into the coffers of political parties. The package cleared the lower chamber on November 18.
