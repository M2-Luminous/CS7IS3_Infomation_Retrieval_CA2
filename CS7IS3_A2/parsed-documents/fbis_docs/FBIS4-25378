The core of the "No 1 Light Industry type" activation created by them is to reform the old land-use system, tap the tremendous potential in existing land assets, and make use of different rents to accumulate a large fund for activation. We can say that it is precisely by grasping this "golden key" of land that the reforms have been smoothly activated and carried out. This move has enabled people to fully understand the position and role of the reform of the land-use system in the entire reform of the economic structure and in economic development, and thus has opened up a new path for deepening the reforms and for faster development of the national economy and opening wider to the outside world. The successful experience of the Beijing No 1 General Light Industry Company has at least enlightened us in two things concerning the land-use system. The first thing is: Reform of the land-use system can effectively promote the transformation of large and medium-sized state enterprises. There have been many causes why large and medium-sized state enterprises have not been enlivened over a long period, but the main one is a shortage of funds. For a long time, state enterprises have had an excessive burden and have suffered losses in operation. They have been unable to provide funds for readjustment and transformation of the product mix and production setup. This has given rise to a vicious circle. Besides, quite a lot of state enterprises are located in golden areas of cities. Following deepening of reform of the land-use system, their land assets have attracted the attention of more and more people. The practice of the No 1 General Light Industry Company has widened the train of thought on making use of the "differential rent" of land to transform old enterprises. That is: They have pushed toward the market according to law land-use rights originally given them by the administration so that benefits obtained from land assets are revealed, and this has enabled enterprises to obtain valuable funds for activation and has provided motivation for further transformation of large and medium-sized state enterprises. The second thing is: The experience of the No 1 General Light Industry Company has provided an effective way to deepen the reform of the system of allocating and using land in stock. The nationwide reform of the land-use system which began in 1987 has fundamentally changed the system of allocating land by the administration without demanding compensation, without time limits, and without the right to transfer. The system of the transfer of land-use rights has been instituted, and a land market has been established. The advantages of such reform is shown in three aspects: Promoting rational use of land and optimizing land disposal; ensuring the realization of state revenue from land assets; and improving the investment environment. However, this reform has progressed faster and has obtained more apparent results in newly increased land for construction. Regarding the issue of entry into the market of land in stock originally allocated for use by the administration, although ways to overcome transfer formalities and charges for transfer have been worked out, not much progress has been made and enterprises are not very enthusiastic about them because of reasons including the lack of sufficient funds. This has affected the process of the entire reform of the land-use system. What is valuable in the experience of the No 1 General Light Industry Company lies in enlivening, by means of shares controlled by the state, land assets allocated by the administration, strengthening enterprises' enthusiasm about pushing onto the market land originally used by them, thereby, providing an effective way to deepen reform of the land-use system and perfect the development of the land market. From the comprehensive and coordinated reforms of the No 1 General Light Industry Company, we can draw the conclusion that with the establishment of a modern enterprise system, enlivening and strengthening management of land assets are the requirements of enlivening large and medium-sized state enterprises and are also the needs of deepening reform of the land-use system. We must start studying how to solve the problem of land assets management in the course of establishment of a modern enterprise system so that land assets can serve the entire economic construction, reform, and opening up. At present, various localities have started at selected points to carry out experiments on reorganizing state enterprises to make full use of state land assets in stock, and they have played an important role in promoting reorganization of state enterprises and in enlivening their assets. On the whole, the situation is good. However, problems such as unclear land property rights relationships, conversion of land assets into shares at low prices, sales of land assets at low prices, the transfer of land assets to individuals even without compensation or time limits, and so on, have also emerged in some localities in the course of reorganizing state enterprises. If these problems are not solved in good time, they will inevitably lead to losses, or losses in disguise, of state land assets in large quantities and will do harm to the establishment of a modern enterprise system. We must pay great attention to the above problems and seriously and earnestly adopt measures to solve them. Generally speaking, in the course of the establishment of a modern enterprise system, we must uphold the following principles in the disposal and management of land assets: The first is to ensure the maintenance and increase in value of state land assets and to prevent losses, or losses in disguise, of state assets. The second is to promote the reorganization and enlivening of assets of enterprises selected for carrying out experiments. The third is to ensure that the redisposal of state land assets of enterprises is in line with existing land laws and regulations and with the direction of development of reform of the land-use system. To be specific, in the establishment of a modern enterprise system, we should properly carry out work in three aspects in land asset management: 1. Clarify property rights and strengthen property rights management. To establish a land asset management system which meets the needs of a modern enterprise system, we should first of all fix land-use rights of enterprises and as soon as possible complete registration and issuance of certificates of land-use rights. Enterprises which already have certificates to use state land should have, when they are reorganized in accordance with the requirements of a modern enterprise system, the situation of using land in the original enterprises rechecked in accordance with the requirements of the registration on changes in land and have changes in land registered in accordance with changes in the use of land. 2. Properly carry out land appraisal and fix the quantity of land assets of enterprises. As reflected by the experience of the No 1 General Light Industry Company, land appraisal is the only means to correctly reflect the quantity of land assets of enterprises. Therefore, in accordance with the needs of developing the land market and the establishment of a modern enterprise system, we should energetically carry out the appraisal of base and benchmark land prices. The work of land appraisal should be carried out by land appraisal organs which have independent legal person status and can undertake civil responsibility. In appraising land assets, we should put forward a scientific and comprehensive appraisal report. Land appraisal results can be used as the basis for disposal and conversion into shares of land assets after they have been examined and confirmed by land management departments and reported to state assets management departments for the record. This can prevent the conversion or sale of land assets at low prices which will lead to the losses, or losses in disguise, of state land assets in large quantities. 3. Dispose land assets according to law and straighten out the relationship of distribution of benefits from land between the state and enterprises. In the course of establishment of a modern enterprise system, there are three ways to dispose of land assets: The first is for enterprises to handle transfer formalities and payment for the transfer of land-use rights. In this way, enterprises will have the land-use rights for a certain period of years and land assets will become assets of legal persons of enterprises. The second is for the state to use payment for the transfer of land-use rights as funds for obtaining shares, and these shares will be managed by units or departments authorized by the state. The third is for the state to provide land-use rights for reorganized enterprises in the form leases and to collect annual land rents. No matter which form reorganized enterprises may adopt, the relationship of benefits from land assets between the state and enterprises must be clearly defined. Firstly, state land assets should not be underappraised in any way. Secondly, out of consideration of enterprises' ability to bear and the needs of enlivening large and medium-sized state enterprises, payment of benefits obtained from land assets can be delayed or reduced, and enterprises may carry out operations while incurring debts, but the situation must be shown in accounts. We must also ensure by effective means that enterprises will hand over to the state the original value together with the added value of land assets after they have improved the conditions of operation. It is learned that in the near future, the No 1 General Light Industry Company will be able to attain goal of handing over benefits obtained from state assets to the state. In short, comprehensive and coordinated reforms carried out by the Beijing No 1 General Light Industry Company have enlightened the people in many aspects. As representatives and managers for owners of state land assets, land management departments should emancipate their minds, carry out in-depth studies, energetically support reform, seriously sum up good experience and means of various localities, standardize and improve such experience and means in a bid to enliven land assets and deepen reform of the land-use system, and make greater contribution to the establishment of a modern enterprise system and to the development of the national economy.
