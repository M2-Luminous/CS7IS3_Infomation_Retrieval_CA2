This is the specific arrangement made at the telephone conference sponsored by the provincial level departments concerned on 26 May. It was pointed out at the conference that since the issuance and enforcement of the "statistics law" in 1983 and the "province's regulations on statistical inspection and supervision" in 1992, localities across the province have gradually oriented statistical work onto the track of legal systems thanks to earnestly implementing the "statistical law" and the "statistical regulations". However, specific localities and departments as well as some units and individuals have got blunted in their sense of statistical legal systems and not earnestly implemented the "statistical law". By paying no attention to the state statistical law, some of them have employed trickery on the statistical work in order to seek through fraud and deception the political honor and economic interest of their own small communities. They have also done as they pleases in making false statistical reports and falsifying the statistical data. All of these have seriously affected the state in making its policy decisions and conducting its management in this regard in a scientific way and brought about grave harmf to the society. For this reason, the province has decided to carry out mass inspection over the enforcement of the statistical law from early June this year. The mass inspection is aimed at all investigation units across the province, which are organizing the statistical investigation, and at all units (state apparatus, social communities, and enterprises and establishments in various economic sectors) that ought to accept the investigation and are obligated to provide their statistical data. It also chiefly aimed at the following unlawful practices cropping up in the statistical activities over the past few years and particularly since 1993: 1. The statistical reports have been falsified and the statistical data have been forged or distorted. 2. The statistical organs and personnel have been forced or incited to employ trickery in their statistical data. 3. The statistical personnel who have upheld the principles of making statistical reports according to the facts and informing against or exposing the unlawful practices in this regard have been retaliated against. 4. Units have refused to make their statistical report or repeatedly delayed their reports. 5. Units have caused losses and harmful influence by publishing or providing their statistical data arbitrarily and by letting out the state secret. 6. Units have conducted at will the dismantlement and merger of statistical organs or weakened the strength of statistical affairs. 7. Units have obstructed the investigation and handling conducted by the supervisory and statistical departments for the violation cases. The focal point of the mass inspection will be placed on the unlawful practices of employing statistical trickery in the fields of industrial output value, particularly the output value of township enterprises, population, grain output and storage, per peasant net income, investments made in fixed assets, and price index. All of these have drawn a greater complaint from various social circles. In order to successfully carry out the mass inspection Zhang Chengyi, assistant to the governor, urged various administrative offices and the party committee of various cities and counties to establish a specialized leading group or working body to investigate and handle the violation cases in this regard by taking a clear-cut stand. They should resolutely investigate through to the end and in line with the law the units and individuals who have employed trickery in the important statistical data in order to seek through fraud and deception their own political honor and economic interest and their own small communities interests, as well as units and individuals who have retaliated with the activities of fraud and deception. By no means should they wink at or tolerate these units and individuals. He also urged various localities to integrate the mass inspection with the education on popularizing the law, with the basic construction of statistical work, and with the investigation and handling of violation cases. The mass inspection will conclude at the end of August this year.
