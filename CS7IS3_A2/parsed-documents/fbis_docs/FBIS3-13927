Defense establishment sources now say that the Syrians are directly connected to yesterday's attack in which two Nahal Brigade soldiers were killed. Our military correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda reports: [Begin recording] [Ben-Yehuda] There is a direct link between the Syrians and the Iranians on the one hand and yesterday's events and the Hizballah attacks on the other Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur stated today. Both countries support Hizballah and have some sort of hidden competition going on between them as to who will extend it more support in weapons and other areas. [Gur] There is no doubt whatsoever that there is a direct link between the Syrians and Hizballah. We have had countless evidence that if the Syrians wish it, Hizballah will hold its fire. One cannot say they are the sole influence on Hizballah since the Iranians also have a say there, but there is no question that the Syrians have a great deal of influence over Hizballah's actions. [Ben-Yehuda] Hizballah has been showing signs of having regained its strength since Operation Accountability. Deputy Minister Gur said Hizballah has improved its method of operation and has recently acquired sophisticated weapons. [Gur] Hizballah's ability is quite considerable. In the past year it acquired modern and sophisticated weapons. It has also adopted a more sophisticated method of operation. Therefore, its ability to operate can not be dismissed. This necessitates us being constantly on alert and thinking of ways to overcome these new factors. [Ben-Yehuda] Gur was visiting Eti Kohen, the woman wounded in yesterday's terrorist attack near the settlement of 'Ateret. He added that it is not yet clear what additional waves of terror are to be expected in the wake of the massacre in Hebron. He went on to say that there are currently large numbers of troops in the field and that the security forces have been adopting numerous and diverse measures to guarantee maximum security.
