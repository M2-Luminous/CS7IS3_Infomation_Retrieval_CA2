The number of deputy heads of government has been cut from eight to five. In his first weeks in office new Prime Minister Abdudzhalil Samadov appealed to his countrymen to "submit constructive proposals" on improving the operation of the national economy, at the same time apologizing that he cannot respond to each letter from citizens. The new prime minister's concern is understandable: The economy has been brought to a critical point. Since last October, Uzbeksgaztrans has reduced gas deliveries to Tajikistan by 70 percent, and in particular the Dushanbe thermal power station has had to operate at only 30 percent of capacity. As a result, trees began to be cut in Dushanbe in late fall, just like in Yerevan some time in the past. As the economic crisis mounted, the flow of Russian-speakers from the country increased. And although the Tajik press still writes that the cause is the language law adopted a few years ago, in fact the true reason lies in increased confrontation by armed groupings inside the "winners'" camp. The uncontrolled movement of arms; more than a thousand criminals at large, released by People's Front gunmen from the Kurgan Tyube prison in summer 1992; and finally, the makeup of the Internal Affairs Ministry, including officers with a criminal record -- these are the reasons which will hardly be conducive to improving the situation. And although writing in VECHERNIY DUSHANBE, city prosecutor Salomiddin Sharopov suggested that crime has fallen, he could not hide the fact that the number of serious offenses in Dushanbe has increased by 19.3 percent, including murders, 2.2 times, and robberies, by 31.9 percent. Nonetheless, the Supreme Soviet Presidium decided not to dismiss power ministry chiefs for failing their duties, but quite the contrary upgraded the level of the state security committee to a ministry. It seems that this will have only marginal effect because the political and economic crisis will hardly allow the law enforcement bodies, "diluted" with former racketeers, to make the population more secure. Tajik security officers more or less show their worth only on the border, but even then with heavy losses.
