The majority in the executive committee accuses the Munich lawyer of having violated the statutes, resolutions of the Federal Executive Committee, and principles of the party. "On his own authority," Schuenemann pursued the founding of an Instead Party in Saarland and did not check the infiltration of former Republikaner into the organization, Deputy Chairman Mike Bashford stated in Hamburg on Wednesday [18 May]. The decision to take such massive action against the chairman, who was only elected at the end of March, was made by six of the 11 executive committee members on Tuesday evening. [passage omitted]
