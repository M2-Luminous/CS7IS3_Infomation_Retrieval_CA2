Russia has already hit one such reef. The impact was quite painful. The decision to resume the delivery of Russian gas to Kiev would have been made even had the recent negotiations in Moscow between a government delegation from Ukraine and the Gazprom management not resulted in any specific agreements. The Russian side did not have any other way out of this situation. There are a few reasons for that. An export product pipeline to the West runs through Ukrainian territory. As soon as the Russian side reduced the delivery of fuel to Ukrainian customers, the latter began to use "gray" exports more vigorously. Besides, being aware that theft cannot go on for a long time, they pumped so much fuel into gas storage facilities, just in case, that it will suffice for the entire spring and summer period and more. The largest German consumer of Russian gas, the Ruhrgas AG concern, warned as if in passing, at the beginning of the Ukrainian-Russian "gas war," that Ukraine may tap into export flows and begin to take export gas for its consumers. For this reason, Ruhrgas AG has taken measures to offset possible losses due to reduced gas deliveries to German consumers. This statement came in as the first alarm call for Gazprom. In general, Kiev displayed enviable composure when faced with the "cut off the gas to Ukraine" situation. The president of Ukraine, who was paying an official visit to the United States, declared that suspension of deliveries of Russian gas would not only bring about the complete stoppage of Ukrainian industry but would also seriously complicate the execution of agreements on the removal of strategic missiles to Russia. It was no accident at all that the moment at which Moscow chose to reduce deliveries of gas to Ukraine coincided in time with Mr. Kravchuk's visit to Washington. The Russian side, which cannot get the upper hand in the conflict with the obstinate Ukrainians, would want to internationalize the conflict in the hope that the world community would influence Ukraine and force it to make concessions. However, no official response to this action of Russia followed in the United States. It was rather the other way around. It was quite symptomatic that Washington allocated Mr. Kravchuk $350 million in credit, despite the fact that Kiev has long had the poor reputation of a deadbeat defaulter. In diplomatic parlance, this is called moral support. There is no state program for development of the fuel and energy complex in Ukraine. Why? Because it does not fit the arrangement whereby the International Monetary Fund extends $1.5 billion in credit to Ukraine. On the eve of Kravchuk's overseas visit, American newspapers quoted a high-ranking Western diplomat: "They (meaning the leadership of Ukraine) have been told specifically that assistance should not be given to state enterprises that are going under." Another quote: "The Government of Ukraine has acknowledged that it has sharply increased financial assistance to state enterprises; this may become an obstacle in the path of the extension of Western loans which Ukraine badly needs." According to some projections by American special services, "the recession in Ukraine amplified by regional confrontation may bring about civil war and disintegration of the republic." A vicious circle emerges. If the economy of Ukraine falls into the abyss--and in the absence of foreign credit and investment it definitely will--the situation will be in line with the scenario of the American special services. If the Ukrainian leadership does not finance state enterprises, stagnation in industry is unavoidable, which will be followed by a social explosion and possibly civil war. Does Russia need a civil war on the territory of an immediate neighbor, which on top of this has nuclear weapons? It is known that decisions to suspend delivery of energy resources are always political. Therefore, Gazprom could not have made it independently, without supreme sanction. The reconnaissance in force indicated that the suspension of gas deliveries to Ukraine promises Russia nothing but a headache. The Moscow agreements, which were hastily concluded (literally a few days after making the decision to reduce deliveries), may, if they are honored by the Ukrainian side, encourage certain hopes for stability in the form of joint ownership of underground storage facilities and main gas pipelines on the territory of Ukraine. (This occurred in Estonia, where Gazprom owns 30 percent of Estgaz.) Besides, the so-called Turkmen scenario has also been activated (an analog to the expected agreement between Kiev and Ashkhabad [Ashgabat]) whereby Ukrainian debts will be paid by counterdeliveries of merchandise and equipment, including for main gas pipelines. However, Gazprom, which should become the owner of at least one-half of the property of enterprises converted to joint-stock operations, may be bitterly disappointed because foreign property in Ukraine is not protected by legislation. This is why the chief of the Russian Gazprom, Rem Vyakhirev, admitted after the negotiations that these agreements are not all that advantageous for Ukraine. Despite the fact that Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Landik stated peremptorily that come April all consumers of Russian gas will switch to prepayments, the temptation to go on stealing is too great. After all, it has reached the point where managers at many enterprises have denied access to their compounds to Ukrgazprom representatives who were supposed to disconnect hundreds of nonpayers from the gas distribution network. This whole Russian-Ukrainian "gas war" also has an "Asian front," or more precisely, a Turkestan front, which for some reason is not mentioned. After all, Turkmenia [Turkmenistan], which failed to receive $844 million for gas delivered to Ukraine, does not wish to resume deliveries for now. The economic aspect of this decision is clear, but a political aspect also exists. It appears that the confidence of the Turkmenbashi [Leader of the Turkmen] in transforming his republic into the first economic tiger of Central Asia has begun to diminish, although the official propaganda of Ashkhabad continues to instill in citizens the notion of the prompt prosperity of the land. However, miracles do not happen. A look at the yardstick of the currency market of Turkmenia would suffice to ascertain this. The real ratio of the manat to the Russian ruble is as follows: At the bazaar, 1 manat may be purchased for 45-50 rubles, which is several dozen times less than the officially established rate. For this reason they will be forced sooner or later to agree to painful measures aimed at cutting back budgetary expenditures there. The Turkmenbashi, as the father of the nation for at least the next decade, will have to explain to his subjects why his government is forced to resort to unpopular measures while carefully avoiding the combination of words "shock treatment." The insolvency of Ukraine may be one of the central arguments in such an explanation. Since the "Turkestan front" is located in the southern backyard of Russia, the latter has resolved to close it down. According to some data, the AvtoVAZ [Volga Automotive Plant] (?!), which is experiencing great financial difficulties itself, is buying the Ukrainian fuel debt from Turkmenia. While they are going through the motions, the Russian Gazprom undertook to make up 80 percent of the loss to Ukraine from the shortfall in the delivery of Turkmen gas out of its own resources. We will not have to wait long for a new turn of events: The deadlines for the payment by Ukraine of the financial segment of the debt, which was coordinated in the classified part of the protocol of the Moscow meeting, must be determined in April. In any event, at present Russia is doomed to deliver gas to its nearest Slavic neighbor and suffer financial losses in the process if it does not want to pay for a civil war in Ukraine tomorrow. Such are the disturbing lessons of the post-Soviet political economy.
