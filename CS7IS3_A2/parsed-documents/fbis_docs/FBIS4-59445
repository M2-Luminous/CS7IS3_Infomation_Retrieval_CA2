FBIS4-59445 "drnes093_j_94018" FBIS-NES-94-093 Daily Report 12 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Wrapup of Reports on Battles, Casualties Wrapup of Reports on Battles, Casualties Defense Ministry Comments JN1205201594 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1900 GMT 12 May 94 JN1205201594 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Statement issued by "responsible military source" at the Defense Ministry in Sanaa on 12 May] [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful: The heroes of our Armed Forces, with support and success from God, continue to fulfill their valiant missions in the battles of confrontation against the forces of rebellion and secession on all axes and sectors, inflicting on the deceived forces, which are [word indistinct] paid by the secessionist and criminal elements in the Socialist Party leadership, heavy losses on all axes and sectors. On the al-Tali'-al-'Anad sector, the valiant Armed Forces -- supported by the honorable citizens in al-Dali' who stood on the side of unity, democracy, and Constitutional legitimacy -- managed to cleanse the various pockets in al-Dali' district in general. The center of the district, the city of al-Dali', was returned to Constitutional legitimacy. The remaining soldiers, NCO's, and officers from the 'Abbud Brigade surrendered to the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. Quantities of weapons, ammunition, and military equipment, stored in the military pockets in this [word indistinct], were seized. Our Armed Forces on the southwestern axis, al-'Anad-(?al-Hayla) sector, managed to engage with the forces opposing Constitutional legitimacy in parts of the al-'Anad Camp fortifications, inflicting heavy losses on various equipment and weapons. Our forces on that axis, which were deployed in (?Kharad), were able to rearrange their situation to prepare for continuing their combat missions. On the Abyan-Aden axis, our valiant Armed Forces were able to counter the hostile offensives and inflicted heavy losses on the troops of the secessionist and rebellious forces, forcing them to retreat in defeat. On that axis, our forces seized a number of T-62 tanks. The air defense heroes also downed a combat aircraft. With a courageous confrontation and high vigilance, the Armed Forces foiled the futile encircling attempt by units from Taysir Brigade and what remained of the al-Wahdah Brigade and the 30th Brigade. Our valiant Armed Forces destroyed and seized 21 T-55 tanks, four BMP armored vehicle, three (?Shilfa) vehicles, three 14.5 (?systems), two BMP-21 vehicles, and 18 trucks. Our Air Force also carried out successful air raids against the formations of Taysir Brigade and inflicted heavy losses on it. Our Air Force also carried out air raids against 'Ataq airport, Shabwah Governorate. Our planes returned safely to base. In general, fatigue is overwhelming all units of the troops loyal to the secessionist and criminal elements in the Socialist Party. This is apparent in their suicidal, destructive acts which cannot be justified by any sound military logic, except by the fact that they may believe the fabricated lies that are broadcast by the media of the secessionist, renegade gang that is hostile to the people, the homeland, unity, and democracy. There is a great difference between what is happening in the field on all axes and what is announced by those who are hiding behind the citizens and the economic, services, and strategic installations in Aden. Lies do not live long. Here, we reaffirm our call to all brother officers, NCO's, and soldiers in the units that are still under the control of the secessionist, rebellious forces. They still can return to the trench of right and reject the dictatorial orders they are given to fight their suicidal, futile battle. Positions of honor and dignity in the Armed Forces, the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy, await them so that they can join their brothers in the Armed Forces and all children of our Yemeni people against the enemies of life, the enemies of unity, democracy, and the enemies of the march of unity and progress. In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. And soon the unjust assailants will know what vicissitudes their affair will take.
