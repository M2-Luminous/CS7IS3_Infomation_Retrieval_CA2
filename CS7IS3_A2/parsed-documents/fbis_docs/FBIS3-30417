Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller delivered the opening speech at the news conference where the foreign ministers of the respective countries also participated. Ciller stated that they encountered a war for freedom during their visit, which was undertaken for humanitarian purposes. Ciller said: What the world should do is put Bosnia-Herzegovina back on the world map. We share the principles of the international community. Human rights is the most important value. Preventing terrorism and oppression is among the values we share. We should defend these values when and where the need arises. Calling for a tolerant approach to the religious and cultural unity of certain communities, Ciller called for the perpetuation of the values so that another Berlin Wall will not happen. Indicating that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be the joint goal of the whole world, Ciller appealed to international public opinion. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, a historical document -- termed the Sarajevo Communique -- concerning the joint Ciller-Bhutto visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina was issued. Noting that the visit was for humanitarian purposes, the communique says that rarely in the annals of human history has a nation been subjected to such a massacre while the whole world is watching. The Sarajevo Communique further states: It is terrifying that such a terrible human tragedy is being played out in the heart of a continent that prides itself on its commitment to human rights. It is unacceptable that in this era, where the principles of the United Nations are universally recognized, a sovereign and independent state is being violently wiped out and its people -- peace-loving and enlightened -- massacred. We are respectfully saluting the heroism shown by the people of Bosnia. We are supporting them in their just struggle toward the continuation of their national existence. We are supporting them all the way in their determination to defend their territorial integrity, the sovereignty of their motherland, and their political independence. The international disrespect shown in reaction to this aggression is horrifying. We appeal to the world community to halt the destruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The UN Security Council should make sure that all its resolutions are properly implemented. The embargo imposed on Bosnia-Herzegovina should be lifted. The embargo violates their most important international right -- the right to self-defense. Bosnia should not be coerced into [word indistinct] negotiations. We will stand against any initiative that supports aggression. Ethnic cleansing cannot be considered the basis for the emergence of a country. The conscientious efforts of the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations should not be belittled. We are appealing for an immediate lifting of all obstacles standing in the way of humanitarian aid for Bosnia-Herzegovina. For this reason, Tuzla Airport should be reopened. The blockade on Sarajevo and the region declared the security region should be lifted and the bombing of the civilian population should be stopped immediately. Apart from this, an all-out cease fire should be imposed and negotiations renewed. Ciller and Bhutto made a courtesy call on Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. The Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic and other officials saw Ciller off in Zagreb. It is expected that Ciller will arrive in Turkey at midnight.
