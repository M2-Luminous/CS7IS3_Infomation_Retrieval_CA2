FR940317-0-00021 FR940317-0-00007 Based on available information, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants from the Republic of Korea into the United States as a result of this rule. In 1992, the United States did not import any live ruminants or swine from the Republic of Korea. Additionally, only 2 metric tons of meat and meat products were shipped from the Republic of Korea to the United States. This accounted for less than one-tenth of one percent of total 1992 meat imports. The Republic of Korea is currently an importer of beef and lamb and does not produce enough ruminant meat to be self-sufficient. Therefore, any effect on domestic prices or supplies will be insignificant. Increases in imports of live ruminants from the Republic of Korea are also unlikely because there is no demand in the United States for live ruminants from the Republic of Korea and because of high transportation costs. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.
