FR940523-2-00093 FR940523-2-00049 National Park Service General Management Plan; Haleakala National Park; Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Statement Summary: Pursuant to Section 102 (2) (C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91&hyph;190 as amended), the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) assessing the potential impacts of the proposed General Management Plan for Haleakala National Park, Maui County, Hawaii. The proposed action would add adjacent lands to the park containing significant natural and cultural resources to permit visitor access and to ensure the long term protection of park resources. The proposal also includes needed improvements to visitor services to be carried out through the development of a limited amount of new facilities and the upgrading of existing facilities. Research programs are also called for in the proposal to refine and supplement the existing resource data base. Two alternative plans are being considered. One is a no action alternative which calls for a continuation of current operations with no upgrading or development of park infrastructure. The other is a minimum requirements alternative which calls for the same level of facility upgrading and development as the proposal, but adds substantially less land. Supplementary Information: Written comments on the draft general management plan and DEIS will be accepted until July 30, 1994. Public meetings on the draft plan will be scheduled at different locations on the Island of Maui, including Kahului and Hana, during the month of June. The times, dates, and specific locations of these meetings will be announced in local newspapers several weeks in advance. Park Service officials will be available at the meetings to present the plan, receive oral and written comments, and answer questions. Inquiries on the draft general management plan and DEIS should be directed to the Superintendent, Haleakala National Park, P.O. Box 369, Makawao, Maui, Hawaii 96768. The park telephone number is (808) 572&hyph;9306. Copies of the draft Plan and DEIS are available at the park headquarters at the above address. Copies are also available for inspection at public libraries on Maui, at the State Library in Honolulu, and at the Western Regional Office, National Park Service, 600 Harrison St., suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107&hyph;1372.
