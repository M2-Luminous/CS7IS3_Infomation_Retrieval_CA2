This clearly reduced the difference between interest rates on loans and deposits. It can thus be seen that public opinion is effective in supervising any commercial organization. The purpose of the major banks in their willingness to readjust greatly divergent interest rates is evidently to defend the interest rate agreement, which is to their advantage. The United States has tightened short-term money supply on two occasions since the beginning of February, causing preferential interest rates for commercial banks to rise by 0.25 percent. This has made it possible for Hong Kong to make corresponding readjustments. However, various categories of interest rates in Hong Kong have been slightly higher than those in the United States for a long period, and the new interest rates in the United states are still lower than in Hong Kong. Therefore, Hong Kong can either increase its interest rate by 0.25 percent or maintain the existing interest rate structure. The move by the Hong Kong Association of Banks to suddenly raise the interest rate for Hong Kong dollar deposits by 0.5 to 0.75 percent, while the major banks have raised their preferential rates by only 0.25 percent, is greatly different from the practice of many years. Evidently, this is a result of pressure from public opinion. In the past few months, the debate in society on abolishing the interest rate agreement has become heated again, and demands for abolition have become stronger and stronger. Therefore, the banks have to be at combat readiness. This is because the existing interest rate agreement is the only thing that attracts the attention of the society. Once the monetary policy function of the agreement has faded away or been abolished, the image of the association in society would be even less noticeable and would attract less attention. On the other hand, since the major banks have a certain influence on the association and the interest rate agreement, they are less willing to have the agreement abolished. Since public opinion says the banking sector takes advantage of the interest rate agreement to make considerable gains from the difference between interest rates on loans and deposits, and the recent increase in interest rates on deposits decided by the association was far greater than the movement in preferential interest rate for the commercial banks, people cannot but associate this move with the idea that the banking sector has made a concession to public opinion in society. In recent years, the banking sector has made extraordinary gains during a period of low interest rates. The low cost of capital has set off the impact of an evident slow down in capital growth and has given support to the achievements of the banking sector. Therefore, the banking sector strongly wishes to defend the interest rate agreement. Before the readjustment of interest rates, the interest rate agreement of the Hong Kong Association of Banks fixed the interest rate for Hong Kong dollar deposits at 1.5 percent, but the best lending rate at the major banks was 6.5 percent. The difference between interest rates for loans and deposits was 5 percent. This meant the banks gained more than three and a half times the cost of capital. As far as the present situation is concerned, although the Monetary Authority has new accounting arrangements and a regulatory mechanism for capital raising, and can effectively and appropriately operate at any time in the open market in the banking sector, the interest rate agreement has existed in Hong Kong for many years after all, and the major banks have insisted on maintaining the agreement and have made quite a big concession to public opinion; therefore, we can consider maintaining the agreement temporarily. However, society must carry out supervision so that the banks cannot take advantage of the agreement to reap staggering profits and that the legitimate rights and interests of consumers can be protected. In addition to reaping staggering profits by taking advantage of the interest rate agreement and the great difference between interest rates on loans and deposits, some banking groups have frequently increased charges in recent years and have even asked for additional interest on loans under the pretext of so-called rising costs or as compensation for loan risks. All this is unfair to consumers. Banks are undoubtedly commercial organizations, but they undertake great responsibilities in society. Therefore, they should not collect charges at will and society should exercise close supervision over them.
