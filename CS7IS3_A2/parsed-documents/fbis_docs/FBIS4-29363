It was the first time in two and a half years that production marked year-on-year gains for all the four types. Industry analysts said the increased output signals a recovery for the slumping petrochemical industry, but the association said demand for plastic resins is unlikely to make a full recovery soon. Production of low-density polyethylene was up 6.0 percent, high- density polyethylene up 8.0 percent, polypropylene up 3.0 percent and polystyrene up 6.0 percent, the association said. Production of polystyrene, used in household appliances, hit a monthly record of 112,700 tons.
