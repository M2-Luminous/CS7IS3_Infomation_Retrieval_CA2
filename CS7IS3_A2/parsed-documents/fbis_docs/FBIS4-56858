It has yet to be decided which neighboring country, either Argentina or Brazil, may be selected, although the balance is tipped in favor of Argentina. Uruguay may also be included. Reliable sources have said the preliminary negotiations initiated some months ago have been translated into a rough draft of an international agreement based on the UN Convention on Maritime Law. It should be recalled that, pursuant to the agreement between Russia and Paraguay -- the first of its kind -- the parties have granted each other the status of most-favored nation while promoting economic bilateral cooperation in building, streamlining, and reconstructing mixed enterprises between both nations or within the Treaty of Asuncion or Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. The agreement also provides for the facilitation of the supply of equipment, technology transfer, and industrial cooperation. All this was confirmed with the visit of Sergey Glazyev [name as published], Russian minister of foreign economic relations, to Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay more than a year ago. His proposals have been enhanced by Yan Anastasyevich Burlyay, Russian ambassador to Argentina and concurrent ambassador to Paraguay. His ideas produced a favorable response among Paraguayan ship owners, so much so that after discussions with the government at technical level, steps were taken to adopt the necessary international instruments to begin deep-sea fishing in the territorial waters of neighboring countries like Argentina and Brazil, and possibly Uruguay. Official negotiations will be pursued within the framework of Articles 69 and 70 of the UN Convention on Maritime Law, which establishes landlocked countries' rights to deep-water fishing. Legislation and other background information have been collected in the aforementioned neighboring countries to assess whether this could be a cost-effective activity for Paraguayan ship owners or for joint ventures between Paraguay and other countries like Russia. This move also seeks to define the species of fish to be captured, and the marketing in Paraguay or other countries.
