The paper, which carried exclusive news of Russia's plan to sell submarines to North Korea, sent a reporter to the (Novik) port in Vladivostok -- which is the prohibited area for foreigners -- and held an interview with a relevant official there. He said that Russia had decided to stop delivering submarines to North Korea. Having obtained contract documents regarding transactions for the submarines that were to be sold to North Korea, the paper carried commentary on the documents on 3 February along with submarine photos. The paper reported that although a relevant Russian military officer had said that they were "exporting scrap materials, not submarines," it was more likely that Russia was selling them as weapons as it has been confirmed that a North Korean high-ranking naval officer was directly involved in negotiations for the submarines. The paper reported: Although Golf II Class submarines, which were to be sold to North Korea this time, appear to be largely scrap material, their facilities, including operational functions, remain functional. According to the data furnished to the paper, the Management Bureau of the Resources External Affairs of the Russian Defense Ministry and the Japanese Toyen trade corporation (head office in Tokyo) signed the contract on 16-19 November last year. The price of the 12 Russian submarines are as follows: Two of the submarines are $140,000 based on price of $51 per ton and ten submarines, at $92 per ton, amount to $1.15 million. One of these submarines has already been delivered to Najing port in North Korea.
