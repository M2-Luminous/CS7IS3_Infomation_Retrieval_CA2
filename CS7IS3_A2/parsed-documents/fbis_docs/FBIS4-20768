However, he declined the offer, saying: "I felt that taking on the job under these circumstances would result in an escalation of the explosive situation." 'Ali Nasir added: "I stressed the importance of having existing bodies assume the job of implementing the document, rather than being content to merely sign it." He indicated that it would have been possible for him to take on the job if the offer had been the result of a meeting of the Presidential Councils, the ministers, and Parliament. However, he said that "these councils did not take this initiative, and this prompted me to focus on the importance of these parties' taking the initiative to implement the document." 'Ali Nasir then said: "I participated in the signing ceremony, but I did not sign the document, and I stressed, both before and after Amman, the importance of good intentions and an initiative in the direction of implementation being taken by the bodies concerned in the Presidential Councils, by the ministers, and by the Parliament, and that all parties, one after the other, commit themselves to implementation, including the security organizations. I proposed that the meetings be held in Aden or Sanaa, as an indication of the fact that all parties desire to create and implement the solutions and be committed to them. The document in itself is very important, it has the objective of having the country emerge from its crisis, it contains a national program, and it is the result of a collective national effort made by all parties and leaders in the Yemeni arena. Also, it has the support of the Arabs and international support. However, the implementation, unfortunately, has coincided with military events in some areas, whereas what is needed is to seek a solution by means of a dialogue, not by means of shots fired by artillery, tanks, and airplanes." The former Yemeni president called for a search to be made for other alternatives in order that national Yemeni unity be preserved and in order to avoid bloodshed. He called upon the leaders to seek a solution via the Document of Pledge and Accord, which expresses the aspirations of the Yemeni people who have suffered from so many problems and hardships, and said that this situation is one which necessitates the creation of rapid solutions.
