In an interview published in yesterday's LES DERNIERES NOUVELLES D'ALSACE, the former president of the Republic wonders whether it is necessary to have "two currents within the European Union [EU]," one which "brings together only those states which approve the idea of a political union," and "one which brings together the other countries which only want a good organization of relations among the twelve European partners." "This distinction is important for the future," stated Giscard, who suggested that the question be "clearly put," in a referendum, "to the public of every member state." "If the referendum turns out to be negative in some countries, we would have to draw the appropriate conclusions," added Giscard, who, it needs not be repeated, sides with those who "approve of political union." In addition, the former president of the Republic repeated that he remains "very attached to a federalist conception of the EU," adding: "And I think that no other solution exists." This contradicts Dominique Baudis, the head of the UDF-RPR [French Democratic Union-Rally for the Republic] list, who considers the federalist conception "outdated."
