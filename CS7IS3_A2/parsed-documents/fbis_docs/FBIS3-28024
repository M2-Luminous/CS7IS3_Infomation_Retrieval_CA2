The chief of General Staff, according to the paper said the report of the Japanese weekly was based on a rude and open false document and it was a clear provocation motivated by the intention to throw a shadow on the Ministry of Defence and the general staff of Russia. The paper said: At the same time, the chief of general staff did not rule out that this would be beneficial only to those who seek to complicate the relations between Russia and North Korea. That is right. The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is now presenting itself as a very crucial matter. As was stated recently by a high-ranking Russian diplomat, we consider the sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on which some countries insist are the worst means. Worse still, there are people who are trying to turn the complicated process of talks into an open pressure on Pyongyang. It is not good to them to accuse Russia now of having helped the DPRK possess nuclear weapons. Is it?
