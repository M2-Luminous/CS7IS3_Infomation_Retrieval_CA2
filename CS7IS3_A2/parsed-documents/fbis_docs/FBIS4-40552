Ponomarev: "Heightened Hysteria Envelops the the Pentagon Too?"] [Text] The unimaginable commotion in the U.S. mass media over the problems in the nuclear sphere which have emerged on the Korean peninsula is spreading. It seems that the U.S. Defense Department has also given way to the hysteria being fueled by some newspapers and television companies. THE WASHINGTON TIMES asserts that concrete plans are being hastily drawn up in the Pentagon in case of an outbreak of military actions. As far as can be judged, it is primarily a matter of reinforcing the South Korean troops deployed in the region of the DMZ dividing North and South Korea. Pentagon experts believe that the configuration of forces there is now clearly to Seoul's disadvantage: The South Korean Army has only a few large combined units in the vicinity of the Zone, totaling 21 divisions, whereas the DPRK has concentrated two-thirds of its armed forces there, comprising 1.2 million men in all. Because of this, it is reported from Washington, the Pentagon is examining options for transferring U.S. troops into the DMZ area. Right now the number of American troops on the Korean peninsula totals 36,000 men. But they can quickly be bolstered by a further 26,000 Marines stationed in Okinawa. It is also planned to move additional armaments to the threatened region and to top up reserves of equipment and ammunition, in particular the so-called "bunker bombs" designed to destroy hardened underground targets. Among such targets the U.S. generals primarily class installations associated with the DPRK nuclear complex in Yongbyon. Citing "informed sources," the U.S. press writes that the intelligence services have already transferred additional skilled staff to South Korea. They are being employed to analyze and evaluate information received from artificial earth satellites, reconnaissance aircraft, and bugging devices located at sea and on land. Citing the magazine DEFENSE NEWS, ITAR-TASS also reports that the U.S. Defense Department intends to make use of the latest acoustic technologies to identify and chart underground passages and tunnels which it is suggested that Pyongyang has constructed. These installations, allegedly created for "covert penetration" of South Korean territory, are supposed to be revealed by studying the concussion [detonatsiya] resulting from exploding special charges, using a method developed by the "Eliant Techsystem" [name as transliterated] company. These are just a few of the items appearing in the U.S. press on the subject of Pentagon preparations for a possible war on the Korean peninsula.
