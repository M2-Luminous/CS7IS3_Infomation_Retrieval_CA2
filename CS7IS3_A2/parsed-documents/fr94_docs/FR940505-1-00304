(G) Use of an adaptation to any of the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(vi) (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this section may be approved by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis. An owner or operator must submit sufficient documentation for the Administrator to find that the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(vi) (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this section will yield inaccurate results and that the proposed adaptation is appropriate. (vii) Leak Detection Methods for Volatile Organic Compounds. Owners or operators required by the various subparts of this regulation to carry out a leak detection monitoring program shall comply with the following requirements: (A) Leak Detection Monitoring. (1) Monitoring shall comply with 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (2) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (3) The instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the methods specified in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (4) Calibration gases shall be: (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air), and (ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane and air at a concentration of approximately, but no less than, 10,000 ppm methane or n-hexane. (5) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible as described in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (B) When equipment is tested for compliance with no detectable emissions as required, the test shall comply with the following requirements: (1) The requirements of paragraphs (a)(4)(vii)(A) (1) through (vii)(A) (5) of this section shall apply. (2) The background level shall be determined as set forth in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (C) Leak detection tests shall be performed consistent with: (1) ``APTI Course SI 417 Controlling Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Leaking Process Equipment'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;82&hyph;015 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161) (2) ``Portable Instrument User's Manual for Monitoring VOC Sources'' EPA&hyph;340/1&hyph;86&hyph;015 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161) (3) ``Protocols for Generating Unit-Specific Emission Estimates for Equipment Leaks of VOC and VHAP'' EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;88&hyph;010 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161) (4) ``Petroleum Refinery Enforcement Manual'' EPA&hyph;340/1&hyph;80&hyph;008 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161) (viii) Bulk Gasoline Delivery System Test Protocol . (A) The method for determining the emissions of gasoline from a vapor recovery system are delineated in 40 CFR part 60, subpart XX, ยง60.503. (B) Other tests shall be performed consistent with: (1) ``Inspection Manual for Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Gasoline Marketing Operations: appendix D'' EPA&hyph;340/1&hyph;80&hyph;012 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161). (2) ``Control of Hydrocarbons from Tank Truck Gasoline Loading Terminals: appendix A'', EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;026 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161) (ix) Vapor Pressure of Volatile Organic Liquids . (A) If the VOL consists of only a single compound, the vapor pressure shall be determined by ASTM Method D2879&hyph;86 (incorporated by reference as specified in paragraph (c) of this section or the vapor pressure may be obtained from a published source such as: Boublik, T., V. Fried and E. Hala, ``The Vapor Pressure of Pure Substances,'' Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., New York (1973), Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook, McGraw-Hill Book Company (1984), CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, Chemical Rubber Publishing Company (1986&hyph;87), and Lange's Handbook of Chemistry, John A. Dean, editor, McGraw-Hill Book Company (1985). (B) If the VOL is a mixture, the vapor pressure shall be determined by ASTM Method D2879&hyph;86 (incorporated by reference as specified in paragraph (c) of this section) or by the following equation: E:GRAPHICSEP05my94.060 where: P vol = Total vapor pressure of the mixture, n = Number of components in the mixture, i = Subscript denoting an individual component, P i = Vapor pressure of a component determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(ix)(A) of this section, and Xi = Mole fraction of the component in the total mixture. (x) Vapor Pressure of Organic Material or Solvent. (A) If the organic material or solvent consists of only a single compound, the vapor pressure shall be determined by ASTM Method D2879&hyph;86 (incorporated by reference in paragraph (c) of this section) or the vapor pressure may be obtained from a published source such as: Boublik, T., V. Fried and E. Hala, ``The Vapor Pressure of Pure Substances,'' Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., New York (1973), Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook, McGraw-Hill Book Company (1984), CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, Chemical Rubber Publishing Company (1986&hyph;87), and Lange's Handbook of Chemistry, John A. Dean, editor, McGraw-Hill Book Company (1985). (B) If the organic material or solvent is in a mixture made up of both organic material compounds and compounds which are not organic material, the vapor pressure shall be determined by the following equation: E:GRAPHICSEP05my94.061 where: P om = Total vapor pressure of the portion of the mixture which is composed of organic material, n = Number of organic material components in the mixture, i = Subscript denoting an individual component, P i = Vapor pressure of an organic material component determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(x)(A) of this section, and X i = Mole fraction of the organic material component of the total mixture.
