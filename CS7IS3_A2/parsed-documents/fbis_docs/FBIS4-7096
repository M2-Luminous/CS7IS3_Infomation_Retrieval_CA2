This is the picture one can draw from the drama being played in the sudden formation of the parliamentary group "Kaishin" in the House of Representatives on 25 April on the heels of the appointment of Tsutomu Hata as prime minister. A top leader of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which was left out of the alliance within the ruling camp, could not hide his displeasure, saying: "I could not have anticipated something like this happening at this time." The formation of the parliamentary group that proceeded while the cabinet was being formed is likely not only to have a major impact on Prime Minister Hata's power base, but will also speed up the overall reorganization of the political world. For Hata, who had to watch the developments alone in the prime minister's residence, this is literally the embarkation of his cabinet on rough seas. The man who began the work of forming the alliance this time was Ouchi, who until very recently had sided with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the SDPJ, and Masayoshi Takemura, representative of Sakigake [Harbinger], in opposing the Shinseito and Komeito-led concept of forming a new-new party or a large alliance of parties. Ouchi met with Takemura and Murayama separately on 25 April, and sought their understanding on forming the "Kaishin" alliance. But Sakigake responded negatively, and Murayama remained cold, stating: "All I heard was the DSP explaining intraparty problems." A concerned official insisted: "Ouchi pleaded with Murayama, saying, `There is no other choice but for the DSP to go along. Please accept it.'" There was no question that in the series of developments over the formation of "Kaishin," Ouchi's actions were conspicuous. According to DSP officials, Ouchi met with Shinseito's Ichiro Ozawa about 23 April at the request of the latter. Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the DSP and a close friend of Ozawa, was said to have acted as an intermediary between the two. In this meeting, Ouchi is supposed to have proposed forming an alliance among the DSP, Shinseito, Japan New Party, and Sakigake. Ozawa concurred, saying: "That is fine." In a news conference following the party leaders' meeting on 22 April, which decided to appoint Hata as the ruling coalition's candidate for prime minister, Ouchi appeared to be thinking and still undecided about the idea of forming the grand alliance because he said: "I want to specifically think about it." Few people within the DSP had been consulted on the matter in advance. It was at the meeting of party Diet members of the two houses on the afternoon of 25 April, following his meetings with Takemura and Murayama, that Ouchi formally brought up the matter. Even though the party entrusted Ouchi and Yonezawa with decisionmaking on the matter, one who attended the meeting said: "Most Diet members were dumbfounded." The situation was similar in the Japan New Party. After Ouchi and former Prime Minister Hosokawa met on the afternoon of 25 April, there was a report to an informal meeting of party Diet members shortly past 1700 on forming the alliance with the DSP. A party staff official admitted it came as a surprise, saying: "No one but Hosokawa had known about it. It was an action that came as fast as a lightening." Now that the parliamentary group has been formed, in assigning posts in the new cabinet their allocation will be made on the basis of the group. This means that the "Liberal Party," which was recently formed by defectors from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], may be able to win a post in the cabinet, and the DSP will be able to increase its posts from one to two. Consequently, within the SDPJ there is criticism that "Ouchi ran to Shinseito, baited by increased posts in the cabinet." Anyway, in creating the ruling parties' largest parliamentary group in the House of Representatives, there is the additional aim of bringing the SDPJ under control. A staff official from the Japan New Party noted: "The Hata government is supposed to have done soul-searching on problems that existed with the Hosokawa government. This may not please the SDPJ, but there is no other choice when we think about the need for taxation reform and about how we have to run the Diet." The SDPJ, which met the surprise attack no sooner than an agreement was made regarding the prime ministership, is reacting fiercely. On the evening of that same day, a top party leader spat out in disgust: "That is unrelated to the SDPJ. Shinseito is probably behind all this." Following the meeting with Ouchi, Murayama phoned Ouchi and protested emphatically: "I am surprised this came about today. There is no way the SDPJ can accept it." Things are proceeding at a speed much faster than the SDPJ expected. Even though Komeito is not participating in it, "Kaishin" is an exact duplicate of "Kaikaku" which Ozawa and Hosokawa sought to establish some time ago. There is no doubt this group will become the parent body for a new-new party. The three top SDPJ executives hastily met several times in the evening to discuss countermeasures. Meanwhile, former SDPJ cabinet members who assembled at party headquarters vented their anger. Ozawa was triumphant following a ceremony marking the launching of the new alliance. He said: "This cannot be done unless we make the most of such an opportunity." The curtains for the Hata government appear to have been opened at the "Ozawa's pace"--once again.
