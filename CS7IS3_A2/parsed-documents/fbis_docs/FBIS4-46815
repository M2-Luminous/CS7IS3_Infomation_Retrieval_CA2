Forty-six percent of the jobless were registered in the cities, and 54 percent in the districts. The largest number of the jobless is in Vilnius 4,952 (5,031 at the beginning of April) and Panevezys -- 1,910 (2,074), the fewest are in Marijampole --238 (261) and in Palanga -- 216 (248). The districts with the most jobless are Taurage -- about 1.8 thousand people, and Silute -- 1.4 thousand. The number of jobless workers keeps increasing in the country. On May 1, there were 65.7 percent of them (65.4 percent at the beginning of April). The number of jobless women remains stable (61.7 percent). The level of unemployment and joblessness has changed little in the country, as compared with April 1: the level of unemployment -- 3.2 percent (it was the same at the beginning of April), and of joblessness -- 1.3 percent (1.4). One available job in the country is sought by about 19 people who are not working, and 8 jobless individuals. The Lithuanian labor exchange's inquiries among the employers have revealed that at the beginning of May 120,000 people in this country worked an incomplete working day, not in their working place, were taking a compulsory vacation, or were about to be fired. The president's adviser on questions of social economic policy, A. Vasiliauskas, told LIETUVOS RYTAS that hidden unemployment, which the official statistics pass over in silence, was entrenched in the country and was a negative phenomenon. Many enterprises avoided applying the Bankruptcy Law, because the people are paralyzed by psychological fear. On the other hand, procrastination might lead to a social explosion in the future. V. Aleskaitis, the chairman of FIDA, a firm of the agency for the promotion of foreign investments, and the former minister of international economic relations, said that investors in Lithuania are not being scared away by the bastions of industry with thousands of workers drawing minimal wages. The serious investors may even find this unreally low level of unemployment attractive, but they immediately try to compute how fast it might rise in Lithuania. "Instead of paying unemployment benefits and granting the right to seek work, people get minimal wages and are left with no prospects -- this is a faulty situation," V. Aleskaitis said. "The freezing of natural processes promotes a social explosion." The director of the Vilnius labor exchange, J. Jagminas, asserted that this spring there was an increased demand for construction workers in the capital city. Other typical large city trends were also noticeable: fewer registered jobless and youths, more able-bodied people. The enterprises in the capital city have so far been reluctant to furnish the labor exchange with statistics about working at less than full capacity; by the way, directors of private enterprises in the Northern countries are acting in a similar manner.
