FBIS4-29678 "dreas119__a94005" FBIS-EAS-94-119-A Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Financial Markets, Services Issues Analyzed Financial Markets, Services Issues Analyzed Making Guidance Transparent 942A0341B Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN in Japanese 15 Jun 94 p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0341B Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Article by economics department reporter Hideyuki Konaka] [Text] An official of a foreign securities firm operating in Japan still bitterly complains of invisible barriers to entry into Japanese markets, saying, "It took five years from the date of the application until a permit was issued by the MOF. MOF officials would listen, but the process was very slow because of the vagueness of both standards and detailed procedures used in the approval process." The law governing operation of foreign securities firms in Japan provides approval standards such as "adequate assets to ensure sound operations" and "adequate social trust," but it lacks any detailed regulations. That means that approval is subject, to a great degree, to the discretion of the officials handling each approval application. Moreover, foreign firms constantly voice the dissatisfaction that "the preliminary hearing stage leading to tentative approval is inordinately long." During the preliminary hearing stage, the MOF provides a variety of "administrative guidance" concerning systems required to operate a securities firm in Japan. It is said that each piece of administrative guidance issued by the MOF must be followed by submission of a written response by the applying firm and that each submission reaches a thickness of almost 10 centimeters. Once this process is completed, submission of a formal request is finally approved by the MOF. MOF officials admit that it is normal that "the process of tentative approval, submission of application, and formal approval takes one month, but inclusion of the preliminary review stage extends the normal time requirement to one or two years." In other words, the advance "guidance period" consumes the majority of the total processing time. MOF officials rebut charges of vagueness by saying, "Unlike the United States where you start with the submission of an application for a permit, we provide appropriate guidance beforehand. We feel that you can call this a case of being helpful," but to foreigners such Japanese-style administrative guidance systems have a tendency of appearing to be "vague." Even in the "financial services" sector of the Japan-U.S. trade talks, a strong case is being made for attaining transparency in approval and legal systems. This issue first surfaced in the "Japan-U.S. Yen-Dollar Committee" meeting of 1984 and has since been mentioned at every opportunity, including the Japan-U.S. framework talks. During the insurance sector talks held on 1 and 2 June in Tokyo, the U.S. side's trade and commerce action officer said, "We would like to see the establishment of transparency and clarification of provisions for permits and regulation and the provision of clear-cut standards for approval of insurance products," and renewed their request for improvement of administrative guidance. The U.S. officials also stressed that "transparency has been made a topic in trade talks for as many as 10 years," and made no effort to conceal their frustration at Japan's slowness in making improvements. The U.S. perception of the situation is reflected in the report concerning trade barriers compiled at the end of March 1994 by the U.S. Trade Representative. Under the item concerning "financial services" in Japan, the report discusses as a system issue the "lack of transparency." The report first covers the current situation by referring to the specific case of the insurance law by commenting, "It is limited to general rules and relies on administrative guidance for specific regulation." Additionally, it states that participation by foreign firms is difficult because of the lack of clear-cut standards and a problem exists in that there is no way to determine whether the MOF treats foreign and Japanese firms in a different manner. The Japanese Government has finally shown signs of reviewing the status of administrative guidance in response to criticism of this nature from overseas sources. The first move in this direction is the Administrative Procedures Law to be implemented in October 1994. That law is aimed at providing for fairness and transparency in administrative procedures to the degree possible by establishing common rules for handling permits and related actions which were previously covered in individual pieces of legislation. The law provides for delineation of "purpose," "content," and "responsible individuals" concerning administrative guidance and provides that oral guidance must be issued in writing to cover the three listed points whenever so requested. The law will provide for comprehension of such documentation by third parties and affected parties hope that it will eliminate vague administrative guidance. However, comments are being made that this law alone will not provide for the resolution of vagueness in administrative guidance. A source at a city bank gives as a reason, "administrative guidance is the product of collusion between government agencies and industry. A problem exists in industry which has "accepted vague administrative guidance from government agencies through a process of telepathy." It appears we can say that the system reflects Japanese-type perceptions symbolized in administrative guidance which requires modification.
