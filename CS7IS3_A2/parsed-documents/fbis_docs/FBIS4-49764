As far as the most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status issue is concerned, brandishing the human-rights "big stick" will not lead to any good ending. The Chinese leader said: China's views on human rights are different from those of the United States. There are many differences despite some similarities. The United States holds that the U.S. view on human rights is universally accepted but, in fact, only 1 billion people in this world endorse the U.S. view on human rights while the remaining 4 billion people do not. As far as the Chinese know, the U.S. human rights record is not good. In the United States, there is racial discrimination as well as discrimination and harassment against women; the crime rate is much higher in the United States than in China; and the United States did use firearms to quell the Los Angeles riots but China made no comment on this because it was an internal affair of the United States. China places more stress on man's right to subsistence and development but this seems difficult for the United States to understand. As a Chinese saying goes: "The well fed do not know how the starving suffer." The U.S. per capita GNP is about $25,000, whereas China's GNP, even if quoted from U.S. statistics, is no more than $1,000. China is still a developing country with more than 80 million people still living in extreme poverty. Therefore, for China, the very first problem that must be dealt with is that of providing its 1.2 billion population with food, clothing, housing, and transport facilities, that is, the issues concerning the right to subsistence and development. The United States has already basically solved this problem. Therefore, what is being talked about in the United States nowadays is another right, specifically, the issue regarding the so-called principle of "one person, one vote" or the freedom to criticize the government. This leader stressed that China will definitely not accept the U.S. and Western views on human rights. We would like to discuss the human rights issue with the United States and other Western countries on an equal footing but we will never tolerate pressure on us, the Chinese leader said. Referring to the MFN issue, the Chinese leader said: The Americans have a well-known doctrine called the "carrot and stick" policy. The United States is currently holding a "carrot," that is, the MFN status and, on the other hand, a "big stick," that is, human rights. The MFN status is the foundation for normal economic and trade relations between the two countries and is not only favorable to China but also to the United States. The United States perhaps has an unrealistic belief that China very much fears that the U.S. side will revoke MFN status. Frankly speaking, China does not want to see the United States revoking China's MFN status. However, this does not mean that revoking MFN status will cause the sky to fall down and the earth to revolve in the opposite direction and, thus, the PRC will not be able to survive anymore and the Chinese economy will stop developing. To be sure, there will be some impact, but China is not so terribly afraid of the MFN status being revoked as the United States imagines. I have good grounds for saying that: First, China does not rely only on foreign trade, and China has its major market at home; and second, China has benefited from its trade with the United States but it has not benefited as much as the United States imagines. It is all right to compare Sino-U.S. trade to a "carrot" but this "carrot" is not so big as described by the United States. If the United States revoked China's MFN status the biggest victim would not be the Chinese people nor the Chinese economy. Of course, this does not mean that the Chinese economy will be unaffected at all but, the direct impact upon China will be much less than that on Hong Kong, Taiwan, and U.S. investors in China. Furthermore, the United States itself will also suffer very great losses. This Chinese leader said: If the United States revokes China's MFN status, China will react in similar fashion. China is not only a big importer of U.S. wheat, chemical fertilizer, and timber, but also the biggest foreign buyer of Boeing airplanes. Just recently, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company entered the China market. China's present annual import volume is $100 billion. If China's import volume keeps growing by 9 percent a year, by 2000 its total annual import volume will reach $1,000 billion, which will present a huge market even measured on a world scale. So, if the United States revokes China's MFN status, this will imply that the United States will give up this market.
