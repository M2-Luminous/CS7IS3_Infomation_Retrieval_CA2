"There should not be a standoff between the ruling coalition and the opposition camp," Hata told the House of Representatives Budget Committee. He added that his administration, "is sincerely seeking to implement the common policy agreement." The premier was responding to a query by Social Democratic Party (SDP) legislator Shun Oide. The SDP, which was the No. 1 component of the previous cabinet led by Morihiro Hosokawa, stormed out of the coalition late last month in protest against the abrupt formation of a large parliamentary group excluding the SDP. The SDP's move forced Hata to form Japan's first minority government in 39 years. SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo demanded Saturday that the Hata Cabinet should resign en masse after the fiscal 1994 budget bills are approved by the Diet, and before the opposition camp submits a motion of no-confidence. Kubo also hinted that the SDP, which holds the deciding vote in the Diet, may move to make a reconciliation with its former coalition partners if Hata bows out. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Sunday there is no difference of opinion between him and Kubo. Murayama said a dissolution of the lower house for a snap general election might be inevitable in the event of political turmoil. Yohei Kono, president of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party, said Monday he agrees with the SDP on the issue. Oide urged Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa to withdraw his recently published comments that Japan needs to apply a more flexible interpretation to the Constitution in order to defend itself in the face of a "possible threat from North Korea's missiles and the buildup of China's naval forces." Oide took issue with a statement of Kakizawa's published in a book that carried proposals from 200 intellectuals and politicians. Kakizawa rejected Oide's demand to renege his conviction about Japan's defense policy, while promising to live up to the Hata administration's vow not to amend interpretation of the Constitution. Hata rejected Oide's demand that Kakizawa be dismissed as foreign minister to take account for his remark. Hata renewed a pledge Monday to seek the passage of the overdue fiscal 1994 state budget by the end of the current Diet session as discussions on the budget finally started. Hata said,"I really hope the budget passes in the current Diet session by any means. I will make most sincere efforts for that." The Diet session is scheduled to end June 29. "I feel great responsibility. I regret the delay," Hata said. Nearly 80 days have passed since the government submitted the budget to the Diet for deliberations. He was responding to questions by an LDP legislator Takashi Fukaya. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai denied he is seeking an extension of the term of the current Diet session to ensure the passage of the budget. Hata declined to talk about an extension of the Diet session, saying it is a matter that should be decided by the Diet. Kumagai also promised a formal report on the recent "sexist" remarks by Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito and top policy strategist in the ruling coalition. Kumagai said he will directly ask Ozawa what he really meant by the remarks and will brief the committee session. He was referring to Ozawa's remarks last month which defended the move among some coalition partners to create a new Diet bloc without the SDP. Comparing the convergence of various political parties to an extramarital affair, Ozawa reportedly told reporters, "it doesn't matter which women you may sleep with." Kumagai said the remarks are "not appropriate if they were really made."
