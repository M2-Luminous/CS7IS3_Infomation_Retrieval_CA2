FR940124-1-00051 FR940124-1-00008 Accordingly, in §602.26 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary requires accrediting agencies to have standards assessing the 12 areas cited in section 496(a)(5) of the HEA. In §602.26(a)(3), the Secretary exempts accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables their institutions or programs to participate only in Federal programs not authorized under the HEA from having to establish standards for the areas listed under (7), (8), (10), and (12). However, the Secretary does not exempt these agencies from the requirement to establish standards that assess success with respect to student achievement. The Secretary believes that the standards specified in §602.26(b)(9) fulfill the requirement in section 496(a) of the HEA that the Secretary recognize accrediting agencies that meet the Secretary's standards, which must include ``an appropriate measure or measures of student achievement.'' Furthermore, the Secretary believes that any determination by an accrediting agency that the program or institution it accredits provides quality education or training must be based, in part, on an assessment of the achievement of students enrolled in the institution or program. The Secretary notes that the exemption provided in section 496(a)(5) of the HEA for certain standards was not discussed during negotiated rulemaking because it was added as a technical legislative amendment after the negotiations took place. Each of the 12 required standards is discussed below. The title for each standard is based on the statutory language used in section 496(a)(5) for that standard. Unless otherwise noted, consensus was reached among negotiators as to language for each of the standards. The proposed regulatory language in §602.26(b) for standards addressing areas (1), (2), (3), and (5) follows the recommendations of negotiators and simply restates the law. These four provisions require that, to be recognized by the Secretary, an accrediting agency must adopt standards under which it evaluates the quality of an institution's or program's curricula; faculty; facilities, equipment, and supplies; and student support services. The Secretary has reexamined the manner in which these four standards are described in the proposed regulations and believes that it may be more useful to provide guidance as to the manner in which quality may or should be discussed under these standards than to simply restate the law. The Secretary requests comment on this matter. To assist commenters in this regard, for each of the four areas, the Secretary examined the standards of several accrediting agencies to determine how these agencies addressed quality standards for those areas and presents the results of that examination under the appropriate topic. The Secretary invites comments on those approaches and additional suggestions for focusing on quality assessment. Section 602.26(b)(1)␣ Curricula . The Secretary found that the standards most accrediting agencies have adopted to evaluate an institution's or program's curricula relate to the overall quality of the curricula, its appropriateness in light of an institution's or program's educational objectives and the specific degrees or certificates awarded, and the mechanisms the institution or program uses to evaluate the curricula and make modifications. The Secretary considers all of these to be elements of good practice in the assessment of an institution's or program's curricula. Accordingly, the Secretary requests specific comment as to whether the manner in which these agencies handle standards for curricula would be a useful addition to these regulations. The Secretary also invites additional comments regarding other elements that the Secretary should include in the evaluation of accrediting agencies for compliance with this requirement. Section 602.26(b)(2) Faculty . The Secretary found that the standards most accrediting agencies have adopted to evaluate an institution's or program's faculty relate to the overall quality of the faculty, the extent to which the institution or program relies on part-time faculty to teach students, and the effectiveness of the teaching provided by all faculty. Some agencies also include in their standards an assessment of the procedures an institution or program uses for the hiring, promotion, evaluation, and professional development of faculty, while other agencies merely examine these issues in light of whether the institution's or program's policies provide for the fair and equitable treatment of faculty. The Secretary considers all of these to be elements of good practice in the assessment of an institution's or program's faculty. Accordingly, the Secretary requests specific comment as to whether the manner in which these agencies handle standards for faculty would be a useful addition to these regulations. The Secretary also invites additional comments regarding other elements that the Secretary should include in the evaluation of accrediting agencies for compliance with this requirement. Section 602.26(b)(3)␣ Facilities, equipment, and supplies . The Secretary found that the standards most accrediting agencies have adopted to evaluate an institution's or program's facilities, equipment, and supplies relate to the overall quality of these support areas. Specifically, the Secretary found that most accrediting agencies assess, in light of an institution's or program's educational objectives, the adequacy and appropriateness of: libraries, learning resource centers, and other academic and instructional support facilities; the equipment and supplies that support the instructional program; and any other physical resources the institution or program uses to achieve its educational objectives. The Secretary considers all of these elements to be good practices for the assessment of facilities, equipment, and supplies. Accordingly, the Secretary requests specific comment as to whether the manner in which these agencies handle standards for this area would be a useful addition to these regulations. The Secretary also invites additional comments regarding other elements that the Secretary should include in the evaluation of accrediting agencies for compliance with this requirement.
