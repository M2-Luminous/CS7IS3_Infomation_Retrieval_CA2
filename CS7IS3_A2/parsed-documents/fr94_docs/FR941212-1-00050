FR941212-1-00050 FR941212-1-00013 2. Publication Cut-Off Date The PTO is currently considering establishing a firm cut-off date at which time applicants must decide whether or not they wish their applications to be published, with the only alternative to publishing being abandonment of the application. Present thinking, based on experiences in the publishing of patents and SIRs, is that a cut-off time of 15 months from the earliest filing date for which a benefit is sought would be necessary to assure publication at 18 months. An applicant would have to notify the PTO of his or her wish to not publish, and thus abandon, the application by this cut-off date. The PTO recognizes that in certain instances an applicant may desire to maintain the invention as a trade secret if the protection to be afforded, in light of the prior art considered by the examiner, is limited in nature. Examination before the examiner in most non-continuing United States origin applications should be concluded, and a first Office action should be issued in most applications, by this cut-off date. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances, an applicant may request accelerated examination such that in a non-continuing United States origin application, prosecution before the examiner should be complete by the cut-off date. 3. Accelerated Examination Currently, the PTO will accelerate the examination of (make special) an application under the conditions set forth in 37 CFR 1.102, as described in M.P.E.P. ยง708.02 and Petitioning to Make Applications Relating to Biotechnology Special, 1092 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 55 (July 15, 1988). It is contemplated that some applicants will desire an accelerated examination of their respective applications to obtain a final patentability determination prior to the critical publication cut-off date, when an applicant must decide whether to have the application published. Of course, increasing the number of accelerated examinations may diminish the availability or speed of accelerated examination to an individual applicant, as there will be more applications receiving an accelerated examination. This will further delay the examination of applications not provided with accelerated examination. In view of the potential value of an accelerated examination to an individual applicant, thought must be given as to whether (1) the current requirements for receiving an accelerated examination are adequate, (2) accelerated examination also should be provided for a substantial fee, or (3) there is another alternative that would meet the needs of all applicants. See Question # 5. 4. Recovery of Publication Costs The PTO estimates that 82 percent of the applications filed in Fiscal 1996 would be published under the proposed legislation, and that it would require about $14 million in Fiscal 1996 to recover the costs of publishing these applications in accordance with option (ii) discussed above. If the proposed legislation provides the flexibility to the Commissioner to recover the costs of publication by adjusting the filing, issue, and maintenance fees, or by charging a separate publication fee, or by any combination of these methods, how should this cost be allocated among the various fees? Should the cost of publication be recovered through a separate publication fee per se, or should all or part be distributed among the filing, issue, and maintenance fees? In addition, fees assessed under 35 U.S.C. 41(a) and (b), such as filing, issue and maintenance fees, are subject to a 50 per cent small entity discount, whereas a publication fee may or may not be subject to a small entity discount. Accordingly, the manner of allocating the costs of publication will dictate the relative proportion of the costs paid by large and small entities. See Question # 6.
