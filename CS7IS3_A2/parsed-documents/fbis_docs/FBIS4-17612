The ministers had a closed door meeting. But sources in the Russian delegation told ITAR-TASS that during the talks attention was focussed on questions concerning political, trade and economic cooperation between the two countries. According to the Russian side, the questions do not conform to the interests of the two states [as received]. Problems of military and technical cooperation were also touched upon during the negotiations. Soskovets called on the Syrian side to "constructive cooperation", and also expressed readiness to "adopt specific decisions" during his three-day visit. In this context, he offered to form three working groups. The first one to deal with questions concerning mutual obligations, the second to resolve econimic problems, and the third to deal with problems of arms and special technologies. The first two groups from the Russian side will be led by Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov, and the third by Chairman of the Russian Committee for Defence Industry Viktor Glukhikh and the Russian Defence Industry Committee Chairman Viktor Samoylov. At the end of the talks Russian State Industry Committee Chairman Igor Suchkov told ITAR-TASS that the delicate question of Syria's debts was also touched upon during the talks. Till date it amounts to about 10 billion U.S. dollars. In this connection, he expressed assumption that if the Russian side "returns at least 20 per cent of the debts in the form of goods and simply in cash, then it will be equivalent to those expenses which we have borne." The second round of the Russian-Syrian talks will be held on Tuesday.
