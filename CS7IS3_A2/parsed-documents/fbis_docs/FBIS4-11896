In an interview with the Iranian news agency's correspondent in Khartoum on Sunday [3 April], Professor Saraj said the media, parliamentary, and political circles were responsible for America's hostility towards Sudan. He said the United States had never been concerned with the restoration of peace in southern Sudan, and that it used the rebels in the south as a pretext to put pressure on the Sudanese Government. [passage omitted] He emphasized that Sudan will not accept threats and will never give up its Islamic path, whatever the pressures. He said the United States cannot internationalize the conflict in southern Sudan, as that would constitute a violation of Sudanese sovereignty. Sudan is ready to defend its independence and territorial integrity.
