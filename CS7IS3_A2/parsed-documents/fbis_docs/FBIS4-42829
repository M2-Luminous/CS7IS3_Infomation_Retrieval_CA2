The EU commissioner in charge of justice and internal affairs, Padraig Flynn, said "drug addiction and trafficking present a major threat for Europe's citizens." He said the problems called for a "coordinated reaction by the Union and its member states." The action plan presented by Flynn suggests better use could be made of the Netherlands-based Europol to achieve police, customs and legal cooperation to fight drug trafficking. The plan also suggests greater cooperation with third countries either in the framework of existing international agreements or by negotiating specific agreements.
