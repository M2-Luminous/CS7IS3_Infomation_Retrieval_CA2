Having based its foreign policy on defending rights of the world's oppressed, from the triumph of the Islamic revolution in 1979, Tehran, which severed ties with racist Pretoria, is to resume its economic and political relations now that a popularly elected government has come to power in South Africa. The Iranian Cabinet approved establishment of economic-political ties with South Africa in January 1994 with the collapse of apartheid and commissioned the Foreign Ministry to pave the way for removing the sanctions against the country and set up relations with it. Economic and political experts anticipate establishment of firm and multilateral relations between Iran and South Africa and foresee steady expansion in the future. According to informed sources, South Africa, which was once the main consumer of Iranian oil, intends to resume its economic ties with Iran by importing crude oil, and the first official agreement to be signed between the two countries is expected to include the supply of Iranian crude oil for South African refineries. Iran expressed interest in improving its economic and trade ties with the country a month after the lifting of United Nation's economic sanctions against it. Now it is expected that Iran would play an active and substantial role in South Africa's economic programmes and that the two countries' volume of exchange would rise to dlrs. [dollars] 100 per annum very soon. The valuable experiences of Iranian experts and specialists over the years of reconstruction following the victory of the revolution would enable them to have an active part in development of housing and power generation in South Africa which declared it would spend dlrs. 108 billion on housing, electricity and employment within the coming five years. [Word indistinct] the lack of a clear prospect in Iran's economic relations with South Africa, experts believe that mutual interests and connections between the two nations and their leaders provide a proper foundation for Tehran and Pretoria to build up deep political, economic, cultural and social ties.
