The resistance of HT&hyph;CP wheels to development of residual tensile rim stress is a function of the design of the wheels and the manufacturing processes used. 3. In-service wheel failure data and experimental data show that HT&hyph;CP wheels have an incidence of residual tensile rim stress and of wheel failure that is approximately the same as non-discolored HT&hyph;CP wheels. 4. Transport Canada, the Canadian rail safety agency, does not prohibit the use of discolored curved-plate wheels on railroad freight cars. Canadian data collected over nine years similarly show that discolored and non-discolored HT&hyph;CP wheels fail for residual tensile rim stress related reasons at approximately the same rate. 5. New air brake testing procedures have significantly reduced the likelihood of sticking brakes_the principal cause of the development of residual tensile rim stress in HT&hyph;CP wheels. 6. Removal of HT&hyph;CP wheels costs the railroad industry approximately $40 million per year, yet provides no discernible safety benefit. Data Collection on Premature Wheel Failure AAR proposes a data collection program that will provide a data base which can be used to make sound decisions about railroad freight car wheels, particularly HT&hyph;CP wheels.
