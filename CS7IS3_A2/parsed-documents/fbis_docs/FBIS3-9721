That means that the ODS (66 deputies in the 200-seat parliament) will insist on its stand although some ODS deputies spoke with their coalition colleagues about a possible compromise on Friday [25 March]. The ODS has favored that this year it would be determined what senators would be elected for two, four or six years. The coalition is divided over the issue, as the minor parties, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA, 14 deputies), the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL, 15) and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS, 10) prefer a different system consisting of 27 three-mandate constituencies. The opposition is against having a Senate at all and is calling for its abolition. "This is the only way to apply the electoral system stipulated by the Czech Constitution," Petrova stressed. During Monday's coalition talks Premier and ODS Chairman Vaclav Klaus told his partners that his party had not been fully informed on the steps of some of its deputies regarding the compromise. Today the ODS leadership appointed Klaus to deal with the coalition partners on the issue.
