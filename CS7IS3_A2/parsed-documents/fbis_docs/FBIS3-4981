"At the moment, I cannot be optimistic or pessimistic about the future of the contact," Song said upon return to Seoul from the truce village. While explaining about the talks he just had with the North before a group of reporters, Song said North Korea unreasonably raised two new issues in addition to their oft-repeated demands for the suspension of "nuclear war games" and the South's renouncement of its international cooperative system over the nuclear question. The vice minister said it is ridiculous for North Korea to dispute the issue of purely defensive Patriot missiles while they themselves test-fired "Nodong-1" missiles. President Kim Yong-sam's remarks which North Korea disputed were a justifiable statement under the then circumstances. "North Korea seems trying to engineer the projected exchange of special envoys in a direction favorable to them while delaying the talks on the strength of their new demands," he said. Song said that it seems at the moment North Korea is less interested in the exchange of special envoys. But, there may be a last-minute aboutface on the part of North Korea as they are well aware that the third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level talks could take place on March 21 only after special envoys were exchanged between the two Koreas, Song said.
