The pretext for the deportation was that they were "unreliable" in districts bordering on Turkey. Most of the deportees were Moslemized-Turkefied Georgians, as is confirmed by plenty of historical documents, and I will not dwell on this matter here. Much has been written and said about the historical processes that resulted in that demographic pattern in Meskhetia-Dzhavakhetia. Let me recapitulate: first, incorporation by the Ottoman Empire, followed by Tsarist Russia's long-range anti-Georgian actions, and finally the Soviet system's monstrous nationality policy, cut a substantial portion of the Georgian people off from their native culture, deprived them of their language, destroyed their national consciousness, and finally made them victims to Stalinist repression--the Mohammedan Meskhetians were uprooted from their native soil, and the final thread linking them to their motherland was broken. There in Central Asia, in a Moslem environment, they became further denationalized. Today, they find it difficult to give a definite answer to the question, "Who are you?" They shrug their shoulders, look at each other, start to speak, argue, and finally... they look at us as if to say, You hold the key to that mystery, you know more. After the deportation, two groups of political leaders arose, with opposing orientations--pro-Georgian and pro-Turkish. The pro-Turkish leaders emphasize the deportee's present situation--Moslem religion, Turkish language, and Azberbaijani surnames and nationality listed in their documents. These leaders engage in falsifying history and they instill among their own people and broad segments of society the notion that Meskhetia was historically inhabited by Turkish tribes, and that they themselves are descendants of these tribes. The pro-Georgian leaders (L. Baratashvili, Kh. Gozalishvili, and I. Varsknelidze), drawing upon historical documents, tried to restore and reenforce Georgian national consciousness among the people. They always cooperated with Georgia's leading intellectuals and also, though not always successfully, tried to establish contact with the Georgian government. Everyone wants to return to his homeland, regardless of national orientation. This problem became especially acute after the Fergana tragedy. Let me also add that of all the peoples of the former Soviet Union who were deported in 1944, only the Mohammedan Meskhetians have failed to gain real rehabilitation; they are the only ones who have not been repatriated. The hysteria that broke out in 1989-91 regarding this unfortunate people did so much to poison our society's consciousness that its effects are still felt. This long-suffering people should be returned to their homeland, but our country's vital interests demand that the Meskhetians be brought back with a Georgian national consciousness. What is being done in Georgia to accomplish this task? The deportee issue is being dealt with by both legislative agencies (the Commission for the Protection of Human Rights and National Minorities Affairs) and executive bodies (the Committee for the Protection of Human Rights and Interethnic Relations, the Refugees and Settlement Committee). In addition, a governmental commission to settle the deportee problem has been set up--though only formally so far. Despite all these protectors, things are not getting anywhere. The Parliamentary Commission has drafted several bills on deportee rehabilitation, but it is unlikely, unfortunately, that Parliament will pass them. Instead of a bill, a totally "bland" draft decree has been placed on the agenda of Parliament's plenary session, having to do with granting citizenship to repatriates. Meanwhile, our bill has been waiting in vain for Parliament's attention. Children of the deportees have been in Tbilisi for almost a year now, living in a dormitory in the Gldani district. There are about 80 boys. They are studying Georgian language and history in the Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani Pedagogical Institute. Twelve young men are trainees in the Military Academy. They are also studying Georgian. What shall we do with these boys, who keep asking us the same question every day: When are we to get our Georgian surnames and nationality back? That's the question we have been asking Parliament, and we are eagerly awaiting their answer. Things were not helped by the Head of State's Order No. 106, issued 18 May 1993, concerning the problems of deportees. The basic part of the Order remains unimplemented to this day. Just as a man cannot hide from himself, no people can escape its history. The Meskhetians' historical misfortunes are a part of our own common historical fate. The mistakes which were committed in the recent or distant past and which brought the Mohammedan population of Meskhetia-Dzhavakhetia to such a tragic plight, are something we have to rectify. It is a sad reality of Georgia's history that being cut off for so long from their native culture has brought it about that the Mohammedan Meskhetians do not know their identity, and today, left without a homeland, they have come to our door and are meekly waiting (bless their patience!) for us to let them come home. I'll go further: even those deportees who, under the influence of the pro-Turkish orientation, consider themselves Turks, deserve our care and protection. Especially considering experience we have had in which, given the necessary explanation work and sincere treatment, these people have turned back to Georgianness. The fact that only a few of the Mohammedan Meskhetians who were repatriated in the 1970s and 1980s still remain in Georgia, while the rest were expelled again, must be on our conscience alone. I take full responsibility in saying this, because I was a direct participant in that deplorable process. Clear proof of the fact that we are not taking care of those that do remain can be seen in the predicament of the Mohammedan Meskhetians living in the town of Kopitnari, Samtredskiy Rayon. Consider two aspects: schooling, and the restoration of surnames and nationality. The younger school children have to walk a long way, which is dangerous given today's crime situation, because the Mohammedan population is the most vulnerable (last October, the fighting there cost the lives of two children). There is a building in the town in which elementary classes were being taught a few years ago. For two years now the people have been asking for the classes to be resumed. They are asking for schooling, to be taught in Georgian, and we aren't doing a thing. The same is true of the reinstatement of surnames and nationality. Their applications still lie untouched in the Rayon Civil Registry Office. A Meskhetian girl named Amina, who died in the tragic events of October, had taken part in a television program in connection with the start of the school year in Georgia on 20 September, just a few days before she died. A reporter asked her what she wanted the most. Her answer--in beautiful Georgian--: "To go to school and grow up to be a good Georgian for my country." The Georgian people and those who were cut off from them must break down the barrier of distrust which was erected several years ago by the anti-Meskhetian campaign fomented by destructive forces.
