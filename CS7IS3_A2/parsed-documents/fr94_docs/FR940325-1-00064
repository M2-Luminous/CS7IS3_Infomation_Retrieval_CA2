FR940325-1-00064 FR940325-1-00008 Section 1784.6&hyph;1‚ê£Multiple Resource Advisory Councils This section would provide for the establishment of multiple resource advisory councils. One multiple resource council would be established for each BLM administrative district except when prohibited by factors such as limited interest in participation, geographic isolation in terms of proximity to users and public lands, or where the configuration and character of the lands is such that organization of councils along BLM district boundaries is not the most effective means for obtaining advice for the management of the ecosystems or resources of the area. The exceptions are intended to provide for situations such as those encountered in Alaska where it is difficult for interested persons to participate because of extreme travel distances, or situations where management of neighboring BLM districts or portions of districts involving similar lands and ecosystems can best be served by organizing a multiple resource advisory council along boundaries other than BLM district administrative boundaries. The determination of the area for which a multiple resource advisory council would be organized would be the responsibility of the affected BLM State Director. Organization by ecoregion boundaries would be encouraged where appropriate. The Governors of the affected States and established multiple resource advisory councils could petition the Secretary to establish a multiple resource advisory council for a specific BLM resource area. Multiple resource advisory councils would provide advice to the Bureau of Land Management official to whom it reports regarding the preparation, amendment and implementation of land use plans. The councils would also assist in establishing other long-range plans and resource management priorities in an advisory capacity. The Department intends that this would include providing advice on the development of plans for range improvement or development programs and has included in the proposed amendments to 43 CFR subpart 4120 a requirement for consultation with multiple resource advisory councils in the planning of range improvement or development programs. Multiple resource advisory councils would not provide advice on personnel management, nor would they provide advice on the allocation and expenditure of funds subsequent to budget planning. Appointments to multiple resource advisory councils would be made by the Secretary. In making appointments, the Secretary would consider nominations from the Governor of the affected State and nominations received in response to a public call for nominations. The Secretary would encourage Governors to develop their nominations through an open public process. In reviewing nominations submitted by the Governors, the Secretary would consider whether an open public process was used. All nominations would be required to be accompanied by letters of recommendation from interests or organizations to be represented that are located within the area for which a council is organized. The Secretary would appoint 15 members to each multiple resource advisory council. Five members would be selected from persons representing commodity industries, developed recreational activities, or use of public lands by off-highway vehicles; five would be selected from representatives of nationally or regionally recognized environmental or resource conservation groups and wild horse and burro interest groups, from representatives of archeological and historical interests, and from representatives of dispersed recreational activities; and five would be selected from persons who hold State, county, or local elected office, and representatives of the public-at-large, Indian tribes within or adjacent to the area, natural resource or natural science academia, and State agencies responsible for the management of fish and wildlife, water quality, water rights, and State lands. The proposed rule would require that at least one of the members appointed to each council must hold elected State, county, or local office. An individual would not be allowed to serve on more than one multiple resource advisory council at any given time.
