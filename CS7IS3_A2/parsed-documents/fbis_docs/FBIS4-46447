Police said the checkpoint, half a mile from the town centre on the Blaney Road, was manned by both police and troops. A spokesman said the number and extent of the casulties was not known. No members of the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] were thought to have been hurt and first reports indicated no one was killed. A single Mark 15 IRA mortar appeared to have been fired at the checkpoint from a VW van stopped a short distance down the road, said the spokesman. The mortar is said to have missed the checkpoint but to have exploded nearby. The checkpoint is part of the huge security cordon the army and police have thrown around the area in recent weeks to protect construction workers strengthening the fortifications around the frequently attacked security base in Crossmaglen. The Army said three soldiers had been injured and taken to Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry. Their injuries were not life threatening. One civilian was treated by a local doctor, said police. The mortar, which the IRA admitted firing, just missed the VCP [vehicle checkpoint] and caused damage to a nearby house. Police said later up to four civilians suffered minor injuries. A police spokesman said there was no warning about the attack. "The attack was carried out by vicious and ruthless men who care nothing for the life and limb of any individual."
