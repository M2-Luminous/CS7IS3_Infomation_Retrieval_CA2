In an action with respect to the standards and authentication system, the Ministry of Transport [MOT] will station officials in the United States on a permanent basis to help facilitate U.S. auto manufacturers' acquisition of "model certification" from Japan. The government will also study how it can support import car exhibitions held by the private sector. These plans will be incorporated into the "general measures on foreign trade" [taigai sogo taisaku] which will be finalized in the middle of March. Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corporation and Nissan Motor Company have decided to prepare voluntary import plans primarily aimed at buying U.S.-made auto parts in 1995. These plans will be announced in March. The government wants to secure understanding of the United States by emphasizing that both the government and the private sector are making efforts -- toward reopening the talks. The government measures will give priority to creating circumstances which can contribute to promoting purchases of U.S.-made automobiles and auto parts. Model certification is a system whereby the MOT will check and determine whether the models of vehicles [to be imported] meet the safety criteria of Japan or not. Once certification is issued, vehicles of the certified models can be sold in the Japanese market without inspection in the country. Since inspections of individual vehicles by the government are not necessary, the system will contribute to lessening manufacturers' burdens. The MOT has decided to give preferential treatment to stationing its inspectors in Detroit beginning in April to deal with applications for model certification by U.S. manufacturers. As far as U.S. demands for easing the standards and authentication system are concerned, specific plans will be worked out by increasing the frequency of meetings of Japanese and U.S. transport authorities' specialists on standards and authentication, and by setting a deadline for arriving at a conclusion in the meetings. The auto maintenance service industry will be advised not to discriminate against foreign-made parts. The possibility of the government providing support for imports -- in the form of the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) backing up import car exhibitions and business conferences -- is also being considered. With respect to the framework talks on automobiles and auto parts, Toyota Motor Corporation and Nissan Motor Company will prepare and announce their voluntary plans on procurement of U.S.-made products in March. They are studying whether to indicate procurement plans in monetary amounts. They will also make public details of already-agreed-on cooperation projects including sales plans in Japan of vehicles from the U.S. Big Three. It is likely that other companies like Honda Motor Company and Mitsubishi Motors Corporation will eventually prepare similar plans, even though the companies will be presenting them as the companies' own purchase plans, and not as "pledges" to the United States. Regarding four [as published] other areas including government procurement, competitiveness, and deregulation, a meeting of cabinet members concerned will be held to finalize specific plans on 25 February. The specific plans will include adoption of a general evaluation system in some parts of the telecommunications, medical equipment, and government procurement, and an announcement of the plans will be made on or around 10 March.
