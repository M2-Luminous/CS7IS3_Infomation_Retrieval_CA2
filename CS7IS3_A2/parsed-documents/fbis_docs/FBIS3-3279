This was stated by Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of the Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, at a seminar on Tuesday [15 March], which was attended by advisors on local district affairs. Owing to sabotage of the British side, it is impossible to implement the so-called "through train" arrangements, which allows legislators elected in 1995 to remain in office after July 1, 1997, when China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, Zheng said. As part of the framework with which Britain ruled Hong Kong, the last district boards, the two municipal councils and the Legislative Council under the British administration will surely terminate along with the colonialist reign, he stressed. As the transfer of power is approaching, Zheng said, "we must rely on Hong Kong compatriots, including Hong Kong advisors, to make good preparations for works in all fields during the transitional period and make every possible effort to keep Hong Kong stable and prosperous." During the seminar, many Hong Kong district affairs advisors threw their support to a motion, proposed by Cheng Yiu-tong, a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), and agreed by other 30-odd delegates, on the reorganization of the three-tier councils. District affairs advisor Fok Ting-hung deems it necessary for the NPC, which serves as the highest organ of the state power in China, to approve the motion.
