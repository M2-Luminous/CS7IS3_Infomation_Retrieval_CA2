FR941205-0-00043 FR941205-0-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;74&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9079; AD 94&hyph;24&hyph;06] Airworthiness Directives; Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and &hyph;700A Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and &hyph;700A series airplanes, that requires installation of two new circuit breakers in the 6 volt output circuits of the flight deck lighting transformers on electrical Panel `RY,' below the right pilot's seat. This amendment is prompted by a report of smoke in the flight deck due to a lighting transformer 6 volt output circuit short circuiting to ground. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent smoke or fire in the flight deck due to inadequate circuit protection for 6 volt circuits of the flight deck lighting transformer. DATES: Effective January 4, 1995. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of January 4, 1995. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Raytheon Corporate Jets, Inc., Customer Support Department, Adams Field, P.O. Box 3356, Little Rock, Arkansas 72203. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and &hyph;700A series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38143). That action proposed to require installation of two new circuit breakers in the 6 volt output circuits of the flight deck lighting transformers on electrical Panel `RY,' below the right pilot's seat. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify this requirement. The FAA has determined that this addition will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. The FAA estimates that 202 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $222,200, or $1,100 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
