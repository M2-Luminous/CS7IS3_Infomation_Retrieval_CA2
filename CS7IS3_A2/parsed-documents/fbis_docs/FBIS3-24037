Dubovoy: place and date not given: "Poor-Quality Justice Costing the Government Dearly"] [Text] The process involved in establishment of the democratic state of Moldova is inconceivable without reorganization and perfection of the entire judicial and legal system. Over the past several years a concept for legal reform was worked out in the republic, and enforceable enactments were adopted regulating the transformation processes. The achievements as well as difficulties that have been encountered were discussed with our correspondent by Alexei Barbaneagra, minister of justice of the republic of Moldova. [Dubovoy] Mister Minister, the draft of a concept for judicial reform in the republic of Moldova was prepared by the Ministry of Justice, and you personally were one of its creators. A draft law on judicial and legal reform was likewise prepared and submitted to parliament for review, but there are still no results. What is the reason for that? [Barbaneagra] The situation is indeed the way you described it. I am not clear as to the reasons why the draft law on legal reform in the republic of Moldova was not reviewed by the old parliament. I believe that the new parliament, realizing the importance attached to the resolution of this question, will include it in its agenda. After all, in our opinion legal reform must serve to guarantee statehood and democracy and the successful advance of economic transformations, because of which its earliest possible adoption is necessary. Thus far republic legal organs continue performing their functions relying on laws which, unfortunately, have nothing but a negative effect on the results of our activity. [Dubovoy] Another year has passed. What was it like for the judicial organs of the republic and the Ministry of Justice as a whole? [Barbaneagra] Over the past year work at the ministry was aimed at the elaboration of draft laws and enforceable enactments, submission of conclusions regarding new laws, systematization of legislation, and the provision of Moldovan citizens with necessary legal information. Last year alone personnel of the ministry prepared and provided conclusions on 1,160 draft enforceable enactments. Judicial activity deserves particular attention. Last year the courts handled 12,005 criminal cases, which is 852 cases more than in 1992, along with some 30,368 civil cases. Practically all of them were reviewed. So far, however, we are not satisfied with the activity of rayon and city district courts as there are frequent cases of delays in the review of cases which leaves something to be desired with respect to the case review process itself. That is why, for the purpose of improving the skill levels of judges the ministry organized probationary training at the Supreme Court in 1993 for 75 young jurists while more than 80 judges underwent professional re-certification. Unfortunately judges themselves commit violations of the law, because of which 12 judges as well as 18 bailiffs were punished last year for various infractions. The physical plant at the courts needs strengthening, it is necessary to provide them with technical means. Computers, Xerox machines, and other modern technical facilities--all that so far is only a dream for us. [Dubovoy] Alexei Afanasyevich. You stated that the judges also break the law. In this connection how is the law on languages being enforced by court personnel? [Barbaneagra] We are monitoring its enforcement and I am pleased to note that by comparison with 1989, when not a single sentence was passed in the state language or a ruling given, last year the majority of sentences (in 63 percent of the criminal and 52.2 percent of civil cases) were passed in the courts of Moldova in the Romanian language. That, in turn, means that judges are making their contribution to the consolidation of the law on languages. [Dubovoy] Recently the Ministry of Justice of the republic of Moldova established close ties with international legal organs, institutes, and the like. Which of the contacts are clearly promoting the expansion of links between jurists of Moldova and those of other countries while strengthening legal organs in the republic. What are some of the initial results of such collaboration? [Barbaneagra] There is no doubt that we need such contacts not only for the exchange of views, but also for close cooperation with international legal organizations which are manifesting lively interest in all that is taking place within the republic of Moldova and are helping us with the elaboration of enforceable enactments, conducting expert reviews of laws that have already been adopted, and promoting the integration of our state in the world legal community. Close ties with representatives of the European Community, the CSCE Mission, the European Council, the Association of American Lawyers, the For Democracy Fund, and with others were established. Our jurists participated in the work of international symposiums and conferences on legal issues. On more than one occasion we received invitations from various international organizations for us to study judicial systems functioning in different countries. Recently personnel from our ministry visited Germany, Italy, and Switzerland where they studied the operation of law enforcement organs. Experts from international organizations favored the extension of aid to specialists of Moldova in the area of law, and the problem concerning training and retraining of our personnel is being resolved along with the one pertaining to the provision of courts of the republic with necessary technical means. We are striving to expand the sphere of such contacts and to create all possible premises for fruitful collaboration with jurists in foreign countries to the benefit of our republic. [Dubovoy] An important place in the work of the Ministry of Justice is occupied by the preparation and conclusion of international agreements on legal aid and legal relations in the area of civil, criminal and family law. A few words about how this area of jurisprudence is faring. [Barbaneagra] The elaboration of such agreements is a complicated and a laborious matter. As of today Moldova has signed agreements on legal aid and legal relations in the area of civil, criminal, and family law with Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, and Lithuania. In the very near future such agreements will be concluded with Georgia and Azerbaijan, as well as other republics of the former USSR. As far as legal aid for the population is concerned, as a result of a significant rise in the cost of legal services of jurists, the citizens of Moldova are reverting to their services much less frequently which, for understandable reasons, cannot help but alert us since that, I am assuming, is also a matter of state policy. [Dubovoy] What else is of concern to the minister of justice? [Barbaneagra] A rise in the crime rate, a certain pathological lack of respect for existing laws is disturbing. Democratic transformations in the republic are being hindered by delays in the adoption of judicial and legal reforms. The imperfect nature of the legislation and in certain cases its absence, makes it impossible to resolve many vitally important problems of society. One would like to believe that many of today's problems will be resolved and democratic transformations in the Republic of Moldova will acquire a firm legal basis. [Dubovoy] Thank you.
