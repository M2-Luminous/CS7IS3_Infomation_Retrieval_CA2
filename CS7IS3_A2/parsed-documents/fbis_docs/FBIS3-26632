Quoting an old Chinese saying that "on festive occasions more than ever one thinks of his dear ones far away", the premier said that while celebrating the Spring Festival, "we more than ever think of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao compatriots and the Overseas Chinese ." On the question of Taiwan, he said that it is the common will of all the Chinese people to promote reunification of their motherland in accordance with the principle of "peaceful reunification, and one country, two systems". In the past year, economic cooperation across the Taiwan Straits continued to develop and exchanges between people on the two sides were expanded, while initial understanding was reached in business negotiations, the premier said, adding that "we are happy with such progress". He expressed the hope that the Taiwan authorities will value national interests above everything else and work together with the mainland to push forward the process of reunification. Li Peng voiced satisfaction with the smooth cooperation between China and Portugal on the question of Macao, but noted that the responsibility for the suspension of the Sino-British negotiations lay on the British side. He said that no matter what will occur, the Chinese Government and people are determined and capable to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and to maintain long-term stability and prosperity there. On foreign relations, Li said China, along with other countries, will make unremitting efforts toward the establishment of a new international political and economic order, the maintenance of world peace and the promotion of common development.
