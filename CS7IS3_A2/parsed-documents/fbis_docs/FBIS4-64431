He said they should be prepared to take the long term view and make commitments to the country now, rather than waiting until later when rivals will have put down roots. The UK's exporting future lies in the dynamic trade area of the Asia Pacific Rim and Vietnam could be the next Asian tiger. Speaking , Needham said: "The Vietnamese Government is keen to work with UK partners and has introduced one of the most liberal foreign investment laws in Southeast Asia. I strongly urge anyone considering joint venture activity to make the most of Vietnam's great potential in the rich butunder-developed agricultural and mineral sectors. ``Vietnam has a lot going for it: a wide range of energy and mineral resources; an increasingly productive agricultural sector; an important strategic position and -- not least -- a huge, well educated, resourceful workforce. ``But Vietnam has still to develop a full commercial infrastructure. Power, water systems, transport, ports, airports and communications, some of which will be multinational aid funded, are all essential if Vietnam is to develop its industrial base. ``This need is at the centre of the opportunities for British companies to make the most of the expertise and skills they have developed in equally tough markets.'' Exports to Vietnam started from a low base but are rising (2.2 million pounds in 1988 to 17 million pounds in 1993.) Figures for the first two months of this year have already matched the total for last year -- this does not take into account indirect exports via Singapore and Hong Kong which could double these figures. Needham warned that competition would be tough, particularly since the lifting of the US embargo. He outlined a number of steps the government was taking to help improve our chances against the competition: - The UK was the first Western country to restore medium and longterm export insurance cover and has offered a mix of aid and export credit to support 50 million pounds of business; - 10 million pounds has been made available by the Overseas Development Administration for a number of technical cooperation projects; - The Offshore Supplies Office of the Department of Trade and Industry [DTI] has provided advice to the Vietnamese Government on the oil and gas support industries -- there have been four missions to the country so far; - A DTI export promoter, David Kemp, on secondment from British Gas, has been appointed to to give advice to companies on the Vietnamese market.
