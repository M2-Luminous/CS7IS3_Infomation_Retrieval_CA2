The high-ranking official, who returned from Havana today, said both governments are interested in beginning the transaction. Nule Amin also indicated that the first shipments of Colombian petroleum to the Caribbean island will be made some time between June and July. "We expect to finalize some details, such as payment and timeframe formulas" very soon, Nule Amin said. The minister explained that "these will be direct sales," making it known that the transactions will not involve any type of compensation or barter mechanisms. Guido Nule Amin emphasized that during the negotiations it was made clear that Colombia is willing to sell petroleum to Cuba, but under the same "conditions that prevail on the international market." The Colombian minister said Cuba currently consumes 50,000-60,000 barrels of petroleum and that, according to what was agreed upon in Havana, Colombia will initially supply one-third of Cuba's fuel supply. Colombia produces approximately 420,000 barrels a day. It consumes half of that amount and exports the rest.
