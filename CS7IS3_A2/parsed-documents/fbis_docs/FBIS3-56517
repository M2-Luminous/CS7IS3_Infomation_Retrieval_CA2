Meri said after the signing this is "a historic decision that will have a stabilizing effect not only on Estonia but on the entire northern Europe, and which concerns all Estonia's neighbors." In the president's view, neither a system of agreements nor a well-equipped army offer the most reliable guarantees of peace, but a democratic system of government. "Democratic states never pose a danger to each other," he said. "Partnership for Peace was the best NATO could at present offer to East European states," Meri said. Commenting on Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas' bid for full NATO membership, Meri said Estonia and Lithuania face different problems, and that there are no foreign troops in Lithuania nor territorial issues that need solving. Laar said Lithuania did not inform the Estonian Government of its request for NATO membership alluding to problems arising from the differences between the Estonian and the Lithuanian Constitutions. He affirmed, however, that the meetings of the three states' premiers have repeatedly touched on Baltic cooperation in the framework of the Partnership for Peace program. The Estonian premier cited the setting up of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion as a concrete step in this direction. Asked whether the joint signing of the letter today signifies "domestic peace" between the president and the prime minister, Meri said, "The joint signing of this document should rule out such rhetorical questions being asked here today."
