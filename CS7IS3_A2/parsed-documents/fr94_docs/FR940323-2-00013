FR940323-2-00013 FR940323-2-00012 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;401&hyph;601] Brass Sheet and Strip From Sweden; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: International Trade Administration/Import Administration Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (the Department) has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on brass sheet and strip from Sweden. The review covers exports of this merchandise to the United States by one manufacturer/exporter during the period March 1, 1991 through February 29, 1992. The review indicates the existence of dumping margins for this period. As a result of this review, the Department has preliminarily determined to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between United States price (USP) and foreign market value (FMV). We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Valerie Turoscy, Chip Hayes, or John Kugelman, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;5253. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 6, 1987, the Department published in the Federal Register (52 FR 6998) the antidumping duty order on brass sheet and strip from Sweden. On April 13, 1992, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(c), we initiated an administrative review of Outokumpu Copper Rolled Products AB (OAB) for the period March 1, 1991 through February 29, 1992 (57 FR 12797). The Department is now conducting this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). In addition, from December 6, 1993 to December 10, 1993 we verified OAB's responses for this administrative review and found that, in general, OAB's records supported the information which OAB submitted to the Department. Scope of Review Imports covered by this review are sales or entries of brass sheet and strip, other than leaded and tinned brass sheet and strip, from Sweden. The chemical composition of the products under review is currently defined in the Copper Development Association (C.D.A.) 200 Series or the Unified Numbering System (U.N.S.) C20000 series. This review does not cover products the chemical compositions of which are defined by other C.D.A. or U.N.S. series. The merchandise is currently classified under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 7409.21.00 and 7409.29.20. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. This review covers one manufacturer/exporter, OAB. United States Price We based USP on purchase price (PP), in accordance with section 772(b) of the Tariff Act, because the subject merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers in the United States prior to importation into the United States. We calculated PP based on C.I.F., duty paid prices, delivered either to independent U.S. warehouses or to the customers' premises. In accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Tariff Act we made deductions, where appropriate, for U.S. point-to-point freight, point-to-point insurance, brokerage and handling, customs duty, and cash discounts.
