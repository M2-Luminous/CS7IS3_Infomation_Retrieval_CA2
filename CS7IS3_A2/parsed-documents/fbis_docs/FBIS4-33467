He requested today that one official and two agents be investigated for torturing a union member. In the first action he has taken as national police commissioner--a newly created post--Salamanca asked the local police commander to file charges against Captain Wilson Laverde and agents Cesar Cacua and Pedro Tangarife. According to a preliminary investigation, Laverde, Cacua, and Tangarife tortured union leader Luis Antonio Tellez physically and psychologically. Tellez and his partner Aida Luz Martinez had been arrested for distributing subversive literature and throwing explosive devices to disturb public order during a march to commemorate Labor Day on 1 May. According to the commissioner, the police tortured Tellez physically and psychologically to obtain a confession that was not a true assessment of the activities in which he was involved. Criticizing the incident, Salamanca said this violation constitutes a serious attack against the validity of human rights and the image of the institution. Salamanca added that his office will follow very closely the progress of the investigation to be initiated by the local police commander. The incident was revealed at a time the government is conducting a thorough review of human rights in order to improve the country's image before the international community. As part of this campaign, the government has scheduled a meeting with its 14 ambassadors in Europe on 9 June.
