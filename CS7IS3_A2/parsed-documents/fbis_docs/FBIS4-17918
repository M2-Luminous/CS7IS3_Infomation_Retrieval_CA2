In Conversation with your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Correspondent, Tair Mansurov, Ambassador of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Considers New Forms of Deepening the Integration of the Post-Soviet Republics"] [Text] The idea of creating a Eurasian Union consisting of the CIS member countries belongs to Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan. When putting this idea forward at a meeting with professors and students of the Moscow State University, Nursultan Abishevich was being consistent. Several times previously he had put the proposal to strengthen cooperation among the former Union republics to his colleagues in the Commonwealth. He received the Treaty on Economic Union with satisfaction and supported the Collective Security Treaty. Now there is this new initiative. "It is hard to call the present CIS a Commonwealth," Kazakhstani Ambassador Tair Mansurov said, explaining his president's proposal. "In the three years of its existence over 400 joint documents have been adopted, but more than half of them have not been ratified by the national parliaments and those which have been ratified are not operating. In addition, some members of the CIS are in a state of open war and many are waging economic battles against one another. In these conditions it is hard to talk about the mutual aid and support, characteristic of a really integrated association..." My interlocutor was a builder by trade, a politician by necessity. For more than 10 years he built homes and industrial facilities, worked for the party, was elected to Kazakhstan's Supreme Soviet, and represented his people in the USSR parliament's Soviet of the Republics. At the same time he directed the "Kazakhstan" development fund, which performs educational and cultural functions. In January 1994 he accepted N. Nazarbayev's proposal to head the embassy in Moscow. He recently presented his credentials to President Yeltsin. He is a convinced supporter of political and economic union with Russia. He took part in the top-level talks during the Kazakhstani President's first official visit to Russia recently. He is proud of the fact that he has contributed to the elaboration of 23 draft interstate agreements signed at the level of presidents and heads of government, including the treaties on Baykonur and the simplification of the procedure for obtaining citizenship when residents move from Russia to Kazakhstan or vice versa. "Nursultan Abishevich's new initiative -- on the Eurasian Union -- is on the same plane," Tair Mansurov explained. "The president's idea is that now, in conditions of the independence and equal rights of the republics, it is possible to create a completely new interstate association capable of overcoming the shortcomings of the present CIS...." Tair Mansurov said that President Nazarbayev sees three main corner stones at the basis of the Eurasian Union: -- Common supranational organs for the coordination (management) of the economy, defense, and foreign policy; -- A single economic area; and -- A common defense complex. The supranational institutions include councils of the heads of state and the heads of government, the parliament, councils of defense ministers and foreign ministers, and the interstate executive committee -- a standing organ whose leader is appointed by the heads of state for a term specified by them. As for the single economic area, it can be built, for example, on such foundations as the coordination of economic policy and the adoption of obligatory joint programs, a common legislative base to regulate relations among the economic components, a supranational currency along the lines of the European ECU, the coordination of direct ties between enterprises, the creation of mixed and joint industrial-financial and transport firms, trading houses, and commodity exchanges. The defense and foreign policy complexes can be equally effective. Through its executive committee the Eurasian Union should receive the status of a fully-fledged representative in all the leading interstate organizations. "It goes without saying that innovation is always greeted with caution," the ambassador said. "So it was that the reaction to the Eurasian Union was mixed too. It is a pity that Nursultan Abishevich was sick and unable to share his ideas with the participants in the Moscow summit. But we know that many projects that seemed unfeasible have in time been put into practice. I believe that the same fate is in store for the President of Kazakhstan's initiative.
