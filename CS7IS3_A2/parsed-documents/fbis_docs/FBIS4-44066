The talks on price stability, sound public finances and labour market flexibility were brief, the main points having already been approved at a meeting of the EU member's ministers of economy and finance two weeks ago. They had to be approved by the heads of government at the EU summit here before being formally adopted by the finance and economics ministers at their next meeting. Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen told European leaders that the union had to offer a clearer explanation to the public indicating that the policy was aimed at fighting unemployment, the source said. The convergence criteria set in the Maastricht Treaty on European economic and political union set a limit for public sector debt of 3 percent of gross domestic product. The criteria have to be met for countries to join a single European currency sector due to be agreed at the end of 1997 or 1999. Few EU member states currently meet the targets.
