[Peres] Undoubtedly. I think that it is only the start, and to tell the truth -- I am impatient. I believe we have one year in which to act. I believe that campaigning will begin next year, so that we are left with one full year. That is not a great deal of time. The Golan Heights is our last hurdle, and I ask: What do we do in that year? What do we do with that hurdle? What can we achieve on a security level? My answer to that is that a new system of relations has to be achieved also here. We have to achieve regional security. We have to insist on two conditions with the Syrians: One, comprehensive negotiations, which will end the war with all the Arab states, except for Iraq, Iran, and Libya. Second, to begin a new strategic setup that responds to the threat of missiles and nuclear arms through an early warning system and nonaggression pacts, which will provide security to the nations. It will be a joint Middle East structure, plus the United States, plus Russia, based on the NATO model. In addition, a new economic system has to be set up. Whoever thinks he can live outside the region is making a terrible mistake. I want two things: To end warfare with all the states and to set up a partnership of peace and not compulsory arbitration of former conflicts. [DAVAR] Will you have enough time to present a new geopolitical situation prior to the next elections? [Peres] We will not present a new geopolitical situation, we will recognize the existing geopolitical situation. Borders and one kilometer more or less will not decide our fate. What will decide it will be if we have an early warning system, nonaggression pacts, agreements giving warning of false alarms, and accords on arms limitations with mutual supervision. [DAVAR] Has there been progress in the contacts with Syria on those issues? [Peres] Nothing has begun yet with Syria. There has been an improvement in the atmosphere, but there are still no negotiations. What the Syrians have to understand is that what is at stake is not only peace between states, but between peoples. In other words, we have to convince our people, and the Syrians have to convince theirs, that there is something to talk about. [DAVAR] How do you convince your people? [Peres] I tell them what I think. Persuasion is done by explaining the situation and by actions. Sometimes the action precedes the explanation and sometimes the reverse. The big problem is to convince yourself and then to convince others. I do not understand why no one is reading the writing on the walls. Ask the Likud what it is offering. We have now concluded the issue of Gaza, thank God, which is good news. From here we have to go on to Syria, and then return to the West Bank. [DAVAR] Interlinked negotiations? [Peres] No, each separately. [passage omitted]
