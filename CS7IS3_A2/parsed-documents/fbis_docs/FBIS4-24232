Monique Mas has just spoken to Major Emmanuel Ndahiro, military spokesman of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front], and asked him if the RPF has softened its stand: [Begin Ndahiro recording, in English fading into French translation] Not at all. We have not changed our position toward the French intervention. Considering past French actions, we are still opposing it. They were responsible for the killings in Rwanda and we have no reason whatsoever to trust them. As you know, they have never helped solve our problems. We could not prevent them from coming here. What RPF leaders say is that if the French limit their intervention to the Zairean border and to humanitarian actions we will not clash with them. We issue a warning to the French: History has taught us that they have not come to rescue 8,000 people, but to protect the criminals who have murdered more than 500,000 people. [end recording]
