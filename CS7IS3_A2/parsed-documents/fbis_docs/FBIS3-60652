The governmental organization is made up of 25 countries. Joining Argentina as a newcomer will be Hungary. The decision is seen to be the result of a long-term policy of Foreign Minister Guido di Tella to join the international committee and was helped by President Menem's decision earlier this year to scrap the Condor missile development. In Switzerland yesterday, where the MTCR was due to stage a meeting, the Argentine representative Andres Cisneros said Menem's government "had renounced the development of offensive arms in order to participate in the highest of technological progress for peaceful ends."
