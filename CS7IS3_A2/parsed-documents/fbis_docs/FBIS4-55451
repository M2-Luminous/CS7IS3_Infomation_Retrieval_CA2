Last Friday it was the Solidarity national armaments industry section that protested. The continuation of such policies by the government of the Polish Republic is read by the work forces of armanents industry enterprises as indicating an intention to liquidate this sector of industry. This may cause an unimaginable social explosion, for the consequences of which the Government of the Polish Republic will bear responsibility. [Czerwinski] I think that the internal restructuring processes, supported by certain decisions at the level of both parliament and the government, the law on special regulations in the sphere of ownership transformations, constitute a certain political and economic indication of the fact that the government nonetheless is in favor of the maintenance of this industry, that this industry is necessary both for our economy and, above all, for our defense preparedness. And we will be doing what we are doing, but able to do so in the sphere of rescuing this industry. [Klukowska] The armaments industry consists of over 80 enterprises. Just a few years ago, we earned at least several hundred million dollars from the sale of arms every year, being the third placed exporter, after the former Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, of the countries of CEMA. [Czerwinski] The arms trade market is nonetheless a market that is very brutal and a market for professionals. The gun scandal precisely was an example of an instance where what was in practice a private company tried, without government protection, without the protection of the special services, to strike a particular deal. It was trapped by a straightforward provocation, one that could have been discovered much earlier. [Klukowska] It transpires that over 70 percent of the products of the armaments industry are civilian production, and it is precisely in this that many, inter alia the Ministry of Industry and Trade, see an opportunity for bringing this branch of the national economy back to health. [Czerwinski] Were we to rest the restructuring of the industry solely upon supplies to the Polish Army, solely upon export opportunities, this industry would not be capable of getting out of this enormous trough. That is why we decided to go for, above all, legal regulations and the protection of this industry in its special role and, thus, payment for an economic mobilizaton plan, which was adopted last year, preferential treatment as regards purchases by the Ministry of National Defense, protection and assistance by government offices for export opportunities. This, of course, very often taking into account certain international implications, as also the associations between particular enterprises of ours. [Klukowska] What is the situation of the armaments sector at this moment? [Glowacki] Tragic. If I say that at this moment remuneration has since last year, since the notorious consultation meeting, increased in essence by 500,000 zlotys [Z] and varies around a level of Z2.8 million, this is witness to what the mood is, what the situation is in these plants, and what can possibly be expected in the near future. [Klukowska] Is the issue just remuneration or the fact that you are producing, we as a state produce equipment that is not all bad, but for which there is no use? [Glowacki] Also so. Also so, although this situation is subject to change insofar as the enterprises are themselves attempting to counteract it. Nonetheless, without systemic solutions, without decisions at the level of government, we will unfortunately end up stewing in our juices. [Klukowska] When listening to trade unionists, one gets the impression that you, with your optimistic faith in the future, are nonetheless an isolated figure. They do not have such optimistic perspectives. [Czerwinski] I think this transpires from a certain long expectation. The first signs of improvement are appearing. It seems that it is at this moment appropriate to exchange this very long expectation, these starved work forces, for concrete economic results. The year 1994 will already be the year of breakthrough. It will be a year of growth, improvement of the economic situation of both enterprises and work forces as against this background. On the other hand, we expect a clear improvement; we can expect it in the years 1995-96. The enterprises ought to return to a standard level of economic efficiency on the order of 5-6 percent [as heard]. For this year, we would wish to bring about a situation in which all of the enterprises have in practice a net profit close to zero and thus are not yet too profitable but, on the other hand, do not bring losses.
