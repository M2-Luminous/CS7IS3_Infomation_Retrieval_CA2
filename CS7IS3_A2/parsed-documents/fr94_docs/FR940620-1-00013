ACTION: Proposed rule; notice of data availability. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making available for public comment additional data supporting a proposal published on February 11, 1993 (58 FR 8102). The proposal, known as the ``universal wastes'' proposal, addressed the management of certain widely-generated hazardous wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C hazardous waste management regulations. The data made available for comment by this notice are included in a document entitled ``Analysis of Potential Cost Savings and the Potential for Reduced Environmental Benefits of the Proposed Universal Wastes Rule,'' U.S. EPA, April 1994. This document is available as discussed in the ADDRESSES section below. DATES: Comments on the new data made available by this notice must be submitted on or before July 20, 1994. Please note that the comment period for the original ``universal wastes'' proposal (February 11, 1993, 58 FR 8102) closed on May 12, 1993 (see notice of extension April 8, 1993, 58 FR 18197). The Agency is not requesting additional comments on the issues discussed in that proposal. Comments are requested only on the new data made available by this notice. ADDRESSES: The data made available by this notice (``Analysis of Potential Cost Savings and the Potential for Reduced Environmental Benefits of the Proposed Universal Wastes Rule,'' U.S. EPA, April 1994) is available for review in the EPA RCRA Docket, located in Room M2616, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460. The docket is open from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays. To review docket materials, the public must make an appointment by calling (202) 260&hyph;9327. The public may copy a maximum of 100 pages from any regulatory docket at no cost. Additional copies cost $0.15 per page. Copies of the data made available by this notice, and of the original universal waste proposal, can also be obtained by mail by calling the RCRA Hotline at the numbers below. Persons who wish to comment on the notice must provide an original and two copies of their comments, include the docket number (F&hyph;94&hyph;SCSA&hyph;FFFFF), and send them to EPA RCRA Docket (5305), U.S. EPA, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. February 11, 1993 Proposal On February 11, 1993, EPA proposed a streamlined, reduced regulatory management structure for certain widespread hazardous wastes currently subject to full RCRA Subtitle C regulation, in an effort to facilitate their collection and proper management (58 FR 8102). The proposed reduced regulatory structure, known as a special collection system, is designed to ensure that management of these hazardous wastes is conducted in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment, given the diffuse and diverse population of generators of these wastes. Proposed regulatory language was included for hazardous waste batteries, and suspended and/or cancelled hazardous waste pesticides that are recalled. Several other wastes, including hazardous waste thermostats, were also discussed briefly in the preamble as possible additions to the special collection system. The Agency also included a proposed petition process to be used to add additional wastes to the special collection system in the future, and criteria to identify wastes that would be appropriate for addition. See 58 FR 8102, February 11, 1993 for a detailed discussion of the proposal. II. Description of Available Data In the February 11, 1993 ``universal wastes'' proposal (58 FR 8126) the Agency committed to: •``Analyze the costs of the current regulatory requirements for generators and collection facilities and of the requirements [proposed]''; •``Analyze whether there are significant reduced environmental benefits from the modifications being proposed''; and •Notice the analysis for comment prior to promulgating a final rule. The document made available for comment by this notice, ``Analysis of Potential Cost Savings and the Potential for Reduced Environmental Benefits of the Proposed Universal Wastes Rule,'' U.S. EPA, April 1994, presents these analyses. Part I of the document summarizes the proposed universal wastes regulations and introduces the analyses. Part II discusses and compares estimated costs of the existing Subtitle C regulations and of the proposed changes to these regulations. The conclusion of this analysis is that the proposed regulations will result in total annual savings of approximately 93 million dollars. A sensitivity analysis is also included. Part III of the document discusses whether the proposed regulatory changes will significantly reduce the environmental benefits provided by the current Subtitle C regulations. The conclusion of this analysis is that the proposed reduced regulations will not significantly diminish the environmental protection currently provided by the full Subtitle C regulations. The Agency is requesting comment on the methodology used and the results of both the cost analysis and the analysis of potential significantly reduced environmental benefits. Dated: June 13, 1994.
