The source, who supervised the Palestinian delegation to the latest round of negotiations, said agreement on many issues has been reached with the Israelis. These include the size and deployment of the Palestinian police force, linking the deployment of the force and the Israeli pullout of Gaza and Jericho with the release of Palestinian detainees and civil affairs, the source said. Geographic jurisdiction and the judiciary system in the Palestinian autonomous region are now being discussed, the source added. The source said 'Arafat will enter Gaza and Jericho in late June or early July at the latest. He said there is an agreement within the PLO leadership that the Political Department, led by Faruq Qaddumi, and the Arab and International Department, led by Mahmud 'Abbas, remain in Tunis. Informed Palestinian sources said the readiness expressed by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday to dismantle some settlements in the occupied territories as part of efforts to achieve a permanent peace with the Palestinians constitutes a serious beginning toward ending over 50 years of enmity. The sources expressed a belief that the recent operations in 'Afula and Hadera, in which many Israelis were killed, will give the negotiations more momentum than expected. Other Palestinian sources said the recent telephone conversation between Rabin and 'Arafat dealt with some aspects of the Declaration of Principles, especially the pressing Palestinian desire to get the negotiations into their final stage. The sources said that many sides are now making efforts toward this end. They added that 'Arafat expressed his full preparedness to enter into this final stage.
