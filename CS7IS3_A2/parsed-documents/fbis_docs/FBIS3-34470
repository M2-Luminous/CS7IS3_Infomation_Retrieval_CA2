The representatives submitted to the brother president the results of the Shabwah Governorate expanded popular gathering and the statement issued by the gathering which met under the slogan "For the Sake of A United And Effective Stand of the Governorate's Sons To Defend Unity, Democracy, Justice, and Social Development." The brother Presidential Council chairman spoke at the meeting. He praised the national role played by the sons of Shabwah Governorate in the march of the Yemeni revolution, the national movement, and the confrontation of the colonialist presence and the imamate regime. He praised the results of the expanded gathering of the sons of the Shabwah governorate and the positive decisions they adopted. He said these results embody a high sense of national responsibility and demonstrate a dynamic militant spirit that is committed to the homeland and eager to safeguard its unity and democratic course. The brother chairman said: The most important achievement of this gathering is the unity of ranks of the sons of the governorate, irrespective of their party affiliations. He added: This is a great gain for this governorate which suffered much, whether before or after the independence. Its sons have offered convoys of martyrs for the sake of independence. They also offered many of its elite men as defenseless victims of the regrettable political disputes. The brother president added: Our target has been and continues to be that 22 May 1990 will be the decisive date for ending all these disputes and tragedies from which our Yemeni people have suffered much. He added that Yemeni unity is the framework for settling differences. It is the fence within whose boundaries the Yemeni family is reunited. It is the balm that soothes all the wounds of the past. The brother chairman added: However, it is regrettable that political quarrels and private interests seek to sully this beautiful picture of unity and to assassinate the joy our people feel as they proceed toward a new era where ranks are closed, hatred disappears and all work together to build the homeland, carry out development, construct roads and schools, hospitals, educational institutions, and spread services throughout Yemen. The brother chairman said: However, it is regrettable that some try to obstruct this so that the benefits of unity will not reach all the people who will then realize the importance and value of unity in their lives. The brother chairman said it is important to unite the efforts of the sons of the Shabwah governorate so that they work for the interest of the governorate and the homeland, and benefit from the lessons of the past. The past is replete with unfortunate lessons which should be kept in mind so that they are not repeated in our lives. The brother chairman said: Unity is the means to achieve a better future. Preserving it is a sacred national duty, and the alternative to unity will be destructive for the entire homeland. He added: All are dutybound to safeguard unity because it will prevent the return to the past where partitioning prevailed. The preservation of unity takes place through sincere and fruitful action in the field and through the decisive confrontation of all those who seek to harm unity. Addressing the audience, the sons of Shabwah Governorate, the brother chairman said: I highly value the results you have attained in your gathering. We support them because they embody a national spirit that remains committed to the constants which cannot be relinquished. We support all your legitimate demands and needs, whether in the field of services or in other fields. We will do our best to meet them within the available capabilities of the state. We are also in tune with the sentiments you have expressed that Shabwah should never again be the scapegoat or the arena for political disputes. We are confident that our homeland's future will be promising, God willing. We believe that the course of dialogue and understanding is the best approach for settling matters and disagreements. He added: Party, provincial, or religious biogtry will only cause tragedies. The brother chairman said: We were united on 22 May, and we will safeguard our homeland's unity with all the power we have. Unity brings accord, peace of mind, establishes an atmopshere of amity and fraternity, responds to the people's needs and protects their rights. Unity means safety. Without it, we will become fragmented into more than one entity. The brother chairman referred to the incident of the impounding of the large shipment of espionage, monitoring,and military telecommunications equipment which was recently confiscated by the competent authorities. He said that attempts were made to bring this shipment into the country illegally, a shipment which was impounded by the competent bodies. He said: In whose interest was this, and who paid for it? He added: Where are the regulations, the laws, and the conscience on whose basis we should account for what we do? We want to employ funds for the good of the Yemeni people, for developing the homeland, entrenching their unity, and not to harm the people and destroy the homeland. We must learn lessons from the past, and resort to reason, and not be influenced by whims and suspicions which only benefit Yemen's enemies. [passage omitted]
