On the same day he had a tete-a-tete conversation with Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. According to some information, they discussed the two sides' views on the Partnership for Peace program joined by the two states. After this, the foreign ministers signed a declaration on the principles of forming Ukrainian-Polish partnership and an agreement on protecting the graves and places in memory of victims of war and reprisals. Commenting on the results of the Ukrainian-Polish negotiations and the agreement signed, Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland Hennadiy Udovenko stated to a UNIAN correspondent that the documents signed did not signify a union between Ukraine and Poland. They did, however, make the declaration of strategic partnership more specific. The ambassador's view is that "Ukrainian-Polish relations are at a stage of stagnation and are in need of a fresh impetus," in view of which he categorically opposed the opinion of some of the Polish mass media that the minister's visit was inexpedient ahead of the elections to Ukraine's parliament. He considers the visit very topical indeed. Answering the UNIAN correspondent's question on whether the issue of Ukraine possibly joining the France-Germany-Poland geopolitical axis was discussed at the meeting, the ambassador stated Ukraine was interested in this issue but Poland had not decided yet.
