The code forbids the concentration of the market and establishes that no entity or person can own more than 10 television stations nationwide. Five of those, at most, may be VHF (Channels 1 through 13). The family of entrepreneur Roberto Marinho (Globo Network) has shares in 17 television stations, 15 of which are VHF. The official registers of the Communications Ministry show the Marinho family has 10 television concessions (eight VHF and two UHF, that is, Channels 14 and above). They also have shares in four other VHF stations in Parana State, two in Sao Paulo State, and one in Minas Gerais State. The Sirotsky family (RBS Network) has concessions for 13 VHF television stations and shares in another station in Espirito Santo State. The Saad family (Bandeirantes), the Abravanel family (SBT, Silvio Santos groups), and the Camara family (of the Anhanguera family in the Center-West Region) all surpass the limit of five VHF television stations in the entire country. The Bandeirantes group has concessions for nine VHF television stations, SBT has eight (plus one UHF station), and the Camara family has seven. These oligopolies are the result of a loophole in the law: It established limits for entities and people, but it does not consider one simple trick -- registering the concessions in the name of several companies or several members of the same family.
