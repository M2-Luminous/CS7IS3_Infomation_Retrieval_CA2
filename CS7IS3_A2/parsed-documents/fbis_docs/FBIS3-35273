This was said in the report that Clinton presented to the U.S. Congress recently, in which he reviewed the state of emergency that the United States announced toward the Jamahiriyah as of 1986. The JANA political editor commented on this, saying that what is a cause for amazement in Clinton's statement is that it came from the largest nuclear state in the world against Libya, a peaceful state facing unjust mandatory sanctions for which the U.S. Government itself is the first to be held responsible and that has practiced various pressures through threats and attraction [as received] in order to impose such measures at the UN Security Council. The editor wondered what the Great Jamahiriyah had done to constitute the danger that the U.S. President mentioned, apart from the fact that it has refused to be a lackey and dependent and has drawn for itself an independent political path based on getting friendly with those that befriend it and hostile toward those that are hostile toward it. It has also rejected infringement upon its sovereignty and its Arab nation. In this framework, it becomes clear that the primary reason behind the report of the U.S. President at this moment is the stance of the Great Jamahiriyah, which has exposed the so-called Gaza and Jericho agreement and the plan to sell Palestine and impose unconditional surrender on the Arabs. When the U.S. President says that Libya constitutes a danger for U.S. interests, by these interests he means the Israelis, because the U.S. wants Israel to be the most powerful and the Arabs to surrender and submit to their will. The editor stressed that the U.S. Government must prove this serious accusation before the UN Security Council, which must investigate it. The U.S. Government must prove how Libya constitutes a danger to the United States. JANA has learned that the secretariat of the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation will submit the text of the report that was presented by U.S. President Clinton to the Congress to the Secretariat of the General People's Congress so that it is distributed to the Basic People's Congresses so that every member is well informed of the contents of that report and the serious dimensions and meanings it contains.
