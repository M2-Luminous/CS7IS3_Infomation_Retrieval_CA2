As a minimum, the actions being taken give that appearance. And, those actions continue beyond the initial coordinated interventions in foreign exchange markets that were initiated on 4 May. However, a look at the realities indicates that it would be difficult to conclude that the policy of multilateral coordination among principal nations has been restored. Mention must also be made that the policy we speak of now is limited to treatment of the symptoms. When the German Federal Bank implemented its third interest rate reduction this year on 11 May, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said, "The move is welcome as a measure which will be useful in stimulating the economies of Germany and Europe as a whole," and displayed confidence that the cooperative posture of Japan, the United States, and the European nations was functioning effectively. The question is, to what extent is this genuine policy coordination? And to what degree is it effective? If we were to start with the conclusion, mention should be made that the actions being taken do not represent a full-scale restoration of policy coordination at the G-7 level of principal nations which comprise the summit members. As an example, Minister of Finance Hirohisa Fujii comments on policy coordination among Japan, the United States, and Germany by saying, "Coordination on interest rates was not mentioned at the G-7 meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents on 24 April." Even Bank of Japan [BOJ] President Yasushi Mieno responded to the question of whether an agreement had been reached at the G-7 level on interest policy other than market intervention to prevent a fall in the dollar, by saying, "Monetary policy is not of a nature that you would restrict actions to the foreign exchange markets or of a nature that management would be based solely on foreign exchange values. It appears that the mass media find much appeal in coordinated interest drops or hikes, but the monetary policies of the respective nations should be responsive to conditions in each country and are not conducive to calls for massive, uniform change." The United States is a nation that is conspicuous in its reluctance to respond to external pressure. The United States did not take the initiative in coordinated action to prevent a decline in the dollar only for fear of a weak dollar. Moreover, the reason did not rest with the desire to prevent an excessively strong yen. The United States took the coordinated actions out of fear of a vicious cycle reflecting an overheated U.S. economy leading to concerns for inflation, a decline in the dollar despite rising interest rates and accelerating inflation. The United States will not take action solely in response to the value of the dollar, in contrast to Japan, which is excessively sensitive to the value of the yen. Basically, when long-term U.S. interest rates rise, the United States treats the matter as a domestic issue. The reason is that higher interest rates can lead directly to lower stock prices. However, we cannot neglect the fact that the situation in the U.S. economy is susceptible to a rise in interest rates because of a drastic fall in the dollar. The primary reason for that susceptibility is the inadequate savings rate in the United States. The recent favorable economic conditions in the United States are attributable largely to an expansion of consumption based on credit. Individual savings are at an unusually low level. The U.S. economy's fundamental problem rests on this point. Domestic savings are not sufficient to cover needs arising from the fiscal deficit and demand for capital to handle capital investments. There is no choice but to rely on foreign capital inflows to cover the shortages. The U.S. Government asserts that the fiscal deficit has begun to shrink, but if savings rates fall further, the imbalances in the economy will remain unchanged. Policies that neglect to act on such structural issues can represent no more than treatment of symptoms. That being the case, Japan had better not place excessive hope on recent "coordinated" actions. [passage omitted]
