The government failed yesterday to adopt a new MSZ statute that would separate politicians from clerks. Incompetence, failure to take foreign language tests, insufficient work experience in the diplomatic service, foreign citizenship, social origins associated with landed aristocracy, "Solidarity," Judaism, and having worked for "Radio Free Europe"--these were accusations levied by the subcommittee evaluating MSZ personnel against employees who accepted diplomatic jobs after 1989. The subcommittee's report, which will be presented at a session of the Sejm Foreign Affairs Commission today, consists of two parts. The first part, which was written by the subcommittee's members, speaks of the origins of the subcommittee, lists certain criteria that diplomats should meet, and also lists accusations concerning MSZ's personnel policies. The authors of the report write that cases of employees being released from duty after 1989 "bring to the surface the issue of constitutional responsibility by the former and current foreign affairs minister." Another part of the report, the so-called supplement, contains 11 appendixes that, according to the subcommittee's members, were written by former and current MSZ employees, as well as by people from outside the MSZ. Only two of the appendixes, pertaining to several cats that were kept by one ambassador in his residence, are signed. The appendixes, which in effect amount to denunciations, contain an assessment of the MSZ's personnel policies and of foreign policy in general. The arguments that were listed most often concern membership in a social group, having been abroad before 1989, or being married to a foreigner. One of the authors of the treaty with Lithuania is being reminded that his father was a Stalinist diplomat, but the fact that the individual himself is an outstanding historian and a former member of the democratic opposition is not mentioned. Another diplomat is said to allegedly be implementing the Vatican's plans in the East because he worked for Vatican Radio in the past. In one of the appendixes, the dissolution of Comecon and the Warsaw Pact is regarded as a misfortune for Poland. Because of suspicion that the appendixes contain slanders, Professor Bronislaw Geremek, chief of the Foreign Affairs Committee, refused to distribute the report's appendix to Sejm deputies. "The appendix is an integral part of the subcommittee's report," said Tadeusz Samborski, a member of the subcommittee. "Professor Geremek's decision is unacceptable." Aside from the coalition members, the document was signed by Wojciech Lamentowicz, of the Union of Labor, and Andrzej Micewski.
