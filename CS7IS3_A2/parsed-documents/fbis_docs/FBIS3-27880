He said the U.S. move for early deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea is, in part, aimed at putting pressure on North Korea to come to an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). If the North Korean nuclear problem is solved at an early date, the anti-missile missiles could be deployed in Japan instead, the official said. He said U.S. President Clinton has not given final approval for the deployment of Patriot missiles, but is expected to approve it sooner or later. "The South Korean government agrees to the deployment in principle and the interceptor missiles will be deployed at the bases of U.S. forces here in March or April at the latest," the official said. He said the 36 Patriot missiles to be deployed here are for protection of strategic points of U.S. forces in South Korea rather than for defense of densely populated areas including Seoul and the surrounding metropolitan area. Deployment of Patriots on the Korean Peninsula is the first step in establishing the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system, which the U.S. government is pushing for on a long-term basis. Washington confirmed Wednesday it was considering deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea to defend its ally against North Korean attack. Gen. Gary Luck, commander of U.S. forces in Korea, requested deployment of Patriot missiles late last year to prepare against Scud missile attacks by North Korea.
