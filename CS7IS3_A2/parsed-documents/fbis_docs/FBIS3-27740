This is another manifestation of our government's open-door foreign policy. Although being an agonizing victim of the confrontration on human rights, we are ready to hold a dialogue on human rights because we are Vietnamese. And just as Uncle Ho put it: We are clear and straightforward. We only demand independence and freedom without harboring any personal hatred. We want the world to realize that we are a civilized nation, even more civilized than the assets-plundering and country-invading clique. It is not that those wanting to have a dialogue on human rights with us are in the same situation as us, but rather those countries which once confronted us on human rights. We are ready to a hold dialogue with them and we wonder if they will behave like civilized people while talking with us or will they display a lack of civilized attitudes as they usually do? First, we would like to talk about the United States. They once helped the French colonialists re-invade our country and they were reported to have at times shouldered as much as 60 percent of the war expense for the French. They then sent their troops to invade the southern part of our country and they launched barbarous air strikes against the north, creating untold deaths and suffering and lingering cultural, social, and environmental consequences. They have also imposed a protracted embargo against us, thus violating the right to development of our people and their legitimate human rights. It is clear that over the past 40 years, they have confronted us on human rights and now they want a dialogue on the issue. Will they prepare to repay their human rights debts for the Vietnamese people? Or will they, after failing to defeat us in their human rights confrontations, now change their tricks by resorting to a human rights dialogue to subjugate us? U.S. political circles have noisily talked about their human rights-based foreign policy. Their radio stations are daily harping about U.S. human rights values. But everyone knows that the United States itself was the mastermind of the nuclear disasters at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. While boasting about their human rights protection policy, they are trying to perfect their mass-destruction weapons. We do not want to interfere in their internal affairs, but we are aware that the United States' Declaration of Independence of 1776 stated that everyone is born equal. But since then, African Americans in their country have continued to suffer from the bad practice of deep-seated racial discrimination. Although the American black makes up only 15 percent of the U.S. population, the number of black prisoners accounts for 50 percent of the nation's total. According to figures provided by the Census Bureau in a 1992 report, 32.7 percent of American blacks live below the poverty line. This means that one in every three American blacks live below the poverty line. The gap between the rich and the poor is extremely wide. In 1991, the annual income of one-fifth of the richest Americans constituted 46.5 percent of the total national income. Whereas, the annual income of one-fifth of the poorest accounted for only 3.8 percent of the total national income. His excellency Mr. (Brzezinski) once said that the violence-exalting television- and movie-based culture was creating the highest murder rate in any civilized country in the world. In 1993, there were 390,000 killings of that nature in the United States. One may ask, is this representative of U.S. human rights values? Australia is also a country which is very enthusiastic about asking for a human rights dialogue. But we wonder if certain forces still remember that they once joined with the United States in confronting us on human rights during the recent war. We also do not want to interfere in their internal affairs but we know that after 200 years, it was only in November last year that their parliament, after 50 hours of debate, eventually agreed to recognize the land ownership of the Aborigines. There are many other countries which once rivaled us on human rights for a long period of time. We welcomed President Mitterand for having personally traveled to Dien Bien Phu to close a page of past history. But the human rights debts owed to the Vietnamese people are still there and cannot be easily ignored. Morals do not allow them to forget. We do not want to interfere in their internal affairs but we are aware that in their countries, there are numerous problems related to human rights. Morally, they must learn to address their own problems before talking about teaching other people to do this or do that. With our age-old cultural tradition and with our Ho Chi Minh morality, the Vietnamese nation can feel proud of being a human nation. There is no need to recall faraway stories; our attitude toward the POW/MIA issue and the way we treated Puppet government employees and Puppet Army personnel in the past are enough to testify to this fact. Those who once confronted the Vietnamese people on human rights and who now want to have a dialogue with us on human rights should think of the need to pay their human rights debts to the Vietnamese people if they regard themselves as civilized and thoughtful people. Having already failed in their attempts to confront the Vietnamese people on human rights, how can they be successful in their bid to use dialogue on human rights to subjugate the Vietnamese people? This is unacceptable and impractical.
