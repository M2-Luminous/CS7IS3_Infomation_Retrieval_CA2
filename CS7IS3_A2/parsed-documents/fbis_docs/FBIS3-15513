Under the decree, each victim is entitled to a lump sum in compensation money equivalent to 100 minimal wages in the first stage. The federal government is expected to raise Rbl [rubles] 27 Bn to this end. "Generally speaking, no indemnity can compensate the losses sustained by the Balkarian people. The question is one of partial compensation as an indication of full rehabilitation of the people falling victim to purges", Zamakulov said. In his words, any delay of the process will cause a negative response on the ground. Zamakulov also insists that one-time benefits be paid not only to the victims themselves, but also to their family members including their children born in places of resettlement.
