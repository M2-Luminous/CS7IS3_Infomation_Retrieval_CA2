FBIS4-60092 "drnes098_o_94005" FBIS-NES-94-098 Daily Report 20 May 1994 SYRIA Press on Need for Israel's `Complete' Withdrawal Press on Need for Israel's `Complete' Withdrawal JN2005071894 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 20 May 94 JN2005071894 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Press review] [Text] Under the headline "Requirements For Peace," AL-THAWRAH says: From the outcome of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's talks in the region, it became apparent that the gap in viewpoints on peace and means to achieve it is very large because the Israeli position is very far from the foundations and requirements of the peace process launched in the Madrid conference. The paper notes that the Israeli position on the peace process and its objectives is characterized by a disdain for the peace process, avoidance of its objective -- comprehensive peace -- and an attempt to replace it with the objective of partial solutions. The paper adds: In contrast, the Syrian position on the peace process and its objective is characterized by concern for the peace process and full accord with the Madrid formula and the resolutions of international legitimacy. This position was reaffirmed by President Hafiz al-Asad when he received the U.S. secretary of state the day before yesterday. AL-THAWRAH says: In light of the obvious contradiction between the Syrian and Israeli positions, one important fact emerges: The peace which Israel seeks to achieve is different from that which the world and the Arabs want for the region. The paper stresses: The kind of peace the world agrees upon and for which the Arabs entered into talks in Madrid and Washington is the kind of peace based on justice and comprehensiveness and the kind of peace that returns to the Arabs their rights and occupied territories in full. Concluding its editorial, AL-THAWRAH says: Because the Israeli position is still far from the foundations and requirements of the peace process, the U.S. sponsor must build a new direction for his efforts, based on providing all that is necessary to force Israel to accept the requirements of the peace process, on top of which is complete, unconditional withdrawal. On the same subject, AL-THAWRAH says: The outcome of Christopher's talks in Israel has revealed the big gap between Israeli and Syrian positions on peace because Israel is very far from the foundations and requirements of the peace process, which started in the Madrid conference. The paper adds: Syria has stressed, and still stresses, concern for the continuation of the peace process and a commitment to continue to make efforts to push this process forward. It has also responded, and still responds, positively to U.S. efforts in that regard. Syria, at the same time, adheres to the resolutions of legitimacy and the UN Security Council which obliges Israel to withdraw completely to the 4 June 1967 borders as the condition without which the just and comprehensive peace in the region cannot be attained. Concluding its editorial, the paper stresses the need for Washington's assuming the role of the unbiased, fair, and effective partner by forcing Israel to submit to international legitimacy and its resolutions. Under the headline "No Peace Without Land," AL-BA'TH says in its editorial today that the U.S. initiative, which is based on the land-for-peace formula, constituted the foundation on which the Madrid Middle East peace conference was based. Resolutions 242 and 338 were considered the legal instruments that make the Israeli occupation of the Arab territories null, rejected, and impermissible, the paper says. The paper notes that all those interested in world peace have acknowledged the importance of Syria's positive role in the peace process since its acceptance to attend the Madrid conference. They considered that acceptance to be the most important in creating a new reality based on just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. AL-BA'TH says: When the rounds of Washington bilateral talks started, the Arabs felt that Israel was refusing to give specific pledges to implement international legitimacy and that its maneuvers constituted an extortion of the state sponsoring the talks. With the start of every round of talks, Israel wanted new weapons and fresh financial grants. Every round was also preceded by a flagrant Israeli attack against Lebanon or a massacre of the Palestinian people on their soil. The paper stresses: From day one in the Madrid conference, Israel knew that withdrawal from all of the Golan Heights is an indispensable condition for establishing peace with Syria. It must also be stressed that Israeli occupation of every inch of the Arab territories must end on the basis of the initiative on which the Madrid conference was based. AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: If Israel is serious about achieving peace, then the Arabs have responded favorably to Madrid and Washington talks because they are advocates of peace and because peace is their objective.
