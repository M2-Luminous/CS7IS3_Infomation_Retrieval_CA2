When the No. 2 Songgwang-ho, 98 tons, was under repairs in the seas about 220 miles southwest of Cheju Island around noon, a Chinese patrol boat seized it and whisked its Skipper Sin Hyon-pok, 43, and 10 fishermen to the patrol boat to tow the empty boat to China, the No. 1 Songgwang-ho, a sister boat of the seized one, cabled to the Pusan Marine Police Saturday. The Chinese boat gave up the No. 2 Songgwang-ho, cutting the rope, when the sister boat chased it, the cable said. Another Chinese boat also seized and took away the No. 27 Taehung-ho, 123 tons, with 11 crewmen, including Skipper Pak Hong-yang, 40, aboard, in the open seas 175 miles southwest of Cheju Island about the same time when it was adrift owing to engine trouble, according to the Pusan Marine Police. Although the No. 2 Songgwang-ho was caught in an area believed to be China's territorial waters, the No. 27 Taehung-ho was seized in open seas and this is expected to cause a diplomatic row between Seoul and Beijing, the police said.
