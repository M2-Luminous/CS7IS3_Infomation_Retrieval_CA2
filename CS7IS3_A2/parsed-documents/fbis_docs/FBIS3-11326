In that respect, it agreed to begin talks with the representatives of banks to define the list of financial entities that will participate in the bidding process. That proposal is part of the overall rehabilitation plan Fogade will impose on all banks that are under the financial assistance program. Initially, Fogade had studied the possibility of including 12 banks in the process, but the board members agreed to decrease the number to eight. The conditions under which banks will take over the administration of assisted banks have not yet been defined, but the plan calls for temporary external supervision until the institutions recover their stability. During a 9 March meeting, the Fogade board members considered for the first time the possibility of letting national banks with a greater solvency manage the assisted banks. Serious differences arose among the board members regarding the proposal. Some felt that letting the major banks manage the assisted banks would generate legal problems, since the process may be at odds with the content of the law to promote free competition. Next Friday, the Fogade board will study the rehabilitation plans that will be established on the Maracaibo, Construccion, Barinas, Metropolitano, La Guaira, and Sociedad Financiera Fiveca banks. The Banco Barinas Bank, one of the assisted entities, has made great strides in its rehabilitation plan. On this matter, it was reported that this bank will apply the following measures: -- Merge Banco Popular with Banco Barinas. -- Cut costs by 40 percent. -- Sell some Banco Barinas assets, including its headquarters in Castellana. -- Allow the contribution of capital by the partners. Regarding the Banco Metropolitano rehabilitation plan, it was reported that its board members are considering selling assets, reducing the managerial staff, and permitting new contributions of capital. Banco Metropolitano has already begun talks with a group of national and foreign banks to get those entities to become partners of this institution. In addition, the Fogade board named Manuela Daria and Angel Magdaleno as the administrators of Banco Hipotecario de Occidente.
