Sqd Ldr Prasong pointed out that it is the responsibility of the police to the search and investigate the case, saying he was not directly in charge of the affair. The Russian embassy has asked for cooperation from Foreign Ministry on this matter, he said. He said he had provided Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut with the information in order to help the foreign ministry. If Thai police couldn't find the missing third secretary Igor Makeyev, all must take responsibility, as it will tarnish the country's image because foreigners may view Thailand as an unsafe country. The foreign minister said officers suggestions that the Russian envoy had already left the country was only an assumption because his passport was found to have been left in Thailand. He warned those who discussed such issue to be careful in what they say because it might cause confusion.
