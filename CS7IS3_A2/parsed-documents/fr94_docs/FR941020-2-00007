This review covers Rhone Poulenc Chime DeBase (Rhone Poulenc), a manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States, and the period January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993. The firm failed to submit a timely response to our questionnaire. As a result, we have preliminarily determined to use best information available for cash deposit and appraisement purposes. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. effective date: October 20, 1994. for further information contact: Joseph A. Fargo or Richard Rimlinger, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;4733. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On January 5, 1994, the Department published in the Federal Register (59 FR 564) a notice of ``Opportunity to Request an Administrative Review'' of the antidumping duty order on ASM from France. On January 24, 1994, the petitioner, the PQ Corporation, requested an administrative review of Rhone Poulenc, a manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States. We initiated the review, covering the period January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993, on March 14, 1994 (59 FR 11769). The Department is now conducting this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 as amended (the Tariff Act). Scope of the Review Imports covered by the review are shipments of ASM, a crystallized silicate (Na 2 SiO 3 ) which is alkaline and readily soluble in water. Applications include waste paper de-inking, ore-flotation, bleach stabilization, clay processing, medium or heavy duty cleaning, and compounding into other detergent formulations. This merchandise is classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 2839.11.00 and 2839.19.00. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review covers Rhone Poulenc and the period January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993. Use of Best Information Available We mailed the antidumping questionnaire to Rhone Poulenc, the only manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States. Rhone Poulenc failed to submit a timely response to our questionnaire. The Department has therefore decided to use the best information available (BIA) in determining the rate for this firm. When a company fails to provide the information requested in a timely manner, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's review, the Department considers the company uncooperative and generally assigns to that company the higher of: (1) the highest rate assigned to any company in a previous review or the investigation or (2) the highest rate for a responding company with shipments during the review period. See 19 CFR 353.37(b) and Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review Portable Electric Typewriters from Japan (November 4, 1991, 56 FR 56393). In this case, for BIA, we assigned to Rhone Poulenc a margin of 60 percent, the highest rate from a prior review. See Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, Anhydrous Sodium Metasilicate from France (52 FR 33856, September 8, 1987).
