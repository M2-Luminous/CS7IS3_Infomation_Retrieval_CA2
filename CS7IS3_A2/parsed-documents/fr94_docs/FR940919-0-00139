FR940919-0-00139 FR940919-0-00017 With the exception of the California linderiella, the Service concludes that the report by Sugnet and Associates (1993b) does not provide a basis for significant disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to this listing action. Rather, the data presented in the report substantiates the rarity and fragmented distributions of the four species listed herein. Therefore, the Service has determined to issue a final regulation pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(6)(i)(I). Issue 13: Many commenters, including the California Department of Transportation and Congressman Wally Herger, requested the Service delay or not list the five species because they believed additional distributional and ecological data are needed to determine the ``true'' status of these animals. Several people contended that the survey work and collection data upon which the proposed rule was based are inadequate. One commenter contended that this perceived lack of information would result in a procedurally inadequate listing. Eight commenters stated that the data utilized by the Service presents only collection places inhabited by the species. They asserted that the Service did not conduct a random field survey and failed to accurately delineate the distributions of the species. These parties contended that the absence of information on locations that are not inhabited by the animals suggests a general lack of extensive collection efforts or knowledge of them. To support the need for further field work, one commenter cited 18 records of the vernal pool fairy shrimp and 30 records of the California linderiella that were not included in this proposed rule. This commenter did not provide any additional records of the Conservancy fairy shrimp, the longhorn fairy shrimp, or the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Service Response: Scientifically credible data on the status of the five crustaceans was collected in a random 322 kilometer (200 mile) north-south transect in the Sacramento Valley from Fall River in Shasta County to Jepson Prairie in Solano County (Simovich et al. 1992). This study found that distinct segments totaling 35 kilometers (22 miles), or 11 percent of the transect, contain vernal pools and swales. Within the portions of the transect, the vernal pool tadpole shrimp and the vernal pool fairy shrimp were found on 16 kilometers (10 miles), the Conservancy fairy shrimp on 6 kilometers (4 miles), and the California linderiella on 10 kilometers (6 miles). The animals were not found in all pools and swales in suitable habitat areas in this study (J. King, in litt ., 1992). King ( in litt ., 1992) reported that the vernal pool tadpole shrimp was found in only five pools on 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the 16 kilometers (10 miles) of vernal pools where the animal occurred, indicating a sparse distribution within much of the area where it occurs. The fairy shrimp species and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp largely were absent from extensive regions in the Sacramento Valley where degraded vernal pools still remain, such as the Red Bluff and Coyote Creek areas of Tehama County, and the Allendale area of Solano County (R. Brusca, in litt. , 1992). The three crustacean biologists who conducted this research concluded that based on this random field survey, these fairy shrimp species and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp are rare throughout their ranges. A comparison of the maps in Sugnet and Associates (1993b) indicates that the number of occupied pools, and amount of suitable habitat for the 30 populations of the California linderiella are larger than for the 32 populations of the vernal pool fairy shrimp. In addition, the California linderiella is known from the north coast, San Francisco Bay area, western areas in the San Joaquin Valley, and the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada in San Joaquin and Stanislaus Counties where the vernal pool fairy shrimp is not known to be present (Sugnet and Associates 1993b). The Service concludes, as detailed in the ``Summary of Factors'' section, that there is sufficient biological evidence that the vernal pool fairy shrimp, Conservancy fairy shrimp, longhorn fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp warrant listing. Sampling conducted at various locations and intensities between 1981 and 1993 by biologists familiar with the four fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp and their habitat provided adequate information on the distribution, habitat requirements, and most importantly, threats to the four species to warrant the present action. All additional data provided by respondents during the comment period, including the report by Sugnet & Associates (1993b) have been incorporated into this final rule; none of this data indicated that these taxa were not threatened or endangered. The Service's decision to propose the four fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp was based on significant threats associated with habitat loss and fragmentation, rather than solely on the basis of population numbers.
