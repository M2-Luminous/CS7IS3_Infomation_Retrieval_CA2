The city is truly facing a threat of an outbreak of epidemics, says the chief state sanitary physician in the republic. The first alarm signal was received in March of last year. More than 150 people were affected back then as a result of a dysentery epidemic outbreak. The reason was damage to the water supply network which, when water is supplied to the population on schedule, was responsible for bacteriologically contaminated water entering the water pipeline. Yet it appears that the city authorities are not particularly concerned about it. The city water supply network which has outlived every permissible life span continues to supply water with an unknown composition to houses in its original incarnation. The situation is even further aggravated this year due to an acute energy crisis. For months, household garbage is not hauled away from the city, and there is no gasoline. The city hall was forced to appeal to the population to fill the garbage trucks, whenever possible, with their own fuel whose prices have reached record levels--1 l of gasoline fetched $1.20. And until the fuel problem is solved, the epidemiological situation has a potential to get out of control any moment.
