Since virtually all types of industrial and other commercial fuel give off carbon gases, South Korean stands to be hit hard by the convention, especially with the massive number of cars and conventional heating systems. The convention, which currently has 51 signatory countries, is aimed at curbing the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases on a gradual basis throughout the world. South Korea became a signatory to the convention last December as the 46th country to do so and the convention, should it be in the near future be regarded as an advanced country, could pose as a serious problem. According to officials of the Foreign Ministry's Science Environment Section, the main cause of global warming has been identified as carbon dioxide and the convention reflects advanced countries' eagerness to halt further change in the climate, especially in terms of temperature. However, there has already been sharp criticism from developing countries on pressure for them to join up since they believe that most of the greenhouse effects have been caused by advanced countries themselves. "Although it is difficult to determine who is actually responsible for the changes in climate resulting from pollution, chances are that they began long before industrialization actually began to take place in countries which are currently classified as developing, including Korea," one official noted. Developing countries realize that the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is inevitable in the process of further industrialization and they have been demanding differential treatment. For Korea, however, the problem is not so simple. It is scheduled to apply for admission to the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and development) in 1996 and it would have to express greater willingness to conform to the standards in advanced countries. Statistically, the per capita emission of carbon dioxide was measured at about 1.6 tons in 1990, considerably less than the 2.4 tons in Japan and 5.8 tons in the United States. Since the convention stipulates that countries in group one, in which Korea is not yet included, must reduce the level of emission to that in 1990 by the year 2000, which would be an enormous task for the government and industry. The non-law-binding convention seeks to establish the basic guidelines for the reduction of greenhouse gases and deal with problems relating to the provision of financial and technological assistance to developing countries. Advanced signatory countries are obliged to obtain an exact estimate of the existing emission volume of the pertinent gases and report it to the convention's negotiating committee along with specific timetable for their reduction. Developing countries, on the other hand, have a period of three years to do the same although they have been insisting that their timetable would depend on the extent of financial and technological assistance from advanced countries.
