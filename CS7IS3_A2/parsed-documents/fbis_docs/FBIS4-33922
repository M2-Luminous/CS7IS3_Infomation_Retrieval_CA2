The officials of these organizations told the media that they do not want to travel in the official vehicles of their organizations because the FRAPH violently confiscates them. It was learned last week that customs personnel at the Haitian international airport confiscated, without apparent reason, bulletproof vests and uniforms from members of the U.S. Marine Corps. Regarding the topic, the (?mysterious) confiscation of communications material and defense weapons was made by regular military forces and not by "armed civilians as the alleged civilian mission affirms." "This material has been confiscated because it was not registered anywhere," the communique stated. This weekend, two individuals who identified themselves as FRAPH members violently seized an official vehicle from a 64-year-old driver. The FRAPH is a paramilitary group linked to the Haitian Army. It has been identified by the OAS-UN Civilian Mission and international organizations as responsible for the violence and the repression of popular organizations and supporters of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Meanwhile, airplane tickets for flights through 25 June have sold out. That is the date when the United States will suspend its commercial flights to Haiti. Air Canada has already canceled its flights effective this Monday and announced it will make a special flight on Wednesday in response to the Canadian Embassy's recommendation to Canadians to leave the country before 25 June. Political observers have expressed surprise that the price of gasoline has dropped at a time when it is said the border with the Dominican Republic is closed to prevent the entry of fuel. Gasoline vendors in Port-au-Prince explained to Radio Tropic that they have no difficulties obtaining the fuel because it is brought across the border at night when there is no surveillance.
