He said the draft of the new constitution has been finalized, although some politicians in the republic have stated their preference for the federation idea. But even federalists insist that the component parts of a Georgian Federation should not be granted the right of secession. They believe nonetheless that this would remove support for separatism and help the republic to get rid of conflicts on the ethnic grounds.
