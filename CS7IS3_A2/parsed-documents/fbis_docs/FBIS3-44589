At a news briefing, the Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said the Government had not yet been contacted by the PWC, but he ruled out accepting such an invitation under any circumstances. [Begin Macleod recording] Our general stance is this: If people in Hong Kong have questions of clarification on the bill then, of course, they are welcome to put them and we will answer them. That is our normal stance: If people have questions, we'll answer the questions. But, there is no question of us sending people up to Beijing to appear before the PWC. [end recording] Sir Hamish also said he expected the inflation rate to remain at the present level of around 8 percent during the next few years. He said the booming economy meant that there would be a surplus this year, despite his deficit budget, but he refused to speculate on how big the surplus might be. Speaking in Beijing, the head of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Lu Ping said it would be a sign of noncooperation if Hong Kong Government officials did not go to Beijing to explain details of the airport corporation bill. He said certain items in the bill were not clear and needed explanation from Hong Kong officials. Mr. Lu also said Chinese nationals born in Hong Kong will not lose their permanent residency if they emigrate to other countries. He was speaking one day after a senior government official warned that up to 400,000 Hong Kong Chinese residents could lose their right of abode in the territory. Cliff Bale has this report. [Begin Bale recording] Principal Assistant Secretary for Security Simon Vickels told legislators yesterday that the setting up of strict criteria for permanent residents could mean many Hong Kong Chinese emigrants would lose their right of abode after 1997. Mr. Lu disputed this, saying that Chinese nationals who return to Hong Kong after emigrating would not lose their permanent residence, nor will they have to make an application to return here. Mr. Lu also expressed the hope that the criteria for non-Chinese nationals seeking permanent residence will be kept simple. He said he welcomed people from other countries to ensure that Hong Kong remained an international financial center. However, Mr. Lu also said this issue would have to be discussed further. This will be done by the Security Sub-Group of the Preliminary Working Committee, which starts a two-day session on Sunday. Several members have suggested that criteria such as property ownership, the ability to speak Cantonese, and having work or relatives in the territory should be used to determine whether a foreigner takes Hong Kong as his place of permanent residence. [end recording] Mr. Lu also spoke about yesterday's invitation to government officials to visit Beijing to explain details of the airport corporation bill. He said that if they rejected the invitation, it would be a sign of noncooperation. Mr. Lu also said any final decision on the bill would rest with the airport committee under the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group.
