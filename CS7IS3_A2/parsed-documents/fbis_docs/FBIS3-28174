On the same day, an electronic jamming plane [chonjajangaegi], which flew into the skies of the regions of Yongwol and Pyongchang from Japan's (?Yokosuka) base, created electronic jamming in this region. Also, they were running amok in the concentrated attack exercise of invading the skies of the operational regions by formations of pursuit assault planes and vertical take-off and landing assault crafts which took off from an overseas base. This very provocative war exercise was playing with fire to enhance the capability of unexpected attack amid electronic jamming. Also on this day, the South Korean puppets continuously mobilized and deployed some 20 tanks and 300 armed hooligans from Manu-ri toward Ogok-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi Province. In addition, they kicked up a commotion of dragging in and assembling large-caliber guns in the whole area of (Kagong)-ri, Inje County, Kangwon Province, South Korea to the DMZ of the Military Demarcation Line.
