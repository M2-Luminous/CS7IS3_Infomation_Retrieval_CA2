Nasri Khuri, secretary general of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese Council, announced that the discussion dealt with two main topics: the establishment of a joint training center, and a grid link between the two fraternal countries. Khuri pointed out that it was agreed to exchange expertise in the electricity field with regard to power stations, grids, and other technical aspects. Regarding the grid link, Khuri said that it was agreed to prepare the power lines coming from 'Anjar Power Station and the northern region for the exchange of energy before the end of 1994. Khuri revealed that several projects are under discussion to increase the power link between the two countries. Regarding the agenda of the next meeting, Khuri said the building of a power station will be the subject of the next meeting. The current idea, he added, is to build this station on Lebanese territory, in the northern region of al-Biddawi, in order to benefit from the waters of the southern al-Nahr al-Kabir River for the cooling operations.
