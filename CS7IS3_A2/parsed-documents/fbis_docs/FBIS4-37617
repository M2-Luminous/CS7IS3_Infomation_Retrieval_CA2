These lands take up tens of thousands of dunams, which Israel annexed over the years in the wake of drilling for water and due to the flow of the Jordan River. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said in recent interviews it must be acknowledged that the Dead Sea is not a fixed lake, but shifts several kilometers from time to time. We recall that the Jordanians are demanding that territories spread over some 360 sq km, chiefly in the 'Arava and mainly uninhabited, be transferred to their sovereignty.
