While the United States is highlighting this atmosphere with official and public threats, things remain tense and the Resistance ranks are on constant alert. So how does Hizballah view developments in the south? Hizballah's Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im Qasim said he expects every aggression from Israel and at any time, regardless of whether there are any apparent or formal justifications. He said the Israeli threats are not new, because the tighter the situation Israel finds itself in, the harder it tries to escape it by flexing its muscle and by trying to use force to achieve progress in the negotiations and to compel those involved to make concessions. Shaykh Qasim added: We do not regard the Israeli threats as an exception but as part of the constant threat to the south, Western al-Biqa', and Lebanon as a whole because of the Israeli presence on our soil. The U.S. stance is biased. It adopts the Israeli plan for the region. It is natural for the United States to propagate whatever Israel wants. U.S. sympathy with the threats is merely new proof of its collusion with Israel to prevent Lebanon and the region from having any dignity and to interfere more in imposing its policies. Another reason for the American and Israeli shouts is the effectiveness of the Resistance and its effect on complicating the schemes. We place this before all the nationalists and honest people so as to affirm the resistance option against Zionist arrogance. Shaykh Qasim added: Another U.S. ploy is to urge Israel to remain calm. This is a known, sly way of distributing roles between the United States, which claims to be concerned about peace and security, and Israel, which violates a decision agreed on with Washington so that the use of force can be an additional weapon in subjugating the region. The United States should take its hands off Lebanon and the region. Israel can do nothing without the sponsorship of the United States, which takes care to ensure Israel's military superiority and supports it politically in international forums. Its pressures in the region mean that the United States is a full partner in the aggression and has never been a real peace partner for a single minute. Shaykh Qasim believes that no one can guess the extent of the aggression. He ruled out the idea of an invasion because such an action needs the right conditions and developments that cannot easily be provided right now. He added that an invasion will cost Israel more than Lebanon because Israel would have to invade a people, not confront a regular army. Shaykh Na'im Qasim denied reports that there had been contacts with Hizballah to reduce its resistance operations during the negotiations and stressed that no one asked us to reduce the operations during the Geneva summit between President Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. He said: We do not carry out our operations based on the negotiations, because we do not believe in them. Our resistance action is a constant one based on the principle of liberating the land. The resistance will continue as long as the occupation exists. It might intensify or weaken according to conditions on the ground but not according to political circumstances. Asked about reports of internal party arrangements in preparation for a settlement, Shaykh Qasim pointed out that the party is basically against a settlement. We are wagering on the failure of that settlement, he said, adding: We believe the settlement involves enough complications and pressure to hinder many of its aspects. Failure is a possibility like all other possibilities. As for our internal situation, our structure considers every possible action under different circumstances based on maintaining the basic principles. There are no plans to rearrange the party and we believe there is no need to make such changes later, he emphasized. Shaykh Qasim believes that talks are immobile and that no progress has been made along any of the tracks except the Palestinian 'Arafatist track. He remarked that Israel is confused because it believes in the need to make major concessions in view of the capability of the Resistance, the Syrian stance, and the position of the opposed Palestinian factions. This can embarrass Israel into making concessions. It is trying to avoid this because it wants to conclude separate deals similar to Gaza and Jericho and its appendix in the Cairo Agreement. Such deals would empty the various tracks of their meaning. Facing difficulties, particularly on the Syrian-Lebanese track, Israel tends to make threats of war then cry wolf to influence the public and thus find a justification. Shaykh Na'im Qasim continued: We believe the negotiations are immobile. There are many obstacles and we do not know how they will develop. Man must occasionally monitor the situation to assess each phase in light of developments. But, he said, no matter how easy things might be, we do not believe the settlement will be achieved in full or that the occupation problem will end.
