It was stated that Turkey's insistent attitude played a significant role in the realization of this intervention. In his weekly news conference, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman said that Gorazde is one of the Serbs' main targets in their policy to gain territory and carry out ethnic cleansing. This is why Gorazde was included among the six safe areas declared by the UN Security Council and was placed under international protection, Ataman recalled. Although it was a belated move, Ataman declared, the NATO intervention against Serbian positions was an appropriate and welcome development. He added that Turkey's insistent attitude constituted one of the significant factors in the realization of this intervention. Ataman stated: It is important to closely observe the Serbs' every move and behavior and to give the necessary response to every attack. The international community should have realized by now that the Serbs understand only determined stands.
