"Our approval is limited to an exchange of letters or a meeting in a third country to find out if North Korean leaders are willing to visit Seoul, and does not extend to their actual visit," an NUB official said. If Pyongyang shows it is sincere about settling the nuclear problem, Seoul is said to be willing to seriously consider allowing North Korean Church leaders to visit the South. KNCC applied for a permit to contact North Koreans to invite church leaders from the communist country to attend its general assembly on Feb. 21 and various religious events.
