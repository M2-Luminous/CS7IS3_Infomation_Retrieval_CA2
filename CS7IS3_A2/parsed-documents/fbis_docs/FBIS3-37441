He said the country's mass media are on the decline and Russia is facing the possible loss of its national television, because "it costs three trillion roubles a year, and the Finance Ministry wants to drop it from the budget". Poltoranin, who is now heading the House Committee on Information Policy and Communications, said a law on television is being drafted, and hearings about the economic situation of the mass media will be held in the parliament at the end of February. Poltoranin said parliamentary correspondents are deprived of any possibility to cover the activity of the State Duma because the Duma Council, factions, groups and committees have developed a practice of meeting behind closed doors. Journalists are therefore unable to get any first-hand information. The Duma decided to consider a draft federal law "on the coverage of the activity of the bodies of state authority of the Russian Federation by the mass media" before March 21, 1994.
