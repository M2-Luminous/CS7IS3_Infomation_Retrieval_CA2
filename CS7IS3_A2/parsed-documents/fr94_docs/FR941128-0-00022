FR941128-0-00022 FR941128-0-00007 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background NO X are precursors to ground level (tropospheric) ozone, or urban ``smog.'' When released into the atmosphere, NO X will react with volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the presence of sunlight to form ozone. Tropospheric ozone is an important factor in the nation's urban air pollution problem. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) made significant changes to the air quality planning requirements for areas that do not meet the ozone NAAQS. Subparts 1 and 2 of part D, title I of the CAA as amended in 1990 contain the air quality planning requirements for ozone nonattainment areas. Title I includes new requirements to control NO X emissions in certain ozone nonattainment areas and ozone transport regions. Section 182(f) requires States to apply the same requirements to major stationary sources of NO X as are applied to major stationary sources of VOC. The new NO X requirements are reasonably available control technology (RACT) and new source review (NSR). These provisions are explained more fully in the EPA's NO X Supplement to the General Preamble published in the Federal Register (FR) on November 25, 1992 (see 57 FR 55620). In addition, the general and transportation conformity rules (conformity) required by section 176(c) contain new NO X requirements (see 58 FR 63214 and 58 FR 62188), and the vehicle inspection and maintenance rules required by section 182(c)(3) also contain new NO X requirements (see 57 FR 52989). El Paso, Texas was designated nonattainment for ozone and classified as serious pursuant to sections 107(d)(4) and 181(a) of the CAA. The El Paso nonattainment area consists of El Paso County and shares a common airshed with Juarez, Mexico. Under section 181(a), serious areas must attain the ozone NAAQS by 1999. DFW was classified as moderate with an attainment deadline of 1996. The DFW nonattainment area consists of Dallas, Tarrant, Denton, and Collin Counties. Please reference 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991, codified for Texas at title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations in ยง81.344). II. Applicable EPA Guidance The CAA specifies in section 182(f) that if one of the conditions listed below is met, the new NO X requirements would not apply: 1. In any area, the net air quality benefits are greater without NO X reductions from the sources concerned; 2. In a non-transport region, additional NO X reductions would not contribute to ozone attainment in the nonattainment area; or 3. In a transport region, additional NO X reductions would not produce net ozone benefits in the transport region. In addition, section 182(f)(2) states that the application of the new NO X requirements may be limited to the extent that any portion of those reductions are demonstrated to result in ``excess reductions'' of NOx. The NO X provisions of the conformity requirements would also not apply in an area that is granted a section 182(f) exemption (see 58 FR 63214 and 58 FR 62188). In addition, certain NO X provisions of the vehicle inspection and maintenance requirements would not apply in an area that is granted a section 182(f) exemption (57 FR 52989). The EPA's Guideline for Determining the Applicability of Nitrogen Oxides Requirements under Section 182(f) (December 1993) describes how the EPA intends to interpret the NO X exemption provisions of section 182(f). In addition, a memorandum signed by John S. Seitz, Director of the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, dated May 27, 1994, describes certain revisions to the process the EPA currently intends to follow for granting exemptions from NO X control requirements. As described more fully in the Seitz memorandum, petitions submitted under section 182(f)(3) are not required to be submitted as State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions. Consequently, the State is not required under the CAA to hold a public hearing in order to petition for an areawide NO X exemption determination. Similarly, it is not necessary to have the Governor submit the petition. III. International Border Area Section 818 of the 1990 CAAA incorporates a new section 179B into the CAA which contains special provisions for nonattainment areas that are affected by emissions emanating from outside the United States. The section 818 provisions are hereinafter referred to as section 179B. Because the El Paso nonattainment area shares a common airshed with Juarez, Mexico, the section 179B provisions apply to El Paso. Under section 179B, the EPA will approve a SIP if the area meets all other CAA requirements and establishes that implementation of the plan would achieve attainment of the ozone standard by the CAA statutory deadline ``but for emissions emanating from outside the United States.'' Customarily, an area must demonstrate, using EPA guideline models, that it would attain the relevant NAAQS. Since El Paso and Juarez, Mexico share an airshed and data are not available for a Juarez emission inventory, modeling of the entire airshed is not possible at this time. Current EPA policy allows an area subject to section 179B, such as El Paso, to perform modeling using only U.S. air emission data. Such modeling may form an acceptable basis for demonstrating attainment for analysis purposes required under section 179B. For areas on an international border that demonstrate attainment, ``but for emissions emanating from a foreign country,'' the provisions of section 179B will keep such areas from being subject to the ``bump up'' provisions of section 181(b)(2), which require reclassification to the next higher ozone nonattainment classification if the area fails to attain the relevant NAAQS by the applicable attainment date. See 57 FR 13498, 13569&hyph;13570 (April 16, 1992). The State of Texas performed Urban Airshed Modeling (UAM) using only El Paso emissions data, and demonstrated that El Paso would attain the ozone standard by 1996 ``but for emissions emanating from Mexico.'' The El Paso UAM ozone modeling analysis will be referred to in this notice as the ``attainment demonstration'' for El Paso. Although the EPA allows an area such as El Paso to demonstrate attainment on a basis of U.S.-only modeling, it is understood that ultimately basin-wide modeling must occur in order to develop a control strategy in El Paso that will achieve the NAAQS. The United States entered into the Agreement for Environmental Cooperation along the U.S.-Mexico Border, referred to as the La Paz Agreement, with Mexico in 1983 to address environmental concerns along the border between the two countries. Annex V of the Agreement, negotiated in 1989, calls for basin-wide modeling to be accomplished for the El Paso/Juarez airshed. The EPA has been working with Mexico and with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) to accomplish the basin-wide modeling. Since the statutory attainment date for serious ozone nonattainment areas such as El Paso is 1999, concerned agencies intend to complete such modeling by 1999. IV. State Submittal On June 17, 1994, the TNRCC submitted to the EPA two petitions pursuant to section 182(f), requesting that the DFW and El Paso nonattainment areas be exempted by the EPA from the NO X control requirements of section 182(f) of the CAA.
