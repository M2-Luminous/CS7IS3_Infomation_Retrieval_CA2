President Yeltsin who headed the list last December was the second. The rating was determined by 50 experts: editors of leading publications and prominent political analysts. The composition of the fist five changed considerably compared with January: Yegor Gaydar, Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Vladimir Shumeyko dropped out. Their places were taken accordingly by the Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the Chairman of the Central Bank Victor Gerashchenko. The greatest change in rating happened to the Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin who skyrocketed from position 98-99 to 16-16 which can be accounted to his key role in Russian diplomacy in Bosnia. The Tatar President Mintimer Shaymyev moved from 27th to 10th place which is attributed to the signing of the agreement between Russia and Tatarstan. The other politicians whose influence grew included Defence Minister Pavel Grachev (8), presidential national security advisor Yuriy Baturin (12), the Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik (25), the secretary of the Security Council Oleg Lobov, the chief of the External Intelligence Service Yevgeniy Primakov.
