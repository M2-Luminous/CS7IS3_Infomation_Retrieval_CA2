Tudor"] [Text] Romania's minister of national defense, General Niculae Spiroiu, declared in a television broadcast of the "Pro Patria" program that he wishes to end the conflict with Senator C.V. Tudor. "Let us consider it a closed chapter, we have much to do in the Army," said Mr. Spiroiu, although at the news conference of the Greater Romania Party on 3 February the leader of that party continued his accusations and slander against the dignitary, who is a member of the Vacaroiu government. He called the defense minister: "A minister who is a trafficker and a maniac," "a political adventurer," "the epitome of incompetence," and a person who "demolished the arms industry," "turned the ministry into a small feudal family," and "permanently misinformed the state institutions." Here are a few examples of the way Senator V.C. Tudor portrayed Minister Spiroiu at the recent news conference of the Greater Romania Party. Therefore, the general's decision to call for an end to the conflict is viewed as a more than surprising act, since Mr. Spiroiu has not even turned to the legal authorities to have Senator C.V. Tudor reprimanded for his remarks.
