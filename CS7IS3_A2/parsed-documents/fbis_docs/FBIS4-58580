As you well know, the first stage of the negotiations on the implementation of the Declaration of Principles [DOP] ended today. The negotiations lasted seven months. This duration can be in part explained by the fact that we, naturally, wanted to reach a detailed agreement which would clarify in no uncertain terms the complex fabric of peaceful coexistence for two entities that -- as is well known -- have no love relationship, to put it mildly. This was done to implement the conceptual gist of the interim agreement. The interim agreement consists of two parts: giving the Palestinians authority to run their lives; and giving ourselves responsibility for Israel's external security, and defense of the settlements including settlers' movements within the territories. Gaza and Jericho is the first stage of the interim agreement. This was done to ascertain how the system functions, and it required dealing with numerous details. Today you were again made aware of the nature of the negotiations, their occasional deviations and repetitions. Therefore, I really regard the agreement and the accompanying maps as a basis that allows for the implementation of the concept's nucleus for the Palestinians to run their lives while we ensure the security of the State of Israel and its citizens. Naturally, the key does not lie in the agreements alone, but also in their implementation. We are interested in relatively short implementation period. It became apparent to me last night that the PLO chairman is asking for several more weeks, two or three, for an overlapping period. We will probably have to agree to this, provided an overlap indeed takes place. I understand that today, 22 Palestinian policemen were supposed to begin manning the points and regions of coordination so that the policemen are received in an orderly manner. I hope that people will also be sent who are able to assume responsibility for running civilian life. I wish to point out: Today, in Gaza alone, 24,000 Palestinians receive their salary from the civil administration; 6,000 are permanent employees, and 18,000 are employed on a temporary basis to prevent the closure from causing economic distress that could create a security problem. The PLO has limited experience in running a community. There are people there who are able. I hope that the appropriate people arrive or are found in place, and indeed the handing over of the civilian and security issues is done properly. I mainly speak of the Gaza Strip, where some 750,000 Palestinians reside. In the entire Gaza region, there are more or less 16,000 residents, which is naturally much smaller [sentence and figure as heard]. The territory of Gaza that would be handed over to the /Palestinian Authority/ does not include a single Israeli settlement. Therefore, the problems there are much simpler. [Shlomo Raz, Qol Israel] Does the incident that took place on the stage during the signing ceremony not make you wonder about the ability to implement the agreement? Does it not make you regret the entire move? [Rabin] There are no regrets, although during the past several months we learned that problems come up on occasion. Then, if we make our position unequivocally clear, we overcome the problems. [Raz] Mr. Prime Minister, how do you intend to handle the negotiations with Syria following the agreement with the PLO? How much will this agreement influence the negotiations with Syria? [Rabin] These are two separate negotiation tracks. The secretary of state visited our region. We raised several ideas. We received responses which, without exaggeration, revealed large gaps between our fundamental positions and theirs. Nevertheless, the secretary of state will probably return to our region in two weeks. If there is no change in the Syrian positions then a waiting period clearly lies ahead until their positions change because there are certain things that no Israeli Government can accept. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, can the principle of a certain area first also be applied on the Golan Heights? [Rabin] I think that this constitutes an unsuccessful attempt to link today's very meaningful withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho first to something which is ultimately related to the last line of withdrawal [pauses] -- because as you know, this government has accepted the principle of territorial compromise and withdrawal -- certainly from part of the Golan Heights -- in exchange for peace. We also implemented a withdrawal in the case of Egypt without linking the issue to the last line of withdrawal from Egyptian territory. This is a different matter than Gaza and Jericho First. [Imanu'el Rosen, Israel Television Channel 2] What would have happened had 'Arafat continued to refuse to sign the maps? [Rabin] I think I made myself very clear to everyone there. I said that I would not make a speech and there would be no agreement. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, perhaps you can give us an authoritative explanation of what happened on the podium today? What was the cause of the misunderstanding? [Rabin] I want to make something very clear. Perhaps the media overplayed reports that two central and dramatic issues were slated to be resolved in the meeting between 'Arafat and myself: the policeman on the bridge, and the expansion of the Jericho area. I think that in all truth -- not only because of us and perhaps mostly due to no fault of our own -- we devoted too much time to symbolic matters while the major problems of what would happen in the Gaza Strip where 750,000 Palestinians live in poverty; the problem of how to establish a system capable of maintaining public order and assuming its security responsibilities; the question of how to prepare for assuming control over the area.... [pauses]. As I mentioned earlier, the Civil Administration currently pays the salaries of 24,000 wage earners in the Gaza Strip alone. Who will pay their salaries when we leave tomorrow or in one week? Who has made preparations to pay their salaries? Is there any institutional structure capable of assuming the responsibility? In the past I was firmly opposed to a unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. The reason was first and foremost that we would be blamed for the chaos, reciprocal killings, and other negative developments that could ensue if we implemented a rapid unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip without the presence of a party capable of assuming minimal security responsibilities -- and there is no such party. Who is capable of assuming minimal security responsibilities for the most immediate and vital necessities in the Gaza Strip? If we do not supply power there is no electricity in the Gaza Strip. If we do not supply it there is no water in the Gaza Strip. If we do not supply the hospitals with oxygen tanks then I do not know what would happen there. If we suddenly cut off the supply of medicine and drugs -- and there is no one there willing and capable of assuming responsibility -- then that might possibly obligate us today to drag out the process of our withdrawal from the Gaza Strip far longer than we would have wanted. Because our Palestinian partner was apparently busy with other things and less interested in sending people to the area to start overlapping in order to assume responsibility. Computers perhaps are the only field today in which some degree of overlap has taken place to some extent. That is the problem. [Rabin] /As you are fully aware we signed today the agreement about Gaza-Jericho first, which is the first phase of the implementation of the DOP signed last September in Washington. I believe the minor incident that took place on the platform shows to you the difficulties that we experienced in the last over seven months of negotiations of the detailed implementation of the first phase -- the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Why we stressed on preparing an agreement which all the details that we considered to be vital to its success must be worked out. We are trying here to create peaceful coexistence between two entities that there is no love lost between them -- and I put it mildly. The purpose is to create the kind of peaceful coexistence that on one hand the Palestinian authority will run the lives of the Palestinians in the agreed areas: the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The main problem is in Jericho, it is 750,000 Palestinians vis a vis 16,000 to 20,000 in the Jericho area [sentence as heard]. The economic difficulties are much bigger in the Gaza Strip. We want to maintain security. Security to the State of Israel -- that is to say external security. We agreed with the Palestinians in the DOP about having the settlements. Therefore, we are carrying the overall responsibility for the settlements in the territories, especially in the Gaza Strip -- in the Jericho area there are no Israeli settlements-- and of course, to their movement from the settlements to Israel or passing, like in Jericho, from the northern part into Jerusalem. We knew that unless everything will be prepared in detail there will be no chance to succeed to build this peaceful coexistence. /Second, we found that much time was lost without overlapping activities on their part. It starts only today when 22 officers of their police will go there. We have to build and to create three centers of coordination: two in the Gaza Strip and one in Jericho, through which coordination between the Israeli military forces and the Palestinian police and other security activities will be coordinated otherwise the clashes can create a real problem. Therefore, we did not lose time. After all, we could complete the handing over from our own part in two, three weeks from today. It might be even in ten days. The problem today, as the chairman of the PLO said last night or deep in the night, is that he might demand little bit more: two, three even up to four weeks. We would like once we have reached agreement to get out as quickly as possible from wherever we have to get out. But we have an address, a capable address to hand over responsibility to the life of the Palestinians in the territories. Just to give you one example: We today pay to the Civil Administration under the military government of Israel in the Gaza Strip for 24,000 people. Six thousand permanent employees of the Civil Administration, for 18,000 a special budget was appropriated to prevent too high unemployment, the kind that would increase as a result of the closure on the territories. But we do not want the economic situation to develop in a way that it will create security risks for us. Tomorrow, we will leave. Who will pay these 24,000 people? [passage indistinct] [Rabin, continues] /...from the outside, most of the people that have not been for 20 or 27 years in the Gaza Strip or in Jericho. How long will it take to acquaint themselves with the new changes in the area? Twenty seven years ago, when we entered during the Six-Day War to the Gaza Strip, there were less than 300,000 people there. Today it is three quarters of a million, if not 800,000. There are practical problems that, unfortunately, focus was not given enough in proper preparation for the handing over. We will have now to waste time, from our point of view, because for whatever we have agreed and for wherever we have agreed to pull out, we are ready to do it as quickly as possible. We will wait to see, today, tomorrow, the day after. Hopefully the infrastructure, the overlapping will be done in proper way. And we are committed toward what we signed today. We know that the partner is not accustomed to be responsible to life of community. It has limited experience in certain issues, but there are very capable Palestinians, and I believe there is no shortage of capable people there, if they have the determination and the guidance to what has been agreed on./ [Unidentified correspondent] /Did Mr. 'Arafat tell you last night that he would not sign the map...? [Rabin, interrupting] /I will explain what happened. Unfortunately, the media in the last three months built up two issues that would be decided in the meeting between Chairman 'Arafat and myself: One is the Palestinian police on the bridge, one is the size of the Jericho area. Believe me, the two are symbols, for each side might be important, but this is not the crux of the problem that we face together in Gaza-Jericho alone. The issues that I referred to -- how to maintain the life of the Palestinians, to develop them economically, socially; the question of security -- these are the two issues that will decide the success or the failure of the attempt that we are engaged in. But the media built it, and I was limited by the principles that I was guided by them when we decided on Jericho in addition to Gaza -- that it will be a limited area; that it will not include any Israeli settlement, in contradiction to the Gaza Strip. Second, for me, security along the lines, external lines, it is to say that the external security interpretation, especially along the Jordan River, is an issue of great concern. Therefore I could not meet his expectations. He brought up another issue: Special arrangements in the Rafah terminal, and he demanded that there, the director general will be Palestinian. I could not meet this. [passage indistinct] [Rabin continues] /...we signed the agreement on the basis of my position. It is to say: we added a certain amount of area to Jericho area as it was described before yesterday, and I agreed that we can continue the discussions on the issues but, when we sign, it will be on the basis of my answers. How it was ended? First I made it clear that unless the maps will not be signed there will be no agreement and I will not speak./ [passage indistinct] [Rabin continues] /...I agreed that the discussions on these issues will be continued without affecting the implementation of the agreement -- based on what we know last night. I agreed to send a letter in which I will say that there will be continued discussions on these three issues./ [Unidentified correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Rabin] /I am sure that from the side of the Palestinians, it looks to a dramatic change in their lives. For the first time, the Palestinians will run large communities in what used to be British-mandated Palestine. From our point of view, the main test is security... [transmission interrupted] [Rabin continues]/...we know that the issue of Jerusalem will be brought up in accordance to what we signed in the DOP. It is to say: Not later than two years after the completion of the implementation of Gaza-Jericho First. Jerusalem will not be discussed when we negotiate the second phase of the interim agreement, the elections, the final composition of the Palestinian authority, and the future of Judaea and Samaria. For me.... [break in reception] [Rabin continues] /...some people did not believe Israel is serious in its readiness to go along with what we were committed to. But we, when we say, we mean it. Second, I believe that the question of the money was understood by us for a long time. This is why Israel's Foreign Minister Peres and others were active with the countries and organizations.../ [break in reception] [Unidentified correspondent] [Indistinct question on the release of prisoners] [Rabin] We have understandings and agreements regarding the release of prisoners, and we will follow them. I would not like to go into detail on this issue -- not here, not today. As for the Palestinian, PLO stand, regarding the shape of the permanent arrangement: You have their stand from the Madrid conference. They never kept it a secret. We have a different position. The most important thing now is to concentrate on the issues included in the DOP for the interim agreement. The first stage of the interim agreement is Gaza and Jericho First. Let us prove that we can create that which we have agreed on. Then we will talk about the end of it.
