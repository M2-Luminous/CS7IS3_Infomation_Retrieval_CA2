He was addressing a public session of the assembly after it met in committee during the course of the morning. Dr Hartzenberg said AVF Gen Constand Viljoen's decision to register the organisation on Friday night for the election was "good," but the assembly had considered all the benefits and drawbacks on Saturday and decided not participate in the election -- unless its demands were met by the government and the African National Congress. The AVF was not prepared to subject its nation to a communist government. The only way left for the Afrikaner to achieve a peaceful solution was to stand up and state his demands. The nation should be pointed in the right direction and mobilised to achieve freedom and self-determination. Dr Hartzenberg said the Freedom Alliance [FA] members were free to each make their own decision as to whether to participate in the poll or not. Different decisions would not affect the FA's unity, he said. Dr Hartzenberg's announcement was applauded by rightwing supporters who attended the open session of the assembly's meeting in the Dutch Reformed Church synodal centre. All the leading rightwing figures, including the Mulder brothers, Afrikaner Weersstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche and Gen Viljoen, were present.
