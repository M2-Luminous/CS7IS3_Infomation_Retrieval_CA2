Over 500 veteran Red Army men and veteran cadres who previously worked for the provincial-level organs happily met together and extended greetings to each other. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, and Dai Suli, former veteran leader of the province, gave speeches at the party. There are some 190,000 retired veteran cadres in the province. Since last year, these veteran cadres have played an important role in maintaining political and social stability and building the socialist spiritual civilization. On behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, Gu Jinchi extended Spring Festival greetings to all veteran comrades of the province. After affirming the positive contributions made by veteran cadres in accelerating the province's reform and development, he pointed out: Now that we are precisely in the process of replacing the planned economy with the socialist market economic structure, the emergence of new contradictions and new difficulties is inevitable. Under the new situation, all levels of leaders should show concern for the weals and woes of veteran comrades and should do more tangible deeds for them. The first task we should do for veteran cadres after their retirement is to ensure that they spend their remaining years in happiness and good health. At the same time, we should arrange for them to attend study classes, show concern and love for them politically, and pay attention to making use of their role. Dai Suli, former veteran leader of the province, also spoke at the tea party. He expressed hope that veteran cadres would study the Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping to keep pace with the development of the current situation. At the same time, he called on veteran comrades to make best possible use of their remaining strength under the leadership of the provincial party committee and the provincial government so that they can truly have something to do in their old age.
