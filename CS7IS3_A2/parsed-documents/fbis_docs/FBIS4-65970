Speaking to citizens in Bingol, Erkan remarked that the terrorist organization is on the verge of collapse as a result of successful work and that the terrorists are left with the options of dying or surrendering. [Begin Erkan recording] Also last month, 500 terrorists were killed. Can an organization survive if it loses 500-600 terrorists in one month? This is not possible in the face of our state and our nation. We will conclude this matter. There are also other schemes involved. We will be careful. [end recording] Stressing that the organization is also serving the interests of foreign forces, Erkan noted that the pictures of the terrorist organization's leader with Armenian priests appeared in some press organs.
