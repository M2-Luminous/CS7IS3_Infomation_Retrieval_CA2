It shows that migration in the last year, in comparison with previous years, has declined. The number of inhabitants of the Republic of Latvia, according to inter-nation migration, has declined in 1993 by about 28 thousand people. The total volume of inter-nation migration (the total number of persons who have entered and those who have left Latvia as a place of permanent residence) in the last year, in comparison with 1992, declined by 39 percent, with emigration declining more rapidly -- by 39.6 percent, than immigration -- by 32.5 percent. The decline in both immigration and emigration volume is attributed to the flow of immigration to our neighboring countries of Lithuania and Estonia, and especially to the CIS. Immigration from the CIS countries in 1993 declined by 38.2 percent, while emigration to these -- by 41 percent. Emigration from Latvia to western countries in 1993 continued at the same volume as for the previous year -- 2,487 persons in 1992, and 2,319 persons in 1993. Emigration from Latvia to western countries continues to be almost 8 times greater than immigration from these. The greatest effect of migration is the decline in the number of inhabitants of Latvia's largest cities of Riga, Liepaja, and Daugavpils, which could be considered as a positive result, and also in the rayons of Bauska, Cesis, Ogre and Preili. A positive migration balance in 1993 was found in the city of Rezekne and in the rayons of Rezekne, Kuldiga, Ludza and Balvi. But during this time period, no positive migration balance from abroad was registered for any of the cities or rayons of Latvia. Statistical data show that the number of Latvians in cities continues to decline as a result of migration: in 1992 by 4.5 thousand, while in 1993, by 1.4 thousand. This indicates that Latvian families, for various reasons, are relocating to live in rural areas. Migration of Inhabitants in Latvia in 1993.
