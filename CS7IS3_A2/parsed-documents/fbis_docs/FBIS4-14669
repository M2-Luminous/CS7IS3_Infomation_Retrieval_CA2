It was found in dense forest by pilots of the Russian Dalaero company. How it got there remains a mystery, although long-time local residents recall that during the forties there were rumors going around the Far East that an American aircraft, crippled by Samurai [Japanese] fighters over the Sea of Japan, had made an attempt to reach an airfield in Maritime Kray but crashed in the tayga. According to Vladimir Safronov, Dalaero director, the sensational find was no coincidence. One of the spheres of activity of the multifaceted Dalaero Scientific Production Association [SPA] is the search for various objects abandoned or lost in the vast tayga. During several expeditions the aviators have found a Soviet DB-3 long-range bomber; several An-2, a Yak-13, and a Yak-18E aircraft; a Mi-1, a Mi-2, and a Mi-8T helicopter, and two tractors dating to the beginning of the century. One of the tractors was built in 1903. All of this equipment will be restored and displayed in a museum which the Dalaero SPA enthusiasts plan to open.
