According to Government (Interior) Minister Fabio Villegas, "the Colombian people's civic-mindedness triumphed in the face of a minority which, hopefully, has heard the majority's repudiation of their violent practices." The official referred to in this regard the actions of communist guerrilla groups that in the past weeks increased attacks to sabotage the elections. Villegas said the subversives perpetrated several attacks, which all the people repudiated. He referred to especially the kidnapping of 32 electoral authorities in the eastern Department of Santander, which caused the suspension of the elections in the small town of Carcasi. A little more than 17 million people over 18 years of age were eligible to vote, but the small turnout at the polls, a habit of Colombians that this time increased due to intense rain, raises the fear of increased abstentionism. There was a 45-percent abstentionism in the legislative elections held in 1990. This figure increased to 70 percent in 1991 when a new Congress was elected, after the National Constituent Assembly, which promulgated another Constitution that year, promoted the dissolution of the legislative body. The voters elected Ernesto Samper as the presidential candidate of the ruling Liberal Party, because, according to unofficial reports aired on radio networks, he obtained at least 46.3 percent of the votes. The Liberal Party elected its candidate in an internal "Popular Referendum" availing itself of the infrastructure of the elections. If the results are confirmed, as it is taken for granted, Samper will be the Liberal Party presidential candidate who will run against Conservative Party presidential hopeful Andres Pastrana in the May elections.
