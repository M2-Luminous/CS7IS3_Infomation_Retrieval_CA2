In his policy speech to the Diet and in statements made during his stay in foreign nations, Prime Minister Hata has frequently mentioned Japan's bid for permanent membership on the UN Security Council. At a Brussels news conference, he said: "Japan is being asked by the rest of the world to fulfill its duty as a permanent member of the UN Security Council." His rhetoric contrasts with that of the Hosokawa government, which mentioned Japan's bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council in guarded and indirect terms. There are reasons why Hata makes frequent mention of Japan's bid for permanent membership on the UN Security Council. In contrast to the Foreign Ministry, which has been eager for Japan to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council, neither the Hosokawa nor the Miyazawa governments were very keen. Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary in the Hosokawa government, and Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, have also been negative about Japan becoming a permanent member. At a meeting of the task force mandated to reform the UN Security Council, Yoshio Hatamo, former Japanese ambassador to the United Nations, delivered a speech which made very clear Japan's eagerness to join the UN Security Council. In reaction, however, then Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura quite openly expressed his discontent with the speech. Nonetheless, the Foreign Ministry did not back down. Whenever leaders of other nations visit Japan, the ministry tries to include expressions of their support for Japan's permanent membership on the UN Security Council in joint statements and news releases. The Foreign Ministry has steadily created a climate in which Prime Minister Hata could justly state: "Japan is being asked by the rest of the world to fulfill its duty as a permanent member of the UN Security Council." The way the Foreign Ministry has handled the issue of Japan's bid for permanent membership, though, appears to have toughened Mr. Takemura's attitude. The foreign minister moved to the Prime Minister's Official Residence after a change of government. Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], who maneuvered behind the scenes for Mr. Hata's promotion to the premiership, is eager for Japan to expand its international contributions, including its military contribution. It can be said that, inspired by Mr. Ozawa's eagerness for Japan to make international contributions, the Foreign Ministry has moved to trumpet the need for Japan's permanent membership on the UN Security Council. But why has the Foreign Ministry clung to Japanese affiliation with the UN Security Council? One reason we can cite is the statement made by Under Secretary General James Jonar [name as published] of the United Nations that "the UN Security Council is now being transformed into a board of directors." The General Assembly of the United Nations, with more than 180 members, has been too slow in taking action and that the UN Security Council is about to become a body mandate in the management of international issues. Three years ago the UN Security Council held weekly sessions, now it holds them daily, with the exception of holidays. Most of the session is given over to informal discussion. Japan is the biggest financial contributor to the United Nations, following the United States, but Japan has to wait outside the door of the UN Security Council. It is not strange, then, that even Foreign Ministry officials say: "We want to see Japan attending sessions in the capacity of a full, permanent member." However, the question remains, "what can Japan do after becoming a UN Security Council permanent member." The U.S. Senate adopted in late January this year a supplementary resolution asserting that "Japan should not be allowed to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council unless it is prepared to participate in UN peacekeeping operations (PKO) including the use of force." French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who visited Japan in March this year, said: "The permanent member nations of the UN Security Council have both rights and obligations. They have an obligation to participate in PKO when it is decided by the UN Security Council." Although Japan has to positively work to join the UN Security Council, the question of whether Japanese laws currently in force are compatible with Japanese affiliation with the UN Security Council as a permanent member still remains unanswered. Revamping those laws will have much to do with Japan's exercise of its collective right to self-defense, the topic of frequent debate at home. If Japan fails to make clear its attitude toward revamping those laws and exercising its collective self-defense right, it would cause misgivings among Japanese and misunderstanding among other nations. It is already known that the United States supports both Japan and Germany becoming permanent members of the UN Security Council in the hope that they will increase their financial contributions to the United Nations. Other nations, too, hope to become permanent members of the UN Security Council and there are no rational criteria for deciding one rather than another. In addition, developing countries have demanded reform of the UN Security Council. The bluebook on foreign policy released on 13 May points out the "slow pace" of the response by Japanese news media and the Japanese to international expectations of the country, saying: "Awareness in Japan has failed to keep pace with the international community's growing expectations of Japan." We have the impression that the Foreign Ministry has been pushing the issue of Japan's bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council unilaterally.
