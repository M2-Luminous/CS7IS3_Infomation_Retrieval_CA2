Bulger] [Text] Pretoria April 12 SAPA -- The government was joining the international mediation process intended to resolve the country's constitutional deadlock, African National Congress Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa told the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] on Tuesday [12 April]. Mr Ramaphosa said the mediation was originally intended to involve only the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]. However, negotiators had decided at Friday's Skukuza summit that the government should become a party to the mediation. The government has, until now, been lukewarm about the mediation process, fearing it could reopen a range of already-settled constitutional issues. Mr Ramaphosa, who was providing the TEC with a summary of the negotiations to date, said a task force met on Monday to draw up a new proposal for consideration by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. The task force comprises representatives of the ANC, the IFP, the South African Government and the Zulu monarchy. Mr Ramaphosa said "considerable progress was made" by the task force, which was due to meet again on Tuesday afternoon to hear the response of the king and kwaZulu chief minister and IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to the new proposal. He said the terms of reference for the mediation process would also be determined on Tuesday. However, he warned against IFP expectations that the elections might be postponed. "The IFP seems to be getting into the mediation process in the hope that the process will result in the date of elections being postponed. The election date is sacrosanct, not even the mediation process can tamper with it," Mr Ramaphosa said. He expressed disappointment about the outcome of the Skukuza summit and the fact that it did not yield a more positive result. He said the outcome of the task force's deliberations depended on the king and kwaZulu's response. Speaking on the same issue, South African Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo repeated that the elections would not be postponed.
