FBIS4-56801 "drlat090_c_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-090 Daily Report 3 May 1994 MEXICO `Confidential' Report Warns of Turbulence `Confidential' Report Warns of Turbulence PA0705022594 Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 3 May 94 pp 1, 50 PA0705022594 Mexico City EL FINANCIERO Spanish BFN [Report by Jose Luis Gaona and Georgina Tristan] [Text] In the final stretch of Carlos Salinas de Gortari's term as president, his political and social finishes [cierre] are viewed by the government itself as "unstable," while his economic finish is "threatening." A "confidential" report by the Attorney General's Office [PGR] entitled "Mexico, Picture of Violence," which was completed one day before Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination, states that Salinas' administration has been the most turbulent administration in the past 36 years. The 46-page document states that Adolfo Lopez Mateos' administration had an "unstable" social finish, but it was politically and economically "stable." Jose Lopez Portillo's political and social finishes were "stable," but his economic finish was "unstable." Miguel de la Madrid's were economically and socially "stable" but politically "unstable." Meanwhile, the report states that in view of the upcoming federal elections on 21 August, it is important to protect citizens nationwide through the presence of public security forces. There is evidence of a serious political schism within Salinas' inner circle, a schism which is not only personified by Manuel Camacho Solis and his supporters, but which the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas has used to his advantage. The report points out that the Chiapas rebellion and the death, violence, and political persecutions it prompted dashed, among other myths, the fallacy that Mexico's social peace was the envy of many countries in the world. Still, in his final State of the Nation address, President Salinas pointed out: "I hereby reiterate that Mexico is moving forward confidently and calmly with the help of its Armed Forces." The reality experienced by the Mexican people, at least over the past 10 years, shows the exact opposite to be true. Although its origins were diverse, the myth of social peace that the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] had boasted about has led to a climate of violence in many parts of the country, the PGR report added. The Zapatist revolt revealed a threat that has always existed as well as proving that social tensions can erupt at any time in any part of the nation. They are likely to occur in the wake of years of extremely poor economic and social conditions, repression, and a lack of mechanisms to participate in politics. Other forms of violence are not simple possibilities, they are tangible realities. For example: - Political violence that the state's repressive apparatus -- namely, the Army, state and federal police, and judicial institutions, as well as the so-called "white guards" of the paramilitary corps -- exercise against dissidents who oppose the government, the official party, and regional leaders. - The violence that has been unleashed as a result of the war between the various cartels fighting over drug production, marketing, and distribution in Mexico. - The violence displayed by numerous gangs of former police officers and criminals who have turned kidnapping and robberies into their favorite means of obtaining million-dollar profits, without ever worrying about whether or not they will have to murder their victims. The report acknowledges that political violence seems to have unleashed its fury in the southeastern part of the nation. This region, which has only been thrown the leftovers of the nation's economic modernization policy, stands out, because the states that comprise it -- Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Puebla, and Veracruz -- feature the largest concentrations of poverty and abandonment, the worst education and health services, and populations predominately comprising peasants and Indians. Together with this area, in states such as Mexico, Hidalgo, Morelos, Michoacan, and Tlaxcala, social tensions and political confrontations have often turned into political demonstrations against the authorities, local leaders, and police. The demonstrations have invariably been repressed by the "forces of order." The electoral frauds, political challenges, seizing of mayoral offices, violent evictions by way of the police, arbitrary arrests, and the murder of activists and sympathizers of political parties that oppose the PRI have created a vicious circle that makes it very difficult for the authorities to respond without violence and in accordance with the law. The document notes that one of the main ingredients contributing to this climate of violence and social instability is the lack of credibility in election results. Tabasco looms as the state first in line on the list of electoral risks for "radical changes." Conflicts, in the meantime, are possible in the states of Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Yucatan as a result of the prevailing social, economic, and political situation. "The worst-case scenario, in terms of elections, exists in Guerrero and Michoacan, where prospects for August are not very encouraging." The document mentions some regions where the PRI presidential candidate will face difficulty in winning votes in the upcoming federal elections: - Baja California, the first state governed by the opposition (PAN) [National Action Party], could very well represent a vulnerable region for the PRI candidate, although there is a good chance there will be votes to favor the candidates of that party for deputy and senatorial posts. - In Chiapas, with a population of more than 3.2 million people, the events early this year gave rise to a certain political anarchy and opportunism on the part of some political parties, labor unions, and government, student, and peasant sectors which openly declared support for the demands made by the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army]. There were those, in fact, who even proposed Subcommander Marcos as a candidate for governor of this state. The current situation makes it difficult to define the attitude of the people toward the PRI. - To a great extent, Chihuahua represents the largest number of votes for the rightists (PAN). The degree of PRI penetration is limited in the elections for deputies and senators, just as it is for local legislative representatives in some municipalities of less importance. - In Guanajuato, with virtually 4 million inhabitants, 49 percent of people of voting age, and in one of the three PAN-controlled states, there is a minimal degree of conflict. It has not been ruled out, however, that there may be vulnerable areas or possible postelectoral conflicts. - Guerrero, one of the areas in which the FDN [National Democratic Front] won the elections by a majority in 1988, is one of the most vulnerable electoral regions for the PRI. This is where Procup [Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's Union Party], the Progressive Party of Guerrero, and the Guerrero Civic Party have the greatest penetration. Some business groups also play a decisive role: Ruben Figueroa Alcocer, Israel Soberanis Nogueda, and Max Tejeda. The Catholic Church also maintains a great deal of influence here. This is a state that has a climate that could engender conflicts that are not only social, but also political-electoral in nature. - In Jalisco, civilian society is very upset over the negligence with which public officials are carrying out their work, both at the state and municipal level. Jalisco could represent a favorable vote for the PRI candidate, but not for the party's senatorial and deputy candidates. - In the state of Mexico, with more than 9.8 million inhabitants, social sectors are disgruntled, above all among PRI militants, as is evidenced by the occupation of mayoral offices, the blocking of highways, and frequent demonstrations. The climate is ripe for political and social conflicts. The regions most vulnerable for the PRI are Valle de Chalco, Chimalhuacan, Nezhualcoyotl, Los Reyes la Paz, Tejupilco, and San Mateo Atenco. To a great extent, the power the PRI still holds is attributable to the aid the National Solidarity Program has earmarked to traditionally overlooked areas; this, in turn, has favored the PRI. Meanwhile, the PAN comprises people from the middle-high class. Proof of this is in the zone in which the PRI has not been able to win one position [casilla] in several elections. It (PAN) is the third political force. As far at the PRD is concerned, its focus of action and penetration lies mainly in areas most unprotected and forgotten by the authorities. - The PRD's main bastion is Michoacan, where 17.5 percent of the working population comprise artisans and laborers and 33.7 percent of the population are farmers. This is the state with one of the greatest risks of political upheaval by way of post-electoral protests and demonstrations. For the election of deputies, senators, and president of the Republic, this state is one of weakest in terms of PRI support.Morelos, where the rural vote is decisive, does not represent an area totally opposed to the PRI. Nevertheless, the PRD's influence among the Morelos peasants cannot be dismissed.268460096n Nayarit, there is a possible majority vote for the PRI in the election for president of the republic, but this does not hold true in the election of deputies and senators.Nuevo Leon is a state in which there is no immediate climate for political conflict. Nevertheless, there is a certain level of discontent among lower social classes, teachers, and some labor groups. The PRI is strong in this region.2000060100axaca, as other states in the nation, has been fated by several administrations to economic, social, and political backwardness. Therefore, the state's serious economic inequalities, extreme abandonment, and poverty are a fertile ground for the rise of political groups linked to the defense of human rights. This region is ripe for post-electoral conflicts. - In San Luis Potosi, where there is strong PRD influence, there a political and social explosion is waiting to happen. This area is very weak in terms of PRI voters, particularly in the presidential elections. - Tabasco, which in the past three years has become totally polarized as a result of the diverse political, social, and economic problems, is susceptible to political and social conflicts. This region is vulnerable for the PRI. - In Yucatan, there are approximately 400,000 unhappy PRI members; therefore, there exists a climate ripe for political conflicts. This could be a stumbling block for the PRI and help the PAN in the federal elections, particularly with regard to the federal deputies and senators.
