FR940303-2-00138 FR940303-2-00072 The laboratory has developed procedures that will enable it to accept components and materials tested and evaluated by another NRTL laboratory. These procedures include evaluating the listing report, and reserving the right to retest and audit the components as it deems necessary. Components tested and evaluated by Entela will fall under their follow-up service agreement. An approved source list has been revised to include company name, address, and area of expertise. The TPCP identifies the circumstances when testing and evaluation of a product may be accomplished at the client's facility, such as when the equipment is large and not easily shipped or when specialized test facilities are required. The TPCP also identifies the general criteria for qualifying the manufacturer's facility to include the witnessing of the tests. A procedure exists for the qualification of subcontractors for the supply of services in support of the laboratory functions. The laboratory maintains a listing of approved external testing sources for general laboratory support and a separate list for those suppliers that qualify under 10 CFR part 50 for the nuclear industry. This listing and any associated files has been reviewed for its completeness. Background The applicant states that Entela, Inc., was originally founded in 1974 as a Michigan Corporation called Entel Engineering Services (no longer in existence) specializing in structural steel inspection, with departments in structural engineering, field service inspection, asbestos inspection, and geotechnical engineering. In 1981, equipment and personnel were added to initiate an in-house materials laboratory. Through a continued growth commitment and dedication to meet its client's needs, the applicant states that it experienced dramatic growth, necessitating the formation of certification programs within Entela, Inc. The services offered at Entela, Inc. (also doing business as Entela Laboratories, Inc., but one in the same company according to the applicant), include metals chemistry, simulated environmental testing, plastics/non-metals testing, product testing, electrical/electronics testing, metallurgy, mechanical engineering, third party certification programs, metrology, and calibration. As of this time, Entela, Inc. employs over 75 individuals and has two facilities, located in Grand Rapids, Michigan and Taipei, Taiwan. Presently, all testing is performed at the Grand Rapids facility, and only follow-up inspections are carried out in Taiwan. Entela, Inc. desires recognition for testing and certification of products when tested for compliance with the following test standards: ANSI/UL 45_Portable Electric Tools ANSI/UL 48_Electric Signs ANSI/UL 50_Electric Cabinets and Boxes ANSI/UL 67_Electric Panelboards ANSI/UL 73_Electric-Motor-Operated Appliances ANSI/UL 82_Electric Gardening Appliances ANSI/UL 94 1 _Tests for Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances 1 Exclusive of radiant panel testing.
