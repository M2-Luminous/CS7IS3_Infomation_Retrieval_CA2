Almost every day there are reports of an administration created, bosses appointed, a department expanded. I am afraid that soon Moscow itself will be too small to accommodate this gigantic army of do-nothings, bureaucrats generating red tape on any question except one--their own interests. These particular interests they tend to meticulously. And generate one decision after the other, whose main purpose is obvious: obtaining money for the budget to pay bureaucratic salaries and create the conditions for unofficial supplementation of these salaries with large bribes. I apologize in advance to those few persons in ministries and agencies who do perform work that benefits the state, the economy, and society. But there are thousands of others... One gets the impression that someone is pursuing the goal of pure sabotage: As soon as the situation in the economy and the social sphere stabilizes slightly, decrees are adopted and directives signed that inevitably lead to an explosion, another round of inflation, and create problems for production, commercial activities, and the consumer market. I am not inclined to think in terms of sabotage, however. I insist on another explanation: personal gain. Naturally, the growing budget deficit plants the idea among the masses not included in the apparat orbit that it is time to reduce bureaucratic agencies. Naturally, the presence of numerous holes both in legislation and in approaches to its implementation permits functionaries to extort considerable money from anyone who wants to survive in the current chaos. As if the first hike in customs duties was not enough--they had to hit prices with a whip so hard that they jumped right through the roof. As if it was not enough to add a 3 percent surcharge to the absolutely contrived and unjustified in our conditions value-added tax--beginning in April they decided to quietly milk enterprises some more by increasing deductions, which in the end go, again, not to pensioners and the disabled but into the "fund for salvation of bureaucrats, bankrupts, and producers of defective goods," which is what the state budget is to a considerable extent today. Arbitrariness awaits us everywhere; it is growing stronger, propped up on the shoulders of the power vacuum. The law is not a deterrent for those who turn off water and electricity in homes, refuse to transport a patient to a hospital, in violation of property rights tow automobiles away from the streets and take them who knows where on the contrived grounds of illegal parking--as if there is any place where they can be parked legally. Some are arrested and then receive lengthy apologies; others are left alone, despite clear signs of criminal activities. This is everyday life. And in the economy, under loud proclamations of loyalty to reforms, they strengthen the monopolism of the poor excuse for producers who are incapable of competing with the Thai cottage industry and African farmers. How long can one try people's patience by playing with presidential, government, and parliament decisions that span the gigantic amplitude from "hurrah" and "this is the only way" to "we apologize" and "we will take a different road now"? We are in no danger of getting either a wise tsar or a wise leadership, given the current disposition of forces in the top echelons. It is time to search for and promote new intelligent people, who could replace the current generation of powerless powerholders--and not in a decade but in the nearest elections. Civil accord is necessary and possible, but not on the basis of a compromise between groups of chatterboxes--only on the basis of true reforms in the economy and a well-defined approach to social problems.
