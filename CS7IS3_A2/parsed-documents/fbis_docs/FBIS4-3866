Addressing a roundtable breakfast jointly hosted by Goodman & Goodman, one of Canada's law firms and the Institute of Toronto C.D. Howe in his honor, Zou said "I have become more keenly aware of both the possibility and great potential for our mutually beneficial cooperation" in economic and trade field [sentence as received]. More than 100 businessmen attended the event. Zou said since the establishment of Sino-Canadian diplomatic ties, bilateral economic relations and trade between China and Canada have recorded considerable progress but it falls far short of the need and potential of the two sides. With highly developed industries, Canada enjoys an advantage in energy, transportation, telecommunications and finance, he said, adding that "It is entirely possible for Canada to make bigger steps in developing economic relations and trade with China." "One of the purposes of our current visit is to explore with you ways to further expand Sino-Canadian economic cooperation and trade in the years to come," the vice premier said. He said during the past 15 years, China has scored significant achievements in its modernization drive. "The rapid economic growth in China is now materializing its great potential as a big market," he added. "China, a big market with 1.2 billion population, is attracting more and more foreign investors." Until the end of 1993, China has approved foreign investment in 174,056 projects and more than 60 billion U.S. dollars have been invested, he said. He hoped that more Canadian enterprises will join the rank of Northern Telecoms Limited, who stands out with distinction among Canadian companies to gain a foothold in China's market. He urged Canadian businessmen to seize the opportunities and take a more active part in China's modernization drive. "If we are not a partner today, it will be tomorrow," Zou said.
