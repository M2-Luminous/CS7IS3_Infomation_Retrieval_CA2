[passage omitted] His Highness said, "The nature of this meeting is to implement decisions reached during the summit meeting of their majesties and highnesses, the leaders of the Council's states. Accordingly, the decisions reached at the summit were reviewed during the meeting, be they security, economic, or political decisions." His Highness said the meeting at the outset concentrated on the summit's decisions and ways of implementing them, and thus on political evaluations, political topics, GCC states' ties with their neighbors, and on the international effort that would be launched. Asked about incongruity in the GCC's political stands, His Highness said, "That is what we hear in the press, but at the summit-level meetings or at those at the foreign ministers level, we have not noticed any incongruity between GCC states." Responding to a question on Iraq's attempts to split the Arab front, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal said, "I did not mention splits in my address. I said that Iraq was trying to come through with justifications, particularly humanitarian ones." He added that Iraq wanted to reached its aims of not complying with the Security Council resolutions, particularly in its dispute with Kuwait on the demarcation of borders with Kuwait and on ending Iraq's claims on Kuwait. That effort had to be confronted and shown for what it was. His Highness said, "We sympathize with the Iraqi people and their plight, but what is standing as an obstacle to improvement of the conditions of the Iraqi people is the Iraqi Government and not international resolutions." He said that the international resolutions would solve the Iraqi people's tragedy. But Iraq was trying--through them--to get through to the Arab countries emotionally by telling them that the continuing sanctions were harming the Iraqi people. However, Iraq wanted to exploit this in order not to comply with the resolutions, which were of utmost importance for the Arab sphere, to Kuwaiti-Iraqi ties. If the basic condition was carried out, the whole picture toward Iraq would change, and Iraq would gain international support.
