Beginning Tuesday, and for 48 hours, the presidents will hold the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government. In an exclusive interview with EFE, Gaviria, who will cease to be president on 7 August and will likely assume office as OAS secretary general in September, explored some issues related to Latin American integration and to the future of the OAS. [EFE] What is Colombia's outlook as it prepares to host the Fourth Ibero-American Summit? [Gaviria] We expect this summit, as the others that have preceded it, to result in an exchange of ideas and experiences and to be productive. We will debate economic issues, trade, investment, how to unite the trade processes we are involved in, how to improve opportunities for investment and savings in America, and how to preserve our special links with Spain and Portugal, which are our bridge to the European Union [EU]. [EFE] Is this bridge truly operational? [Gaviria] It has been working. It is our link with the EU, particularly via Spain. I think it is very useful. There have been disagreements, such as on the Andean countries' preferences. In the specific case of the preferential treatment that Colombia receives from the EU, the battle that Spain waged and the support we received from this country were decisive. [EFE] Does Colombia regard these annual summits as useful? Does Colombia think it is necessary to hold these summits annually, or would it prefer them to be held every two years? [Gaviria] We are maintaining a neutral position on this issue. We believe that the agendas of some countries tend to be a little overloaded for annual summits. This is not true in our case, however, and we support any decision made. We would vote neither for nor against holding these meetings on an annual basis. [EFE] How do you think the Cartagena de Indias summit will influence the hemispheric summit President Bill Clinton has called to be held in Miami in December? Do you think the two meetings are compatible? [Gaviria] I do not think either meeting will conflict with the other. First, the two agendas are very different. The subjects we will discuss with Spain and Portugal are very different from those we will discuss with the United States, a country with which we hold a much more complex, intensive, and, in some aspects, a much more conflicting relationship, but a relationship that offers us many opportunities. I do not see the two meetings competing with one another. Some references to the Miami summit will probably be made in the Ibero-American summit. At least from Colombia's viewpoint, I do not see any kind of incompatibility regarding time or agendas. These summits apparently have demonstrated their usefulness and potential. Regarding the future, we should hold more, not less, of these kinds of meetings on the continent. I do not believe the presidents will have trouble attending several summits. [EFE] What will the Ibero-American leaders tell Fidel Castro in Cartagena de Indias that they have not told him already? What do you think of the fact that he was not invited to the Miami meeting? [Gaviria] I do not know what other heads of state will tell Castro. That is one subject that has been overlooked a bit. At the beginning, the subject of Cuba appeared to come up frequently in the summits, but now it has fallen away. More importance is attached these days to exchanging experiences and ideas than to an intensive debate with Cuba. The possibility of this subject springing up in a summit should not be ruled out, however. Regarding the Miami summit, it is a U.S. initiative, and, because of this, the United States has specified which countries it wants to attend and has left out Cuba, probably because there are no diplomatic relations between the two countries. [EFE] In the Group of Three, Colombia has been one of the leading countries in the debate about relations with Cuba. Do you not feel a little frustrated to see that the rapprochement with Castro has not resulted in a political opening? [Gaviria] Well, it is true that the economic opening has been considerably greater than the political opening. Nevertheless, I appreciate the changes that have been taking place in Cuba. The international community and myself regard these changes as insufficient, but I think they are moving in the right direction. Everyone expects to see more political changes that will make it possible for Cuba to be reinstated in the inter-American system. [EFE] You will assume office as OAS secretary general in a few months. What do you think of your role as secretary general? What changes does the organization require? Which of these changes are most pressing? [Gaviria] I do not think immediate changes will be introduced, because decisions in an international organization such as OAS are by nature made by consensus and made gradually. The secretary general can make suggestions, but it could take months, even years, for these suggestions to become changes. I think, however, that all across the continent there is a desire for the organization to adapt itself to the new agenda on the continent: trade and strengthening democracy and the mechanisms for the protection of human rights and the environment. This task could take many years but, if it is completed, it can make the OAS stronger and make it serve to meet the countries' most urgent needs. [EFE] Do you agree with the frequently voiced charge that the OAS is an over-bureaucratized and slow organization? [Gaviria] Although there was important progress in the way of modernization during Joao Baena Soares' term, the OAS has undergone an experience common to any truly international organization: The world changes much faster than these organizations, and, for this reason, the OAS lagged behind a little. The idea now is to put it in step with these changes.
