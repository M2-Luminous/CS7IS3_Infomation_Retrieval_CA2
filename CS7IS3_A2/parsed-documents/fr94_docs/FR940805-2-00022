FR940805-2-00022 FR940805-2-00016 Golden Field Office; Grant Award to the University of Pittsburgh AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its intention to award a grant to the University of Pittsburgh for continuing research activities to advance the state-of-the-art in designing macromolecular electron delivery systems for artificial biocatalysis. ADDRESSES: Questions regarding this announcement may be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Golden Office, 1617 Cole Blvd., Golden, Colorado 80401, Attention: John K. Lewis, Contract Specialist at (303) 275&hyph;4787. The Contracting Officer is John W. Meeker at (303) 275&hyph;4787. The Project Officer is G. William Ives at (303) 275&hyph;4755. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The University of Pittsburgh has been conducting research for a number of years to develop electron delivery systems for artificial biocatalysis. Successful completion of this research will advance the goal to further develop the mapping of electron transfer pathways and to investigate multiple electron transfer reaction mechanisms necessary to reduce CO 2 . This work is an extension of work currently being funded by DOE and competition for this effort would have a significant adverse impact on the continuity of this research program. The applicant has an exclusive domestic capability to perform this activity successfully because of the unique expertise of the principal investigator and the unique laboratory facility designed to support these efforts. DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary to satisfactorily complete the current project. DOE funding for this grant is estimated at $300,000 and the anticipated period of performance is thirty-six (36) months. Issued in Golden, Colorado on July 25, 1994. John W. Meeker, Contracting Officer. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19154 Filed 8&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
