Liu Zhongde stressed the necessity of increasing the intensity of reform of the cultural structure and to open up a new situation for cultural undertakings. A Year in Which More Measures Will Be Taken in Reform of the Cultural Structure and the Intensity of Reform Will Be Greater Than Any Other Year The reporter asked: "Is this year a year in which more reform measures will be taken by the Ministry of Culture and the intensity of reform will be greater than any other year?" Liu Zhongde gave an affirmative reply. He said: The year 1994 is a crucial year for the comprehensive advancement of and for making key breakthroughs in reform of the economic structure in our country. This has made speeding up and deepening reform of the cultural structure even more pressing. Speeding up and deepening reform of the cultural structure is not only to meet the needs of the overall situation of reform of the economic structure, but also to meet the needs of invigorating and developing socialist literary and art undertakings. If we say our work in the past year was to make necessary discussions and preparations for speeding up and deepening reform, this year should then be a year for making greater progress and obtaining considerable results in reform. He explained with examples that the internal organizational reform of cultural organs should be completed this year. Such reform includes changes in the functions of government work. This means the mode of management which is suited to the planned economy structure of the past should be shifted to the mode of management which is suited to the market economy structure. The leadership of cultural work should gradually change the practice of regarding micro management as the dominant factor to the practice of regarding macro management as the dominant factor, should concentrate major efforts on giving guidance in direction, grasping general quantity and quality, structure, and results, and should learn and master the comprehensive use of economic, legal, and administrative means and public opinion to guide the healthy development of cultural undertakings. Besides, this year we should also complete the structural reform of cultural institutions. Arts institutes and schools directly under the Ministry of Culture, for example, have already finalized reform plans and have started implementing such plans. Reform of Artistic Performance Organizations Is of Paramount Importance to Reform of the Cultural Structure When asked by the reporter the focus of the reform of the cultural structure this year, Minister Liu replied: It is the structural reform of performance organizations, including the structural reform of artistic institutions and troupes directly under the central authorities. Reform in this respect is of paramount importance to the entire reform of the cultural structure. He said that in September last year, the Ministry of Culture issued a "Circular on Further Speeding Up and Deepening the Structural Reform of Artistic Performance Organizations," which put forward views on the reform of artistic performance organizations, including the general layout, the leadership and management structure, the personnel system, the wage system, the management in giving performances, and ideological and political work. This year, we want to advance reform in a big step forward and to earnestly make some achievements. When the reporter asked Minister Liu to give details on the structural reform of organizations directly under the central authorities, he replied that we are concentrating our efforts on the reform of artistic institutions and troupes directly under the central authorities. This has been the key and difficult point in the reform of the literature and art structure for many years. At present, we are tackling substantive problems. We have specially grasped experiments on reform of the Central Philharmonic Orchestra, the Central Peking Opera Troupe, the Central Song and Dance Ensemble, and the Oriental and Song and Dance Ensemble. The leading group for the reform of artistic performance organizations directly under the central authorities set up last year has today put forward macro views on and key operational points for the present stage of the structural reform and they will be published after discussion and approval. Here, the targeted mode of reform is to concentrate efforts on properly running troupes which represent the national artistic level, and, on the basis of making a scientific assessment, improving the structure and personnel and pulling together the strong points in terms of personnel, finance, and materials to make general and rational readjustments of the existing layout of institutions and troupes directly under the central authorities. To be specific, we shall establish a performance mechanism with the help of the government and performance subsidies as the center and this will effectively put an end to the "big pot" way of distribution which makes no difference between those who work and those who do not work and between those who work well and those who do not. This will not be the same as what some people said: Reform is simply to increase the income of personnel who give performance; and without much money, people can eat from "the same big pot," and with much money, people can still eat from "the same big pot." The reform in the latter aspect is even more difficult. At present, some artistic organizations cannot continue to exist even if the planned economy structure remained unchanged, and much less can they keep abreast of the market economy structure. Regarding traditional, national, refined literary and art organizations which represent the national level, the state will focus its support on them through increasing state input and social sponsorship to enhance their improvement and development. In this respect, it is necessary to establish, through this reform, a long- term, steady, and reliable material guarantee channel and to thoroughly change the situation in which such organizations are like beggars and can give performance only when they have secured some money. The concrete operation will also include the establishment of a personnel system which takes contract appointment as the center and the ministry will help solve the problem of where to go for various kinds of artistic personnel who are not employed, who are waiting for employment, or who have been dismissed after the sizes, posts, and personnel of institutions and troupes directly under the central authorities have been fixed. We shall adopt the method of dynamic separation centering round artistic production. To be specific, various institutions and troupes will organize the artistic creation and production of a number of plays and programs this year and in the course of making preparations for such plays and programs, it is necessary to boldly adopt a new management structure, sign contracts with those who are needed by the artistic production, put them in positions by appointment, and carry out dynamic separation in the course of artistic production. This shows that the intensity of reform here is quite great. However, it will totally get rid of the long-standing drawbacks of artistic institutions and troupes directly under the central authorities, be conducive to the establishment of a set of new and vigorous operational mechanism, bring about artistic vitality, increase the ability to compete in the market, set the institutions and troupes as examples, and give impetus to the reform of artistic performance organizations across the country. The Spiritual Loss of Cultural Workers and the Decline in the Quality of Cultural Products Should Not be the Cost of Reform Liu Zhongde also mentioned that following the increase in intensity in the reform of cultural structure, the difficulty in reform will also increase correspondingly. We should not expect to accomplish the whole task at one stroke, but should advance in an orderly manner, step by step, and with emphasis on some points. We have just started the major task of establishing a cultural structure which is in keeping with the socialist market economy structure. Therefore, regarding the reform, we should not hesitate, but should tackle problems with a sense of undertaking a historical mission and properly carry out the reform. Only in this way is there hope for cultural undertaknigs. To accomplish this mission of the times, cultural cadres at all levels and the broad masses of literary and art workers should first of all have a good mental state and should be able to correctly handle contradictions between the individual and the collective, the individual and the undertaking, and the present and the future which they meet with in the course of reform. Without the mental state of forging ahead despite difficulty, it will be difficult to persist in reform. Liu Zhongde pointed out that to test whether or not the reform of the cultural structure is successful, it is necessary to see whether or not the reform is conducive to three things, that is, to fully arousing and giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of literary and art workers, to producing products and talented people, bringing about flourishing socialist cultural undertakings, and meeting the people's growing needs in cultural life, and to promoting economic development and comprehensive progress of the society. Therefore, this reform should bring about new development and a new situation in cultural undertakings instead of bring chaos to cultural work. The spiritual loss of cultural workers and the decline of the quality of cultural products should not be the cost of reform. This does not conform with the law of development of culture and art and we should pay attention to this question. The central authorities have attached great importance to, and shown great concern about, cultural work at present, including the reform of the cultural structure, exercised effective leadership, given effective guidance, implemented clear-cut policies and principles, and won the people's full support. Our work is precisely being carried out under such concrete guidance.
