Brigadier Gabriel Ramushwana is to become commander of the new South African National Peacekeeping Force. He was apparently a compromise candidate, and it could be a thankless job, with so many valuables to contend with in a South Africa in the midst of change. On the line to Venda, Jeremy Skeet asked Brigadier Ramushwana whether he was surprised to get the job. [Begin recording] [Ramushwana] Oh yes, I was really surprised. That came from the blue really, I couldn't believe it. [Skeet] How do you see your role in this position? [Ramushwana] Well, I believe my role will be to, you know, create peace, to bring about peace within the South African region, and also to try, you know, to bridge differences that are there between political parties, followers, and so forth, and then also encourage the people to respect one another and to accept one another, as well as maintaining peace amongst themselves. [Skeet] Do you think you are the right man for this? You did lead a bloodless coup to take control of Venda. Do you think you are the right man for this? [Ramushwana] Well, maybe the people thought I was the right guy. For myself, I would say maybe I am. From the records, yes, in as far as this region is concerned, specially Venda as such, I took over in 1990, and I tried everything I could to bring the people together, to bring the warring factions together, and I also tried to do away with violence. Eventually, I succeeded. We are the most peaceful group of people within southern Africa today. [Skeet] Now, one of the conditions when you become leader of this national peacekeeping force is that you have to give up your present job, which is ruler of Venda. Are you prepared to do this? [Ramushwana] Oh yes, I am prepared to do this. Today I have been discussing with my Military Council regarding this issue, and we are almost about to finalize everything. I could step down by the end of the month, but I will still remain the chief of Venda Defense Force. We will be seconded to the South African Transitional Executive Council. [Skeet] And will you transfer power to someone else, or will you just dissolve Venda? [Ramushwana] No, no, no. What I will do is, seeing that the period is so short from now to the elections, I think it will be appropriate for me if I had to ask someone to take over from me and then continue up to after the elections. [Skeet] Now, you are also on the ANC [African National Congress] list of potential candidates for the elections. Now, you taking this position means you will have to give up any political ambitions you have. [Ramushwana] Yes, I have already, you know, resigned or, shall I say, asked them to remove my name from the list in order to be able to do my job properly. [Skeet] So, after the elections, do you see your role within the new South African Defense Force? [Ramushwana] Oh yes, the National Peacekeeping Force will obviously be part and parcel of the new South African Defense Force.
