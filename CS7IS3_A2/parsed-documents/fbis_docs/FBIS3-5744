Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told reporters the government has decided to send only Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi to the Detroit meeting as other ministers invited to the meeting are unable to go because of Diet business. "There is a perception that deliberation on the (fiscal 1994) budget is more important, so the government made a decision to have only the labor minister attend," Takemura said. U.S. President Bill Clinton has invited officials of the other G-7 major industrial countries -- Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- to the meeting to discuss ways to create new jobs. From Japan, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and Economic Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota were also invited to the meeting.
