Medvedev, member of the personnel certification commission, by Andrey Uglanov; place and date not given: "On the Invisible Front; the Eyes and Ears Will Remain"] [Text] "Fighters of the invisible front," "knights of the cloak and dagger"--these romantic labels have stopped accompanying employees of the KGB, and later, of the Ministry of Security. At first, they were deprived of the halo of the infallible, and afterwards a quiet attempt was made to get rid of them. The latest attempt at such a radical riddance was the reorganization of the Ministry of Security into the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS), with fundamental changes in functions. The personnel certification commission also appeared. Our interlocutor is N. Medvedev, a member of the commission. [Uglanov] Nikolay Pavlovich, has the president decided to completely get rid of the very mention of the KGB and the Ministry of Security? [Medvedev] In accordance with his edict, the functions of the GB [Security Service] are being changed. Now, these are counterintelligence organs. With the change in functions, there is also a change in the qualitative composition of personnel. Certification of the personal qualifications of personnel, of course, is going on, with their political views being taken into account. And it is clear: These organs should serve the state. [Uglanov] But whom did they serve? [Medvedev] Also the state. But how? Ideological and political functions that were not natural for a normal state were being performed. And after the reformation of the KGB all that occurred was a change in the signboard. All of the traditional approaches of serving the state remained. [Uglanov] Well, for example? [Medvedev] In Penza Oblast, security organs publicly arrested the head of administration of the oblast before the elections (he was appointed by the president). The Procuracy and the court investigated this incident, and the case was closed--"There was no reason to find fault with the head of administration." But the Ministry of Security and the heads of administration are associated with one and the same structure--the authority of the president. And this is what the question was--how to serve the state. [Uglanov] Does the commission have access to lists of the agents of the Ministry of Security among the deputies, journalists, politicians, and others? [Medvedev] There is a person on the commission's staff who can have such access. [Uglanov] But do you not feel sorry for generals who served faithfully and truthfully? [Medvedev] A majority of those who are presented to the commission will be certified. We are reviewing those who were removed by the managers of the Federal Counterintelligence Service--N. Golushko and S. Stepashin. But I, for example, have doubts about the Penza leadership and the heads of this department in St. Petersburg and in Leningrad Oblast. This is associated first and foremost with questions of a political nature. [Uglanov] Thus, will the reduction of the leadership of the Ministry of Security be noticeable or not? [Medvedev] It will be. [Uglanov] And will the buildings, for example in the center of Moscow, be vacated? [Medvedev] I think that part of them, yes. But they will be occupied by the Border Troops Service. [Uglanov] Will secret collaborators of the KGB fall under the reduction. [Medvedev] With the change in Ministry of Security functions, I think so. But for purposes of counterintelligence work, everything will be done. The eyes and ears will remain. But there will be no surveillance for ideological and political reasons. There also will be no thoughtless reductions. We will not create the kind of situation where an embittered professional would pass into the criminal and shady sphere. [Uglanov] It is most likely that the hunt has already started for generals and their brains. [Medvedev] Yes, and not only for generals. But all of the specialists will remain. I do not rule out a situation when we will even have to increase the number of workers for new functions.
