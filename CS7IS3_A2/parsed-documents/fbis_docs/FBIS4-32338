The statement says: This is an important step along the road toward strengthening the stability of our continent, compatible with the philosophy of the program. It is suited to new European conditions and the new tasks of the Atlantic Alliance. Poland, which joined the Partnership for Peace on 2 February and submitted its presentation document on 25 April of this year and is now close to coordinating an individual partnership program with NATO, hopes that Russia's participation in the program will also promote partnerlike Polish-Russian cooperation. We invariably believe that good cooperation between NATO and Russia, pursued with respect for the interests of all partner states, irrespective of their size and military potential, is of fundamental significance for security and stability in Europe. Poland is convinced that this cooperation should be accompanied by a gradual expansion of the Alliance to interested states that share its objectives and values. This would promote the implementation of Alliance tasks and the stabilization of the European situation, the Foreign Ministry statement says.
