In a statement read on Radio Metropole, the Senate quaestor made reference to brutalities committed against employees. He also denounced the behavior of legislators who used force to control the Senate. [Begin Larosilliere recording] The Senate office strongly condemns the acts of violence and the brutalities against Senate employees not only by senators elected in the contested 18 January 1993 elections, but by other senators as well. Despite the threats by members of the so-called office, threats on radio, and the arbitrary arrest of the assistant chief of the Senate supply service under the instigation of those same citizens, one did not imagine that they would move from words to action. In fact, some Senate employees were ill-treated, some beaten by this same group and other armed individuals working for them. Since the office has no means of dealing with this situation except those provided by the Constitution and the Senate's internal rules, the office is obliged to take the following extraordinary and limited measures: 1. While waiting for the office to take all necessary measures to guarantee the security of all senators and staff, the quaestor's office asks employees not to show up for work on Avenue Marie-Jeanne in the Biscentenaire area. 2. The office asks the staff to keep in touch with the quaestor's office in order to receive their paychecks and all other important communications. Thank you. 8 March 1994, Julio Larossiliere, senator of the Republic, quaestor in the Senate. [end recording]
