Uhrlau told FOCUS: "Of course, we class the Republikaner among the right-wing extremists. After all, they are watched by the BfV all over the FRG." The Cologne Office for the Protection of the Constitution takes a different view. In internal statistics for 1993, the Cologne officials do not class Schoenhuber's adherents among the 43,000 right-wing extremists in Germany. According to Office Spokesman Hans-Gerd Lange, there are "only starting points for extreme-right aspirations." Uhrlau, however, talks of 66,000 right-wing extremists, including 23,000 Republikaner. Uhrlau said: "I do not understand why the Republikaner are ignored in the statistics."
