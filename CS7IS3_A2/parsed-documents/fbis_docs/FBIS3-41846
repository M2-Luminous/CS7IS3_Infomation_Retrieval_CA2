In a press conference at the end of his two-day visit to China, Hata said, ``Japan hopes to resume the normalization talks at an early date.'' The Japanese minister said that he discussed this offer during his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who he said welcomed it. Western sources here said unofficial contacts had already begun between the Japanese and North Korean Embassies in Beijing on matters related to resuming the normalization talks. They said Japan first expressed their willingness to resume the talks to the North Korean Embassy in Beijing toward the close of last year. ``The time of the resumption of the talks could possibly be either next month or March,'' one of the sources said. Regarding the North Korean nuclear issues, Minister Hata said Japan and China agreed that the recent substantial progress in U.S.- North Korea contacts was a welcome development. Hata added he believes North Korea would not resort to any careless acts inasmuch as their nuclear question is directly linked to peace and stability in the whole region of Northeast Asia let alone the Korean peninsula.
