On China's position on the Korean nuclear issue, Jiang Zemin said: We follow with great interest current events. We always believe that sufficient patience is required to solve such complex issues as the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The greater the difficulties, the more it is necessary to keep calm. We appeal to all parties concerned to exercise restraint and act prudently. In solving the problem, the ultimate objectives should be to safeguard peace and stability on the peninsula and to achieve denuclearization there. So long as we do not deviate from these two basic objectives, there is always the possibility of finding out a proper way to solve the problem, no matter what temporary difficulties might happen. We should see that the door of negotiations has not yet been closed, and room to maneuver and the possibility of dialogue still exist. All parties concerned should take active measures to avoid intensifying the crisis, and not let the efforts made by all parties over the last year and more be wasted. China does not approve of sanctions. It is because sanctions do not help the solution of the problem. On the contrary, they will escalate the event and have consequences which none of the parties is willing to see. I believe that only dialogue and consultations are the effective way to solve the problem, as well as the fundamental way out. On Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang Zemin said: President Clinton recently announced his decision to extend China's most favored nation [MFN] status and to delink the human rights issue from the MFN status in the days to come. The decision will help China and the United States strengthen and expand economic cooperation and trade, and it conforms to the fundamental interests of the two countries and their peoples. I believe that so long as both sides consider the future, the world situation as a whole, and their fundamental interests, adhere to the principles set in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, enhance trust, reduce trouble, develop cooperation, and avoid confrontation, Sino-U.S. relations will develop smoothly and healthily. Jiang Zemin also expressed his views on Sino-Japanese relations. He said: Despite several changes in Japan's political scene, the friendly cooperation between China and Japan in various fields is still progressing steadily. Japan's various parties in the government and the public and the broad masses of the Japanese people are of the same view in strengthening and developing the good-neighborly, friendly, and cooperative relations between China and Japan. Established on the basis of extensive common interests and long historical and cultural origins, as well as on a solid mass foundation, the Sino-Japanese friendship is full of great vitality. A politician should conform to the historical trend and do some solid deeds for the development of bilateral relations. The 20th century is coming to an end soon. There is a civilian organization between China and Japan -- the 21st Century Committee for China- Japan Friendship. It indicates that both Chinese and Japanese peoples wish to bring Sino-Japanese relations characterized by mutual understanding and trust, equality, cooperation, and common prosperity into the 21st century, so the friendship between the two countries will pass on from generation to generation. I am fully confident in the future of Sino-Japanese relations. When the reporter asked about China's stand on Japan's becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council [UNSC], Jiang Zemin said: We have noticed that Japan wishes to become a permanent member of the UNSC and play a greater role in international affairs. We understand and attach importance to such a wish. China is in favor of expanding the size of UNSC when the time is ripe to reflect the reality of the changing international situation, and the increasing number of UN members. We maintain, in the meantime, that the wealth of a country should not be the sole condition taken into consideration, and that the principle of fair regional distribution, and the principle of unanimity in consultation should be fully honored in approaching this issue. The reform of the UNSC is presently at the preliminary stage, and opinions should be solicited from the vast number of its members on specific ways to carry out the reform. Hatsuhisa Takashima is a senior commentator on international issues in Japan and has interviewed numerous famous world leaders. President Jiang Zemin met him once in November 1989.
