The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] said Monday's attack in Misr al-Qadimah, after which the assailants shot and wounded eight Egyptians while fleeing the scene, was "in retaliation for the recent executions" of several al-Jama'ah members. Al-Jama'ah claimed responsibility in a statement sent to the Arabic daily AL-HAYAH, which is published in several capitals. At least 261 people have been killed since March 1992, when Islamic militants stepped up their violent campaign aimed at toppling the secular government of President Husni Mubarak. The government has rounded up hundreds of suspects and hanged 23 Moslem fundamentalists since June.
