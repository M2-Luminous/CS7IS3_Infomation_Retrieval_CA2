At NATO Headquarters in Brussels Wednesday Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Federation minister of foreign affairs, signed a framework document on the general principles of participation in this program, whose aims have already been supported by 20 European states. International observers have unanimously called Russia's signing of this program a most important stage in the new relations of security which have taken shape since the end of the "Cold War." Although the program might be far from perfect, it will, nevertheless, significantly strengthen mutual trust and openness in the interests of all European states. As a transitional form of cooperation, the program will provide both NATO and Russia with time and opportunities to formulate more clearly the terms of Russia's joining the North Atlantic Alliance. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has called the signing of the treaty one more stage on the way to uniting Russia with the West. In actual fact, however, it is, rather, part of a policy based on the "wait and see" principle. If in time it becomes clear that the economic and democratic reforms in Russia are becoming stronger, then there will be no difficulties in the way of further rapprochement; if not, however, there will be no need for NATO to regret that caution was displayed in the past, the BBC points out. Russia has been granted special status with due regard to the fact that its joining NATO is not envisaged in the long term, Radio Deutsche Welle reports. But Russia has had to make concessions not only on this point. The NATO alliance has denied Moscow a rigid consultation mechanism and the right to vote on the alliance's affairs. But, however positively Russia's subscribing to the "Partnership for Peace" program is evaluated, it is clear that this certainly does not mean the elimination of the contradictions between Russia and NATO over the aims of this cooperation.
