Addressing a news conference at the Russian Defense Ministry on the results of the meeting, Pavel Grachev said that joint preparations for a presentational document, reflecting specific measures of cooperation between Russia and NATO, would start in July at the level of military experts. Among other things, this would clarify certain measures planned for 1994, of which there are more than 30, and produce more detailed plans for military cooperation in 1995. The minister said that the framework document of Partnership for Peace and the Russia-NATO protocol to the same program, both signed by Russia, open up a variety of prospects for military cooperation. Pavel Grachev noted that during the meeting agreement was reached on the establishment of NATO missions in Russia and Russian military missions at NATO's Supreme Allied Command, Europe, and at NATO HQS. Agreement was also reached on a telephone link between the General Staff of the Russian armed forces and NATO's Supreme Allied Command. According to Pavel Grachev, cooperation would also develop between fleets and districts, "which will also take in military units." Plans for cooperation also envisage participation by Russian Defense Ministry representatives as observers at NATO military exercises and talks between the General Staff of the Russian Federation armed forces and NATO's Supreme Allied Command. Pavel Grachev described consideration for Russia's interests and the adoption of mutually agreed decisions as the main condition for the development of such ties.
