The United States, on the other hand, is confident that the plan is ideal and that it has finally hit upon a simple solution for Bosnia. The latest analyses made in Zagreb, however, seem to indicate that the U.S. solution is far from being simple. Zagreb's acceeding in the U.S. plan is being seen as a Croatian effort to get out from under U.N. pressure. Furthermore, diplomats in Belgrade point out, any solution devised at the expense of a third side -- in this case, Bosnian Serbs -- is bound to fail. This view is shared by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, who believes that the U.S. plan is acceptable only if it has no ulterior motive other than lasting peace in Bosnia. The Washington talks are interesting also from another aspect -- that of the United States' former support for Bosnian Moslems. Washington's idea to unite the Moslems and Croats denotes its reluctance to permit the creation of an Islamic state in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Any future U.S. support for the Moslems must be regarded only in the context of their unification with the Croats, it is being heard in Belgrade. In any case, one thing is clear -- both the Moslems and the Croats have an interest at this time in falling in with the U.S. plan. However, during the two years of war, the two sides have signed and then ignored a host of different agreements, always running true to form of saying one thing, doing another and plotting a third.
