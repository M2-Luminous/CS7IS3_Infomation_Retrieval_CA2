Is it a warning to UN officials who are not taking a firm stance in defending the "blue helmets?" Is it a warning to the warring factions which continue to fight despite the peace plan theoretically agreed on by the big powers in Geneva? The announcement in Paris on Tuesday, 17 May, of the "partial" withdrawal of the French "blue helmets" from Bosnia caused some dismay among the leaders of the UN troops on the spot. The withdrawal of almost 1,000 French troops from Glina in northern Krajina (territory in the hands of Serbian separatists in Croatia) by 15 June was planned "to compensate for the dispatch of French reinforcements to Sarajevo (1,000 men) in March following the NATO ultimatum. But the announcement of another "withdrawal," that of the French battalion (almost 1,300 men) from Bihac, a Muslim enclave in western Bosnia, surprised everybody in Zagreb, the general headquarters of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Especially those mainly concerned -- the leaders of the French contingent. The statement by French Defense Minister Francois Leotard (full withdrawal from Bihac by the end of the year), then the qualifying remarks by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe ("if there is no progress in the peace negotiations"), sowed doubt about Paris' real intentions. UNPROFOR "understands the frustrations" of France, "which has long been the main contributor of troops to this operation," but it has not been "officially informed" about France's intention to reduce its contingent, a spokesman for the force, commanded by French General Bernard de Lapresle, said on Tuesday. The leaders of the French "blue helmets" have not been informed about the intention to withdraw from Bihac, a UN "safe area," where the military situation continues to deteriorate under the double blows of Fikret Abdic's Muslim dissidents, supported to the west by the Krajina Serbs (Croatia), and the assaults of the Bosnian Serb forces to the east. The statement came as a surprise although the French have been trying for months, without success, to be replaced by other "blue helmets," especially Malaysians, in Bihac. Diplomatic and financial circles have speculated that financial considerations or rather that of "media profile" lies behind this decision: The French battalion in Bihac is costly. And although it is popular and has probably saved the enclave from a Serbian invasion, the press, concentrated in Sarajevo, says little about it. Some people do not rule out the possibility that, by overdramatizing the situation, the defense minister is trying to secure more funding. Nor is it possible to rule out the possibility that French officials are trying rather noisily to send a signal both to the UN civilian leaders and to the warring sides. With regard to Bihac, incidents took place in March during a Serb offensive between the French authorities and the UN civilian officials. France cannot continue its participation in the UN forces in Bosnia "on a lasting basis" if its soldiers cannot "defend themselves against aggression," Mr. Leotard said, while the UN secretary general's representative took a long time to ask the NATO planes to silence the Serb guns which were bombarding the French "blue helmets" in Bihac. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who made a surprise visit to Bihac after this incident, criticized "the excessively long delays, the excessively cumbersome administrative and political procedures" for organizing military responses by air in the case of attacks on the "blue helmets." The new warning of the "partial withdrawal" comes at a time when the UN "safe areas" of Bihac, Tuzla, and Sarajevo are once again the target of Serbian fire, without UN officials reacting. That cannot "improve the situation" a UNPROFOR spokesman explained to us. The cacophony in Paris -- which is not the first -- on all events is sowing confusion within the ranks of UNPROFOR in Zagreb. Many people here are simply wondering whether the French Government has just one policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina.
