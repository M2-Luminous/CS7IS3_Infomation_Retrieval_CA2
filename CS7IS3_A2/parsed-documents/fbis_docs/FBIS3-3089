Both sides are still taking a forward-looking attitude toward the development of Sino-U.S. relations. Both sides maintain that "Sino-U.S. relations are very important and are willing to promote the improvement and development of relations between the two countries." Warren Christopher said: "Bill Clinton is determined to establish extensive and more constructive relations with China. Both sides should seize the opportunity and take action so that bilateral relations can be further developed." China and the United States have crossed swords frankly and seriously on the human rights issue, but both sides have taken a century-straddling long-term view toward the potential for developing the relations between the two countries and safeguarding the common interests of maintaining international peace and security. This has enabled the two sides to reach consensus on five areas, in which cooperation is possible. First, both sides have agreed to continue to maintain the momentum of high-level exchanges between the two countries. In April this year, Song Jian and Wu Yi will attend a meeting of the Sino-U.S. Science, Technology, Commerce, and Trade Committee in the United States. This indicates that both sides want to develop cooperation in science, technology, economy, and trade. Second, the U.S. side has reaffirmed its firm support to the restoration of China's status as a signatory state to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Third, China and the United States have agreed to resume and develop exchanges between the armed forces of the two countries, and both sides have agreed to establish a committee for using the national defense industry to produce products for civilians. Fourth, the Chinese side has agreed to allow a U.S group to come to China in the near future to carry out on-the-spot investigations on three cases of missing U.S. personnel during the war in Vietnam. Fifth, China and the United States have signed a statement on cooperation in implementing the memorandum on prison products. These results show that both China and the United States are calmly aware of the tremendous benefits of bilateral cooperation. This is in the interest of both countries. The common interest of both sides is not confined to the economy. On many hot spot issues of the world, China and the United States need coordination and cooperation at the UN Security Council. Both China and the United Stated have a tremendous influence on international affairs and share some identical views. They absolutely are capable of joining hands in settling regional security and peace issues. Without China's cooperation, the United States will not be able to properly resolve many problems. Therefore, if the United States adopts a policy of isolating China, it will also be isolated, and this does not conform with its interest. The Seattle Conference has laid a framework for the development of Sino-U.S. relations. Since Warren Christopher has admitted that the United States is not seeking a change in China's social system but hopes to establish extensive and stable relations with China, the question of how China and the United States should get along peacefully has become the key to developing relations in the future. It is impossible to have genuine cooperation if one side exerts pressure on the other side while talking about cooperation and compels the other side to submit to, and act according to, its will, treating the other side as a dependent. Nor is it possible to develop long-term stable relations if one country compels the other country to implement the administrative order of its president and its laws. Warren Christopher's diplomatic approach during his recent visit to China remained an attempt to take a high-handed policy, a practice which has divorced itself from the tide of history. The U.S. national strength is less than it was in the past, and the United States can no longer impose its will on its Western allies in many international issues. The United States met with a soft rebuff on the issues of Bosnia and Somali. In dealing with its relations with Russia and Japan, the United States failed to attain the anticipated results, despite the pressure it had exerted. Even in handling its contradictions with Haiti and the Philippines, the United States can no longer implement the policy of wielding a big stick. There are differences between China and the United States on the human rights issue, and such differences do not only exist between China and the United States. Similar sharp differences also exist between the United States and many Third World countries. In order to settle the differences, the United States has adopted the policy of the stick and has advocated the linkage of human rights with most favored nation trade status. It has asserted that there are only a little over two months left, and it is quite possible that the United States will not give most favored nation trading status to China. This of course has evoked the strong opposition of China. China has advocated the separation of human rights from the most favored nation issue. How can China submit to the United States and accept the instructions of the administrative order of the U.S. President? Would China not become the 51st state governed by the U.S. President if it made such a concession? The Chinese people have struggled over the past century and more to make their country independent. Succeeding in making the people rich and the country strong means the realization of the right to subsistence and the right to development, the most important human rights. Through thorough and frank dialogues during his recent visit to China in his capacity as secretary of state, Warren Christopher has very concretely understood China's national policies and principles on the concept of human rights and has understood that the three joint declarations remain the foundation of Sino-U.S. relations. The spirit of these three declarations is mutual noninterference in one another's internal affairs. Most favored nation status is not a favor which is bestowed but is given mutually. The development of Sino-U.S. trade will benefit both sides. Nevertheless, China will never agree to become a dependent and lose its sovereignty and independence. It will never act according to the order of the U.S. President for the sake of most favored nation trading status. Qian Qichen said yesterday: "I believe that Sino-U.S. trade will continue." This is China's assessment of the prospects for Sino-U.S. trade. The U.S. Secretary of State came to visit China in order to solve problems. The pattern was already fixed at the Seattle Conference; China and the United States share an understanding; and both the American business circles and people favor the development of cooperation and diplomatic relations with China. The two sides are currently at a difficult stage; however, there should be ways to overcome the difficulties. Is it not probable that the U.S. President will handle his own administrative order after all?
