ULIMO is an armed Liberian faction. The deployment began on 1 March throughout the country to disarm all the factions. In principle, this should have begun under UN supervision on 7 March. ULIMO guards at the Po River checkpoint told AFP: "We will not allow ECOMOG to be deployed to our sector because we have not received orders to that effect." They also reiterated their request for "financial compensation before handing over their arms." Last week, ULIMO chairman, Alhaji Koromah, asked for $5 million from the United Nations to fund the reintegration of his troops into civilian life. On 1 March, General Ian Douglas, coordinator of the reinsertion program of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, indicated that an "emergency fund" of $180,000 would be granted. During a visit to the Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL] camp in Schieffelin, 20 km east of Monrovia, Gen. Douglas stressed that "the aid would be effective only after disarmament, camping, and demobilization" of the forces of the three leading armed factions, the AFL, ULIMO, and the National Patriotic Front of Liberia.
