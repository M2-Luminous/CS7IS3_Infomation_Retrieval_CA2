FR940412-2-00030 FR940412-2-00018 Intent To Prepare a Draft Supplement to the Final Environmental Impact Statement (DSEIS) for the Red River Chloride Control Project, Texas and Oklahoma AGENCY: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, DOD. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The purpose of the DSEIS is to address changes in ``without project'' conditions since filing of the final Environmental Impact Statement on 27 May 1977. ADDRESSES: Tulsa District Corps of Engineers, P.O. Box 61, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74121&hyph;0061. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. John P. Mace, Chief, Environmental Analysis and Support Branch, (918) 669&hyph;7188. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The overall project was authorized for water quality control by the Flood Control Act of 1966, Public Law 89&hyph;789; as modified by the Flood Control Act approved 31 December 1970, Public Law 91&hyph;611; and as amended by the Water Resources Development Acts of 1974 and 1976. A final environmental impact statement for the project dated July 1976 was filed and published in the Federal Register on 27 May 1977. Facilities already constructed include a ring dike at Estelline Springs (Area V), the Bateman low-flow collection dam on the South Fork of the Wichita River (Area VIII) and Truscott Brine Lake which is located on Bluff Creek, a tributary of the North Fork of the Wichita River near Truscott, Texas. The Lowrance (Area X) low-flow collection facility, which will pump into Truscott, is currently under construction. Funds have been appropriated to begin completion of design and construction of the remaining authorized facilities at Areas VI, VII, IX, Crowell Brine Lake, XIII, and XIV, Oklahoma and Texas. Significant issues to be addressed in the DSEIS include changes in the pool size of the Crowell Brine Lake, changes in methods of collection and disposal (Deep Well Injection) at Areas XIII and XIV, and possible changes in location and types of collection facilities and disposal at Area VI. Reasonable Alternatives to be Considered Include: No action, deep well injection, and relocation of the Area VI Brine Storage Lake. Significant Issues to be Addressed in the DSEIS Include: The potential impact of decreased chloride concentrations in the Red River Basin on primary production and sport fish abundance in Lake Texoma, impacts on Federally listed threatened and/or endangered species, changes in land use at the Area VI disposal site, and any changes in fish and wildlife mitigation requirements resulting from the noted changes. A scoping meeting is not planned, however, a news release informing the public and local, state, and Federal agencies of the proposed action will be published in local newspapers. Comments received as a result of this notice and the news release will be used to assist the Tulsa District in identifying potential impacts to the quality of the human or natural environments. Affected Federal, state, or local agencies, affected Indian tribes, and other interested private organizations and parties may participate in the scoping process by forwarding written comments to the above noted address. The DSEIS is expected to be available for public review and comment by June 1994. Any comments and suggestions should be forwarded to the above noted address no later than 1 May 1994 to be considered in the DSEIS. Kenneth L. Denton, Army Federal Register Liaison Officer.
