The sources said 'Amr will brief Damascus about what is going on in Cairo, and will discuss the cordon states meeting and the possibility for the PLO to participate in it. 'Amr was a member of the Syrian Arab Socialist Ba'th Party during the 1960's and 1970's, and he was a former member of the party's Regional Command. The visit is taking place at a time when the PLO leadership is facing a real crisis as a result of Israeli procrastination and blackmailing in Cairo talks.
