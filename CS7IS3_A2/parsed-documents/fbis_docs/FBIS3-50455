The defense minister, who was released from the Shaio clinic yesterday, said Venezuela's decision to reinforce counterinsurgency operations in the border area is appropriate. The senior Colombian official said: "We agree with those decisions and it seems to us very appropriate that they have taken strong measures to control their side of the border area." He reiterated that "there is absolutely no problem with the Armed Forces. There is permanent coordination and communication and we consult with each other on many of the decisions that affect security along the border. There is total harmony in this regard." The minister said coordination also exists with the Ecuadoran authorities to stop violent actions. The minister made his remarks after learning about the Venezuelan Government decision to create a rural security committee to reactivate the specific commando units and vigorously deal with the activities of the Colombian guerrillas in the border area, where 200 Venezuelan cattle ranchers have been kidnapped. Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda said that 1993 has been a good year for the Armed Forces and the National Police, because results were achieved in many fields. The minister announced he will return to work in three weeks and he has already begun to keep abreast of the issues being handled by his office.
