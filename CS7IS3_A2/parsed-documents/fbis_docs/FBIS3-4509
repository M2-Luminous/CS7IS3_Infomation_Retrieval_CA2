In a routine press briefing for both Chinese and foreign press members, Wu said Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Jiang Zemin agreed on a three-point principle in connection with the Korean situation. The principle was the maintenance of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, resolution of the North Korean nuclear question through dialogue, and non-use of pressure against North Korea over the nuclear issue. Reiterating China's opposition to any resolution by the U.N. Security Council, spokesman Wu said, "since dialogue alone will be the only means of resolving the question, Security Council president's statement containing considerate contents would implant patience for constructive dialogue among the parties involved and would thus make it possible to resume dialogue." He said the summit between Presidents Kim and Jiang did not discuss the issues of the Team Spirit and Patriot missiles. "But, China's policy is against any acts of threatening stability and building up tension on the Korean peninsula, such as the staging of a military exercise and deployment of Patriot missiles," Wu said. Stating that President Kim's visit to China was highly successful, the spokesman said South Korea and China will closely cooperate in the economic and trade areas based on the mutual understanding made through a series of meetings between President Kim and Chinese leaders.
