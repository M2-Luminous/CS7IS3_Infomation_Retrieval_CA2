FBIS4-58262 "drnes085_m_94009" FBIS-NES-94-085 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 JORDAN U.S. `Grudge' Seen Fueling Anti-Jordan Moves U.S. `Grudge' Seen Fueling Anti-Jordan Moves JN2804142594 Amman AKHBAR AL-USBU' in Arabic 28 Apr 94 pp 1, 18 JN2804142594 Amman AKHBAR AL-USBU' Arabic BFN ["Exclusive report"] [Text] Even with the fabricated atmosphere permeating Jordanian-U.S. meetings, and the less-than-warm statements about relations, the United States continues to harbor a grudge against Jordan and expresses dissatisfaction with its pan-Arab policy. The United States is also playing a decisive role in maintaining the estrangement between Jordan and Saudi Arabia. It wants to confuse Jordan's stands and to foil its initiatives and policies. The reason for all this is that the United States still insists that Jordan supplied Iraq with information about coalition forces during the Gulf war and that it was, and still is, an outlet supplying Iraq with its needs, despite the unjust embargo. The United States continues to tighten the siege on the Port of al-'Aqabah in order to cause more harm to the Jordanian economy, in retaliation for the Jordanian masses' stands in support of Iraq -- stands that continued to escalate and nurtured a sense of hostility in the Jordanian arena against the United States's positions. Political analysts say that during every meeting with Jordan, the United States asks questions about the Gulf war, attempting to confirm its doubts and statements. By interfering in Jordan's relations with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, it tries to isolate Jordan and its positions from any Arab support. Jordan has confirmed to the United States that these accusations are untrue and that its role during the Gulf was only a moral one. The Israeli claim that Jordan accommodates Hamas leaders is the second stage of the U.S.-Israeli conspiracy aimed at creating a state of instability in Jordan. Jordan condemned such interference in its domestic affairs, saying it does not allow anyone to impose a mandate or a decision on it because this constitutes an encroachment on its sovereignty and violates its stands. The Americans tried several times to twist Jordan's arm by various means of intimidation and temptation for the purpose of singling Jordan out. However, despite all its suffering, Jordan has rejected these demands and maintained its firm pan-Arab stand toward Palestine and the Gulf war.
