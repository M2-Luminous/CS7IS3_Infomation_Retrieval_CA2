FR940208-2-00084 FR940208-2-00069 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33561; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;15] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Partial Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to an Extension of Its Pilot After-Hours Trading Facility February 1, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 notice is hereby given that on April 21, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On January 4, 1994, the Amex amended the filing to request that the pilot program for its After-Hours Trading facility be extended for a three-month period, until April 30, 1994, while the Commission considers the Exchange's request for permanent approval of the pilot program. 3 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 As originally filed, File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;15 requested permanent approval of Amex's pilot After-Hours Trading facility. On January 4, 1994, the Amex amended the filing with an additional request for a three-month extension of the pilot in order to give the Commission adequate time to consider the request for permanent approval and requested that the extension be granted accelerated approval. See letter from William Floyd-Jones, Jr., Amex, to Sandra Sciole, Special Counsel, Commission, dated December 23, 1993. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Exchange proposes to extend its pilot After-Hours Trading (``AHT'') facility through April 30, 1994. The current pilot program was scheduled to expire on January 31, 1994. The Exchange requests accelerated approval of the proposed rule change. The Exchange believes that accelerated effectiveness is appropriate since it would permit the Exchange's existing AHT facility to continue operating while the Commission considers permanent approval of the facility. The proposal to extend the AHT pilot, therefore, does not raise any new questions for the commission's consideration. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose In August 1991, the Commission partially approved the Exchange's AHT facility on a temporary basis. 4 This facility permits the execution of coupled and single-sided closing price orders after the close of the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading session. Commencing at 4:15 p.m., single-sided round lot orders for equity securities can be entered through the Exchange's PER system or left with the specialist or the specialist's authorized representative for matching and execution at 5 p.m. at the Exchange's last closing regular way price. Coupled buy and sell round lot, odd lot and partial round lot orders also can be entered through the PER system, or left with the specialist for execution at 5 p.m. against each other at the Exchange's last regular way price. Members are permitted to designate good `til cancelled (``GTC'') limit orders entered during the regular trading session as eligible for execution in the AHT session. Such orders are marked ``GTX'' and migrate to the AHT facility for possible execution. 5 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29515 (August 2, 1991), 56 FR 37736 (August 8, 1991) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;91&hyph;15) (Amex AHT Approval Order). 5 The Commission notes that the Amex's AHT facility enables members, not including specialists, to enter both proprietary and agency orders in any Exchange traded equity security, including stocks, rights, warrants, primes and scores, ADRs, and non-option equity derivative products, for execution at the Exchange's last closing regular way price.
