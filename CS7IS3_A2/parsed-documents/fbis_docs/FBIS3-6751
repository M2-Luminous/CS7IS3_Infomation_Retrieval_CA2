WASHINGTON TIMES said Seiji Yoshida, an officer of the old Japanese Army, confessed that he, together with his men, kidnapped more than 1,000 young Korean girls as "comfort women fo the army" and threw them into a concentration camp, but he had not been put to a trial after the war. Noting that nearly 200,000 Korean women are said to have been drafted as "comfort women for the army", the paper said such atrocities were committed on the instructions of the then top authorities of Japan. The Belgian paper SOLIDAIRE said the Japanese Army not only forcibly drafted Korean women as sex slaves but also unhesitatingly committed such beastly atrocities as murdering "comfort women" by dismembering and burning them in groups after satisfying their sexual desire. The Malaysian paper SIN CHEW JIT POH said that the Japanese "imperial Army's" history of rape and murder was a filthy history, a history of ruining women. Hiroshi Takeuchi, mayor of Handa, Japan, told a press conference that truth is one, not two or three, however hard the government may try to conceal facts. He demanded a clear probe into the damages inflicted upon the Korean people and their backgrounds. Lidi Alajandro, general secretary of the New Progressive Union of the Philippines, recalled that the Japanese imperialists drafted a large number of women and forced them to serve as "comfort women for the army" during the Second World War. He said this is unpardonable and Japanese Government must bear responsibility for this. The AZAP News Agency of Zaire said the Japanese Government could never evade its responsibility for the misfortunes and sufferings inflicted upon the Korean people and human rights abuses. It must make a proper apology and compensations to the DPRK Government, urged the news agency.
