Outgoing Social Welfare Minister Monserrat Butina, accused of nepotism by the opposition, will be replaced by Deputy Alberto Cardenas, a member of the ruling Republican Unity Party. Education Minister Eduardo Pena, who at the end of 1993 had to deal with a two-month long strike by approximately 100,000 teachers and professors who work for the state, will be replaced by the Education Ministry's Assistant Culture Secretary Rosalia Arteaga. Industry, Commerce, and Integration Minister Jorge Garcia, who recently criticized several government policies, will be replaced by Jose Vicente Maldonado, who until today held the post of secretary general of the administration. Maldonado will be replaced by his former assistant secretary Carlos Larreategui. Cardenas and Maldonado are the third individuals appointed to the Ministries of Social Welfare and Industry, Commerce and Integration, respectively, by Duran-Ballen during his first 18 months in office. The president also appointed economist Marcel Laniado de Wind as executive director of the National Council of State Modernization. The announced changes, expected since December, are the result of specific situations faced by the outgoing ministers and not general political changes within the government. Most of the new officials will take the oath today during a ceremony that will be presided over by Duran-Ballen at Carondelet Palace, the presidential headquarters. The rest will be sworn in within the next few days.
