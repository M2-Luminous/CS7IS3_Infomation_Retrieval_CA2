In an interview published today, Sunday, in the Spanish daily LA VANGUARDIA, Gaviria says that he does not believe it is convenient "to pressure" the Cuban Government and that it is best to help the Caribbean country change its economy. "What we can look into as a possibility--but I do not know if Castro will go along with it--is to work along the lines followed by Spain, Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico in the past, keeping open the channels for dialogue and technical cooperation," he said. "We have to assess the situation to see if we can help Cuba change its economy," "with technical support and without subsidies or attempts to alleviate its economic situation," the Colombian president explained. The Colombian president believes Cuba has progressed in the economic sector during the past months "in a direction that could be described as correct." He said, however, the international community "is a bit impatient and would like political changes to take place more swiftly." Asked if he believed Cuba could achieve democracy with Castro in power, Gaviria replied: "As long as changes in Cuba continue in an orderly manner, the possibilities that will allow for a gradual change are important." Regarding the scheduled Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias on 14 and 15 June, Gaviria said it will basically be geared toward the exchange of economic, commercial, and investment experiences, bearing in mind the ongoing processes of integration. As in previous summits, the one in Cartagena will serve, according to the Colombian president, to strengthen cultural, linguistic, and economic ties between Latin America and Spain and Portugal. "Relations with Spain and Portugal have helped us extend an important bridge to the European Union," Gaviria told the Barcelonan newspaper. According to Gaviria, Ibero-American summits are very useful to the Cuban Government, because it listens to the experiences of the rest of the Latin American countries at those meetings and gathers "useful teachings." Gaviria said that with the death of drug trafficker Pablo Escobar, Colombia has left behind "the worst part of narcoterrorism" and shown that no criminal organization, regardless of how powerful it is, can challenge the state. The Colombia president attributes the violence in Colombia to the traditional weakness of the government and the administration of justice. "Violence comes from the past century. We have always had very high levels of violence," he said. "The main factor is not only poverty and the lack of policemen, but also inadequate justice," he added.
