On the one hand, it has a very practical aspect pertaining to a reduction of the indebtedness level; on the other hand, a very important aspect is the adoption of a timeframe for repayments in a way that would take into account the realistic capabilities of our state budget which is the result of the economic and budget situations. It is worth stressing here that a rescheduling of repayments to the London Club is advantageous also from the standpoint of the timeframe adopted by the Paris Club. Thanks to the agreement with the Paris Club....[Pawlak pauses] One must stress that recently, the London Club agreement was negotiated by Dresdner Bank, and the role of the Germans in leading up to the successful finalization of the talks is worth stressing here. On our part -- over the last six months -- we undertook various initiatives, both on the official level and in informal contacts, to lead to a successful completion of the agreement in question. The agreement -- while finalizing the process of restructuring the foreign debt -- sends a very clear message indeed, that Poland is a stable country which meets its obligations, and that is one of the determining factors when it comes to possibilities for cooperation, including major capital investments. [passage omitted] [Geryn] In January, there was the Prague meeting, in February -- the Brussels summit, and in March -- the Moscow meeting. In Prague, you talked about Partnership for Development. Is the Moscow visit a first step -- as it were -- on the way to implementing this proposal of yours? [Pawlak] The visit to Prague was actually the first step, since we want to see Partnership for Development as a process that primarily makes our region dynamic -- I mean the countries of Central Europe -- and during the Prague talks with the prime ministers, we talked about several specific types of measures that could possibly contribute to making cooperation among the governments more dynamic. These talks pertained to a speeding up of the implementation of measures regarding a free-trade zone in Central Europe which encompasses Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republic, and Hungary. That was the first step. During the Brussels talks, we also made it clear that what we need is partnership-like and balanced cooperation. The most recent visit -- that is the one to Moscow -- constitutes a completion of the process. The point is to stress the fact that Polish foreign policy should be targeted in many directions, and it should be open to those partners who want to cooperate with us on a very practical basis. [passage omitted] There is no easy way out of this, especially since right now, after a few years have passed, it is very hard to find the right conversion currency or to settle these transactions, and it is really not that clear at all who would gain more out of it given zero options. So what we wanted to do, was to concentrate on setting routine cooperation in motion. If cooperation develops dynamically and if we manage to sign agreements on contracts for delivery of strategic raw materials for many years to come, and if we adopt a trade protocol for 1994, then the results of these measures will make it possible to solve the problems of the past and of mutual debts more easily and more efficiently. These factors can definitely contribute to making cooperation more dynamic. Apart from that, we also talked about an infrastructure for cooperation and development broadly speaking -- beginning with cooperation among banks to make settling accounts easier, to enable companies to get in touch with one another faster, and to make economic exchange safer. Another element is the construction of a pipeline to make use of the potential resources of our economies, as well as construction of a highway and a railway that would connect Berlin with Warsaw, Minsk, and Moscow. Those are the factors that the government can influence, and these possibilities will later be implemented by specific companies and people. That is also the general scheme of looking for measures that would constitute the Partnership for Development. [Geryn] Mr. Prime Minister, you talked to your counterpart, that is Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, and the conversation was quite long, outside of the binding protocol. What is your assessment of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin? [Pawlak] I think what is very important is the practical approach to various issues. A very interesting conclusion from the conversations is that one can clearly see that the time we have wasted cannot be made up now or redeemed with any kind of money. And now, what is important is that when it comes to the practical side, one must move very clearly ahead, even if these are small steps. During the talks, we debated some principles of cooperation, then during plenary talks we agreed on specific measures and a timeframe for their implementation. During the talks, we came to a mutual conclusion that a visit by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin to Poland may take place in May, which may constitute the next stage in the practical implementation of various agreements and measures both by the government administration, and by specific companies, which would expand cooperation. I think that to go from a high level of grand ideologies down to the level of practical action, will significantly improve our mutual relations to our mutual advantage.
