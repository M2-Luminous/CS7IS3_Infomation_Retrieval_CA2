It outlines the delegation's further activities in the course of future peace negotiations on Bosnia, in a situation where the Bosnian Muslims have rejected the European Union [EU] plan. The five-point document states that the RS assembly has withdrawn the territorial concessions it initially offered because the Muslims have rejected the EU action plan as a formula for resolving the crisis, according to which they would get 33.3 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory. In the continuation of the peace process the RS delegation, the platform points out, will proceed from the real state of affairs -- on the basis of the EU plan -- and the concept of a union of three republics in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. The RS is a sovereign and independent state constituted in line with the universal right of a people to self-determination and it reserves the right to enter unions with other states. According to the published platform, the capital of the RS is Serbian Sarajevo (new Sarajevo). A separate peace agreement for the Sarajevo area, as envisaged under the peace plan, should be promptly signed in order to facilitate the talks on placing the city under UN administration. The RS borders, the platform says, will correspond to the factual situation on the ground, and also the RS would have an outlet to the Adriatic Sea (according to international law - the Corfu Declaration [1917], the Saint-Germain Charter [1919], and other international treaties), while some territories can be considered to be disputed and under a special regime. The borders between the Serb and Muslim states can, for the purpose of creating unified territories, be established by political dialogue, taking communications and other factors into consideration, and in this way a solution to the disputed territories might be found in a peaceful way. The borders between the Serb and Croat states in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina will be defined in the framework of a comprehensive Serb-Croat solution. The RS delegation proposes that the three warring sides immediately sign a peace agreement and enable a modus vivendi in the expectation of a final solution. The RS will, the platform says further, continue to take part in the peace negotiations on the basis of the EU plans, but it requests equal treatment in the negotiations. This means the abolition or suspension of the sanctions and the cessation of all threats against the Serbs. Finally, any violation of the integrity of the RS will be considered as an act of aggression, the platform unveiled by the RS delegation at the peace talks says.
