This has been provided in a draft decision on punishing criminals who violate copyrights submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, for deliberation today. The draft decision also designated that all reproductions that violate copyrights, illegal income from them, and materials, tools, facilities and other property used for this purpose will be confiscated no matter whether they belong to an individual person or a work unit. Director of the Legislative Affairs Work Committee of the NPC Standing Committee Gu Angran explained to the legislators that piracy of books, audio and video tapes, and computer software has become quite rampant in recent years, in illegal attempts to reap huge profits. "This has infringed upon the rights of the authors and destroyed the normal order of the socialist cultural market and economic activities," said the director. "It has also affected foreign trade of the country and its cultural and scientific exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries," he said, adding that perpetrators of this kind of activity should be severely punished. The legal expert stressed that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) also demands judicial punishment in domestic laws for such crimes violating intellectual property rights. The draft decision also provides that those who sell illegal reproductions with clear knowledge of their origin and have illegally reaped large sums of money will be punished with two years' imprisonment, detention and/or fines; if their illegal profits are especially big, they will be punished with two to five years' imprisonment, together with fines.
