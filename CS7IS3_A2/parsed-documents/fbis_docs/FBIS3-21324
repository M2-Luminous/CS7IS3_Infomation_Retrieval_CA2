Seshan, said. Mr Seshan, who began the first of the meetings of regional electoral officers here yesterday, in anticipation of elections due at the end of this year, told reporters that barring the national parties, observers and agents would be allowed into the booths by rotation and only 10 to 15 percent of the agents of independent candidates would be permitted at a time. The presence of a large number of persons when the officials were involved in the nitty-gritty of elections would only be an unnecessary diversion, Mr Seshan said. The meeting also had on the agenda measures to restrict the "manipulative, muscle and money power of privileged contestants that could affect the prospects of other candidates." This included controlling excessive and ostentatious expenditure and restricting the issue of facilities to the election staff to keep dummy candidates and other irritants at bay. There would also be a bar on ministers and candidates attending official meetings and any meetings that could influence the officials, as this would only divert attention of the staff during the elections. Mr Seshan was firm on the issue of the photo-identity cards to voters and said he would brook no excuses from any state government on that. If some state governments complained that they could not afford to spend Rs 100 crores on the cards, his stock answer was, "democracy doesn't come cheap." The deadline for completing the process of issuing identity cards is January 1, 1995. There would be no elections in states where this process is not completed by then, he reiterated. The process of issuing the cards had been "deliberately" decentralised, and besides the identity and other details of the voter, the card would sport a laser hologram of the state symbol to distinguish the card. The card would be as complete as possible, but the ultimate responsibility of ensuring that the entries were correct was on the voter himself. On the restriction of the number of vehicles and security provided to candidates, Mr Seshan clarified that it was subject to the needs of the security of the candidate concerned. Restricting the number of candidates to accommodate the "privileged" ones was no solution, and the election commission generally proceeded on the assumption that all candidates were serious candidates. The idea was to convey to the people the seriousness involved in the conduct of elections, he added. No decision has yet been taken on the use of electronic voting machines, since the government was not in a position to expend Rs 1,000 crores over three years to deploy them nationwide. Besides, the machines have several limitations, which could not be taken care of in the available time. The southern meeting was to be followed by those of the other five regions, including the central, northern, western, eastern and north-eastern regions in the coming weeks. The agenda for all these would be the same. Programmes to increase voter-awareness, and all measures to minimise violation of election norms were also considered at the meeting. Asked about the measures to deal with election-day eve malpractices, Mr Seshan said, "If I were to tell you that the entire election process can be finished in one shot, and everything taken care of, it would be stupid on my part." He stuck to his guns about the orders to political parties on cleaning up the walls and hoardings and removal of posters. "If I am ignored on this, I will bark, I'll bite, I'll shout and fight and do whatever needs doing to be obeyed on this," he warned.
