Alemao promised to obtain the support of 800 unions affiliated with Union Force, which is led by Luiz Antonio de Medeiros, the Popular Party's candidate for governor of Sao Paulo State. Union Force has chosen not to lend its support to any one candidate. Alemao said: "I feel absolutely comfortable with the coalition and with [former Bahia Governor] Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, who is a democrat and who is altogether different from those Stalinists and Lula supporters who advocate crime as an instrument of political struggle." Alemao believes that if Lula is elected there will be no investments in the country to create jobs. "It will bring tragic consequences for all workers," he said. Endorsing the principles of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Liberal Front Party-Brazilian Labor Party coalition, Alemao defends the internationalization of the Brazilian economy. He said: "This is why we are against Lula." Alemao is in favor of ending the state monopoly of oil and of privatizing state-owned companies. Alemao's first suggestion to Cardoso is to increase the goal of creating 8 million jobs during his four-year tenure. "That is not enough," Alemao said. He refused to admit that the economic stabilization program promoted by Cardoso will worsen unemployment in the country. He said: "One cannot state that the Real Plan is provoking unemployment." Although confirming that unions affiliated with Union Force will support Cardoso, Alemao made it clear that Cardoso will not use its facilities in his campaign. "We have sound trucks, but Cardoso will not use them," he said, criticizing once again the involvement of CUT [Sole Workers Center] affiliated unions in Lula's campaign. He said: "CUT has been completely overtaken." Asked if he would hold the post of labor minister if Cardoso wins the election, Alemao said he would rather take the reins of the economy. He said jokingly: "I would prefer to be the finance minister." Cardoso declined to comment on this issue. He said: "I will not discuss the formation of my cabinet at this time."
