In a situation when the Democratic Union is not capable of redefining its identity after the elections, Walesa is currently the only "institution" that is persistently opposed vis-a-vis the victorious coalition. And he is dealing with the situation in his own way: He would not be able to handle both the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] so he courts and bestows favors on the latter. He would have much less room for maneuver if the SLD and the PSL were able to speak with one voice, at least on the most important issues. By rejecting Rosati's candidacy, Walesa made public the fact that the SLD's personnel reserves are small. The president says: Provide me with another candidate, please (as if implying: After all, the party that won the elections should have plenty of candidates!) An opportunity arose, so it is worth doing some teasing and showing that the victorious party does not have many candidates ready to assume the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister. In addition, the one candidate the SLD could possibly submit--that is, Leslaw Paga--has already been submitted by Walesa himself. After that happened, Kwasniewski could be prevented from submitting Paga's name if only for reasons of prestige. The SLD and its leader responded in a way that can make Lech Walesa happy. For four days now, it has not been capable of coming up with any idea for solving the conflict. All the party does is make announcements several times a day that it upholds Rosati's candidacy. The SLD feels offended by the facts. Regardless of how unfair, in the SLD's view, the president's decision is, it is still a fact. Walesa had a constitutional right not to sign the nomination. He did it for reasons he officially announced and also because he likes to provoke people and then wait to see what the outcome will be. The SLD leaders refuse to take cognizance of Lech Walesa's decision. Aleksander Kwasniewski lets emotions take control of him, accuses the president of trying to destabilize the state, and flees from journalists in the Sejm building by using a ladder. In this situation, which is difficult but occasionally present in politics, one could have expected different behavior from a politician of the year 1993, the chief of the biggest deputies club in the Sejm and a "prime minister without portfolio." The coalition is acting in the president's favor. It was known from the time of the elections that the issue of a possible limitation of the president's powers will have to be dealt with at some point. The coalition overdid it in their "testing" by giving Walesa an answer to the question of how much he can fear such a step on the coalition's part. As it turned out, he does not have to fear that very much in the end. Marek Borowski, who had threatened the president with limiting his powers, was immediately disciplined by his own colleagues from the Sejm deputy club. Lech Walesa must be active so as not to be pushed into oblivion. "Not to let them forget about me" seems to be the president's main slogan of the moment. If he were to be obedient, the PSL-SLD coalition would probably be gaining in strength, whereas Walesa would become marginal. And that is the way it is probably going to be; such behavior by Lech Walesa will be a permanent element of the political scene until the time of the presidential elections. This is why it made even less sense for the SLD to have reacted by feeling offended by the facts.
