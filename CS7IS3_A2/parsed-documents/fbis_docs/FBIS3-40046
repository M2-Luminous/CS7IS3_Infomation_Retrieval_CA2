The government spokesman reiterated that the Greek Government received the letter with some reservations, since it bore the name Macedonia. It merely received the letter so that it might learn the content and study it. Venizelos said the European Union's [EU] Dutch Commissioner Hans van den Broek established Skopje's intransigence, so he might have realized, even belatedly, why Greece adopted these measures. Asked if Van den Broek asked the Greek Government to lift the measures, Venizelos said he had not, because Greece insists on its positions. Only when there is practical proof of Skopje's goodwill could our country lift the measures and reconsider its stance on Skopje's accession to the CSCE. Only then, the government spokesman stressed, will we resume the dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations and Cyrus Vance. The subject of the dialogue will be Greece-Skopje's economic cooperation and the name, on which Greece's position is well known. Venizelos said he hoped the Dutch commissioner's initiative would continue.
