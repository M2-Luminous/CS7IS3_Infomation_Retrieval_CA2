Kokhanets, A. Kraslyanskyy, and V. Tuhluk, with the participation of Supreme Council deputies Yevhen Marmazov (Communist Party), Volodymyr Mukhin (Socialist Party), Oles Lavrynovych (Rukh), Mykhaylo Ratushnyy (Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists), Pavlo Movchan and Stepan Volkovetskyy (the Statehood deputy group), and Yevhen Zherebetskyy, Hryhoriy Omelchenko, and Anatoliy Yermak (the Reform deputy group); statements by V. Mukhin and Ye. Marmazov are printed in Russian: "Roundtable Discussion at HOLOS UKRAYINY. We Are Held Together by the Main Point: The Fate of Ukraine, the Fate of Our People"] [Text] Elections in the spring of this year were complicated and tense. If nothing else, the fact that but a handful succeeded in "breaking through" to the Supreme Council on the first try indicates this. Nonetheless, the election was held despite everything. The people made their political choice by clearly saying that they attach hopes to the Ukrainian parliament. At the same time, during the election campaign the people demanded that certain unfavorable elements in the operation of the supreme legislative organ be abandoned, that its operations be greatly improved, and that the coefficient of its effectiveness be raised. So the editorial office invited for a "roundtable discussion" representatives of various political forces, deputy groups, and factions of the Supreme Council in order to share their thoughts about the following questions: 1. What is your vision of the process of improving the operation of the Supreme Council? To your mind, what aspects of its prior operation should be rejected and what aspects should be borrowed? 2. Deputy factions as a new element of the structure of the Supreme Council--will they become an instrument of accord in the parliament or, on the contrary, aggravate a political confrontation? What is your projection? 3. Do your parties and factions have a clear-cut vision of how Ukraine is to overcome the economic crisis? What priority draft laws will you introduce for consideration by the Supreme Council to this end? 4. The Supreme Council and its newspaper. The following took part in the conversation: Yevhen Marmazov (Communist Party), Volodymyr Mukhin (Socialist Party), Oles Lavrynovych (Rukh), Mykhaylo Ratushnyy (Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists), Pavlo Movchan and Stepan Volkovetskyy (the Statehood deputy group), and Yevhen Zherebetskyy, Hryhoriy Omelchenko, and Anatoliy Yermak (the Reform deputy group). The "roundtable discussion" was moderated by Serhiy Pravdenko, editor in chief of HOLOS UKRAYINY. "We Have Come To Work Rather Than Fight" [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Observers estimate that even the first week of operation of the Supreme Council was considerably more productive than with the old set of deputies. They have succeeded in taking care of the initial organizational problems and proceeded toward resolving the main issues. The deputies have actually rejected political controversy and the settling of accounts, and have devoted their entire time solely to what is the most important. Nonetheless, the process of improving the operation of the Supreme Council still calls for major efforts. What is your view of this? [P. Movchan] I would like to note the following essential aspect to begin with. It is yet another illusion that the current Supreme Council has come in, formed itself, and will quickly solve the problems that we are facing. We should not encourage among the public the illusion that the current Supreme Council will set things right all at once and will neatly resolve everything. We should get rid of these illusions, because they facilitate a new period for the accumulation of negative energy, which may end in an assault on the Supreme Council--the way it began in previous years. To me, it is unimportant whether this might come from the west, the south, or the east. It should be understood that the period of collapse that Ukraine is going through will not end all that soon. Ours was not a Ukrainian economy, it was a colonial economy; as a matter of fact, it has to be built anew. All hopes that the Supreme Council will come and announce that a union with Russia begins today, and everything will become marvelous right away is a political speculation. Thus, a great, very strenuous effort awaits us. The best way to ensure this, to have no speculation in this chamber, may be to split into factions, which we are already doing. Ensuring minority rights is yet another essential aspect. At present, there are various colorings in the chamber--blue-and-yellow, Red, or some other, but this is not important. It is important that without ensuring the constitutional rights of the minority in this Supreme Council, we will not get rid of strictly political precedents. Therefore, we need to make relevant amendments as soon as possible and lay a legal foundation for the functioning of groups that represent the minority in the parliament. [H. Omelchenko] I represent the Reform deputy group, which was established on the initiative of a group of deputies--officers, lawyers, and economists. I subscribe to a number of fundamental statements just made by People's Deputy Movchan. However, to my mind, global problems also exist at present along with this. First of all, it is carrying out economic reforms that would make it possible to improve the life of the people and offer an outlook--as the saying goes, the light at the end of the tunnel. The second is the adoption of the legislative base and the creation of an entire system of state organs that could genuinely fight corruption and organized crime. As I see it, in the process there should not even be a discussion of whether or not Ukraine is to be an independent state. The Ukrainian people have made their choice, and there may not be any political unions at the expense of independence. [Ye. Marmazov] [statement printed in Ukrainian] We should approve clear-cut by-laws and strictly adhere to them in order to improve the work of the Supreme Council. Unfortunately, our by-laws were violated all the time, even the provisional by-laws, which were passed last year. This is the first point. Second, we should make sure that our Supreme Council works, that a person comes along who would organize the operation of factions, groups, and circles. It should not so happen that a leader of the Supreme Council pursues his policy contrary to the will of deputies. All people's deputies should work, no matter how different they might be. The task at hand is to get the maximum from everyone in order promptly to pass laws aimed at overcoming the catastrophe that Ukraine is now facing. In the old Supreme Council, nobody was interested in how commissions operate and whether someone reports for work or not. We should now categorically reject such practices. It was indeed possible to work through the commissions, through the territorial groups of deputies. However, not even attempts at that were apparent. At present, we have an extremely difficult situation. There will be work for everyone, just come join in. The operation of the Supreme Council should be organized in such a way that everyone without exception would work on a permanent basis. One submitted a petition when he ran for deputy; let him now quit his previous job. Tell me honestly: Did we frequently see Zvyahilskyy and other leaders at the sessions? At present, too, the minister of agriculture, his two deputies, and the chief of material and technical supplies are deputies. Are they really going to sit here? If 50 people fail to show up for a session, the parliament will be paralyzed. Everybody should work on a professional basis. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Could it be that these difficulties would be successfully overcome if the leaders of factions work efficiently, if there is professional agreement and solidarity? [Ye. Zherebetskyy] I, for one, am very happy that comrade Communists agree that the parliament must be professional. Frankly, all of us were afraid that the leftist blocs would advocate something different. I would like to second the thought of Pavlo Movchan that the minority in the parliament should enjoy clearly specified rights. In recent years, the actual structuring of society has occurred; consequently, it is all the more necessary for the parliament to have its own new structures. At present, there is the center, the right, and the left, but they are not structured among themselves. To be sure, as I see it, a parity between them has already been reached, and this is very important in itself. Preparatory groups operated very productively before the session began. They proposed regulations on factions which we passed and which suited everybody. This indicates that all of us wish to work productively. By-Laws Are Not a Luxury, but Rather the Rules of the Game [O. Lavrynovych]I worked in the group that considered the draft by-laws. It is a pleasure now to hear a favorable evaluation of our effort from a deputy colleague. Of course, the effectiveness of operation of the Supreme Council depends on the rules of the game that it adopts. On several occasions, I worked with the representative of the Communist Party in this group and rejoiced at finding a common ground on procedural issues. This is the case, first of all, with the developed clear-cut rules of behavior of each people's deputy and all parliamentary organs at the time of decision-making. Therefore, the regulations that we have adopted are the first step for the Supreme Council of Ukraine to acquire a civilized appearance in general and to complete its structuring into factions and deputy groups in particular; this is precisely the process that can and must give us an opportunity to work much more effectively than before. These conditions must first of all make our society feel that the deputies are responsible for the laws that they pass, and that there are political forces that assume responsibility for the decisions that they will make within these walls. [V. Mukhin] I took part in the work of the preparatory group. At the first stage, we tried to lay a foundation for the normal operation of the Supreme Council. To this end, the idea of the need for clear-cut structuring was proposed because the fact that the previous Supreme Council was essentially a nonparty one was its substantial drawback. Although they frequently refer to the "group of 239," life has shown that individuals who actually adhered to particular party policies were few and far between in this group. Everybody else amounted to an indefinite political force and voted on each occasion, whichever way he saw fit. This made it impossible to clearly structure operations, due to which they discussed issues for hours and days, without being able to arrive at a common decision. If someone followed attentively the first day of operation of the current parliament, he noticed that within just a few minutes, we plowed through issues that the former Supreme Council would have discussed for an entire day. The idea of clear-cut structuring is bearing fruit. This issue simply ties in to the issue of factions. The Supreme Council will be at a political impasse forever in the absence of factions, in the absence of clear-cut political divisions. The situation is very simple: If they succeed in quickly coming to a compromise among the leadership of the factions, a compromise among all deputies will be found automatically. For this reason, when the question [rendered in Ukrainian in the original] "Are the factions of deputies a path toward accord?" I will confirm that this is indeed a path toward a precise and clear understanding of what we want, after all. I think that there will not be harsh confrontations between factions--we are going to come to agreements. [M. Ratushnyy] I would like to revisit the thought with which P. Movchan began. Indeed, the several days of operation of the Supreme Council make it possible to draw certain favorable conclusions. However, it bothers me that the agreement of the deputies to quit their previous position only until 1 July has gone unnoticed (perhaps deliberately unnoticed). This means that some deputies do not want to just be deputies but also to remain directors or heads of oblast councils. They still want actually to influence elections to local councils, and I think that such a trend is dangerous. What else may improve the operation of the Supreme Council? To my mind, it would be the existence of strong executive power in Ukraine, paradoxical as this might be, because until such exists, it will be impossible to carry out the adopted laws. Effectiveness of our actions is out of the question in the absence of this. Rules of the game were mentioned here. We cheat one another all the time. I worked in the working group for the development of by-laws. We made great efforts to provide a greater opportunity for one or several deputies to somehow show initiative and fully partake of the process of law creation. The leader should improve the work of the Supreme Council and mainly prevent it from rolling back. All differences that may be eliminated in the Supreme Council, be they on tactical or some other grounds, may be resolved if the goal of the parliament is the same: to prevent the liquidation of Ukrainian independence. If other trends prevail, this Supreme Council is not worth talking about.... [S. Volkovetskyy] To my mind, the role of the speaker is to designate the middle, or the idea on which the Supreme Council agrees. Finding this idea is not all that easy, because it may not become apparent for everyone right away. A certain mastery, even the talent for advocating this position, is necessary. Of course, the speaker, just like any people's deputy, is entitled to his own point of view on all issues, but he has a special role to play. He must find an optimal solution on which the entire parliament would agree. What we have adopted cannot yet be called good by-laws: This is a temporary move in order to ensure the further operation of the Supreme Council. In all parliaments of the world, their chairmen do not have the extensive rights that our previous chairman had formally or informally (I have studied these issues). Of course, attempts will be made to extend these rights further. This should not be the case. The chairman should be restricted through by-laws, and may allow himself only the things that the by-laws allow. Each deputy should know his rights, know what he can and cannot do, including deputies that constitute the minority, whether or not they belong to factions. If we discuss what practices of the old Supreme Council it would be worthwhile to reject, I think that it is first of all poor discipline and, once again, the excessive role of the chairman. How many cases do we remember in which deputies did not speak to the point, but were not stopped! In keeping with the by-laws, they should have been resolutely interrupted: This would have taught a good lesson to other deputies, they would have made decisions faster. The endeavor would have gained, and their authority among the people would have been greater. Who from among these deputies was punished? There had to be some kind of sanctions, but we did not see anything like that. Also, there were altogether impermissible things, such as voting in place of someone else. Generally, I believe that we, the new membership of the Supreme Council, should raise our operations to a new level, taking into account the experience of foreign partners. [A. Yermak] I think that a rigid confrontation between political parties, circles, and structures will hamper the work of the parliament. This will not benefit the state of Ukraine. This is why I would like representatives of various parties and movements to agree on a moratorium on political discussions from the very first days, at least for a certain period of time, until we improve economic conditions. Political debate in the parliament will bring about still greater polarization of society, and you know that it is quite perceptible to begin with. The people just will not endure all of this. Our regular, harmonious work will provide an opportunity to complete the election to a full-fledged parliament. If there is accord between the representatives of various parties and movements, the right, the left, and the center will be able to make a determination and agree to focus their efforts on economic issues, on fighting corruption and the mafia, but on the condition of grasping that all of us are working for the same independent Ukraine. This is the foundation of foundations, the cornerstone. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] I ask that those who wish to do so respond to the second question: "Deputy factions as a new element in the structure of the Supreme Council." They may not be an entirely new element; an attempt to create them was made in the previous parliament, too, when it was divided into the majority and the minority, but later all of this fell apart. Therefore, will factions become an instrument of accord in the parliament? Your projection? [P. Movchan] Whether there will be accord in the parliament will depend on how the statehood forces act. If all of these forces work for the same cause, the state, accord will always be reached. If we once again encounter anti-statehood forces, a conflict cannot be avoided. However, it is understood that anti-statehood forces will propose all manner of unions, and this will bring about the resuscitation of the old Union. There are very powerful forces in Russia that speak out for the restoration of the Union. It is no secret that such forces also exist here. You witnessed yourselves a demonstration with the requisite slogans on Khreshchatyk. These are the hidden explosives that could split the parliament and cause a split in our state itself. All of these economic programs (I have read them and am familiar with them) further the resuscitation of colonies, and this is the path of provocations and clashes, which would begin here and transcend the confines of the parliament. It is precisely for this reason that amendments should be made to the Constitution right now, including those concerning the powers of the Supreme Council chairman, on which Volkovetskyy has touched: The speaker is not the chairman. The speaker is a regimented individual; if these amendments pass, it would be desirable to already make proposals as to the functions of the Supreme Council chairman. Relevant amendments should be made to the Law on the Chairman, and the head of the parliament should be elected later. As far as we are concerned, we are doing everything the other way around. The programs of the center-right and the center are absolutely identical. The left is an exception. Perhaps they used this as a move in the elections, but now have other approaches and their own vision. The fate of the parliament will depend on these programs: accord or discord, controversy or agreement. One more point--amendments should be made to the by-laws in order to ensure the rights of both the minority and the majority: They should be codified. If this is not done, conflicts are also possible. Do you know what the previous Supreme Council was to blame for? For there being neither a majority nor minority law. So they could not agree. I support the idea of Anatoliy Vasilyovych Yermak about the introduction of a moratorium, but on the topic of independence of Ukraine rather than on political discussions. If we agree that we do not touch on or consider this problem, we will always find a common point of view on economic aspects. The Ideas May Be Different, But the Goal the Same [Ye. Marmazov] We believe that the creation of factions is a step forward in the operation of the Supreme Council. In principle, factions can play a major role in achieving "accord" [word rendered in Ukrainian in the original] in the operation of the Supreme Council. This "accord" will come when factions work in the way which is outlined in the by-laws. We are now taking measures for our faction to become constructive and disciplined. I like it very much that the by-laws provide for the "conciliatory group of deputies" [phrase rendered in Ukrainian in the original] to which a major role is assigned. If we keep to all of this, there will be "accord" [rendered in Ukrainian in the original] in our parliament. As far as "statehood" [word rendered in Ukrainian in the original] is concerned, the program of our Communist Party, incidentally, as well as that of the Socialist Party, clearly says that we support the policy of building a sovereign, independent Ukraine. We have a clear-cut platform, which we have released to the public, and everyone knows this. This is not a maneuver, as Pavlo Movchan said; it is our position. However, whether someone likes it or not, we should boldly proceed to establish an economic union. How can it be viewed? The European Union is now being created in Europe, which is proceeding toward just one monetary unit, the ECU [European Currency Unit]. If we take this path, in the long run there should also be a common unit, and so on. [G. Omelchenko] I hope that deputy factions and deputy groups offer a real chance to achieve a compromise on the most readily solvable problems. The parliamentary practice of the world is unimaginable without the activities of factions, but this same practice is also inconceivable without elections on a multiparty basis. Therefore, if we are to be completely logical, factions indeed would play the role they do in developed countries if we held elections on a multiparty basis. Alas.... One more point. The parliamentary majority may take advantage of its numerical preponderance and demand the adoption of solutions to which the minority will not agree. So if these demands fit within the confines of parliamentary culture and of the possible upholding of minority rights, work will be constructive. [M. Ratushnyy] I agree. We could refer to a favorable role of party factions only in the event that an election has been held on a multiparty basis. More than 180 deputies of the current Supreme Council are nonparty members. This is more than one-half. Therefore, it is feasible to refer to groups rather than factions. Three such groups have already emerged. The first group draws those who clearly advocate the restoration of the colonial status of Ukraine in some new forms. This group includes approximately one-third of the deputies. The second group, which clearly advocates statehood positions, has already emerged: They are also a conventional one-third. The third group likewise accounts for one-third. They are those who make a determination depending upon the situation. Consequently, the danger of changing the rules while the game is in progress exists. At present, someone wants to splinter these groups into some kind of factions and manipulate these small, 25-strong, party factions, to haggle, promise, and actually stage the entire behind-the-scenes performance. I am already seeing how a "hunt" is beginning for certain independent deputies. They try to drive these deputies into some kind of trap, whereas the deputies run toward the center, because there an opportunity exists to stand closer to power. They see that the leftists are getting the upper hand; therefore, they should flee from the center in that direction. This is precisely why the factions, due to their fuzziness, will not clearly reflect the reality that exists in our society. If there is no accord on any terms, this will amount to suicide for the parliament. The very instinct of survival, of self-preservation, should force us to come to an agreement: "Guys, let us work constructively; otherwise we will waste time, and the people will start asking questions as early as the fall...." [O. Lavrynovych] Let us hope for this. I also think that associations of deputy groups and factions the possible existence of which is envisioned precisely by the provisions of by-laws will play a great "peacemaking" role. The unification of these factions and deputy groups will occur precisely in keeping with the principles to which, incidentally, Mr. Ratushnyy referred, perhaps with corrections of some kind. I would like to see a majority that would amount to an association of deputy groups and factions to appear as soon as possible, so that we could clearly know who belongs to the majority, who forms the government, and who precisely is politically accountable for the things that are done in this chamber. I would like a common-sense group, a pro-reform group, a group for establishing legal order in our society, to be formed as soon as possible. This would make it possible to reconcile all opposing sides and to not make enemies of one another, but to cooperate and make the most urgent decisions. Why does nobody want to say that, in essence, there are two factions in this parliament: one in favor of statehood, independence, and sovereignty in full, and the other in favor of economic unions that ultimately mean the restoration of the empire. It is possible to talk about this in various ways, but it should be clearly understood what is what in reality. You do know that Zvyahilskyy is giving the Lisichansk Oil Combine to Russia toward the debt. Therefore, there is an attempt at present to liquidate our sovereignty by way of economics. Here is the "struggle for an independent Ukraine but within an economic union" for you. Let Us Start With the Main Link--the Economy [HOLOS UKRAYINY] So, do you see a way out of the economic crisis, and what draft laws to this end will you propose to the Supreme Council for consideration in the immediate future? [Ye. Marmazov] Proceeding from the platform of our party, we, the Communist deputies, firmly advocate the social choice of the sociopolitical system. We are not abandoning this, and we are convinced that this is the only way to go. We advocate the primacy of all people's state property in politics and economics. This is why I consider creating conditions for the regular operation of state enterprises and collective farms to be the main point. It is on them that our entire economy hinges. However, virtually no attention has been paid to these components lately: We have been left to our own devices. Ukraine will not be fed by either private farmers or joint ventures; all of this will not come to pass soon. It is also necessary to pass first of all a number of laws, in particular those on putting the finance and credit policy in order. Generally, we have an absolute mess in this area. The economy has now been paralyzed because the finance and credit system has been messed up. Hence our paralysis. Such a situation has now developed that in our country enterprises and sectors cannot settle among themselves. The absence of the money supply is one of the burning issues. Something else: I support the comrades in that a major, carefully developed law on fighting corruption, mafia structures, speculation, and bribery should now be developed. Omelchenko has raised this issue. By now, the supreme spheres here have been afflicted with corruption; how are we going to put things in order? Take a look: It is not houses but rather palaces that are being built in the vicinity of Kiev. This is how arrogant people have become while taking advantage of impunity. Even the president's advisers did not refrain from this--they have also been involved with the mafia. One has run away, another has come to take his place, and has started doing the same thing. So, has corruption been elevated to the status of policy here? [G. Omelchenko] Long ago. [Ye. Marmazov] The following issue, although not everyone likes it: We will have to put everything aside and proceed to do the thing that is advantageous to Ukraine--establish an economic union. In the absence of it, we will not be able to restore normalcy in the operation of the national economy of Ukraine. Sooner or later we will proceed to do it anyway, but without encroaching upon sovereignty and an independent policy. [G. Omelchenko] What needs to be done in order to overcome the economic crisis? First of all, the tax system needs to be changed urgently. Manufacturers must pay 30 percent in taxes at the most. It is possible to introduce a nominal tax of 5-7 percent for five years. Further on, strict order should be restored in the credit and finance system and currency regulation. Likewise, a law on fighting corruption urgently needs to be passed. As early as 26 January 1993, the Supreme Council issued a decree in the second point of which it committed itself to approve, within one month, the legal and legislative notions of such phenomena as corruption, the mafia, organized crime, the shadow economy. However, this decree has not been carried out to this day. The next law is about a ban on the involvement of people's deputies in commercial and banking activities personally, through intermediaries, or through individuals fronting for them, which is not being complied with, either. The law on fighting corruption and organized crime should specify the level of liability--from ethical and moral to criminal. Yet another law in this area is the law on the dismissal of officials by virtue of a lack of confidence, which would indicate clearly for the commission of which violations an official, beginning with the president and on down to a clerical worker of the lowest rank, would be dismissed and no longer have the right to work in state organs and government organs. It is also necessary to pass a law on the recall of people's deputies and on stripping them of their powers, which would clearly regulate in what cases this would be done. We have developed these priority draft laws. If such is the will of the Supreme Council, we may put the draft laws on the table in a month and a half. It is also worthwhile to write the following into the law on the recall of people's deputies and stripping them of their powers: "If a deputy has committed violations he shall be deprived of the credentials of deputy and shall never again have the right to run for the Supreme Council or another representative organ." People should know that by transgressing the law they rob themselves forever of access to the sphere of state power. This is what should be done and adopted first of all. As far as the economic union is concerned, it is possible that at some point it will be an integrated structure on the model of the European Union. However, both Russia and Ukraine must be built up as states first. If Ukraine grows strong, we will have more confidence. However, for now it is premature to talk about a union, a common economic space. [Ye. Zherebetskyy] This issue is a new, camouflaged tactical move by our Communists. [O. Lavrynovych] The logic is simple in this instance. Russia does not want the Union to be restored; it wants to restore the classical version of an empire. To this end, it needs a colony, its own Communist colony, because it was always easier to deal with a Communist colony. However, the world would look at Ukraine as something that does not merit serious attention because the owner exists--the patron that would set the direction for that state. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] That is, Russia. [M. Ratushnyy] Of course. To prevent this, we should always ensure economic independence first of all rather than an economic union, as those want who desire to bury the Ukrainian state. Economic independence may only obtain in a complex with the structural opportunity to influence the processes of change in the forms of property. That is, this cannot be politics in itself. At present, the most urgent task for us is to change the structure of power and to clearly determine its functions. With state property accounting for 93-95 percent, legislative acts on precisely state power and self-government will be crucial. What does the economy begin with? With property. Who is administering property at present? The state authorities. [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Officials. These are the best conditions for corruption. They steal what is owned by the state. [M. Ratushnyy] How else? Why do they want to keep kolkhozes? The people who work there steal a kopek's worth, the chairman steals 10 karbovantsy's worth, those who manage in the rayon steal thousands, and those who are at the top--millions. Those who make policy today do not think about the day after tomorrow. Few think even about tomorrow. Since we are talking about the initial steps, we should first of all make legislative decisions concerning changes in the structure of property, the generation of budgets at all levels, and taxation. High taxes especially contribute to smothering the economy. Nobody looks at analogies that have occurred in other states. One gets the impression that nobody has read economic textbooks and nobody knows that production begins to be depressed above 35 percent, and at above 5 [as published] percent, production already begins to collapse. What do we have? We, the Ukrainian nationalists, are precisely in favor of introducing firm order in the economy; ours is the position of a social market economy. I think that nobody is talking about the pursuit of a protectionist policy with regard to our national producers, with the exception of Pynzenyk. The policy of neocolonialism is not carried out only from the east, but is effectively implemented from the west. Everything is being done to destroy production in Ukraine and the producer. I believe that the strict monitoring of export and import operations is necessary. I agree with Omelchenko that it would be more moral to still make amendments to the law "On the Status of People's Deputies," in which to give up immunity. Deputy immunity is the armor behind which various fraud is frequently perpetrated. It is also necessary to make an amendment concerning arrangements for the real recall of deputies. A Union, but Only an Economic One [S. Volkovetskyy] When there is talk of an economic union, it is obvious that they misuse it, and misused it for 70 years by calling the state a union. We are not against an economic union with Russia, but a union such as with Germany, France, Japan, or the United States, on a mutually advantageous basis. I believe that we should think about how to replenish the budget, where to get money, and how to manage it correctly. If we indeed proceed to introduce reforms, offer incentives to our national producers, and create conditions whereby it is profitable to manufacture products, the budget will be ensured, too. It is also important to pass the law "On Local Authorities." Being the chairman of an oblast council and understanding how imperfect this system is, I think that it is certainly necessary for us to not frustrate the forthcoming elections to the local organs of power. In a word, we need to work, rather than waste time. [H. Omelchenko] It would appear that there is nothing frightening: an economic union or some other union. However, I will say what I know by virtue of the specifics of my work. It was fall 1992. A group of people's deputies of the former Soviet Union got together. A part of the group consisted of active-service generals and senior officers. The generals who spoke stated that in Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine there were many military men in leadership positions who were prepared to carry out an order to create the united armed forces of the Soviet Union and to restore it. The decision was also made there to do everything in order to discredit President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, Minister of Defense K. Morozov, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus Shushkevich, and President of Russia Yeltsin. Now let us look at what we have as of now: Morozov is gone, and so is Shushkevich. A couple of months ago, the Union of Officers of Russia got together with the people's deputies of the State Duma in the Moscow area; a plan for the restoration of the Soviet Union was developed there. Officers who serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine also attended. That is to say, the development of the military-political scenario from the fall of 1992 continues. Is it an accident that the former general Rutskoy states that we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of victory over German Fascism in a unified Soviet Union? We should grasp the fact that neither the United States nor other highly developed countries need Ukraine as an independent, strong state. This is why we may be offered, in whatever packaging, a slice of the ruble zone and something else of the kind in order to deprive Ukraine of independence. On 1 December 1991, we said for all time: Ukraine is a state. Therefore, let us do everything for it to indeed be great, prosperous, and rich. [V. Mukhin] As far as the issue of overcoming the crisis is concerned, I can say the following: Our Socialist Party has an anticrisis economic program, which Moroz proposed at one point. We submitted it to the Cabinet of Ministers and to the president. At that time, the president responded thus: "If you come to power, you will then implement your programs." I think that the economic program that we have developed and that both the Communist Party and the group of the Peasant Party perceive correctly will be approved by the Supreme Council because it is aimed at improving the life of the people. It will be best for Ukraine to overcome the crisis if there is an economic, industrial-defense, and political union with Russia. Why? Well, mine is a very large district, and all enterprises that are located there are defense enterprises. These are enterprises of the highest standard, which could manufacture marvelous products that Russia badly needs. We could substantially improve our standard of living owing solely to the Russian defense orders. However, the situation is such that Russia is saying: "Let us sign a relevant agreement." As they explained to me, to this end at a minimum 50 agreements concerning a defense union need to be signed. Now let us look at another aspect of the issue--do we have an actual defense union with Russia or not? Everyone turns a blind eye to the fact that actually this union exists. We have a common defense system, a common system of weapon supply to the troops, common intelligence and counterintelligence systems if we take the pertinent agreement into account; we have a common system of staff command, and so on. The defense union actually exists, but it has not been formalized legally and politically. Annually, we lose tremendous funds because of this. As far as the defense sector is concerned, many people understand that this is a huge complex that employs about 7 million people. It concentrates colossal profits for Ukraine--this is a lack of understanding, I would say national tunnel vision, which causes us to suffer enormous losses. We do not lose "independence" [word rendered in Ukrainian in the original]! As far as our bloc is concerned, we are preparing a draft law on issues that are the most important for the people. The first issue that is of great concern to all is: How will compensation be provided for the deposits of the population that the state actually took away shamelessly, primarily from old people? I am not an economist, but I am studying, and for this reason I believe that a law on taxes is also very important. I am a proponent of the need to support large state enterprises, being aware that they will generate enormous profits for the state if everything is structured intelligently. Now about the newspaper. Personally, I do not like the newspaper. Recently it has been one-sided, and the editor has taken a one-sided position, although he did state at the beginning that he would be objective and would cover the positions of various structures. We would like the people's deputies, especially the factions, to cooperate with their newspaper closely. It should reflect objectively all the events that happen. Some deputies say that they even look at HOLOS with caution, although it is the newspaper of the Supreme Council. It does not matter who dislikes which news, but these views should also be reflected in the newspaper. [P. Movchan] Apparently, a public editorial board should be put together, which would be formed on certain definite principles: either along factional lines or in another manner. However, let us not forget that the newspaper does not belong to either the majority or the minority--it is a newspaper of the Supreme Council, and the entire spectrum of political life should exist in its pages. The ultimate task of both the parliament and its organ is to facilitate the strengthening and building of the Ukrainian state. This is the mainstay. It appears to me that this newspaper needs to have a supplement. As I see it, there is a lack of theoretical pages within it, theoretical articles on a certain aspect of what is going on in the state. I am certainly curious about the dubbing situation. We have a state language. An altogether different newspaper should exist for the Russian-speaking population. Apart from everything else, a Russian newspaper is needed in order to provide information on life in Ukraine in the CIS area. Its nature might be that of a digest. [V. Mukhin] I think that the Supreme Council and the newspaper should cooperate and bring truthful information to the reader as much as possible.
