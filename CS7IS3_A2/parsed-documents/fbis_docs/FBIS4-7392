This right, like other legitimate rights, must be respected on the legal, moral, and emotional fronts. In Vietnam, there are many different religious beliefs and doctrines. In the nation's history of struggle and development, the religions have always remained close to the people; struggled against colonialism and imperialism to win national independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and freedom of religious belief; and strongly defended their beloved fatherland. The people in the religious zones, including those in the Catholic zones, compatriots, and missionaries have fulfilled their obligations as citizens, carried out their religious and worldly duties well, and contributed their strength and possessions, including their blood, to carrying on the resistance and building the country. Many children from religious families have taken up arms to fight, sacrificed their lives, scored glorious achievements in war, and been awarded many medals by the state. In today's renovation movement, many members of various religious groups are manifesting the "good life, good morals" tradition and exploiting their capabilities and intelligence to enrich both their families and society in order to achieve the goal of a "prosperous people, strong country, and civilized society." The various religious beliefs certainly won't interfere with the ability of religious people to become integrated and work together with other people in the common revolution. The party and state have a correct religious policy. The various-echelon cadres, sectors, and localities truly respect the people's right of freedom of belief and will exploit the capabilities, intelligence, and strength of religious followers in the present renovation movement. Unfortunately, in recent years, a number of places have done things incorrectly and even acted contrary to the party's and state's policy of freedom of belief. A number of cadres have exhibited feelings of distrust and acted in a narrowminded way and this has offended religious sensibilities and affected the religious freedom of believers. There are many reasons for those erroneous attitudes and acts, but one of the main reasons is the lack of understanding and immaturity concerning the issue of religion. Some people say that religion is a totally negative social phenomenon, and it should, therefore, be eliminated, the sooner the better. They regard religion as a type of drug that poisons the spirit of the masses. They do not see the rational factors in religion or the moral and humanistic values of mankind that must be protected and passed on. In recent years in our country, along with the process of renovating and democratizing social life, the rapid growth of economic elements, the expansion of the market mechanism, and the tendency to cooperate with other countries having different political systems, there has also been a process of restoring and expanding religious activities. Concerning this, there is nothing to discuss, because this has to do with the rights of each citizen, and these rights are protected by the laws of the state. However, superstition, witchcraft, fortune-telling, and so on have spread rapidly. Publications that propagate superstition have flooded the market and can be found everywhere. They can be found among people of all age groups, occupations, level of education, and social position and even among cadres and party members. They cause people to have illusions about fate and believe that they aren't masters of their own fate but must entrust themselves to fate and spirits. Actually, there have been many distressing situations because of superstition, and some people have been deprived of their right to life. Such things are unacceptable. Thus, eliminating such activities is aimed at protecting people's rights. Looking at things in a dialectical way, the present situation regarding religious life is both normal and abnormal. It is normal in the sense that this is the ordinary life of people and the legitimate rights of religious people. Our nation has recently passed through wars of national liberation. For a rather long period of time, because of the pressing and urgent target of winning national independence, people have been prepared to limit and even temporarily neglect their religious needs in order to concentrate on driving out the invaders and winning national independence. Today, now that the entire country is at peace and the tendency is to renovate and democratize all aspects of social life, spiritual needs, which include freedom of religion, are something ordinary and easy to understand. But this is also abnormal, because in religious life today, a number of people are using religion and freedom of religion to carry on political activities and spread superstitions in order to profit and carry out other evil actions. They are making use of loopholes or the mistakes of a number of cadres in a number of localities to slander the state, saying that the state is violating human rights. They are slandering the authorities in a number of localities, saying that they are oppressing Buddhists, and speaking out on behalf of a number of extremist elements in Buddhism. A number of people posing as Buddhists are creating social disturbances, obstructing communications, overturning and burning vehicles, and opposing those who are carrying out public services at Phu Xuan bridge in Hue City. It is very clear who is protecting and who is violating human rights. They even claim that they have made a list of more than 10 people who have set themselves on fire in order to protest the human rights violations. They have urged people to commit suicide. Not only have they violated the criminal laws, but they have also violated Buddhist tenets concerning killing. Furthermore, they have violated international human rights agreements. Article 18 of the International Agreement on Civil and Political Rights clearly states that "freedom of religious expression or religious belief can be restricted only by legal stipulations, and these restrictions must be necessary for maintaining safety, social order, public health or morals, or other basic freedoms of people." No country can, in the name of the rights of this person or group, abridge the rights of other people and groups. Guaranteeing human and civic rights must be tied to prosecuting those who violate those rights. Thus, protecting the rights of people and promptly prosecuting those who violate those rights are not mutually exclusive. In actuality, they supplement and support each other. This is a basic and obvious point that ordinary people can easily understand. What is the real nature of the so-called "human rights violations and violations of freedom of religion in Vietnam" that enemies inside and outside the country are talking about? In their plot to carry on "peaceful evolution" to change the political system in the remaining socialist countries, they are giving particular attention to the banner of religion in order to deceive and arouse the masses. They say that in Vietnam, there is no party or political organization with the capabilities, discipline, and spirit equal to that of religious groups. Only believers have the spirit and courage to sacrifice themselves for their beliefs, because their faith helps them to ignore hardships and dangers. They say that "the end of the communist system in Vietnam will be decided primarily by religion." On the other hand, they are doing their utmost to distort and slander things using traditional arguments: "Communism is synonymous with atheism, and religion posits a god and so how can the two co-exist?" They say that "communism has declared war on religion." They have said such things in an effort to create a split between the party and authorities and people with religious beliefs and between believers and non-believers. Thus, in reality, statements such as "Vietnam is violating human rights" and "religious oppression" are part of the political plot of the reactionary forces. They certainly do not want Vietnam to become a stable country so that it can strive to achieve the goal of becoming a "prosperous people, strong country, and civilized society" with a socialist orientation. They are intentionally closing their eyes and refusing to acknowledge renovation of understanding or the implementation of the party's and state's policies on religion. The state has always had a unified policy of respecting and guaranteeing people's freedom to believe or not to believe and respecting spiritual values and traditional cultural life. The religious life of the people has existed since ancient times and will certainly continue to exist far into the future. Coexistence between believers and non-believers and between people of different faiths in the community is an objective fact. There has been a tradition of solidarity in building and safeguarding the country, and today, this is a source of strength in renovating, building, and defending the fatherland. Every follower of every religion is different in terms of his material life, but all share a religious life and the life of the times. Although people may have different beliefs, they are all equal in terms of rights and responsibilities before the law. There is no "orthodox religion," and the state does not regard any religion as a "heresy." It always respects the freedom of belief of all religions. This shows a respect for the human rights of each citizen. In building socialism, we have always emphasized refraining from influencing the inner feelings of people or rejecting the right of people to freely choose their own religious beliefs. Thus, in the renovation process, as the party has affirmed, "religious beliefs are a spiritual necessity for some people. We must implement and unify policies on respecting and protecting freedom of belief, oppose actions that violate the freedom of belief, and at the same time oppose actions that make use of religious beliefs to harm the interests of the fatherland and people." This has been codified in state law in order to protect the rights of the people. Religious activities are social activities just like other social activities. Because it is responsible for controlling society, the state must examine and control the social aspects of religions. This is because besides its relationship to the church and the community that shares the same religious beliefs, a religion also has a relationship with and affects society. The state must not interfere with religious beliefs, but it is responsible for controlling the social aspects of religious activities using the laws. The main purpose of this is to protect the rights of citizens and the religious freedom of belief. Religion is a delicate, complex, and profound social phenomenon in the spiritual, ideological, and emotional lives of many people in many generations. Religion is related not only to "ethical matters" but also to "matters of life." It is related not only to "the other life" but also to present life. There must be respect for freedom of belief, but at the same time, those who use this right for non-religious purposes must be opposed. We must respect people's freedom to believe, but at the same time, we must also respect people's freedom not to believe. Respecting people's freedom of belief means respecting people's faith, religious ceremonies, and other religious activities that are in accord with national cultural traditions and improving the morals and character of people. We cannot accept counter-cultural or inhuman actions that are contrary to the legitimate needs of the masses and that lead to confusion, a lose of direction, passivity, and even violations of the law. Respecting freedom of belief, which is one of the fundamental elements of the human and civic rights of people, does not mean allowing freedom to "burst out" in confusion and allowing the spread of every type of "heresy" along with today's open market mechanism. At the same time, human rights should not be relied on to revive and encourage backward customs that the people once voluntarily did away with. As for believers, they are both elements of the religious community and citizens of a country. They have obligations and responsibilities both to their church and to their fatherland. They enjoy both human rights and the rights of citizens just like every other citizen. Thus, on one hand, they have the right to demand legitimate freedoms. On the other, they must struggle against those who violate and make use of those rights and contribute to building and defending the country so that it prospers.
