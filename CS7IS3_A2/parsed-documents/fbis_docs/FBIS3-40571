It knew that the most popular leader and organization in Pakistan was Benazir Bhutto and her Pakistan People's Party [PPP]. In any case, be it the U.S. government or any other Western government, Benazir Bhutto would be their first preference, because Benazir's philosophy and beliefs fit perfectly into the framework of their international policies and the new world order. For example, Benazir is the political heiress to a family and a father who had impressed the Western countries by their education, insight, diplomacy, and cosmopolitan viewpoint. Her father had made the whole third world his supporter by raising the slogan of a new international order on the other side. Then, with the discussions about the nuclear bomb, he had made a soft spot for himself in the whole Arab world. Now there is a fight. The sister, brother, and the mother had been benefitting from the soft spot in the heart of the Arab world for many years. They are still benefitting one way or the other. It is true that the Arab nations could not save Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto from hanging, but that was because of General Ziaul Haq had no other alternative. Both of them were close to the hangman's noose at that time. Had Ziaul Haq saved Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto from hanging and sent him abroad, he would have been hanged himself sooner or later. Freeing Bhutto for Zia meant inviting his own death. Anyhow, General Zia made a deal that was less harmful to him. He knew well that Bhutto's hanging would make him a martyr, and he also knew that this martyrdom would make the PPP and the Bhutto family triumphant. General Ziaul Haq was safe behind the international atmosphere, the flare-up in Afghanistan, and the swirl of the revolution there. The world powers were forced to cajole him. Interestingly enough, when the Afghan revolution after the first phase began to appear pro-Soviet Union and anti-United States, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto began to give the impression from jail that communism was spreading and Southeast Asia was being taken over by communism, and that it was only Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto who could save this communist invasion. We tend to forget history, may it be old or recent. In 1978, when Afghanistan and the Soviet Union signed their 20-year friendship agreement, the central executive of the PPP expressed grave concern over it and passed a resolution at Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's insistence. The purpose of this resolution was to convince the United States that the situation created by the changes and the revolution in Afghanistan might hurt U.S. interests, and that if there was anyone who had the fortitude and courage to stop this process it was Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Therefore, his release was in the U.S. interest. Bhutto's brain was working fully even when he was in jail fighting to stay alive. He was analyzing the foreign politics and changes there very carefully and wanted the United States to use pressure for his release. The efforts that Bhutto made all by himself in his jail cell during that period can be important subject of research and analysis. However, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was just unlucky as detailed in the diaries kept by the British High Commissioner Sir Marlese James. These diaries were published recently under the title Pakistan Chronicle. The fact is that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had lost trust at the diplomatic level. The United States understood well that if it helped Bhutto's release it would be creating an enemy of America who was very popular. That is the same fact that has convinced not only Benazir Bhutto but most of our politicians that the first condition to rule Pakistan is to get approval from the military and the United States of America. The United States also needed a popular leader to help meet its own goals in this region. This need, according to it, could be best filled by Benazir Bhutto. Thus, the drama of elections was staged to achieve this goal. The U.S. administration started to hint about holding elections a year and a half ago. As soon as armed confrontation started in Kashmir, the United States got worried about the situation in this region. For the last two or three years, the way Pakistani government's under Nawaz Sharif's leadership was trying to make Kashmir an international issue had forced the United States to be serious about this issue or at least give the impression of its being serious to the Pakistani people. At the same time, the Nawaz Sharif government joined the nuclear issue with the regional and international politics. Nawaz Sharif's greatest achievement was to propose the five-nation conference to resolve the nuclear issue in Pakistan and India. It left India alone and friendless at international level because four countries were supporting this conference and only India was against it. This was the international situation in which the elections were held. The U.S. government and nonaligned and aligned people assumed that Benazir Bhutto would emerge as the power. However, as the adage goes, "I was bathing and the fly was washed away." It was the most prominent misconception in Pakistani politics that the PPP has the largest vote bank and Benazir Bhutto is the most popular leader. However, when the elections were held, Nawaz Sharif also joined the race. He presented his charismatic personality ahead of his inexperience and neglectful deeds on the political chess board. This development has changed the whole political framework. This situation has puzzled the U.S. administration and has surrounded Benazir with whirlpool of problems. Benazir Bhutto and the PPP had thought that they would be able to force the U.S. point of view on the people using their popularity. It has begun to appear difficult now. Nawaz Sharif and his opposition group is fully aware of Benazir and PPP's helplessness. That is why Nawaz Sharif is talking about Kashmir and the nuclear program in every breath he takes. Meanwhile the United States had shown some flexibility and had tried to convince the people that the U.S. attitude was changing after Benazir's arrival, and Benazir had also tried to use this to her advantage. However, when the U.S. government observed the reaction of the opposition party and the people, it changed its approach, and began to repeat its old stand of depriving Pakistan of aid as long as it was suspected of making nuclear weapons. Although Benazir is emphasizing that she will not accept any pressure over the nuclear program, her refusal to open debate on this issue in the National Assembly only intensifies many suspicions. Saying that the nuclear program cannot be made a topic of discussion in every street and corner is childish. There have been demonstrations in Japan against the nuclear program for months. Why cannot we discuss this issue in our assembly?
