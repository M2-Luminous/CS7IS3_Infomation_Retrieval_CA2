In the international relations, India has continued to strive for better relations with other countries, particularly its neighbors; and barring Pakistan, it has met with a tremendous success in building up realistic, mutually respectful, and economically cooperative relationship with all the countries, more so with its immediate neighbors. Even with Pakistan, India has been all along keen to normalize its ties and have a mutually beneficial economic and cultural exchange. However, Pakistan's attitude has been grossly unreasonable, aggressively chauvinistic, and designed to malign this country. The Interservices Intelligence, ISI, of Pakistan has been aiding and abetting terrorist activities as well as current of separatism in Kashmir, Punjab, and the eastern parts of this country. The latest reports suggest that Pakistan is preparing more than 10,000 Afghan mojahedin to push them into the Kashmir Valley to escalate militancy-related violence in the valley in its bid to continue disturbance in the state. Unnerved by the success of the security forces in their anti-militancy operations in recent months in Kashmir, Pakistan has evidently drawn this massive plan to push in more trained militants to further boost the otherwise sagging morale of the militants in the valley. Surprisingly, the United States of America is not only turning a blind eye to all this, President Clinton has lately made biased and misinformed remarks on Kashmir, Punjab, and perceived abuse of human rights in this country. His remarks on Punjab on finding a solution to protect Sikhs' rights are not only uncharitable but also negate the very structure of secularism on which Indian polity and society are based. It goes contrary to the fabric of Indian Constitution where it is enshrined that in this country, everybody's right is protected irrespective of his caste, color and, creed. Predictably, India has taken strong exception to U.S. President's observation on Punjab and rejected the statement which speaks of a solution that protects Sikhs' rights. It should be abundantly clear to USA and, indeed, rest of the civilized world, that India's commitment to human rights and democracy is axiomatic [as heard] to India's existence. At the same time, this country does not accept external prescriptions in this regard. India hopes that the United States, as another democracy, will value India's policy of secularism and democracy and make more positive moves in the context of India's amiable and meaningful relations. [sentence as heard] Happily, India has appreciated the economic and political stability in today's world as a driving force in international relations. India has responded remarkably to the increasing globalization of economic process through a wide-ranging program of economic reforms. In a short period of about two and half years, major reforms have been undertaken in industrial policy, foreign trade and exchange rate policies, taxation policies, and the financial sector. The basic medium-term objective of these policies is to lay the foundation for sustained growth of output and employment in the context of increasing global competitiveness of the Indian economy. The country is expected to receive around $2 billion in nondebt-creating flows of foreign investment this year. Equity issues abroad by Indian companies have been highly successful. This year, agriculture is expected to receive 2 to 3 percent growth. Interestingly, a U.S.-based economic forecasting company, the (?Wharton) Economic Forecasting Association, WEFA, has projected India's real GDP [gross domestic product] to grow by 5.6 percent in 1994. With an increase in net exports and agricultural incomes, the growth is predicted to be 6.1 percent in 1995. These projections are based on the findings of a study that merchandise exports will rise by 18.6 percent in 1993.
