In an interview with the hard-line opposition "ZAVTRA" newspaper published on Friday, the former speaker, who was released from jail in February under the State Duma-proclaimed political amnesty, said he is not going to participate in opposition rallies and demonstrations and his political activity would manifest itself only in articles and interviews. "I am not a rally regular, I am not used to participating in demonstrations and shouting out slogans", he stressed. Speaking about his arch rival Boris Yeltsin, Khasbulatov said that only "a fascist regime" could have pounded the parliamentary building with tanks, but stressed at the same time that he is sure that a big of top [as received] politicians wants to reform Russia on a democratic basis. "Only a fascist regime could have surrounded the parliament with barbed wire, sent people armed to the teeth against lawmakers and their defenders, shot in [as received] women and children", he said and added "I nevertheless believed and still believe that a big group of policy-makers in this country strives to reform it on democratic grounds". Khasbulatov praised his ally and former vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy as "a politician with a great future, as a man who the people may trust". During the October revolt Rutskoy behaved as a "dynamic and courageous" man, but his entourage failed him, according to Khasbulatov. "If Rutskoy with his understanding of issues in position of acting president was surrounded by competent specialists, the events could have gone in another way", he said. Speaking about himself, Khasbulatov said that no "destructive" changes had occurred with him after he suffered a defeat in the October revolt and was imprisoned. "I left the prison just as I entered it", he said.
