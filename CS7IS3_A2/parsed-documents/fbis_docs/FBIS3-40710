It is but natural that amidst such a mosaic of complex diplomacy, some of the more resourceful and felicitous individuals manage to catch the eye. In the recent past, amongst those who have managed to distinguish themselves in this diplomacy--at least in terms of sheer and strenuous volume of effort--have included Mr Philip Habib, Mr James Baker and Mr Warren Christopher. But an Arab diplomat who is lately attracting notable attention is Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's multi-lingual foreign minister. Like an Arab Henry Kissinger, Mr Amr Moussa has been indulging in recent months in an unflagingly zealous and formidable schedule. This month alone took him to Washington, Jerusalem, Damascus and Amman, besides Mogadishu, Abu Dhabi and Bahrian. Egypt has often produced first-rate international civil servants as well as accomplished diplomats. Mr Amr Moussa is the third member sought after by the international media in an Egyptian troika that includes the U.N. secretary general, Dr Boutros-Boutros Ghali, an Egyptian capt, and Mr Ismat Abd Al-Maguid, the secretary general of the Arab League. Although there may be differences in national debates in the interpretation of the precise ingredients of Egyptian national interest as well as the best way of securing them, there is broad concurrence that the independence, security and prosperity of the national community of Egyptians should take precedence over all else. This relative unanimity about national identity and interests makes Egypt exceptional among the Arab states of West Asia. It has also given Egypt's presidents and foreign ministers considerable latitude in formulating foreign policy. This helps explain why the erstwhile President, Mr Anwar al-Sadat was able to sign the dramatic peace accord with Israel in 1979 as well as why the present president, Mr Hosni Mubarak, has been able to abide by the terms of that treaty. These features could also explain the sure-footed diplomatic moves Egypt made to oppose the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and to rally Arab members to participate in an international coalition against Iraq to which Egypt despatched 30,000 troops. It is the same savoir faire and confidence that Egypt often displays in international mediation today. Be it in Somalia where Mr Amr Moussa has proposed to the Organisation of African Unity [OAU]--of which Egypt is the chairman--that Africa ought to develop a diplomatic mechanism for crisis management in the continent or seeking international troops in Burundi, which Egypt regards as a fellow Nile country. This week's focus in Cairo was however on Libya where an adamant Muammar Gadaffi is squaring up to the Clinton administration over the release of the two Lockerbie bombing suspects. Egyptian diplomats have been working up a back-breaking schedule to try to prevent the sweeping U.N. sanctions against Tripoli. Having undertaken another leg of his diplomatic shuttle, on his return, Mr Amr Moussa's schedule included setting-up secret talks in the Egyptian Sinai enclave of Taba between Palestinian and Israeli negotiators. Fifty-seven-year-old Mr Amr Moussa is a product of the faculty of law of Cairo University and has held a variety of diplomatic assignments including the post of director of the international organisations department and Egypt's permanent representative to the United Nations. He had a highly successful and visible stint in New Delhi from 1983 as Egypt's ambassador. Smoking his customary cigar, the foreign minister spoke to THE TIMES OF INDIA at his new and sumptuously furnished foreign ministry office in downtown Cairo. Moments after the interview concluded the minister remarked that he had to make a "dash for the airport" to receive King Hussein of Jordan. Mr Nagui El-Ghatrifi, the articulate spokesman of the foreign ministry, was present during the interview. Selected excerpts: After the peace accord was signed between the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Israel, there was a momentary lull. Now there seems to be a fresh impetus to the peace negotiations with Egypt playing a central role. Are you optimistic that we might see a new breakthrough? Yes, indeed, I am optimistic. Things are going in the right direction. I don't think they (Israel) will retract on the agenda that has been agreed upon between the PLO and themselves. Generally negotiations are promising on both the bilateral and the multilateral tracks. This of course does not mean there will be no difficulties, obstacles or no risks here or there. But overall in the region, it seems to be a one-way traffic towards peace. I hope that developments will prove me right. The Palestinian-Israeli track has already crossed the point-of-no-return and the negotiations on Gaza and Jericho are also progressing in the right direction. And let me say that the Israeli-Syrian track is also not a lost one. Is it then reasonably accurate to state that if the Syrian-Israeli talks on the Golan Heights cause extreme dilemma, then the Jordanian and Lebanese tracks are less complex? Yes, I would agree. The Jordanian track has already produced all the drafts necessary for establishing the framework for an agreement. The Lebanon negotiations are even more clear as it is a matter of Israeli withdrawal. Even the former Likud government had declared that Israel had no territorial ambitions in Lebanon. I am positive that if we can really work out a good, working, acceptable way of negotiations then the results can be achieved. Watching the bloody events in Gaza, the initial unenthusiastic response from Hamas and the opposition from hardline elements to the peace accord signed by Mr Arafat, has this scenario for peace been too upbeat? This opposition is exaggerated. The Gaza hardliners have a point of view and it is their right to accept the peace accords or to oppose them. However, they have promised not to use force or enter into an armed conflict with their brethren or to create havoc with the security situation. This, I find, is quite satisfactory. Unless of course the arrangements that have been agreed upon do not work out. That then is another matter. One finds West Asia commentators looking ahead to the next decade painting all sorts of hopeful, rosy scenarios, thriving Israeli-Arab economic partnership, portraying even Gaza as a flourishing commercial entrepot. Your comment? All these factors that you are referring to are possible... It can happen. But much will depend on the developments during the next two years. So let us wait and see. I prefer to withhold my expression of optimism on this issue. Let's turn to bilateral relations. The high point was during the times of Nehru and Nasser. People still recall both leaders when referring to Indo-Egyptian ties. Since then, there has been a downtrend in this partnership... There has been a king of downtrend. But not a malafide downtrend. It resulted from force of circumstances... from different priorities. This area has seen difficult times. It has been prone to conflicts and wars and Egypt has been involved in all this and India, which had its own priorities in South Asia, was not in the frontline in West Asia. The Cold War and its aftermath has also had its repercussions on the totality of the situation in the third world, in non-aligned meet forums. The 1967 war was another turning point which in turn affected its ties with India and the 1973 war set the relations on a different level. Then of course there was Camp David. As of now, the prospects for better relations are very good. We believe that India plays a major role in her region in the same way we do in this area. India's leading position in the third world is recognised by Egypt. It is even urged by Egypt. There is no competition between us, only complementarity. The strong bonds which you referred to during the days of Nehru and Nasser were but an expression, or a manifestation of those deep-rooted relations, although I don't put the good-relations era as having begun at the times of Nehru and Nasser. I would say they began much earlier. I am one of those who has advocated the necessity of having excellent relations between India and Egypt. Not that we wouldn't differ on this or that point but the basic premise of our relations should be more cooperation and interaction. Some people in Delhi still recall your successful tenure as ambassador. They say forget about worn-out rhetoric about non-alignment and concentrate instead on enhancing trade and commercial relations between our two countries... Yes, yes indeed. We should focus on economic ties. In fact we hope to discuss precisely these issues when we meet in Delhi for the G-15 summit. And we should set the concrete agenda for more meetings, more dialogue. As for your reference to my ambassadorship in Delhi, I am very much upset that you say that there are only "some" in Delhi who recall my tenure. I would have thought "many" would remember me. (Laughs) Regarding regional tensions in South Asia and specifically on the Indo-Pak dispute over Kashmir, where do you stand? We would very much like to bring this conflict to a close. You will appreciate that I cannot publicly--it would be very unwise of me if I did--discuss details on this issue. The Kashmir dispute is a very old conflict. However, Pakistan has succeeded in putting the problem back on the international agenda. So many more are talking and discussing Kashmir. Once this has been achieved, sitting together and attempting to solve it is the best way. Because Pakistan will live with India and India will live with Pakistan forever. Remember we are sorting out some of our ancient and great problems in the Middle East... Are you suggesting that India and Pakistan should follow the example set by old enemies, the PLO and Israel, and talk frankly across the table? You are talking. But talks should be fruitful. They should have a point and talks should not be setup for the sake of talking... In India as well as in Egypt there is serious concern about religious extremism and the violence it evokes. Are you coming to grips with curbing fundamentalism? Well, as far as India and Egypt, there is some commonality of events as far as religious extremism is concerned; it is also a global phenomena. However, each country has its own peculiarities as far [as] this is concerned and has to devise individual ways of tackling them... But in your attempts to devise ways of tackling them, you have invited some fiery criticism from human rights groups concerning Egypt's human rights' record. No, no. This is a sweeping formula. We cannot simply throw our countries open to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with different motives and agendas. And you can never tell what exactly they are doing or even who exactly is doing this. And mind you, not all those people who work in NGOs are deep thinkers; perhaps many are activists. We need to respect the basic principles of sovereignty of our rights, the basic tenets of human rights and the principles of fundamental freedoms. But we simply cannot submit ourselves to double standards. What double standards? Well, in Bosnia-Herzegovina when "ethnic cleansing" was being practised, we did not see such fervour from the very same non-governmental organisations. So let us adapt one yardstick for all. I have argued these points publicly at the Vienna commission on human rights and said, that we either have one yardstick for all or let's simply forget about this. Looking at the role of the United Nations and its somewhat activist role, I was recently on a reporting mission in Baghdad. There the impact of U.N. sanctions has squarely hit the man-on-the-street whilst hardly affecting the regime in power. Now we hear that sanctions against Libya are to be enhanced. Is this an effective method of diplomacy? First of all you should not put yourself in a position where sanctions have to be applied against you. Second, one needs to assess the international situation with caution. This of course does not mean we do not sympathise with the plight of our brothers in Iraq and Libya. We definitely do. Our work was to strike a balance between our obligations and international legitimacy which in a broader context is what the U.N. does too. The situation as regards Libya is beginning to look dismal. Can diplomacy persuade their leader to give up the Lockerbie suspects? This is what we are striving to achieve. For now, one can only be hopeful.
