Following are the forecasts of the various sectors of this industry: Farm machinery sector The general trend in the farm machinery market this year is that sales will be moderate or sluggish for most products, while only a few products are expected to sell briskly. The market for large and medium-sized tractors will remain approximately the same as last year. Medium-horsepower wheeled tractors will have only a moderate or even a sluggish sale due to the restriction on their use as a transport vehicle plus the fact that part of the market will be taken over by farm trucks. However, a good market is forecast for four-wheel-drive tractors. With regard to four-wheeled tractors and walking tractors, brisk sales are expected for some models and in some areas, but the general trend in the market will be downward. As for internal-combustion engines, some models will enjoy a good sale; others will not. Sales of single-cylinder diesel engines will fall. Multi-cylinder engines for motor vehicles, construction machinery, electric generator sets, and farm trucks will continue to sell well or moderately, but their sales volumes will not grow as fast as last year. The market will be stable for powered irrigation and drainage machinery and for pumps used on farms. Demands for tractor-drawn farm tools and combines will slide down from last year's level. The only exception will be small-sized combines drawn by small four-wheeled tractors, which will enjoy a brisk market because of their practicality, moderate price, and agility. Grain-processing and oil-pressing machines will continue to sell well, and for some models, supply will fall short of demand. Demands for rice and flour mills and oil presses will increase by a fairly big margin. Also, there will be a surging requirement for farm trucks. In particular, four-wheeled farm trucks with a capacity between 0.75 and 1 ton will be in great demand. Sales of parts for trucks and internal-combustion engines, because of their great demand, will maintain a steadily growing trend. The farm machinery sector will grow by 5 to 6 percent this year. Construction machinery sector Since the beginning of last year, the construction machinery sector had ranked first in production and sales until the third quarter when a drastic change in the market caused a big drop in the growth rates of its output and sales. Brand-name products once in short supply became amply available on the market. Some non-brand-name products began to be overstocked. In general, prices have dropped for all kinds of construction machinery. Nonetheless, as our country's investment policy will focus more on transportation, energy, and other basic industrial projects, the construction machinery sector, which serve as a support for these projects, will still maintain a certain level of growth this year. In particular, large-sized and brand-name earthmovers will have a brisk market. The growth rate of the construction machinery sector this year is estimated at more than 15 percent. Meter and instrument sector This year a steady growth is forecast for the production and sales of meters, instruments, and control equipment required by the energy, communications, and transportation sectors. Among them, production and sales of electronic meters and instruments will show a strong tendency to grow. For those items that can be used as part of investment in construction projects, such as various testers and theodolites, the market will change from an active to a moderate state, and accordingly the growth of their output will slow down. On the other hand, items in the consumer-goods and office-equipment categories, such as air conditioners, copiers, and cameras, are expected to have a good market, and their production will increase to a relatively big extent. It is estimated that this sector will grow by more than 15 percent in 1994. Electric equipment and appliances sector This sector showed a steady growth in the first half of last year. Beginning the third quarter, a slight downslide has appeared in the growth rates of its production and sales. Nonetheless, with the support given by the state to basic industries and the implementation of various preferential policies in favor of these industries, including favorable financial arrangements, the external environment of basic industrial enterprises will be gradually improved, and their demand for power generating equipment is expected to hike. Growing demands are also foreseeable for power plants' supplementary equipment and for power transmission and distribution equipment, such as transformers, switchgear, wires, and cables. This will lead to an increase in the output of these products. A more than 12 percent growth rate is forecast for the electric equipment and appliances sector this year. [10 Jan p 7] [Text] In addition to the farm machinery, construction machinery, meters and instruments, and electric equipment and appliances, the following forecasts for 1994 were revealed at the information-announcement meeting by the Ministry of Machinery Industry: Machine tool sector In the third quarter of last year, the once-hectic trend in the machine tool market obviously cooled down, under the influence of the nation's macro-regulation and control policy. As a result, stockpiles of unsold products increased sharply, and their prices kept declining, with the only exception of special-purpose heavy equipment, which still enjoyed a prosperous market. Production and sales of general machine tools and numerically-controlled lathes produced domestically were in a relatively gloomy situation. Since September, the machine tool market has improved, however. For example, at Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant's order-solicitation meeting in early September, the sales contracts signed for general machine tools were sufficient to take up the plant's production for the whole year of 1994. It is expected that the machine tool market for the first half of this year will be somewhat better than the second half of last year, and the market trend will be optimistic. The machine tool sector will have a growth rate of more than 10 percent this year. Petrochemical and universal-purpose machinery sector Brand-name refrigerating equipment, air distributors, and printing machines will continue to enjoy a good sale this year. Increased demand for static dust removers will boost the manufacturers' production task. Requirements for machines, pumps, and valves used in power plants will be relatively great, and accordingly major manufacturers of these items will increase their output and sales. Market for universal-purpose machines, including refrigerators, machines, pumps, and valves, will remain the same as last year. Production and sales of oil-refining equipment and chemical plant machinery will continue to rise steadily, but no improvement is foreseeable in the market for oil-drilling equipment. This sector will have a more than 10 percent growth in 1994. Heavy and mining machinery sector The nation's investment policy, which puts more emphasis on basic industries, has boosted the production tasks of manufacturers of metallurgical and mining machinery, large cast and forged parts, cranes and other material-handling equipment. Production and sales of these items will continue to grow this year. According to a survey by the Heavy Machinery Industry Association, the orders so far received by major and backbone heavy machinery enterprises for 1994 have met 60-100 percent of their annual target. Most other enterprises have received 40-70 percent of the orders they planned to obtain this year; only a few enterprises have met 10-20 percent of their order target. In terms of products, orders for small and medium-sized cranes account for a very small share, while most orders are for items required by the basic raw and semifinished materials industry, the transportation and communications sector, and the electric power industry. The growth rate of the heavy and mining machinery sector is estimated at 10-15 percent this year. Auto sector Since late-June last year, the auto market has changed from an active to a moderate state because of the nation's policy to rein in the scale of capital construction and bank credit and its strict efforts to "control government office spending." In the third quarter of last year, production and sales of motor vehicles showed a remarkable decline, while their stockpiles went up. However, it is believes that the 1.1-million-vehicle target set for last year was fulfilled, and that the stock was maintained at a level roughly equivalent to an average month's output. In making this year's forecast, the following factors should be taken into consideration: 1) Railway transportation will remain in a strained condition. The strategy to use highways as well as railways to share the transportation burden will keep the demand for heavy- and medium-duty trucks at a certain level. 2) Development of township enterprises and tertiary industry will bring about a constant demand for small and mini-vehicles. 3) There were 8.1-8.2 million vehicles at the end of last year. About 1 million of them should be junked. According to this year's plan, an additional 250,000 old vehicles should be replaced by new ones. 4) Demand for domestically made sedans will go up in view of the development of the tourist industry and taxi business plus the needs arising from Sino-foreign joint ventures and special economic zones and the nation's determination to strike hard at car smuggling in coastal areas and to lift the "control on institutional purchase of vehicles." The production target for this year is 1.3 million vehicles, of which 350,000 are sedans. A 10 percent growth is forecasted for the auto sector this year. Basic accessories and parts sector This sector serves as a basic support for the machinery industry; however, for years, it has experienced the following problems: It lacks a sound foundation and is unable to benefit from specialized and large-scale production. Its products are not satisfactory in terms of grade, quality, and reliability. For the above reasons, this sector has become a "bottleneck" in developing the machinery industry. For the period from January through October last year, its gross output value was 14.78 percent higher than the corresponding period of 1992, but this growth rate was still below the entire machinery industry's growth rate by nearly 12 percentage points. This year, with the implementation of certain policies, there will be a decline in the imports of hydraulic and pneumatic tools, sealing devices, ball bearings, low-voltage electric equipment, instrument components, and some special materials. As a result, the basic accessories and parts sector is expected to grow by about 10 percent this year.
