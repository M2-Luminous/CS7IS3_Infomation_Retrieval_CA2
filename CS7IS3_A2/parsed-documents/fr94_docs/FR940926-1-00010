FR940926-1-00010 FR940926-1-00006 The apparent existence of this problem concerns the agency. For example, the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. App. at section 2302, authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to provide grants to states for enforcement programs applicable to commercial motor vehicle safety. Pursuant to that authority, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) established the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) (49 CFR 350). MCSAP provides grants to states to support a national motor carrier safety enforcement program. The program is designed to reduce the number and severity of accidents and hazardous materials incidents of commercial motor vehicles by substantially increasing the level and effectiveness of enforcement activity and the likelihood that safety defects, driver deficiencies, and unsafe carrier practices will be detected and corrected. The increasing Federal and state involvement in that program has led to a corresponding increase in the number of functions common to both Federal and state officers. This increase has, in turn, led to an increasing need for efficient communications and exchange of accurate data. SAFETYNET, therefore, has become even more important to this effort by combining all functions into a single user-friendly data-sharing system for the use of both Federal and state personnel involved in commercial motor carrier operations. A typical SAFETYNET profile consists, among other things, of the type of operation, GVWR, cargo, any accident data, inspection data including any violations and out-of-service actions, work performance reports, and data entry verification. Thus, if law enforcement officers are collecting incomplete or incorrect data because of lack of GVWR information, as Mr. Robinson asserts, the effectiveness of the SAFETYNET system could be compromised. The agency agrees that, assuming the accuracy of the petitioner's figures relating to stolen vehicles, a permanent metal label could assist in the identification and recovery of at least some of the great number of unrecovered stolen commercial vehicles in the United States. FHWA has informed NHTSA that it supports the suggestions in Mr. Robinson's petition, believing that a permanent metal label will help enforce Federal as well as state motor carrier safety regulations. While the petitioner's primary focus seems to be enforcement of CDL requirements, FHWA believes that the importance of this rulemaking is broader in scope than that. The gross vehicle weight rating (or gross combination weight rating (GCWR) for a combination vehicle) is one of three independent criteria used to determine the applicability of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR) for vehicles and drivers engaged in interstate commerce. The FMCSRs cover driver qualifications, hours of service, accident record keeping, vehicle inspection, repair and maintenance, controlled substances and alcohol testing, in addition to the CDL. The GVWR/GCWR weight threshold for the general applicability of the FMCSRs is 10,001 pounds. The recently published final rules on controlled substances and alcohol testing apply to every person who operates a commercial vehicle in interstate or intrastate commerce, and is subject to the CDL requirements of 49 CFR 383. Part 383 includes a 26,001 pound threshold as one if its applicability criteria. The FHWA believes, therefore, that implementing the suggestions in this petition will help motor carriers in identifying vehicles and drivers that are subject to the FMCSRs and Federal and state officials responsible for enforcing the regulations. The permanent metal labels should provide more comprehensive enforcement of such regulations by making possible better identification of the vehicles concerned. FHWA also expressed support for the petitioner's suggestion that the labels on trailers be given reasonable protection since trailer labels are particularly susceptible to damage during commercial vehicle operations. Mr. Robinson suggested that the thickness of the metal label be specified. NHTSA does not believe that is necessary, at least not at this time. NHTSA tentatively concludes that the primary benefit is to be obtained from specifying the use of a metal label. The agency has no information indicating that specifying a particular minimum thickness would increase that benefit significantly. NHTSA understands the petitioner's reasoning that a label of a specified heavy gauge would be more durable and more likely to survive the rigors of commercial operation. On the other hand, the agency also believes that manufacturers must have the flexibility to accommodate the thickness of the labels to the door designs of the various vehicles they produce. NHTSA is confident that manufacturers will affix labels whose sturdiness is consistent with the designs of their vehicles. If, in the future, information obtained from actual commercial vehicle experience indicates that it might be appropriate to specify a minimum thickness, appropriate rulemaking action can be taken at that time. The agency questions whether the petitioner's four suggested permissible locations for the labels on vehicles other than trailers are too limited as compared to the five permissible locations currently allowed. In addition, the petitioner suggested the floor area as a permissible location for the label. The agency is concerned that locating the label on the vehicle floor or even on the instrument panel could place the inspecting officer in an awkward position, perhaps even in jeopardy, by having to lean into the cab of the truck and turn his or her head to read the label. Further, the possibly limited ambient light on the vehicle floor could make it difficult for an inspector to read a label there. On the other hand, inspecting officers routinely stand on the running boards of trucks to check inside for the driver's log, labels, as well as for drugs and/or alcohol. Thus, a label on the floor or the instrument panel could normally be seen by the inspector from the running board.
