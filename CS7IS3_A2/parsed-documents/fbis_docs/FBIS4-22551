Jokingly he said that working for the government he feels himself much wiser. His hair became grayer and he lost some weight. No matter, he will set things right and promises to create ten years of progress. He was born in Khmelnitsk Oblast, to a peasant family. After school and a technikum he worked for three years at the Twice Hero of Socialist Labor Grigoryy Tkachuk Farm, and learned from that experience. He graduated from the Kharkov Veterinary Institute and served in the army. Then in Zaporozhye he started accumulating years of independent economic activity: chief veterinarian, kolkhoz deputy chairman, and chairman. Later, party schooling as first secretary of the rayon committee for many years. He was invited by Pelsha to Moscow, for work at the KPK [Committee of Party Control]. He refused. People pointed their fingers at him saying that only an abnormal person would turn down an apartment in Moscow. Subsequently he was elected chairman of the Zaporozhye Oblast Executive Committee. Without connections, without bribes, using only his own head and through his determination he managed in one of the largest industrial oblasts of Ukraine. Later he worked for a year as representative of the president. In October 1992 he became vice premier. He speaks of that time as follows: "I was really a lucky man! I had just arrived when there were two years of drought and I was told to buy five million tonnes of grain wherever I want, including in America. I went there and was told: the Union has been destroyed--you must resolve the problems on your own. My wife told me: don't complain, our time will come and, indeed, our situation slowly started to improve." [Question] Vladimir Vasilyevich, is it true that prices for agricultural products in Ukraine, by contrast with those for others, have gone up over the past months by just one percent? How did you manage that under conditions of such a tremendous rise in the cost of living? [Answer] We stopped trading on the stock market, regulated the money rate. By the way, the same course is now being followed by the government of Belarus as well. Our economy was, of course, seriously undermined by fuel prices, which led to a rise in prices for all agricultural products. Through the regulation of procurement prices, however, we managed to accomplish something. We calculated procurement prices for grain of the new harvest in the following manner: we divided 1,290,000 coupons by the new exchange rate of 12.6 and obtained 90 dollars. That is the world price for grain. We use the same rate in settling accounts for fuel and fertilizers. That served to calm down the peasants somewhat, convinced them that there would be no sharp rise in prices for industrial products and that it is possible to work without worrying. [Question] What are the results of the last agricultural year? What was it possible to attain with state price regulation? [Answer] Liberalization of prices, just as their regulation, equally leads to a decline in production. Under our conditions, however, the latter proved to be beneficial. We managed to convince the peasant that his labor is not wasted and he reaped a grain harvest eight million tonnes greater than in 1992. At the same time, we are now recording only cleaned high-grade grain. The distribution of land helped. At present 5.6 million hectares of arable land are privately owned. Cereal crops in the public sector shrunk by a million hectares. That is all right. We did not purchase grain on the side like other foodstuffs . Moreover the private sector yielded 40 percent of all agricultural products in gross terms, diminishing the load on kolkhozes and sovkhozes. For the first time we gathered the entire sugar beet harvest in just one month whereas previously that operation took three months. This was done despite the fact that there was a shortage of fuel. Despite the overall decrease in cattle stock over the past two years, we managed to increase it by 200,000 head. Take a look for yourself: all 30 trains departing Kiev are filled with foodstuffs. In the newspapers, however, one reads that if the Ukrainian does not starve to death in the morning, he will certainly be doing so in the evening. [Question] Do you feel any product intervention by western suppliers, particularly with regard to sugar as well as liquor and spirits? [Answer] I just read in IZVESTIYA that the Russian government raised customs duties on imported products by 15 - 20 percent and that this is prompting a price explosion. We are also doing this and will continue doing so in order to protect our producer, even though his products today are more expensive than the imported ones. At the same time, however, we are trying to support the monopoly on sale and purchase of agricultural products within the state. A package of legislative documents has been worked out allowing the peasant to sell his harvest in any way profitable to him. Our trade has been semi-privatized, and the director of a meat combine today does not stay in his office but searches for the best partner for himself in the countryside. The Barnaul meeting of representatives of CIS countries is coming up on the protection of agricultural products from foreign commodity intervention, and I want to discuss that issue once more with V. Zaveryukha, vice premier of Russia. We must know how to protect ourselves. No one is waiting for us on the western market, all the markets there have already been divided up. [Question] You have probably heard about the war taking place between Moscow and Moscow Oblast in the area of food procurement. The mayor of Moscow uses foreign currency credit to purchase cheaper, but perhaps lower quality products abroad, while farms in the oblast are compelled to ship their products either to Siberia or the Far East or bury them in the ground. [Answer] God protect us from the conduct of such a policy. Our butter, meat, and sausage are of better quality than the foreign products and why should we undermine the roots of our public and private sectors. We now created a state procurement order which is 10 percent of the previous one. The remainder will be planned by them on their own. But this is due to our poverty. Agriculture is subsidized, mentored, and regulated throughout the world. In the former GDR only 30 percent of the collective farms disintegrated. The remaining 70 percent are alive and thriving. Their production is much cheaper than that of farmers in the former FRG. Wheat is sold to the American farmer for 120 dollars and bought for 245. The government at present has no money. What is the solution? We are liberalizing prices. But that is better than cheating the peasants by telling them that we will pay and then giving them nothing in return. We are not aspiring toward a revolution in agriculture but are proceeding along the evolutionary path, with caution, so as not to destroy its basis. In the future, if we provide our worker with agricultural equipment of the highest quality, along with means to protect the harvest and are able to subsidize our kolkhoz members and farmers, like the Americans, then life will be much better. [Question] What tasks are you planning on resolving in the new agricultural year? [Answer] In the last two years we have had to alter the mechanism of mutual economic relations between the state and the farms every month. It would be so desirable to create a situation where visiting the peasants one would be told: finally the government did not cheat us. This year we invested 20 trillion karbovantsy in the state procurement order for grain, sugar beets, potatoes, and sunflower seeds alone. The remainder will be placed under complete control of the producers of the goods themselves. Nevertheless the problem remains. I see the struggle among various forces taking place both in Russia and in our own case. The most "fearsome" individual is the one who insists on the fulfillment of his obligations. Last year I did everything possible in order to purchase all the grain from the villages, that, of course, increased prices, but we do have grain, it did not rot in pits. This year the bankers have got us by the throat. We, however, have established the following course--we purchase currency in the bidding committee, dollars at the state price, purchase oil, fuel, and fertilizers and supply them to the farms, converting everything to world prices. In the fall they will return products to us at the same world price. This is a non-monetary form of commodity turnover. But that is a solution only for today. Probably for the first time we are confronted by the full-blown problem of not where to buy, but how to buy from the capitalists and to whom we should sell our products. The most important matter today is to finance the 30 percent of the products that the agricultural sector will provide for us. This is an extremely difficult problem but it cannot be avoided.
