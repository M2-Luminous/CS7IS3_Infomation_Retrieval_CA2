This is not what we wish to see, and the responsibility does not lie with the Chinese side." It has been learned that the total volume of Sino-British trade reached $3.59 billion last year, an increase of 86 percent over the previous year. Judging from the general situation, Wu Yi continued, Sino-British economic and trade relations are not bad, and there is great potential for development. Wu Yi made these remarks at a news conference held by the State Council's Information Office today.
