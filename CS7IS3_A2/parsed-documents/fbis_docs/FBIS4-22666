We can say that the public transportation of the republic was left without work and support. In 1993 the total volume of freight carriage by public-use motor vehicles declined to the level of 1956. Passenger transportation by bus was at the level of 1960; fares were down to the level of 1959. If we compare the results of 1993 with the maximum attained, 12.5 times less freight was carried than in 1986 (120 million tonnes), and 6.7 times fewer passengers were carried than in 1987 (475 million passengers). The truck fleet is down to 6,300 units, which comes to 50 percent of the 1985 level, that of buses--to 2,540 units, or 60 percent of the 1988 level, and that of taxicabs--to 795 units, or 60 percent of the 1988 level. Out of this fleet of rolling stock, 3,800 trucks, 1,100 buses, and 250 taxicabs were idle and without work while technically in proper repair. We are losing skilled cadres of automotive personnel. In 1993 their number fell by 3,563. The average wage in motor vehicle transportation in December of last year came to 56 lei. More than 9,000 employees, or 45 percent of the total number of employees in the sector, have been furloughed or are working short work days. There are enterprises in the sector that are, in essence, bankrupt and have not been officially declared so only because of the absence of a procedure for effecting this process. It is necessary to recall that public-use motor vehicle transportation amounts to only a segment of motor vehicle transportation in the republic. Unfortunately, its proportion of transportation work fell from 25-40 percent to 8-11 percent (in terms of volume of freight transportation). Despite the absence of support from the government, the productivity of public-use rolling stock remains higher than that of such transportation belonging to other departments, and producer cost comes to 82 percent of the average republic indicator. The ministry has proposed and will strive to solve a number of problems in order to improve the situation in the transportation sector. First, the adoption of the Law on Transportation in the Republic of Moldova and the development of new transportation legislation based on it for the main areas of operations. The process of privatization and denationalization should be accelerated. The experience of other countries and the current state of affairs indicate that motor vehicle transportation should be private for the most part. In keeping with the State Privatization Program, 77 out of the 128 enterprises reporting to the ministry should be privatized in 1994 and 1995. This will make it possible to adapt more quickly to meeting the needs of the clients and, therefore, to compete with departmental motor vehicle transportation more effectively (incidentally, the experience of private operators who already exist in the republic confirms this). We are going to work, together with other organs of state government, on a package of legislative documents that will give priority in operations to automotive personnel who perform such operations to higher professional standards (through a system of excise taxes, local taxes, cost of licenses, credit, state investment, and so on). Through our subordinate enterprises and the state we will facilitate the development of an infrastructure for motor vehicle transportation, forwarding and dispatcher services, insurance, freight storage, accounting and settlement operations, etc. by establishing companies in these areas, merging motor vehicle enterprises into associations to this end, and so on. The task of systematizing the flow of information concerning automotive transportation operations by all economic agents, regardless of their departmental affiliation, and automating and computerizing this process with a view to more balanced decisionmaking is extensive. Apparently at this stage (1994-1995) it should be proposed that incentives be provided for the acquisition of the kind of rolling stock the republic needs badly (refrigerated trucks, trailer trucks, delivery vehicles). Within the framework of denationalization, we consider it necessary to accelerate and enhance proposals to convert some of the assets of motor vehicle transportation into municipal property for services and the accomplishment of regional tasks. The problem of urban transit is particularly acute. In this instance, cooperation by all institutions of the state and the population is needed. Of course, targeted investment is a priority. The Moldovan Railroad is a very important and complex link in the national economy. The volume of freight carriage dropped, amounting to 6.2 million tonnes, or 3.5 times less than in 1989. The level of passenger transportation declined insignificantly and came to 16.9 million passengers because of lower fares (compared to buses and aviation). The rates in this mode of transportation are more stable, although they did change in 1993 by a factor of five for freight carriage and by a factor of three for passenger carriage. The republic railroad also has its share of problems. There are 220 kilometers of the main track which are overdue for major repairs, and an absence of 250,000 wooden ties and other structural track materials. The service life of more than 1,500 freight cars is coming to an end; of 273 diesel locomotives, 45 were built between 1966 and 1972; of 43 diesel trains, the service life of 13 has ended; 15 percent of passenger cars were produced more than 20 years ago. Government Decree No. 727 dated 19 November 1993 envisioned a number of very essential areas of development for the railroad: electrification of main lines, construction and upgrading of the Revaca-Cainari rail line, and upgrading and expansion of the Chisinau and Ungheni railway terminals. A transportation pattern is being developed, and the issues of designing and building a high-speed rail line to European standards between Istanbul, Sofia, Chisinau, and Kiev, expanding the network of rail lines in the north and south of the republic, and developing proposals to switch to the production of equipment and spare parts for the needs of railway transportation at some industrial enterprises are being worked on. The volume of carriage by inland waterway transportation fell considerably; in 1993 only 450,000 tonnes of freight and 465,000 passengers were carried. At present, it is also difficult to coordinate the operation of this mode of transportation because of the political situation on the left bank of the Dniester. At present, the attention is mainly focused on expanding the operation of the maritime company, including the use of national crews, the preparation of materials of a legislative nature for maritime and inland waterway transportation, and the expansion of work associated with designing a port on the Danube. The year 1993 was difficult and full of strain for the road construction and maintenance sector of the republic. Only 215.4 kilometers of roadway were repaired, or 11 percent of the level of 1990 when the maximum volume was attained. Only eight kilometers of roads were built. Late passage of the Law on the Road Tax in 1993 added to the general problems in this instance; it virtually left the sector without funds in the reporting year. The funds that were received in the fourth quarter were only 80 percent utilized. With a view to improving the situation in the road construction and maintenance sector, preparations are being conducted for surveying the entire public-use road network and classifying roads by their use at present and in the future. Priority sections for repairs, upgrading, and construction, their length, and outlays are being determined; proposals are being developed to improve financing. All areas of development of the sectors of the transportation complex are closely interconnected and overlap in many instances. This is why it is necessary to arrange them in a coordinated manner. The aforementioned areas were specified on a sectoral basis, but there also are areas of general concern. The main ones among them are the development and signing of international agreements and treaties, the systematization of proposals for the possible attraction of foreign investment, development of a program for cadre training and retraining, participation in the development of programs for taking advantage of the transit situation of the republic, participation in ecological programs, and so on. Work in these areas requires considerable labor and the use of many specialists, which necessitates that they be paid. Of course, nobody in the ministry stays away from everyday work. Nonetheless, a state system of the transportation complex of the republic should also be built--not a governmental but precisely a state system, that is, one rational from the point of view of consumers, of all inhabitants of Moldova.
