Experts in this field have said that the project was developed in setting sights on the management of and the policy on basic research; that, in carrying out the project, researchers conducted pioneering and systematic study and a theoretical summation of priority science fields; and that the overall standard of the project is among the most advanced in China. How to decide the priority of and to appraise scientific research projects is one of the central issues in formulating policy on scientific and technological development. As the science sphere continues to expand, we must first conduct a scientific appraisal of those key basic research projects that are relatively mature and that have an overall impact on and serve as a driving force for economic, scientific, and technological development before we concentrate our efforts on making breakthroughs in key issues. For this reason, over the past three years and more, the group undertaking the project -- led by Professor Chen Yuxiang, a state- level middle-aged scientist -- conducted a large amount of studies and analyses on the scientific selection of basic research projects, finally enabling it to establish a set of theories and a system for appraising basic research projects. At the same time, the group studying specific subjects, in light of the country's policy on aiding science and technological projects and of the country's resources distribution, conducted substantiated research on the structure of specific subjects of study, the metrological analysis of scientific output, the theory on the budgeting and distribution of funds, and the formulation of scientific development strategies and achieved fruitful results. When accepting the project, experts said the project not only was theoretically innovative and has filled the gap in this field in China but that it also has provided a new method that can be used as a reference in formulating policy on scientific and technological development, as well as provided a large amount of information. In conjunction with the country's science and technology policy and management, the project has a very important application value for selecting key technologies. The popularization and development of the project will provide a new means for further improving the coordination between the country's science and technology resources and the state's development objectives.
