The reason, according to officials of the Securities Bureau, is that "there is the risk that they will have an adverse impact on stock prices" if large numbers of banks revise their articles of incorporation and if banks which embrace a strong sense of following the pack embark on a torrent of preferred stock issuances. However, within the ministry, are those who recommend prudence in handling the situation, saying, "It would be excessive to intervene in matters concerning articles of incorporation," and there is the view that it is debatable whether the intent of the MOF will assume the form of effective "guidance." Preferred stock does not carry voting rights but has priority over common stock in the payment of dividends. Preferred stock often poses a burden in terms of dividends and was rarely issued in Japan. However, ever since net worth regulations were imposed on banks in 1993, banks faced the urgent need to increase net worth and Sakura Bank issued 100 million yen in preferred stock in March of this year. Other banks have followed Sakura Bank in considering the issuance of preferred stock. Normally, they would prefer issuing common stock at market prices to increase net worth, but financial institutions are using the majority of their profits to write off bad loans. Enhancement of capitalization through issuance of common stock is restricted to companies that enjoy growing profits and banks are now situated so that they are currently unable to issue common stock. Although costs of raising capital are somewhat higher with preferred stock, they have no choice but to issue such stock. Issuance of preferred stock requires that the articles of incorporation be revised at the shareholders' meeting. The purpose is to revise the articles of incorporation to specify that the board of directors can exercise the authority to issue preferred stock. The MOF is attempting to impose a "hold" on the such revisions to articles of incorporation. The MOF thinks it can forestall a stampede in the issuance of preferred stock if the number of banks revising their articles of incorporation can be decreased. The Securities Bureau which exercises jurisdiction over the stock markets is taking the lead in encouraging a limitation of such revisions, but the Banking Bureau, which is directly responsible for banks, voices the need for caution in the area of "guidance." The reason for such caution is that in terms of banking administration, changes to charters of incorporation are submitted after the fact and no authority exists for the provision of guidance. Further, there was a time when the Banking Bureau had encouraged banks to issue preferred stock to increase capitalization and "it would be difficult to tell them not to revise their articles of incorporation to provide for preferred stock at this late stage." Despite such cautionary comments, officials of the Securities Bureau insist on limiting changes in the articles of incorporation and it appears that they have no intention of withholding "guidance." Some quarters doubt the efficacy of "guidance" that is not backed up by the cooperation of the Banking Bureau, but it appears the Securities Bureau is considering the imposition of adjustments in issuances through "guidance" directed at underwriting securities firms at the point of issuance. In the industrial world, there is the view that the issuance of large volumes of bank stocks at market prices during the bubble economy contributed to the lengthy depression of the stock markets. It appears that recent "guidance" has surfaced based on comments of that nature. However, a leading life insurance company official critically states, in reference to attempts to forestall changes to articles of incorporation even before issuance of the preferred stock, "Any such attempts reminds people of the peculiarities of Japanese markets and should have a negative effect on the markets." It is difficult to predict the direction to be assumed for the issuance of banks' preferred stock amidst a general movement for deregulation.
