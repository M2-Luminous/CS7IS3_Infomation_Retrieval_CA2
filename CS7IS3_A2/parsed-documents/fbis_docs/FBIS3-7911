We salute the first free multiparty elections held [on 27 February] in the Republic of Moldova, which, according to observers, were organized under optimal circumstances, despite certain minor incidents. We hope that the new framework will allow for the assertion, without any obstructions, of the democratic principles, and that also includes telling the truth about the history of the [Moldova] territory and native population. During the news conference Solcanu also referred to the talks held by PDSR with PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party] and PD-FSN [Democratic Party-National Salvation Front]. During the talks held with PUNR the two parties found that in the current political context the protocol signed [on 1 February] remains valid, although it cannot be implemented literally, but merely in its spirit. Talking about the consultations with PD-FSN, Solcanu assessed that a step forward has been made, as they reviewed the goals pursued by the two political parties in the current dialogue. That is important because PDSR is involved in talks with other parties as well, including parties belonging to the Democratic Convention of Romania and those of the current parliamentary coalition. Solcanu stressed that they discussed aspects of a possible moratorium between PDSR and PD-FSN, which could contribute to the continuation of the dialogue between the two parties, ease the current strain in the political life, and offer elements needed for a possible future cooperation in parliament. All political parties have to act with responsibility and make efforts to find the convergent points to surmount the current situation, concluded Solcanu.
