Quintal] [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] explanation of its failure to submit evidence to the Goldstone Commission of inquiry into the violence during the Zulu march in Johannesburg on March 28 was "wholly unacceptable", Mr Justice Richard Goldstone said on Tuesday. KwaZulu government and IFP legal representative Mr Maurice Basslian told the commission the IFP had been unable to make submissions because of April's public holidays, the lack of manpower and records and the problem of finding witnesses. Mr Justice Goldstone dismissed the explanation as unacceptable, especially as the IFP had requested the probe as a matter of urgency on March 29. He said other parties had made their submission in spite of the public holidays. While he could understand the difficulty of consulting witnesses, the IFP leaders at least could have given instruction, he said. Following the explanation, the IFP made a submission which Mr Basslian stressed had been prepared in haste.
