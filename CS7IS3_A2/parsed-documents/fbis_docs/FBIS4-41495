As Interfax correspondents report, the plan was announced by Ingushetia's President Ruslan Aushev at a meeting in the administrative center of Nazran Friday [24 June] night. He revealed that the first to return to the Dachnoye, Dongaron, Kurat, and Chermen communities at the initial stage 1-5 July would be the families whose homes are safe. Expected back within five days from July 5 to 10 will be the refugees living in temporary dwellings. After that, the rest will return. Aushev also reported that subsequently more villages would be set aside on agreement with the Ossetian authorities for those Ingush families that had resided there before the conflict. According to the federal migration service, there are 49,000 Ingush refugees from North Ossetia on the territory of Ingushetia now. However, Aushev stressed that the plan could be translated into action only if the Ossetian side signed a protocol to this effect. North Ossetia's President Akhsarbeck Galazov and his Ingushetia counterpart Aushev are scheduled to meet on Saturday with Dagestan officials and the interim governor Vladimir Lozovoy to act as mediators. Representing the Federation Council will be Ramazan Abdulatipov, its vice-chairman.
