All comments received will be available for examination at the above address from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. Those desiring notification of receipt of comments must include a self-addressed, stamped postcard. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Deborah M. Freund, Office of Motor Carrier Standards, (202) 366&hyph;2981, or Mr. Charles Medalen, Office of the Chief Counsel, (202) 366&hyph;1354, Federal Highway Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) are required to stop at highway ports of entry (POE), weigh stations, and other checkpoints to be weighed and to have their regulatory credentials (e.g., registration, operating permits) checked by State officials. A CMV may be stopped many times in the course of a single trip. Each stop can add a minimum of 15 to 20 minutes to the length of a trip because of the time needed to decelerate, stop, be weighed, have paperwork reviewed, undergo a safety inspection, reenter the highway, and accelerate to mainline speed.
