Chen Xitong, secretary of the Beijing municipal committee of the Communist Party of China, Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan and other government officials made donations at the newly-established Beijing Donation Center for the Hope Project. "The Hope Project will be full of hope when all the people are mobilized," Zhang Jianmin, director of the municipal people's congress said. When a center worker asked Mayor Li Qiyan whether he would like to aid a boy or girl, he answered: "It makes no difference as long as it can help an out-of-school child." In poverty-stricken areas of China, only 300 yuan are needed to help a child through a year of schooling. Since the Hope Project, a national effort to help send children back to school in poor areas, was launched about a decade ago, governments at various levels, social bodies and common people have donated to it. More than 2,000 people took part in the campaign today and donated more than 100,000 yuan.
