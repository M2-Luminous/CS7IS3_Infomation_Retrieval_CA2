FR941207-0-00037 FR941207-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;39; Amendment 39&hyph;9066; AD 94&hyph;23&hyph;04] Airworthiness Directives; Garrett Turbine Engine Company ATF3 Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Garrett Turbine Engine Company ATF3 series turbofan engines, that requires a one-time inspection for cracks of the curvic and bore area of the high pressure turbine (HPT) rotor assembly disk, and replacement, if necessary, with a serviceable disk. This amendment is prompted by several reports of cracks discovered during routine inspections of HPT rotor assembly disks. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent an uncontained failure of the HPT rotor assembly disk. DATES: Effective on February 6, 1995. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of February 6, 1995. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from AlliedSignal Propulsion Engines, Aviation Services Division, Data Distribution, Dept. 64&hyph;3/2102&hyph;1M, P.O. Box 29003, Phoenix, AZ 85038&hyph;9003. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph Costa, Aerospace Engineer, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, CA 90806&hyph;2425; telephone (310) 988&hyph;5246; fax (310) 988&hyph;5210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Garrett Turbine Engine Company Model ATF3&hyph;6 and &hyph;6A turbofan engines was published in the Federal Register on February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6603). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection for cracks of the curvic and bore area of high pressure turbine (HPT) rotor assembly disks listed by serial number in Table 1 of Allied-Signal Aerospace Company, Garrett Engine Division, Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. ATF3&hyph;A72&hyph;6184, Revision 1, dated January 11, 1993. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were received on the proposal or the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. There are approximately 75 Garrett Turbine Engine Company Model ATF3&hyph;6 and -6A turbofan engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 2 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 220 work hours per engine to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $24,200. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption addresses .

Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended]
