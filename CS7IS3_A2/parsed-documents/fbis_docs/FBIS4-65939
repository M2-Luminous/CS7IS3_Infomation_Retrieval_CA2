Helmut Kohl is the great winner of 23 May. He convinced the FDP [Free Democratic Party of Germany] not to tip the scales in the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] candidate's favor. That the liberals were in agony over that decision makes his success all the more impressive. The chancellor, who predicted a kind of final twilight of the gods just a few months ago, is on his way to power again with his coalition. When it was said that he is no longer strong enough to keep the eastern German members within the CDU [Christian Democratic Union], to convince the FDP that they should trust in him as a life insurance, it was only rumor. Once again, Helmut Kohl has relied entirely on his instinct for power. And once again he has had a lot of luck. Kohl is fortunate to have Klaus Kinkel. One of the reasons why Kohl got his way after the bad start he had with Steffen Heitmann, was that he judged the FDP correctly. The liberal party was torn. One-third of them wanted to see Johannes Rau as president; he seemed more suitable than Roman Herzog. They also wanted to signal that the FDP is maintaining a minimum of independence, that it does not let Kohl dictate their ballot slips in the Federal Assembly. But the majority were convinced that they will stand a better chance of surviving this autumn's elections if they commit themselves to a chancellor who just has to find out where he stands once again. In the middle of this test, Kinkel established himself as party chairman. In his view, the FDP must not waver until the elections. He was planning the decision in Herzog's favor as a confirmation of the earlier coalition statement in favor of the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union]. Kinkel's signal consists of three words: predictability, straightforwardness, reliability. The liberals did not vote for Herzog or Rau, but for their chairman's demand that they should behave in such a way that Kohl's coalition feels on its way up again and Scharping's upward trend seems to have stopped. In spite of his relative strength, Kinkel has not come out as a winner on 23 May. The decision for Herzog was born out of a weakness. The FDP no longer feels strong enough to want anything itself, to enforce its own ideas about the candidate's personality and about the distribution of power in the republic. The liberals had two options before Herzog was elected. With the coalition statement, they kept the future with the CDU/CSU open. At the same time, this statement enabled them to feel free to indicate a different line for the presidential election. Kinkel decided in favor of the clear majority in the Bundestag group that feels closer to the coalition with the CDU/CSU than the party as a whole does. He turned the Bundestag group's will into political action cleverly and successfully. But it has also become clear that Kinkel does not dare do something on which one of his predecessors was an expert: juggling with two or more balls. With Genscher as chairman, the FDP could have voted for Rau. In that case it would have been wooed by the CDU/CSU and the SPD. The FDP under Kinkel did not dare do such a thing. It was scared of a "sudden deterioration of the climate." It prefers being scolded by the SPD to being chided by the CDU/CSU even if it does not yet see itself as a liberal working group within the CDU. At first glance, Kinkel's straightforwardness seems to be liberating. The hangover comes later. The new president's first speech has already irritated several of the FDP delegates who had voted for him. The fact that Herzog wants to represent Germany "in a relaxed way," that he welcomed citizens from the East like guests to the West and forgot the foreigners did not only make Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher and Hans-Dietrich Genscher wince. Herzog's impromptu speech, formed by the emotions of the moment, rhetorically plain, made the liberals feel that they are partly responsible. This will, all the more, make them have to support this president who might still need to grow into his office and will certainly not be the image of his predecessor, Richard von Weizsaecker. With the decision in favor of Herzog, the dream of a transition of power fades, the image of Helmut Kohl's upswing moves to the foreground. In this republic, the chancellor is the one who makes decisions. In the coalition, the dog once again wags the tail, not the other way around -- as sometimes happened before. The FDP does not consider it in its interest to prevent the chancellor from coloring everything his way. But this could annoy some of the voters. Will Kohl's success turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory in the end? This depends on whether Kinkel's hope of his loyalty to the chancellor being appreciated is fulfilled. On the evening of 16 October in Bonn, the CDU/CSU and the FDP will have to get enough weight on the scales to be able to harvest the fruit they sowed in Berlin in May. For the chancellor, a cancellation of the twilight of the gods will not be sufficient. More than ever before, the FDP will determine Helmut Kohl's fate.
