Among the address' authors were directors of Kurchatov's Institute of Nuclear Physics, Institute of Physics of Russia's Academy of Sciences, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Russian Research Centre of Applied Chemistry and the All-Russian Research Institute of Electric Machinery. The letter was written in response to a resolution adopted in December 1993 by the presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The resolution said that the modern crisis of "the eldest scientific organization of the country" was largely caused by the lack of budgetary funds "passing through the Ministry of Science." The presidium of the academy urged to reshuffle the Ministry of Science to the corresponding state committee which would focus solely on federal R & D programs, and not on independent R & D projects. In other case, the academy leaders warned they would submit a resolution of no confidence to Science Minister Boris Saltykov. However, scientists who addressed Yeltsin wrote that such a policy would even further aggravate the collapse of science in Russia protesting against "the departmental principle of money distribution" as it "will result in equal empoverishment (of all institutions)." On the contrary, it would be better to keep pursuing the ministerial policy aimed at financing priority studies, they concluded.
