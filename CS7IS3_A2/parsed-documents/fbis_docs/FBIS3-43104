N. Kolokoltsev; UDC 517] [Abstract] Multiplicative exponential asymptotics of the splitting value in any order of a small parameter h is computed for the Shroedinger operator. A general case of several symmetrical point-wells, and wells organized in nondegenerated manifolds is also examined along with the multiplicative asymptotics of the lower eigenfunctions. First, a case of two potential wells is examined and three theorems are derived. Employing the Wentzel/Kramers/Brillouin method, equations can be obtained for a general situation, when the potential V is invariant under the impact of a finite group of orthogonal transformations and when there is a nondegenerated potential minimum in each fundamental region.
