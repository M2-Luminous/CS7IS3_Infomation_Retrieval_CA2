The first specialized law to safeguard state security since the founding of the People's Republic of China, it provides a strong legal guarantee and a powerful weapon in the struggle to effectively prevent and check acts which harm state security, to safeguard state security, to defend the political power of the people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system, and to defend and promote reform, opening to the outside world, and the socialist modernization drive. The law marks an important point in the bid to develop socialist democracy and improve the Chinese legal system, especially the state security legal system. In the year since the law was promulgated for implementation, state security organs in Tibet, under the leadership of party committees, people's congresses, and governments at all levels, and supported and coordinated by procuratorial and judicial departments, press units, and other departments dealing with foreigners, have done a great deal of work in studying, publicizing, and implementing the law, thus achieving some results. First, attention has been given to organizing study of the law and adherence to it by state security police. In accordance with the plan drawn up by the State Security Department Party Committee, all police officers, on the basis of studying, discussing, and memorizing the legal provisions themselves, have sponsored classes over five terms to teach the "State Security Law." This law has also been incorporated with other training courses as part of the compulsory curriculum. Fairly good results have been obtained from providing rotational training for 90 percent of police officers in Tibet, and from providing memorization tests for police officers of departmental organs and prefectural and municipal state security departments and bureaus. Second, we have seized the opportunity to publicize and educate cadres of party and government organs, foreign affairs departments, and various enterprises and establishments about the "State Security Law." Over the past year, state security organs in Tibet have distributed more than 2,000 wall charts and more than 20,000 booklets on the law -- some printed in both the Tibetan and Chinese languages -- to various units, departments, prefectures, cities, counties, townships, and villages. Meanwhile, departmental leaders and leading comrades and law officers at all prefectural and municipal state security organs have sponsored more than 10 lectures on the law for more than 2,000 leading cadres and professionals working at various foreign affairs units and in prefectural, municipal, and county organs. Third, the initiative has been taken to get the support and coordination of press units, and public opinion has been exploited in vigorously publicizing the "State Security Law." The regional state security department, various areas, and city state security organs have universally used propaganda tools such as radios, televisions, and newspapers to publicize the law. City leaders have been invited to make televised speeches and answer questions by reporters. Television stations have broadcast serial dramas; articles have been published in local newspapers. The autonomous regional state security department has published more than 10 articles in XIZANG RIBAO and XIZANG FAZHI BAO, each of which has publicized the "State Security Law." XIZANG RIBAO has also achieved good results through sponsorship of a competition on knowledge of the law. Fourth, enforce the law with specific targets in mind and intensify propaganda and education among specific individuals and units. A few leaders or functionaries at some units handling external relations have, instead of providing support and assistance to state security work, gone so far as to create obstructions. State security organs have educated them on the provisions of the state security law and these efforts produced immediate results. After a year of study, publicity, and implementation of the "State Security Law," law-enforcement skills among state security cadres and police has improved to some extent. Awareness of state security has increased among leaders at all levels, among cadres and workers of relevant departments, and among the general population throughout the region. Many people believe that implementation of the "State Security Law" is not merely a matter of state security; rather, it involves every citizen and organization -- "everyone is responsible for the security of the state." Some units have taken the initiative in providing support and coordination for law enforcement by state security departments. We must, however, be soberly aware that dissemination of the "State Security Law" has not been carried out evenly throughout the region. In areas that have not established state security organs, dissemination has been carried out on only a very limited scale. In particular, many cadres and people in rural and frontier regions have never heard of the "State Security Law" or have only just begun to understand its provisions. State security organs need to upgrade their law- enforcement skills and cadres and police in such organs need to enhance their awareness of their exercise of powers according to law. Supplementary rules and regulations for the implementation of the "State Security Law" need to be formulated or amplified. A handful of units and individuals have continued to disregard provisions of the "State Security Law." Lacking awareness of state security, they refuse to provide support or cooperation for state security work and go so far as to obstruct functionaries of state security organs from executing their official duties. Some refuse to provide information and some do not cooperate with state security organs in investigations, thereby severely impeding state security work. All these problems need to be solved with further efforts to study, publicize, and implement the "State Security Law." The current international situation has provided our region with a favorable opportunity to promote reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. Blessed with economic growth, political stability, national unity, and social progress, Tibet is a scene of dynamism. We must, however, also be soberly aware that, in spite of this excellent situation, peace does not reign throughout the world. Some hostile forces outside have never ceased activities which jeopardize China's state security. They seek to obtain China's political, economic, scientific, and military secrets and they are trying to carry out infiltration, splittist activities, and sabotage one way or another. A handful of extremely anti-socialist elements at home have joined with hostile forces from outside to intensify their efforts to sabotage the security and interests of the state. Because China has been at peace for so long, many are not vigilant about these sabotage efforts that jeopardize state security. Some even turn a blind eye -- or confuse right with wrong -- when it comes to sabotage activities carried out by spy agencies and hostile forces from outside, as well as splittist forces inside and outside the national boundaries. A handful of people, recruited by hostile forces from outside, are engaged in criminal activities to disrupt state security. In order to create a stable environment for reform, opening up, and economic construction; to advance state security work in such a way that it is subject to, and serves more effectively, the party's basic line and gives full play to its function as part of the people's democratic dictatorship on the covert front; and in the face of this acute, complex, and grim struggle, we must make the "State Security Law" an essential part of the second "five-year plan," disseminating knowledge of the law and conducting a region-wide study, dissemination, and implementation of the "State Security Law" in a thorough and sustained manner. Formulating the "State Security Law" was a formidable undertaking; studying, disseminating, and implementing it will prove to be more challenging. A precondition for strict enforcement of the "State Security Law" law is that it be studied and mastered. This is a mandatory task for specialized organs at all levels; it is also something every citizen and organization should do. State security organs, party and government departments at all levels, mass organizations, enterprises and establishments in the region must educate and guide the vast ranks of cadres to study the "State Security Law" so that they clearly understand what sort of criminal act jeopardizes state security; they know a citizen's duty and right to safeguard state security; they keep firmly in mind the idea that "everyone is responsible for the security of the state"; they learn how to utilize the law as a weapon in fighting criminal activity that jeopardizes state security; and they conscientiously safeguard the safety, honor, and interests of the motherland. State security organs must strictly abide by the law in their law-enforcement activity. They should protect the citizens or organizations that have offered support and assistance to state security work; commend and reward those who have made major contributions; investigate to determine the culpability of those who have refused to fulfill their duty or obstructed state security work; and crack down hard on criminal activity that harms the security and interests of the state so that they efficiently ensure that the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics progresses smoothly in our region.
