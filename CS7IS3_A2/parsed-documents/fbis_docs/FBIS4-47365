Two gas deposits and 10 fields containing both oil and gas were detected at the northern edge of the Dniepr-Donets Depression, the main oil and gas producing region of Ukraine. The newly discovered fields are believed to contain over 250 million tons of hydrocarbons, and the stratigraphic range of the commercially exploitable oil and gas deposits is over 1000 meters. This is the first time that industrial quantities of hydrocarbons have been found in Ukraine in crystalline basement rock, which was previously considered to be unpromising for exploration. The deposits' relative proximity to the surface means that they can be exploited with existing equipment, material and technology, and without foreign investors. These circumstances heighten the significance of the discovery for Ukraine, which lacks the materials and equipment required to explore its main hydrocarbon reserves, located at depths of 5,000 to 10,000 meters (Moscow IZVESTIYA 12 Sep 92). The deposits have the added advantage of being located near large industrial users in Kharkhov, Okhtyrka and Sumy. The new exploration techniques consist of a set of highly accurate and efficient nonstandard geophysical surveys developed for detecting oil and gas in sedimentary mantle and crystalline basement rock. One innovation, conducting zonal seismic surveys longitudinally along discordant faults, made it possible to detect fairly long lines of folds rapidly and prepare them for exploratory drilling. Seismostratigraphic analysis was used to detect untraditional forms, such as horst, paleovalleys and wide fractured zones, which characterize structure in sedimentary mantle. The authors of the NAFTOVA I GAZOVA PROMYSLOVIST article proved experimentally that low-value anomalies in pseudoacoustic and pseudointerval rates associated with fractured rock zones are caused by high porosity and, for the most part, with gas saturation. These survey methods were developed under a state program drafted by the authors and can be used in other territories of Ukraine. Ukraine has been seeking to reduce its 80 percent dependence on gas imports from Russia and Turkmenistan by boosting domestic production, now at one-third its 1990 level. A comprehensive national program ``Ukrainian Gas and Oil to 2010'' is addressing problems in oil and gas exploration, production, and processing (Kiev DEM0KRATYCHNA UKRAYINA 3 Jul 93).
