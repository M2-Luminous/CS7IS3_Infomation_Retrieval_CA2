Blix, director general of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), stressed that it is necessary to check a radio chemical laboratory in the Yongbyon nuclear power complex about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang and a 5,000-kilowatt experimental reactor to complete the inspections. Blix is in Hiroshima for the annual meeting of the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum, which this year is focusing on the theme of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide and promoting the peaceful uses of atomic energy. IAEA inspectors were allowed in North Korea last month for their first look at North Korean nuclear facilities in more than a year in an effort to determine if radioactive materials had been diverted to military purposes. Blix told reporters Wednesday that a check of the radio chemical laboratory was necessary to determine if it had been used since February 1993. Blix also said that North Korea is nearing completion on construction of a second plutonium production line, which could double the North Korean output of the material needed in building an atomic bomb.
