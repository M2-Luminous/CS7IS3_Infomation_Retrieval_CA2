At present, the development of our national economy has entered the limits of the expected goals of macroscopic regulation. By the end of April, tax payments increased 29.2 percent over the same period of last year, and incomes at the central and local levels grew at the same pace. The tax reform has not triggered off large fluctuations in market commodity prices. As introduced by a leading cadre of the State General Administration of Taxation, since the new tax system has only operated for four months, only initial results have been achieved. One type of the new problems that have arisen, in a nutshell, is problems related to the tax policy, which are primarily manifested in whether the tax burden of enterprises is justifiable and whether tax payments received can be deducted in a reasonable way. The other type is related to operation. For example, massive operational training was organized before the introduction of the new tax system, but, overall, it has not been enough, and problems such as calculation mistakes, erroneous classification, and mixed-up accounting have occurred. With studies and investigation conducted over the past four months, most of the tax burden policy problems commonly reflected have been solved. For example, as far as enterprises of civil administration and welfare, school-run enterprises, and enterprises running the wholesale business of "shopping basket" commodities are concerned, preferential policies are still being applied to them, and the method of collecting taxes first and then returning the levies to them is being implemented. The value-added tax rate of agricultural produce, metal mineral products, non-metal mineral products, and coal has been reduced from 17 to 13 percent. Grain and edible oil allocated and transferred wholesale to the people by state-owned grain and commercial enterprises will be exempt from value-added tax for two years; as will agricultural means of production, such as feed, seeds, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, plastic sheeting, and farm machinery. Tap water, small facilities of water and power supply below the county level, and some building materials, such as sand, soil, and stone, will be taxed at the rate of 6 percent. The tax on junk purchased from society is reduced by 10 percent, and tax on freight is reduced by 10 percent. Moreover, it is clearly stated that preferential policies concerning enterprise income tax are still applicable to enterprises involved with new and advanced technologies, service enterprises, enterprises utilizing "three wastes," new enterprises in "old, new, border, and impoverished" areas, labor service and employment enterprises, school-run enterprises, enterprises of civil administration and welfare, and township and town enterprises. The leading cadre of the State General Administration of Taxation said: The contradiction of some problems has been alleviated after taking a number of measures, but a process is still necessary before the small taxpayers' problem, the problem of deducting tax payments contained in the opening inventory, and so on are completely solved. Moreover, solutions for some problems have been fixed and are being implemented.
