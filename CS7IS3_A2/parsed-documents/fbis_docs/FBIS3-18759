Demirel stressed that although these measures are not as radical as the 24 January decisions they must absolutely be adopted if the free market economy is to take hold and healthy balances to be formed. Fear of Intervention Demirel stressed that Turkey seems to want a free market economy, but actually does not and fears the free economy. For Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, he had the message: "Don't intervene in the economy," and made the following evaluation: "The most important problem of the economy in Turkey is the failure to make the transition to a free market economy in the full sense. Turkey is afraid of the free market. The state is intervening in the economy. Free market rules do not work when there is constant fear of state intervention. It is necessary to take the measures I listed to eliminate this fear." Demirel pointed out that the 24 January decisions met two of the three goals of the period in which they originated and said: "The 24 January decisions had three goals. One was to eliminate shortages, another was to step up the economic process, and another was to ensure the transition to a free market economy. The decisions eliminated the shortages at that time and stepped up the economic process, but the transition to the free market economy, the most important goal, has not been fully accomplished. This process is continuing but has not been completed. From this standpoint, the 24 January decisions failed to achieve their third goal. To achieve it, the decisions I mentioned must be taken and the formation of economic balances must be left entirely to the marketplace. ``Turkey's economy is still a command economy. As long as we have a command economy, the necessity to overcome bottlenecks and the occurrence of sudden imbalances, just as in the past, will be unavoidable. Turkey must now make the decision to abandon the command economy and must not be afraid of it.'' Demirel pointed out that the dinner he hosted at Cankaya yesterday for bank administrators had nothing to do with recent economic events, that for a long time he has been having dinners periodically for groups such as professional organizations and trade guilds, and that this one had been planned far in advance of the recent foreign exchange event. Demirel said, "My party for bank administrators was not something that was done after the recent foreign exchange event. It was a routine arrangement along with other organizations for which the date had been set far in advance."
