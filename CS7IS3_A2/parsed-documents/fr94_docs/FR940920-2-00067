FR940920-2-00067 FR940920-2-00027 E. State Water Quality Standards and State Certification Since state waters are involved in the proposed general permit area, the provisions of Section 401 of the Act apply. In accordance with 40 CFR 124.10(c)(1), public notice of the draft permit has been provided to the State of Alaska agencies having jurisdiction over fish, shellfish, and wildlife resources (see section II.C. above). F. Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the review requirements of Executive Order 12866 pursuant to Section 8(b) of that order. G. Paperwork Reduction Act EPA has reviewed the requirements imposed on regulated facilities in this draft general permit under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 USC 3501 et seq. Most of the information collection requirements have already been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in submissions made for the NPDES permit program under the provisions of the Clean Water Act. In addition, the environmental monitoring requirements pursuant to Section 403(c) of the Clean Water Act in Part II.B.4 of this permit are similar to the monitoring requirements that were approved by OMB for the previously issued Beaufort Sea II and Chukchi Sea general permits (September 28, 1988, 53 FR 37846) and the modification of the Beaufort Sea II NPDES general permit (September 27, 1989, 54 FR 39574). The final general permit will explain how the information collection requirements respond to any OMB or public comments. H. The Regulatory Flexibility Act After review of the facts presented in the notice of intent printed above, I hereby certify, pursuant to the provisions of 5 USC 605(b), that this general permit will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is based on the fact that the regulated parties have greater than 500 employees and are not classified as small businesses under the Small Business Administration regulations established at 49 FR 5024 et seq. (February 9, 1984). These facilities are classified as Major Group 13_Oil and Gas Extraction SIC 1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas. Dated: August 31, 1994. Chuck Clarke, Regional Administrator, Region 10.
