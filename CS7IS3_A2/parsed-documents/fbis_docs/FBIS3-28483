Recalling that the puppet clique of Kim Yong-sam, the traitor for all ages, is resorting to a wholesale crackdown, branding the peaceful protests for defending the nation's dignity and interests as "violence", the statement says the current struggle of the South Korean peasants and students is by no means "violence". The real violence is the brutalities of the fascist clique which is madly wielding the bayonet at the bare-handed peaceful demonstrators and its boss is none other than the traitor Kim Yong-sam, it points out. The statement calls upon the South Korean peasants and students to wage a more daring struggle to overthrow the treacherous Kim Yong-sam puppet regime and establish a truly independent democratic government, in close solidarity and unity with people of all other strata, holding high the banner of struggle against outside forces and puppets, which they have raised.
