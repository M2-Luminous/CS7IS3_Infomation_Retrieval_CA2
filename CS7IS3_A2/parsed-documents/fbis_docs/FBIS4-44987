As expected, the internal crisis in the Bodoland People's Party [BPP] has further intensified. The first annual conference of the BPP at Bodobazar in Bijni in Bongaigaon district, under the chairmanship of its president Mr. Sansuma Khunggur Bwiswmutiary (6-7 May), expelled Mr. Premsing Brahma, presently the Chief Executive Member of the Bodoland Autonomous Council (BAC) and General Secretary of the BPP, from the primary membership of the BPP. At another two-day conference of the BPP, also described as the first annual conference, held at Tamulpar in Nalbari district on 29-30 April, Mr. Sansuma Khunggur Bwiswmutiary himself had been removed from the presidentship of the BPP and replaced by Mr. Premsing Brahma. The Bijni conference appointed Mr. Rabiram Brahma, the General Secretary of the All Bodo Students' Union (ABSU) throughout the years of the Bodoland agitation and, who had recently resigned as Executive Member of the BAC, as General Secretary of the BPP it annulled the expulsion of Mr. Baliram Boro, Vice-President of the BPP, from the party, and reinstated him in his original position. The decision to expel Mr. Baliram Boro had been taken on April 18 following public criticism by Mr. Baliram Boro of some of the actions of Mr. Premsing Brahma and his supporters in the BAC, particularly disbursement of BAC funds. According to reports available in Guwahati, the Bijni conference was attended by about a thousand delegates representing eight of the 11 district committees of the BPP. On the face of it, these developments appear all too typical of any fledgling political party and seem to be based on personal rivalries and accusations of financial irregularities as well as frustrations over the non-implementation of the Bodo accord, in particular the refusal of the State Government to include 515 more villages (in addition to the 2,750 already notified) in the BAC area. However, beyond these real and manufactured grievances are some more fundamental issues touching on the "Bodo national question" that animated the Bodoland agitation -- issues which the Bodo accord did not even touch upon. It is true that Mr. Hiteswar Saikia has exploited the more superficial of the differences among Bodo leaders with a view to splitting the leadership and finally marginalising the Bodo nationalist aspirations -- as he has done in the case of ULFA [United Liberation Front of Assam]. Nevertheless, such developments do not mean that one faction of the Bodo leadership is less sensitive to those more basic issues than the other or that one faction has compromised itself by agreeing to have a working relationship with Mr. Hiteswar Saikia -- the charge brought against Mr. Premsing Brahma by Mr. Bwiswmutiary and his supporters. For, whoever occupies political office in the BAC structure will, by definition, be tarred as a "collaborationist," with those excluded adopting, apparently out of necessity, a more nationalist posture. Viewed from a broader perspective, however, there seems to be an underlying unity of perception on Bodo 'national' aspirations even in the midst of all these wrangles. And as these developments enfeeble all the organically related structures committed to the Bodo accord and the fulfilment of these aspirations within the ambit of the Indian Constitution -- the ABSU, the BPP and the BAC -- the only certain gainer will be the most extreme and explicitly secessionist of the Bodo nationalist structures, the Bodo Security Force, waiting in the wings to pick up the pieces and appropriate the Bodo movement.
