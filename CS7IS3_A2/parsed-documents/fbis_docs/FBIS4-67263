The State Department document tells us that drug trafficking and money laundering have increased from 1993 to 1994, and it specifically names Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica, and Honduras. With respect to Nicaragua, it states that our country has been slow to pass laws punishing such crimes and does not provide adequate financial support for law enforcement agencies. Reports by such agencies as the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration], U.S. Customs, the Financial Crime Enforcement Network, and others in 1992 and 1993 contain a stockpile of information on financial movements and trafficking in harmful substances. Indeed, the report sounds the alarm for Nicaragua. Let us look at the facts. Our brand-new commissions seem to be unaware of achievements in certain areas. We are specifically referring to money laundering, concerning which we can state that in Nicaragua, the Central Bank efficiently controls exchange banks and other authorized agents. In addition, at a meeting held on 25 January 1993 in the offices of the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, D.C., it was clearly stated that Nicaragua is not among the countries where this type of crime occurs. A memorandum from the BCN [Central Bank of Nicaragua] even reflects this information. The Superintendency of Banking has also instituted efficient control barriers in our commercial banks that render money laundering more difficult. Nevertheless, we cannot say that money laundering does not take place. We must remember that criminal organizations have efficient financial systems and that if they do operate, it must be as discreetly as possible, conducting their dealings through the uncontrolled commercial underworld that exists in our country and paving the way for consolidation. We must be clear about this and not engage in speculative, puritanical statements. Plans The level of drug use in our country has risen from 1990 to 1994 with respect to Cannabis sativa (marijuana), cocaine, amphetamines, and tranquillizers. The increase among young people is alarming. There must be no attempt to cover this up and Commander Caldera of the National Police has warned of the emerging danger on several occasions. Now can we blame the Police for their failure to act because we are all aware of the limited budget available and the red tape of officials in a certain "ministry" that results in operational delays? In the meantime, the figures continue to rise noticeably, as we can see in our daily newspapers and health reports. Drugs have now made their way into Nicaragua. How do they get here and from where? What is the reason for the increase? We all know that we are surrounded by countries where the transshipment and laundering of money is blatant. We are a logical target. We must simply recognize the facts, without euphemisms or underestimating the problem. Rising poverty is a hotbed to be used by drug traffickers, combined with legal confusion and a lack of restrictive criminal laws, an absence of government control over mind-altering substances and of adequate mechanisms to reduce the availability of dangerous substances, along with a lack of (modern) measures regulating the purchase and distribution of drugs for medical use. Let us be realistic: It is not that we can make a country free of drugs, but we can make a country opposed to drugs that is difficult for organized crime to penetrate. Education and Legal and Police Measures The measures are simple but costly, and the investment required is enormous in terms of human and economic interests. It must initially include the following: 1) providing an efficient budget for the National Police to be used to improve techniques and modernize means so as to create an antidrug atmosphere; drafting legal guidelines for speed in operations (functionalality); expanding the range of action and equipment of the Economic Department; modernizing the crime lab in order to bring it in line with world investigative requirements and guidelines; and (Please!) raising the wages of our policemen (they are the ones dying because of our apathy); 2) drafting efficient laws for the fight against drug trafficking and money laundering, not parodies or copies from some other jurisdiction, but laws covering summary action and harsh sanctions; regulating and giving the force of law to police evidence in such crimes; 3) organizing the legal system to make it more workable; 4) setting up an office to oversee the control, uses, and effects of substances and to govern their importation, production, and distribution; 5) regulating the seizure of drugs, equipment, and dirty money from drug traffickers (saving the government budget millions) because we still have obsolete laws on the books in our country; 6) establishing intergovernmental and police cooperation with specialized agencies via cooperation agreements; and 7) promoting education campaigns in our schools. The danger is latent and the message is reaching us from all sides. Our officials must realize that drugs are destroying entire societies today, and we cannot prevent this from happening by rhetoric alone.
