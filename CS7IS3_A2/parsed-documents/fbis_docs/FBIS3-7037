They had been taken away by the enemy in late January after falling unconscious in a storm on the sea. But they steadfastly defended the authority of the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and bravely fought as soldiers of comrade supreme commander, undaunted by the enemy's relentless threat, appeasement and deception, and returned in triumph. When they drifted on the sea, General Kim Chong-il, supreme commander, took all the measures necessary for saving them. Upon hearing about their heroic deeds, he placed great political confidence in them, granting them the honor of being members of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and the title of the Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the "Kim Il-song Youth Honor Prize." Addressing the meeting, Chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea Choe Yong-hae said the heroic deeds displayed by them in a showdown with the enemy clearly showed that if anyone bravely fought the enemy with the revolutionary faith and indomitable will of trusting and following only comrade supreme commander, he could surely win in any adversity and return to the socialist homeland. He called on all the working people to keep themselves in full combat readiness to cope with the new war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique, and rise up like a mountain and defend the honor of chuche Korea by becoming a fortress and shield, rifles and bombs, when comrade supreme commander issued an order. Kim Chol-chin said that they could return to the bosom of the great general after showing the prowess of young soldiers to the enemy, because they were encouraged by the deep trust and paternal affection of comrade supreme commander and they had the rock-firm faith that they would win, guided by the general. Representatives of factory and office workers, youth and students vowed to defend the socialist homeland like an impregnable fortress and dynamically accelerate socialist construction with a rifle in one hand and a hammer or a pen in the other, keeping in their mind the rock-firm faith that they will surely win in any circumstances as General Kim Chong-il leads them. Present at the meeting was Kim Chung-rin, secretary of the Central Committee of the WPK.
