A five-member team led by American Gerald Brubaker was to take air samples from the former chemical weapons complex at al-Muthanna, west of the capital Baghdad, to search for the possible presence of chemical agents. Iraq's chemical weapons were assembled at the site and most of them have since been destroyed. A UN chemical weapons expert, Cees Wolterbreek of the Netherlands, said in December that he was "99 percent" certain that Iraq's chemical arsenal had been destroyed except for a few weapons and munitions. The head of the UN Special Commission on disarming Iraq, Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, said on February 1 that he was still not completely satisfied with Iraq's answers about its chemical program. The chemical team will be the first to visit Iraq since the UN Security Council decided Friday to continue sanctions against Baghdad which were imposed after the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. For the first time the council members could not agree on an assessment of Iraq's compliance with disarmament resolutions ending the 1991 Gulf war. Russia, France, China and Brazil asked the council to recognize Iraqi "progress" toward disarmament but the United States and Britain rejected the request.
