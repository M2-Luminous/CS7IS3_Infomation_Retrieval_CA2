In his letter the RSK president writes that the war in the former Yugoslavia and all its horrible consequences could have been averted had there been more understanding and a better insight into the historic causes of the crisis in former Yugoslavia in 1990 and 1991. "At that time Europe's most powerful countries unfortunately supported the creation of an ethnic community's state on the territory of other ethnic communities, so that the territories of the new states on the soil of the former Yugoslavia corresponded with the artificial states designed by Nazi Germany in 1941," the letter states. It also notes that "in both cases, old Serbian lands were incorporated into the states of Muslims and Croats, while the Serbs were condemned to death, persecution, and assimilation." Martic recalls the European principles articulated by the Badinter arbitration commission, which told the peoples of former Yugoslavia that the international community would recognize the new states, provided they met the following conditions: they should have a territory, a population, and they should exercise legislative authority on that territory. "The Republic of Croatia was recognized, including the territory of the republic of Serb Krajina, where Croatia does not exercise legislative authority; nor does this territory belong to the Croatian ethnic community. The population that used to live there was not Croatian either," Martic adds. The right to self-determination, however, has not only been acknowledged as an exclusive right of the Serbian nation, the letter to the UN secretary general says. These facts were ignored in 1990 and 1991, as well as later on in the work of the international conference on former Yugoslavia, which, according to Martic, resulted in the escalation of the war between the Serbs and the Croats, the Serbs and the Muslims, and later between the Muslims and the Croats. Reminding the UN secretary general about the persecution of the Serbs in Croatia during World War II, when some 1,250,000 Serbs perished, as well as about data on Serbs murdered in and expelled from Croatia over the past four years, Martic stressed he does not believe the secretary general and other officials in the world could afford to ignore the republic of Serb Krajina. "Serb Krajina must be included in the work of the new international conference on former Yugoslavia, which you intend to organize. The republic of Serb Krajina, albeit unrecognized, is nevertheless a factor in international relations, and is subject to international law. On 29 March this year it signed an agreement with the Republic of Croatia and was thus recognized as a warring side. It has the full right to take part in agreements on setting up future relations between the new states created on the territory of former Yugoslavia," RSK president Milan Martic concludes in his letter to Butrus-Ghali.
