Mariano Mena, general secretary of the General Confederation of Panamanian Workers (CGTP) and a member of ARI, told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that the Torrijos-Carter Treaties must be fulfilled. The country is in no condition to negotiate the military bases. According to the leader, the proximity of the election and the political situation do not offer the appropriate conditions for modifying the treaty. According to the Southern Command Treaty Implementation Office, 9,000 U.S. soldiers and 2,562 civilians work at the U.S. bases in Panama along with 5,718 Panamanian civilian employees. David Guerra, presidential candidate for the National Unity Mission party (MUN), said Panama has more immediate needs to attend to, and modifying the Torrijos Carter Treaty would just create more problems. Tomas Herrera, presidential candidate for the Civic Renewal Party, said he agrees with former President Jimmy Carter that the bases will disappear within the time established by the treaty. He indicated that the new government could negotiate the treaties responsibly, seeking to increase Panama's income. Herrera pointed out that "Panama could benefit by renegotiating the U.S. military bases as Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, Turkey, and Korea have."
