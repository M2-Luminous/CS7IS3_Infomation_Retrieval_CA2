However, John Gummer, the Environment Secretary, claimed that many targets had been met and more had been set. He believed that environmental standards and the Government's move to deregulate many activities in order to increase competitiveness were compatible. He listed his achievements as the ratification of the Convention on Climate Change, which seeks to combat global warming, extending pollution control to eight new industry groups, including minerals and chemicals; strengthening the Energy Efficiency Office; and setting reduction targets for sulphur dioxide emissions to cut acid rain. The report, issued eight months late, is the third audit--begun with the 1990 white paper, This Common Inheritance--and details the original promises made and action taken since. Chris Smith, shadow environment protection spokesman, said the document displayed inaction and complacency. He said the last three months had seen the Government deliberately destroy the Energy Conservation Bill, conduct a review of the roads programme that left almost all of it in place, and the privatisation of British Rail. Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat spokesman, pointed out that the Government had abandoned contaminated land registers and showed lack of long-term commitment to cut carbon emissions. "The report is as much a catalogue of government environment inaction as of action." The 200-page document lists 652 promises although some of the main ones show little progress. They include: --In previous years there were plans to bring forward new air quality targets by 1993. A discussion paper was issued this year but there are no targets. --Minimum construction standards were to be set in 1992 for chemical and oil stores. This has been abandoned. --Banning lead solder in water pipes, promised in 1992, is still under consideration. Many parts of Britain have lead levels in water well above World Health Organisation guidelines. Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, said: "This whole document is a testament to deregulatory acts and puts back the cause of the environment. It is proof that ideological blinkers do not deliver environmental protection." - Farmers are causing damage to Britain's prime nature conservation sites, despite being paid Â£7 million a year to protect them, according to a report by the National Audit Office published today. A survey found that nearly one in five sites of special scientific interest showed damage or deterioration between annual visits. During spot checks in one area, the North-west, six out of 10 sites had been damaged by inappropriate farming practices. The report also criticises English Nature, the quango charged with identifying and protecting the sites, for failure to encourage and assist public access to national nature reserves.
