They have obtained the authorization to land from the Rwandan authorities. Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, however, has dampened the optimism: [Begin recording] [Claes] Listen, we have received the authorization from the new government, but as concerns the operation on the ground, it is the military command which will decide. I cannot give you more ample details. [Unidentified correspondent] Is this authorization serious and reliable? [Claes] Well, I could not tell you that we had the authorization if we had not taken all possible precautions. We still have a slight reservation: I cannot give you a 100 percent guarantee that the Rwandan troops at the airport are obeying the authorities, but I am still quite confident. [Correspondent] Was a parachute landing ever considered? [Claes] No, absolutely not. [Correspondent] So you will only land in a specific operation? [Claes] Yes. [end recording] Willy Claes is therefore dampening the hope that all Belgian nationals will rapidly be evacuated from Kigali. We will judge on the spot, he said, when the first Belgian planes approach the runway to land. Willy Claes also said that it has not been ruled out that some Belgians should be evacuated in other planes, French or American, in the context of a coordinated operation, and taken to Nairobi and Bujumbura, where they would then be taken over by Belgian soldiers. Willy Claes refused to give any more details on the operation, but added that only those who wish to leave would be evacuated. Those who remain will do so at their own risk.
