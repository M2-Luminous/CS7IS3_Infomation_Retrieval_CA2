It is coordinating the positions the representatives of the Croat people will be advocating at the constituent assembly in Sarajevo on Monday [28 March]. Zdenko Vranjes has the report. [Vranjes] If we wish to be realistic we will conclude that the solutions agreed and signed in Washington serve the interests of the entire Croat nation, the interests of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the interests of the Republic of Croatia, said Kresimir Zubak, president of the Presidential Council of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, speaking in detail about the course and results of the talks. The Croats have attained a high degree of unity in signing the Washington accord; we see the agreement as binding, and we are ready to translate what we have signed into practice, Zubak said. He called on the deputies to adopt the constitution at the assembly in Sarajevo. If we manage to elect experts and capable people to responsible posts in the municipalities, grand counties [velezupe], and the federation, then Bosnia-Herzegovina, with constitutional guarantees, will remain a homeland of the Croat people in the future, Zubak said. He added that by accepting the Washington accord, a turnabout was made by those who called for a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina and not those who suggested from the very beginning that Bosnia-Herzegovina be a federal state in which the Croat people would be equal and state-building. Zubak also said in his opening address that the solutions from Washington were not imposed ones but that it was obvious that it would have been extremely unfavorable for the Croat people if the agreement had not been signed. Before the debate the deputies were informed about the positions taken by the Presidency of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, positions that were adopted by the HDZ parliamentary group prior to the session of the chamber. The HDZ extended full support to the documents signed and called on the HDZ deputies to persevere in the adoption of the draft constitution and the election of the federation's president and vice president in the interim period at the assembly in Sarajevo. In view of the fact that the Bosnia-Herzegovina president, in his extended term in office, came from the ranks of the Bosnian Muslim people, the HDZ presidency insists that the federation's Presidency in the interim period be a Croat and that the interim government's prime minister be a Muslim. The HDZ proposes that the constituent assembly elect Kresimir Zubak president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. The HDZ Presidency also charged all the bodies of authority in Herceg-Bosna with the task of creating conditions for the implementation of the agreement and to strengthen functions and institutions which, in conformity with the constitution, are to remain intact until a final and overall decision on the fate of Bosnia-Herzegovina is reached. The deputies were also informed that the Croat deputies at the constituent assembly in Sarajevo will be headed by Ivan Bender, assembly deputy and president of the Chamber of Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, and that Ivo Zivkovic has been appointed as his deputy. This proposal was adopted by the HDZ parliamentary group at this morning's session. A debate on this subject is under way and this part of the session of the Chamber of Deputies is off limits to reporters. The agenda of the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna also includes several important draft laws -- the laws on defense, internal affairs, refugees, and displaced persons, and health care. The session is also attended by guests from the Republic of Croatia, HDZ officials Ivan Milas and Gojko Susak.
