The figure represents an average of only 1.5 metric tons of paddy per hectare. With a population of 245,000, the province will face rice shortages possibly from four to five months. Those living in mountainous areas, especially in Ta-oi and Sa-moi Districts, will face a rice shortage for about 10 months. Agricultural service officials reported that the 1993 provincial paddy production is low at 48 percent less than that of 1992, with natural disasters being blamed as its major cause. Severe drought during the production season damaged about 5,300 hectares of lowland and highland rice growing areas. Following such low rice production, the local provincial administration have encouraged people to grow dry season cash crops and dry season rice on 169 hectares. The areas with favorable conditions for these crops include 100 hectares in Ta-oi District, 31 in Saravane District, 27 in Khong Sedone District, and 11 in Vapi District. Farmers in areas without favorable conditions, or without irrigation, have been encouraged to raise as many chicken, cows, and other animals as they can to compensate for losses resulting from low production.
