"We are a bit suspicious of what really the French intentions are," a senior Nigerian official who asked not to be named told AFP on Tuesday [1 March], a day after the French delegation held talks with Cameroon's President Paul Biya in Yaounde. "Because whatever the French interest in Nigeria may be, and of course, there is a lot of interest here, the one in Cameroon and certainly in the French-speaking West Africa for them is more fundamental and critical," he said. "Certainly their involvement could not be good news for Nigeria at all," he added. I think we certainly have to play diplomacy. But at the same time, we have to look at the security and military implications of French intervention so as not to be caught unawares." France on Sunday despatched a contingent of 30 paratroops and two Puma helicopters to Cameroon, which disputes control of the Bakassi peninsula on the border, believed to be rich in oil and fish, with Nigeria. Each side blames the other for fighting there last month. Cameroon alleges that Nigerian soldiers have invaded the area and attacked Cameroonian gendarmes, but Lagos charges that the Cameroonian paramilitary police have been attacking and harassing ethnic Nigerian fishermen, forcing several thousand to flee. "French troops sent to repel Nigeria," the independent VANGUARD newspaper reported Tuesday in a headline typical of the general tone of the press, which expressed misgivings at the move. Cameroonian television said the French troops were "essentially on an exploratory mission" and a French foreign ministry spokeswoman promised an even-handed approach from the team from Paris, led by General Christian Quesnot of the general staff and Bruno Delaye, President Francois Mitterrand's African affairs advisor. Nigerian Foreign Minister Baba Gana Kingibe planned Wednesday to hold a "very comprehensive" press briefing on the issue, a foreign ministry spokesman told AFP here on Tuesday. Kingibe warned Monday in the Nigerian capital Abuja that France "will take full responsibility for internationalising" the conflict and also shoulder the blame for the "attendant consequences" of an escalation of the dispute. The French foreign ministry spokeswoman said that the team from Paris was expected to fly on from Yaounde to Abuja for talks with Nigeria's military ruler, General Sani Abacha, after its consultations with Biya, in a bid "to keep the peace" and find ways "to resolve the dispute as soon as possible in accordance with international law." But there was no indication Tuesday as to when the French delegation might meet the Nigerian leader. In an editorial Tuesday, the DAILY TIMES said: "We stated in the past that Nigeria is not an imperialist country and that we seek the wellbeing of ourselves and fellow Africans. We still stand by that declaration except that there comes a time when a nation must stand up for its legitimate right. "That time is here." In another development, the European Union (EU) called Tuesday for international arbitration into the dispute and expressed "grave concern" at the "skirmishes" talking place in the border region. "The EU urges the governments of Nigeria and Cameroun to seek a solution to the dispute, through arbitration or mediation of any regional or international organisation," a statement issued by the Greek embassy here said. Greece currently holds the presidency of the Union. The Union also called for the immediate withdrawal of troops concentrated on one side of the frontier line, the statement added, without indicating which side.
