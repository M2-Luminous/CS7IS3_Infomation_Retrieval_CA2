Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 14 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on August 22, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons and is simultaneously approving the proposal. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change On June 1, 1990, the NASD, through a subsidiary corporation, initiated operation of the OTC Bulletin Board Service (``OTCBB Service'' or ``Service'') in accord with the Commission's approval of File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;88&hyph;19, as amended. 1 The OTCBB Service provides a real-time quotation medium that NASD member firms can elect to use to enter, update, and retrieve quotation information (including unpriced indications of interest) for securities traded over-the-counter that are neither listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market sm nor on a primary national securities exchange (collectively referred to as ``OTC Equities''). 2 Essentially, the Service supports NASD members' market making in OTC Equities through authorized Nasdaq Workstation units. Real-time access to quotation information captured in the Service is available to subscribers of Level 2/3 Nasdaq service as well as subscribers of vendor-sponsored services that now carry OTCBB Service data. The Service is currently operating under interim approval that expires on September 1, 1994. 3 1 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27975 (May 1, 1990), 55 FR 19124 (May 8, 1990). 2 With the Commission's January 1994 approval of File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;24, the universe of securities eligible for quotation in the OTCBB now includes certain equities listed on regional stock exchanges that do not qualify for dissemination of transaction reports via the facilities of the Consolidated Tape Association.
