The car, which was parked at the junction of Trapezounda and Olimbia Streets, was destroyed. The Revolutionary Violence Cells [Pirines Epanastatkis Vias] claimed responsibility for the car's arson in a telephone call to a private radio station. A YSEE statement described the arson as a provocative action aimed at disorientating the working people. The statement condemned the unseen elements, who, with their suspicious and evil presence, have again tried to open a front against the trade unions--and this on the day of the May Day observances.
