VREME reports that Vladimir Zhirinovksiy, the leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia, had given the elipton to Zeljko Raznjatovic-Arkan. Key components of the bomb, VREME adds, are to be produced at the "Elektron" factory in Sabac owned by Tomislav Simic. In a Sabac news conference, VREME states, Simic had described the elipton as "a small box like a Geiger counter with a small antenna which serves as the personal weapon of every soldier" and announced that his factory would begin serial production of electronic parts for the elipton "in the middle of next year." According to VREME, Elektron is located on a large square in a one-story building pasted over with Arkan election posters. There was a blue Mercedes belonging Mr. Simic in front of the building, so "we thought we were in luck." However, the VREME group found only a doorman and a "close associate" of Simic, who informed them that Simic was not there, that he has been traveling a lot lately. The associate said that he was not competent to discuss the elipton but that Elektron was a reputable, well-established firm that is presently involved in the wholesale marketing of a "wide assortment of goods." VREME reports that the associate was unable to tell them anything about the firm's production but that he showed the group a brochure on the town of Sabac in which Elektron is presented as an export-import firm dealing in electronics production and services. "Thus, we remained convinced that any type of production, if there is any, is a secret, because, except for the doorman, a close collaborator, and a long corridor with several doors, we did not see anything. It seems that Mr. Simic is above all a philanthropist, because his close associate kept repeating how much he had given and continues to give to children and the socially deprived. He mentioned a sum of 200,000 German marks and the construction of a church, and he led us to a room with a sign on the door that said `Trade Office,' where there were piles of used clothing. He told us that the room used to be full but that everything had been given to the people." The VREME group, leaving the factory, went down the road to an Elektron store to see some of the factory's products. In the window there were a little plastic crocodile and an inflated duck. "Not a single trace of technology, especially not a secret one," VREME comments. VREME reports that the brochure on the town of Sabac states that Elektron employs about 60 workers, that it has retail stores, that it produces microtransformers for main telephone exchanges, and that it conducts business all over the world. It also notes that Elektron manufactures a potty-chair which plays music. VREME found out from Sabac residents that most of the data in the brochure were no longer valid. "If there ever was any production, there is none now," VREME states, adding that "only a potty-chair which plays music remains. Mr. Simic patented the potty-chair in the mid-1980's, building into it a mechanism which, in contact with fluid, plays music. It was a good deal, people say. Kids used to run to the potty," VREME concludes.
