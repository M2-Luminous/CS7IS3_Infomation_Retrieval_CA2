Maltseva under the rubric "Press Conference": "Siberian Agreement: Concept of the Region's Development"] [Text] Vladimir Ivankov, general director of the Siberian Agreement interregional association's executive board, held a press conference on the results of the association council meeting that took place in Moscow. This was not the first time Moscow was selected as the place for a "large gathering" for reasons of convenience: This time heads of oblast administrations--association members--came to the capital for an expanded session of the government. It is also important that, as a rule, high-ranking statesmen take part in Moscow conferences of Siberian Agreement: On 4 March it was Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. In his address he spoke against raising electric and transportation rates, which was supported by Siberians. The deputy prime minister detailed his trip to Norway, where he was familiarized with the practical side of taxation. The tax policy of our northern neighbors is aimed at supporting their own producers, and this, of course, is the main lesson for our legislators, through whose efforts domestic industry continues to remain in a difficult situation. Representatives of Siberian territories who spoke at the council asked the government rather pointed questions. Their meaning was that along with delegating to Siberian regions responsibility for conducting reform, rights should be delegated that would make it possible to proceed more effectively with this process. So far there is not even a government concept of economic reform in the Siberian region. Speaking of the interdependence between the European part of Russia and its eastern territories, in this respect the scales are revealingly tilted. Siberia needs only one-tenth of the electric power produced here, one-hundredth of the aluminum, and does not need as much oil, gas, and coal... But if Siberia works for Russia as a whole, there should be a corresponding attitude toward it. So far, however, no such line is seen in economic policy. An example is the allocation of credit to back up agricultural campaigns. Novosibirsk Oblast currently can cover only one-third of its countryside's needs for fuel and lubricants. Keeping in mind that only one-third of the needed fallow land area has been plowed, one may assume that spring plowing will "eat up" the fuel quite fast. The outcome is well known: You reap what you sow. It appears that it will again be cheaper to buy Canadian grain than to grow our own... A score of current problems were discussed at the Siberian Agreement council, regarding which decisions were made, agreements signed, and so on. One of the main items was the document "On the Socioeconomic Development of Siberian Regions and the Course of Economic Reforms," which was adopted after the discussion following the report by the association council chairman, V. Zubov, "Siberia and Economic Reform: Concept of a Development Strategy." This decision states the need to prepare documents corresponding to the strategic goals of Siberia's development. The first line in this list is "On Principles of Siberian Regional Policy." Although it was said both at the meeting and in the back rooms and at the press conference that Moscow cannot survive without Siberia, Siberian Agreement intends through its activities to prove not so much this idea as a more fruitful one--that of restoring the eastern territories through joint efforts, protecting them from demographic expansion on the part of contiguous states. This danger is quite real: Siberians are dying out or moving away, and population centers are being filled with new residents; in some places, for instance, there are twice as many Chinese as there are Russians.
