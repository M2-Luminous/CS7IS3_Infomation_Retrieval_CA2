FR940111-1-00018 FR940111-1-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;31] Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce, plc Spey Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc (R&hyph;R) Spey series turbofan engines. This document proposes to supersede Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52, which superseded Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51. Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51 reduced cyclic life limits for seventh stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disk from 40,000 total part cycles in service (TPC) to 35,000 TPC for the R&hyph;R Spey Model 506&hyph;14 and &hyph;14D engines. Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52 currently requires repetitive inspections or further reduced cyclic life limits for seventh stage HPC disks. This proposal would increase the AD's effectivity to include additional R&hyph;R Spey engine models, eliminate the option for repetitive inspections, and further reduce the cyclic life limits. This proposal is prompted by further investigation into disk bore cracking that was caused by corrosion. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent a seventh stage HPC disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure. DATES: Comments must be received by February 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;31, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299.
