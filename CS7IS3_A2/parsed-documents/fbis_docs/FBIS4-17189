This was reported to INTERFAX by a participant in the talks who did not want to disclose his name. He stressed that the position of the Ukrainian delegation which had stated its intention of setting up the Ukrainian Navy headquarters in Sevastopol had become a "stumbling block" at the talks. The Ukrainian delegation put forward a compromise proposal that both the Ukrainian Navy and the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters be in Sevastopol. The Black Sea Fleet headquarters would be in the Sevastopol Bay and the Ukrainian ones in the Karantinny Bay. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told INTERFAX after the first round of talks that the parties had made known their positions on the separate location of the two headquarters and on their proposals on division of the fleet ships. Grachev pointed out that the proposal that the Ukrainian Navy and the Russian Black Sea Fleet be based in Sevastopol had not as yet been discussed. Experts participating in the negotiations emphasized that the proposals of the Ukrainian party contradicted the agreement on the gradual settlement of the Black Sea Fleet issues signed by the Russian and the Ukrainian presidents in Moscow on 15 April. The document states that the Ukrainian Navy and the Russian Black Sea Fleet will be based separately. An INTERFAX correspondent learned that the Russian-Ukrainian talks were continuing at the level of experts in the afternoon. The two full military delegations are expected to renew the talks on Friday morning. Russian Defense Minister Grachev and Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy will hold a press conference on the same day. INTERFAX learned from sources close to the Black Sea Fleet command that Ukrainian Defense Minister Radetskyy and Navy Commander Vladimir Beskorovainy had met before the talks in Sevastopol and had discussed the issue with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. The Ukrainian position had been worked out at the meeting stating that Ukraine must receive 26 warships and 160 support vessels of the Black Sea Fleet. The total number of the Black Sea Fleet warships and support vessels exceeds 300. However, the Ukrainian delegation did not confirm this information to INTERFAX.
