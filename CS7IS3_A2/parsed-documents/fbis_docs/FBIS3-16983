Armenian authorities which have control over Nagorno-Karabakh said that the plane crashed to into mountains due to thick fog. Thirty two people with 9 children among them died. Iran's Embassy in Moscow reports that the crew of the plane included families of Iran's diplomats. The press service of the Azerbaijan Defense Ministry told TURAN that on March 17 at 23.00 p.m. Iran's transport plane entered Azerbaijan's air space from Georgia and then had to depart from it in the direction of Armenia after a few minutes. The pilot lost the course. Though Azeri control services tried to resume connection with the pilot they couldn't. Soon the plane was over Karabakh to the west of international air space. Azeri radar installations followed the flight of Iran's plane until 23.30 at which point they lost sight of it. At that time the plane was near Khankendi (Stepanakert). Military experts say that the plane immediately disappeared from the radars' screen which proves that the plane was shot down. However, in order to draw a final conclusion we have to investigate the wreckage of the plane. But will Armenian authorities allow the experts including from the international community to visit the site of the wreck? Sources in the President's staff and the Azerbaijan Defense Ministry opposed Armenian authorities' version. They say that the weather was fine and the plane flew at average height. They report that Iran's plane turned to find the right course when was shot down by Armenian forces which mistook it for an Azeri plane. The Ministry for National Security of Azerbaijan confirm this version. Yesterday the Azeri Ministry reported that it has a tape- recording between Khankendi (Stepanakert) and Yerevan proving that the Azeri plane was shot down at night on March 18. The leader of the press service of the Ministry of National Security said that Azerbaijan is ready to present the tape-recording to any party concerned.
