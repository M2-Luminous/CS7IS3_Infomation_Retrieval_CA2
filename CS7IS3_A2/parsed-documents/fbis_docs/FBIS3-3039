[Correspondent] I am a XINHUA correspondent. In his government work report, Premier Li Peng stated the need to speed up cultivating and developing a market structure. Governor Wan, what will Zhejiang, a major province engaging in building a market structure, do in this regard? [Wan] Zhejiang already has more than 4,000 commodity markets of all descriptions. The volume of transactions reached 65.1 billion yuan in 1993. The net amount of money that Zhejiang recovered from its markets ranked first in eastern China. Some of these 4,000 or so markets are super-large in size. Of the nation's 600 markets with transactions exceeding 100 million yuan per year, Zhejiang has 107. The establishment of these markets has expedited the province's economic development. This year, we will continue to improve all kinds of services, establish all forms of markets of essential goods and services -- especially the financial, technology, labor, and real estate markets -- so that our markets will become more efficient. We will also establish and improve market management, establish norms governing market behaviors, tighten the supervision over product quality, and device efficient mechanisms governing prices. Centering around the several major reform projects to be launched in the country, we will also improve our macroeconomic regulation and control, and deepen enterprise reform. Meanwhile, we will also establish a good social security system and the necessary supporting measures to make sure that Zhejiang's market economic development will be even more successful. [Correspondent] I learned from the information you released that, in 1993, Zhejiang's gross domestic product [GDP] increased 25 percent, and your investment in fixed assets increased 66.2 percent. Now, the central government has called for a slower economic growth, do you have the ability to slow down the high economic growth? How much do you think the GDP will be this year? [Wan] Zhejiang's GDP increased 25 percent and our investment in fixed assets increased 66 percent in 1993. The growth was indeed quite high. Such a high growth was achieved when energy supply and transportation and communications facilities were very tight; but the high growth also gave rise to price increases. Therefore, we fully feel the correctness of the call made by the party Central Committee and the State Council to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control and pay special attention to the quality of economic growth. This year, we are ready to earnestly follow the central authorities' call and move forward to establish a socialist market economic system by carrying out several major reform projects, such as those of restructuring the financial, taxation, banking, and investment systems. The developments over the past decade or so show that Zhejiang's annual GDP growth increased 13 percent on the average. The [GDP] growth in the past three year was 20 percent annually. We plan to control the growth -- especially the growth of investment in fixed assets -- through intensifying macroeconomic regulation and control. People in all quarters in Zhejiang must realize the need not to set up any more low-standard construction projects [di sui ping de jian she], but to give priority to improving the quality of economic growth [ti gao jing ji zeng zhang zi liang] through counting on science and technology and improving workers' proficiency. We will pay special attention to market research and to enterprises' efficiency. This is because the industrial output of Zhejiang's village and town enterprises accounts for 65 percent of our province's total industrial output, and market information is very important for these enterprises. When market prospects are good, they will expand their production; but when there is a recession, they will readjust their production or produce other products. Their adaptability to market changes is quite good. We do not worry about how fast our growth may be, but in light of Zhejiang's economic growth in recent years, we think Zhejiang's economic growth will be about 3 percentage points [bai fen dian] higher than the national average. We underscore growth which yields returns. [Correspondent] I am a RENMIN RIBAO correspondent. I want to ask the Ningbo mayor a question. Ningbo is a major open city. What new measures has Ningbo taken to open itself to the outside world and bring in more foreign capital? [Xu Yunhong] We should say that Ningbo has achieved significant successes in opening itself to the outside world. Ningbo's development has been quite fast over the past couple of years. Ningbo's total imports and exports reached $1.7 billion in 1993. That was a growth of 69.4 percent. In 1993 alone, Ningbo approved 1,015 foreign-funded enterprises, which was an increase of nearly 60 percent; and the amount of foreign capital actually invested in Ningbo reached $370 million, a growth of nearly 150 percent. However, I think we should also realize that Ningbo still lags behind other coastal cities in opening up to the outside world. In future, we plan to work hard in the following respects: First, we will speed up building Ningbo's infrastructure. I think that only by doing so can Ningbo give scope to its opening up potential. We must speed up building the additional railway linking Ningbo and Hangzhou so that ports in Ningbo can link up with the Hangzhou-Nanchang railway and other main railways linking north and south China. Our second project is to build an economic development zone and a bonded zone and develop (Dashou) Island -- projects approved by the State Council. The total area of these two zones and the island will reach 60 square kilometers, an unusually large developmental project in the country. The third project we will carry out is to improve the foreign-funded enterprises already in Ningbo. When we people in Ningbo, 5 million in all, make concerted efforts in building up Ningbo, we will live up to our forefathers' expectations. [Correspondent] I am from ZHONGGUO HAIYANG BAO. Zhejiang has come up with the slogan of revitalizing Zhejiang through developing its sea. Governor Wan, do you have any specific plans and measures for this project? Also, what problems does Zhejiang still face with regard to maritime development and management? [Wan] One of Zhejiang's strengths lies in its seacoast. Zhejiang has a 2,200 km-long coast and 3,050 islands. What we are particularly proud of is that we have many deep-water ports, such as Ningbo, Zhoushan, Zapu, Taizhou, and Wenzhou. In terms of tourism, the well-known Mount Putuo is a popular sightseeing spot. Moreover, Zhejiang and Shanghai have plans to jointly develop the Shengxi Islands and turn them into a vacationing resort on the sea. In recent years, the construction of large thermopower and nuclear power plants by taking advantage of Zhejiang's deep-water ports has become very well-known, even in the world. The Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant has been operating normally over the past year. Along the coast, there are a dozen or so places suitable for the construction of thermopower plants with generating capacity greater than 2.4 million kw. We are confident that, by early next century, eastern Zhejiang will become the power base of eastern China. With regard to oil development, you all know that, since 1 January this year, 17 transnational oil companies have been prospecting oil, including seabed drilling and physical studies of the earth, within a 54,000 square km-zone in the sea 150 km east of Wenzhou. So people in Zhejiang are very upbeat about their sea. We can say that while Zhejiang's land size is quite small, we are a major maritime province. Zhejiang's future lies in the sea. [Correspondent] I am a correspondent from the China Central Television. I want to ask Governor Wan a question. Zhejiang is a province in which village and town enterprises are developing quite rapidly. What impact financial and taxation reforms promoted by the state this year will have on Zhejiang's economy, especially the development of Zhejiang's village and town enterprises? [Wan] Village and town enterprises are confronting many new challenges during the course of reform today. This is because state enterprises, through replacing operating mechanisms, will operate with greater vitality. The development of independent and private businesses, and also the changes in the market, are also challenges to village and town enterprises. Owing to their outmoded equipment and inadequate technology, the prospects for some village and town enterprises are also quite grim. In recent years, the provincial government has drawn up policies for cutting the taxes of these enterprises in an effort to support their development. These policies will be rescinded after the new tax system has been implemented, and some village and town enterprises may have to pay more taxes. But we must also see that village and town enterprises have developed flexible mechanisms governing their autonomy, profits and losses, capital accumulation, and development. The motivating force and pressure caused by the reform and the pressure caused by market changes will very likely prompt village and town enterprises to restructure their organization, industrial production, and product mix. So these enterprises will have problems as well as opportunities. But we think they will face more opportunities and hopes than problems. [Correspondent] I am a correspondent from GUANGMING RIBAO. My question is addressed to Hangzhou Mayor Wang Youming: A top priority of the ongoing reform is to transform the operational mechanism of state-owned enterprises and improve their economic efficiency. What is the current status in terms of economic efficiency of Hangzhou's state-owned enterprises? What measures have you taken to improve their economic efficiency. [Wang] Hangzhou has 6,000 state-owned enterprises. Their economic efficiency is quite satisfactory. The 1993 state-owned enterprises' output value rose 13 percent over 1992; sale volume rose 16 percent; and tax receipts and profits submitted to the state rose 23 percent. All 6,000 enterprises are operating normally. [Correspondent] I am a correspondent from JINGJI RIBAO. Zhejiang and Wenzhou have always been models of economic development in China. In a place like Wenzhou with a relatively developed market economy, how does the city government administer its economy and promote the development of enterprises. [Chen Wenxian] In the early stages of development, the city government adopted the policy of greater latitude first and guidance later, greater freedom first and restrictions later, circulation ahead of transportation, and prosperity ahead of (?city appearance). This policy of reform and enlivening the economy has the characteristics of active noninterference. As we have completed [word indistinct] accumulation of the initial stages, we will try to turn Wenzhou's economy from one noted for its lack of order to one that is standard, well-ordered, and regulated by law. We will be shifting from growth in volume to improvement in quality. We will introduce a smooth-functioning and closely integrated market economic structure in which the property rights are clearly defined and the mechanisms are flexible. We will promote changes in two areas: operational mechanism of enterprises and the functions of government departments. We will pay close attention to three key points: the development of a modern enterprise system, the development of a market system, and macroeconomic administration of the government. Wenzhou's economy will experience fast economic growth with high economic efficiency. [Moderator] That is the end of the news conference.
