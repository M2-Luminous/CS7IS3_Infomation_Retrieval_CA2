New Date for it Not Defined Yet"] [Text] The meeting scheduled for 25 January in Moscow between the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan and mediated by the Russian president did not take place. According to V. Kazimirov, special representative of the Russian Federation president and head of the Russian peacemaking mission for the settlement of the Karabakh conflict, new dates for the meeting have not been defined yet. The Russian diplomat thinks that "meetings at such a level should be prepared in the most thorough way" and "unless preparations that would ensure a certain success of the summit are complete, it is premature to speak about concrete dates." Until then, the mediators continue their efforts, the sides voice new proposals on resolving the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. Rakhman Mustafazade, an official in the Azerbaijan president's staff, has named the main principles of Baku's approach to this problem. First, the withdrawal of Armenian troops from the occupied territories and the creation of guarantees for the safe living of the Armenian and Azeri population of Nagorno-Karabakh. Second, the repealing by Yerevan of all illegal constitutional acts and documents that describe Nagorno-Karabakh as belonging to Armenia. Third, the preservation of the cultural appearance of the occupied territories of Azerbaijan, i.e., the renouncing by Yerevan of the policy of destruction of monuments of history and culture of the Azerbaijan people in Karabakh. In Mustafazade's view, the Yerevan officials' dragging out of the peace process within the CSCE framework promotes the actual legalization of Armenia's territorial claims. To all appearances, Azerbaijan will hardly talk at all, having bet on a military solution to the question. The Azeri Army is strong enough today. Besides, Baku feels a weakening of the Armenian Army that began after a series of major defeats. Armenian generals, too, admit this weakening. On the radio 24 January, Major General Arkadiy Ter-Tadevosyan, a directorate chief of Armenia's Defense Ministry, stated that "Today the country is in no position to deliver an appreciable retaliatory strike at Azerbaijan, which has been in recent days increasingly encroaching on Armenia's borders."
