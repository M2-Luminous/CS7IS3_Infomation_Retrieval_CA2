It is one of three extreme right-wing parties that have been created since communist dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu was toppled and executed in December 1989. Party president Radu Sorescu told AFP: "Anti-semitism is old hat, these days we must fight against immigrants and gypsies." Sorescu, a 30-year-old former teacher of the Romanian language, told AFP he had spent two years ensconced in a library to bring his party's doctrine to fruition. Romanian President Ion Iliescu last July asked the state prosecutor to check on the legality of the NPR and two other parties, the Movement for Romania and the Fatherland Party, worried at the spread of apologists for fascism. The prosecutor ruled in November that the parties were law-abiding, a declaration immediately contradicted by a newspaper that got hold of the NPR's internal constitution. That document stipulated that members had to be of Romanian origin, would wear the brown uniform of the Nazi army the Sturmabteilung (SA) and could win the Nazi Iron Cross for exceptional service. Despite provision for a Hitler salute in the constitution, Sorescu said his supporters never gave such a salute. But he did not deny the similarities between his dogma and that of the Iron Guard, the pro-Nazi Romanian movement which was active in the 1930s. He maintains that he has retained only its "good points", citing nationalism and discipline, and denounces the "mistakes" the Iron Guard made before it was banned in 1941, like assassinating opponents and deporting Jews and gypsies. "Many people share our views, but are afraid to express them openly," he said, comparing the position of the NPR with that of French ultra-nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front. "Everybody called him a fascist, until the government started adopting the same stance on foreigners," he said. The party's quarterly THE NEW RIGHT has a print-run of 5,000, and it is snapped up like hot cakes. Its pages are brimful of attacks on democracy -- "a utopia turned to anarchy" -- and of threats against gypsies, who are blamed for rising crime. One of the latest editions had an interview with Le Pen, who said that France could no longer be a haven for foreigners. "Ninety percent of Romanians hate gypsies," Sorescu said by way of explanation for the magazine's success. The NPR claims it is non-violent, but envisages legal moves against those it judges to be incapable of integration, and recommends sterilising gypsy women and creating "reserves" for the "most recalcitrant" members of that minority. According to the human rights organisation Peoples in Peril, based at Goettingen in Germany, there have been more than 20 serious attacks on gypsies since the fall of Ceaucescu. The last was on September 20, when two gypsies were lynched and a third was burnt alive in his shack at Hadareni, 400 kilometres north of here, by a mob out to avenge a Romanian stabbed to death by a gypsy. Still in its embryonic stage, the Romanian right garnered less than 0.2 percent of the vote at the last general election in September 1992. But Sorescu is confident his party will score much higher the next time round.
