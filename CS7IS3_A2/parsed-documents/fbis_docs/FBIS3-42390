Vasilyev] [Text] The idea of creating a European defense system first emerged in the late 1940's. The first step toward making it a reality was the formation of the Western Union in 1948, which included France, Great Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Later, after Italy and West Germany were accepted into this military-political organization, it was renamed the Western European Union [WEU].[.sup]1[/] However, the disagreements between France and Great Britain that had emerged already at that time, the main one being the growth of power of the NATO bloc created in 1949, for more than 30 years relegated the WEU to the background in resolving issues of the collective security of West European countries. In the 1980's, they again turned to the idea of creating a so-called "Eurodefense" in Western Europe. The initiators of this were France and the FRG, playing a leading role in building a "unified Europe." A most important practical step toward creating a "European defense" system was the WEU council's adoption of a document in October 1987 at The Hague that was given the name "The Platform of Interests of European Security." It defined the goals, tasks, and basic directions of military organizational development in Europe. In accordance with the document, a "Eurodefense" system was to be built taking into account the following basic principles: Keeping an American military presence in Western Europe, including a nuclear presence; maintaining the powerful armed forces of West European states at a level ensuring deterrence of any aggressor; improving the nuclear forces of France and Great Britain and maintaining them at an "impressive level." The document placed special emphasis on the fact that the Western European Union is assigned the role of a "European mainstay" of NATO. Thus, the planned "European defense" system was to be created in close coordination with the North Atlantic alliance and help to strengthen its military positions. The process of West European integration in the military area was stepped up noticeably in the early 1990's. This was largely helped by the signing of a treaty in Maastricht in late 1991 by leaders of countries of the European Community (previously the EEC or Common Market) on plans for creating the European Union, the component elements of which, as is expected, will be military-political and currency-economic alliances. The main function of the new organization is to be to work out a unified foreign policy course of the states of Western Europe, including questions of defense and security. A leading role in carrying out these tasks is allotted to the WEU--the only purely European organization today possessing powers in the area of defense. In recent years, as the integration process in Western Europe developed, the WEU's role grew noticeably, and the number of its members increased. Spain and Portugal joined in 1988, and Greece joined at the WEU council session held in Rome in October 1992. Turkey, Norway, and Iceland were accepted as associate members, and Denmark and Ireland as observers. Thus, the WEU today unites all European NATO countries and all member-states of the European Community. In the assessment of western experts, the necessary conditions are thereby created for the Western European Union to fulfill the role both of a "European mainstay" of NATO and the military nucleus of the future European Union. The question of forming military structures within the WEU framework is now actively being studied. Thus, at the WEU council session in Bonn in July 1992, the decision was made to create its standing armed forces. Participants in the forum expressed a readiness to place at the disposal of the WEU troop contingents for accomplishing such missions as joint defense, supporting actions for humanitarian assistance, and settling crises, including measures to restore peace. It was proposed to man WEU forces through multinational formations, units, and subunits of the member-states' armed forces. In addition, it was decided that troop contingents from the NATO allied armed forces could be transferred to the command of the Western European Union to carry out special combat missions. Today, France and the FRG play a leading role in formation of the WEU armed forces. Already in May 1992, the decision was made at the Franco-German summit to create by 1995, on the basis of a Franco-Germany brigade, a joint army corps of up to 40,000 servicemen. Its basis is to be France's 1st Armored Division and Germany's 10th Tank Division. It is planned to deploy the headquarters of the "Eurocorps" already in October 1993 in the city of Strasbourg, France. It will number about 300 operational and technical staff. A number of WEU partners of Paris and Bonn, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Spain in particular, expressed the intention to assign their own troop contingents to this corps. Later on it is planned to create on its basis European "rapid deployment forces," which will have air and naval components in their composition. Formation of military command and control bodies of the Western European Union has begun. A military planning group has been functioning since October 1992. It has been decided to conduct meetings of the chiefs of general staffs on a regular basis. It is also planned to form a transport air command. In addition, it is planned to form within the WEU framework a so-called "West European arms group." In this regard, they are considering the question of including as part of the Western European Union the Independent European Programming Group [IEPG][.sup]2[/] by the end of 1993 and transferring its secretariat from Lisbon to Brussels, which, it is believed, will help create a unified arms market in Europe. Possibly, the NATO Eurogroup, which includes the ministers of defense of the bloc's European member-states, will also be integrated into the WEU in the near future, together with its sub-groups involved in matters of cooperation in the area of military telecommunications, logistic support, and long-term planning. A space reconnaissance center of the Western European Union has begun operating at Torrejon Air Base, Spain. It is planned to be used to gather intelligence information and monitor fulfillment of disarmament treaties and observation of crisis areas in Europe. Today the center has only one-third the necessary equipment. About 50 specialists and analysts from various WEU countries are working here today. They are tasked with monitoring observance of the embargo declared against Serbia and Chernogoria. On the whole, in the opinion of WEU leadership, the beginning of the center's functioning is an important stage in resolving the issue of deployment of an autonomous European space reconnaissance system. At the initiative of Paris, the question of creating nuclear forces of Europe based on French and British arms and developing a general nuclear strategy has been placed on the agenda. On the whole, this idea received approval of the WEU leadership, whose experts began a comprehensive study of the possibility of its implementation. Thus, in 1992, the WEU's Institute of Security Problems conducted research to draw up general recommendations on a European nuclear policy. Some of the results of this research was reflected in the work "European Integration and Nuclear Deterrence After the Cold War." In particular, it concludes it is necessary to safeguard the defense and security of WEU countries not possessing nuclear weapons by means of the "nuclear umbrella" of Great Britain and France and thus creating an "intra-European expanded system of nuclear deterrence." Experts proposed two variants of such a system. One of them called for creating a classic system of nuclear deterrence based on three components: A nuclear strategy, a structure of European nuclear forces, and a system of command and control of them. Implementation of this variant assumes the development of a WEU nuclear strategy, creation of a unified body for consultations on employment of nuclear forces and a nuclear planning group, and deployment of French and British nuclear arms on the territory of certain nonnuclear WEU states. The second project differs from the first primarily by the fact that it does not call for stationing British and French nuclear forces on the territory of other WEU countries. In the opinion of the French leadership, a European nuclear strategy could be prepared by 1995 based on the corresponding principles of the French military doctrine ("deterrence and intimidation"), taking into account changes in the military-political situation in Europe. At the same time, for the time being most West European countries have not officially expressed their attitude toward the idea advanced by Paris of creating nuclear forces of Europe. The British leadership, without completely rejecting it, so far is responding to it quite reservedly and regards its own potential, first of all, as national and not part of the European potential. A trend of an all-round drawing together of the Western European Union with NATO is developing. To improve coordination of actions between the two organizations, the WEU headquarters has been transferred from London to Brussels. A bilateral agreement has been signed providing for an exchange of information and conduct of meetings of the governing bodies. The first joint session of the NATO and WEU councils was held in May 1992. The decision made by Paris and Bonn on the possibility of transferring the Franco-German corps to the NATO command to accomplish missions for repelling aggression, should it be undertaken with respect to countries of the alliance, or to carry out peacekeeping actions (as a result, the corps was given the status of dual operational subordination) largely served this drawing together. This subordination of forces and assets of the Western European Union is becoming a characteristic trait of the interaction of the two military-political organizations. Thus, at the joint session of NATO and WEU councils held by the permanent representatives in Brussels on 8 June 1993, the decision was made to transfer to a single command the naval groupings of NATO and the WEU operating in the area of the Yugoslav conflict. Operational command and control of the joint grouping while conducting operations in support of the embargo in the Adriatic Sea has been entrusted to the commander of the NATO allied naval forces in the Southern European Theater of Military Operations. The question of dual subordination was also reflected in the May 1993 session of the Western European Union council in Rome, where they discussed problems associated with assigning special operations forces to the WEU to settle crises. The importance of this problem involved the need to increase the role of the WEU in preventing and settling conflict situations both in and outside of Europe. It has been proposed to include as part of the special operations forces a multinational airmobile division of NATO's "rapid deployment forces," created from troop contingents of Great Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and also a Anglo-Dutch marine brigade. In doing so, the participants of the meeting emphasized that the airmobile division and the marine brigade, like the "Eurocorps," should be given dual subordination status--NATO and WEU. It is quite obvious that the goal of all the measures is to give the Western European Union at this stage functions of a "bridge" between NATO and the European Community. At the same time, advocates of creating independent European military structures and pursuit of an independent course by Europe in the area of security and defense believe that the WEU's status as a connecting link between NATO and the European Community will be a temporary phenomenon. In the future, they allot it the role of the military nucleus of the planned European Union. In doing so, in their opinion, the new European military-political organization will have complete operational freedom, which will enable it to act, if necessary, independently of NATO. However, such an approach to creating a "Eurodefense" evokes an unequivocal reaction in NATO. The U.S. administration and the leadership of the North Atlantic Alliance express a negative attitude toward plans of creating independent European structures. They see this as an aspiration to decrease substantially the influence of the United States in Europe and its role in NATO, which in the end can lead, in the American leadership's assessment, to the disintegration of the alliance. Today, work continues on the optimal model of the future "European defense" system that takes into account the real military-political conditions and eliminates the ambiguity that today characterizes the relations between NATO and the WEU. Thus, the process of creating a "European defense" system at the current stage is beginning to enter the stage of practical decisions, which indicates the serious intention of the leadership of West European countries to achieve greater independence from the United States in forming and pursuing a military-political course. It is becoming obvious that the bases of the "Eurodefense" system will be formed primarily around the WEU, which is gradually turning into the base military-political structure for uniting Europe.
