Korea" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today condemns the surveillance on campus by the Kim Yong-sam regime styling itself a civilian "government." The analyst says: Recently, a democratic "national assemblyman" exposed at "the Home Affairs Committee of the National Assembly" the fact that "secret houses" for intelligence surveillance had been installed and operated around main universities and colleges throughout South Korea under the disguise of dwelling houses, tong offices, stores, etc. Even after the "civilian" regime made its appearance. The surveillance on campus has been made in nasty ways such as watch from the "secret houses," the grasping of students' movement through agents of special intelligence rings planted at campus, watch and wire-tapping. While talking about "civilian administration," "respect for human rights" and "halt to intelligence surveillance," the Kim Yong-sam group is still resorting to surveillance on campus. This indicates that they are a group of fascist dictators little different from former rulers. Surveillance on campus, intelligence surveillance, is a product of the crisis of rule. The Kim Yong-sam group must know clearly that though it is trying to save the crisis of its rule at the point of the bayonet, relying on surveillance on campus, intelligence surveillance, it will result only in precipitating its destruction.
