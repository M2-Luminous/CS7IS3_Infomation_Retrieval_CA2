Rodriguez opens the debate by stating that he has received many letters on today's issue, some in favor, some against, and others urging further explanation. Recio states that it is not strange to see disagreements on differentiated incentives or material incentives given for production work. He adds that the people have an "egalitarian point of view" and that this is inadequate. Everyone agrees, however, that the appropriate distribution formula for the Cuban economy is the socialist formula: "Pay each person according to the quantity and quality of his work." He goes on to say that everyone agrees with this but that it is hard to put into practice. Recio adds: "The problem is when it affects someone who is not included among those that contribute the most in quantity and quality of work." Recio adds that Cuba had not been able to fully apply a labor-incentive formula. He adds: "The situation now calls for a policy of incentives by sectors and individuals. There are other sectors that do not produce, materialistically speaking, but are important, such as the education and health sectors." Rodriguez states that Cuban society fairly distributes all that there is to distribute but that, unfortunately, this cannot be transferred to the production sector. He adds that some of the letters received mention extraordinary efforts, but do not mention results. Recio states that Raul Castro has stressed that efforts must be encouraged but only results must be rewarded. He adds: "There is a certain mind-set in Cuba that praises the man that exhausts himself in the effort, is seen uncombed, tired, and is turned into a hero. In a certain sense, heroism requires that exhausting effort, but that is not always synonymous with efficiency." Recio goes on to say that production must precede distribution and that what little there is is being distributed with egalitarian criteria. The prioritized sectors -- tourism, sugar, petroleum, transport, mining, and others -- are to be the engines of the Cuban economy and the ones that ought to receive incentives. Rodriguez points out that sectors involved in garnering currency could be considered prioritized sectors and that he believes that these incentives are not being utilized correctly. He adds: "I am thinking, for example, of those chain stores called shoppings. Some of the stores distribute equally among their workers what has come to be called a bag, which is no more than a monthly stock of products which are hard to come by in Cuba. This is distributed equally among the workers." Rodriguez points out the example of the incentive programs implemented in the electric sector, where workers are rewarded for meeting certain standards. He stresses that egalitarian distribution of incentives "is once again dragging us back to the same situation we are trying to fight." Recio states that to give all workers the same incentive is no incentive. He adds: "I believe incentives must be given within a sector, within a sector to a specific branch, within a branch to a specific enterprise, within certain enterprise to a specific factory, and within a factory to specific workers. I insist on the idea that the same incentive cannot be given to an indirect worker than to a worker involved directly with production." Rodriguez closes by stressing the importance of differentiated incentives to specific workers.
