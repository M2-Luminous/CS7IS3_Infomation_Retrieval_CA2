FR941116-0-00103 FR941116-0-00020 There are 11 trees, 4 reproductively mature adults and 7 subadults, remaining in the natural population. Only 2 of the 11 trees occur on publicly protected land. The nine trees on private lands remain susceptible to adverse habitat modification or to vandalism. However, these threats have been greatly diminished through efforts to achieve landowner cooperation and public awareness together with the widespread distribution of artificially propagated seedlings to the public. The optimum habitat requirements of this species apparently are very similar to these of sweet birch. Therefore, most of the 20 introduced populations were planted in areas where sweet birch was abundant and could be expected to regenerate well. Additionally, the 20 established populations were planted on U.S. Forest Service lands; thus protecting these individuals from take. Further, their habitats are protected from adverse modification and may be managed specifically to enhance the species' survival. As part of the U.S. Forest Service's land management activities, competing vegetation is periodically removed from the base of the established trees. Because birches, in general, are known to be sensitive to elevated temperatures and reduced moisture (T.L. Sharik, Michigan Technological University, pers. comm., 1992), care is taken while raking around the trees to avoid removal of too much organic matter and exposure of the roots (C. Thomas, U.S. Forest Service, pers. comm., 1992). On Forest Service land, a bank stabilization project located near the fenced enclosure of the largest Betula uber specimen at the Mt. Rogers Viewing Area was completed in the summer of 1992. This project, which was designed to hold excessive runoff in the existing stream channel in order to prevent flooding or erosion of birch habitat, has apparently achieved its aims without causing any unintended deleterious effects on the birch population. B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes To date, the historical loss of 10 of the original 41 individuals in the population discovered in 1975 (Sharik et al. 1990) can be attributed to transplanting of individual trees on the privately-owned tracts and to vandalism. Collection accounts for an additional loss of 30 seedlings in 1981 from the private land portion of the natural regeneration study area (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990, Sharik et al. 1990). Beginning in 1988, in an attempt to reduce collection pressure, and to protect from loss of genetic diversity due to illegal collecting, seedlings were produced from controlled crosses at a breeding orchard located at the Reynolds Homestead Research Center in Critz, Virginia. The orchard is maintained by periodic mowing, weeding, inspection, and treatment for insects and diseases. The majority of the seedlings are in good to excellent condition. Beginning in 1988, public arboreta, botanical gardens, nurseries, and other interested parties were informed of the availability of round-leaf birch seedlings produced from the breeding orchard, and many requests were filled, subject to the condition that the plants or their offspring were not to be sold. In addition to increasing the number and geographical distribution of round-leaf birches in cultivation, making the plants available to the public was viewed as a way of possibly reducing vandalism to the natural population by changing the public's perception of the tree as rare. While vandalism and collection remain concerns, the distribution of seedlings, along with public awareness efforts such as the interpretive activities at the Mt. Rogers National Recreation Area, and coordination with persons and agencies in the area whose activities could affect the species, have shown at least some indirect success in alleviating these problems. It was noted at the 1992 meeting of the Betula uber Protection, Management and Research Coordinating Committee that no vandalism was reported during the previous year in the introduced populations for the first time in five years. C. Disease or Predation Betula uber is subject to a number of compromising factors, including diseases, insects, and herbivory. Additionally, white-tailed deer will rub saplings with their antlers, and this may nearly or completely girdle the main stem. While no serious problems with insect damage or disease have been observed in the natural population, three diseases were observed in the introduced populations during the 1989 growing season (C. Thomas, pers. comm., 1992), cankers, anthracnose, and a putative foliar virus. In 1991, the highest mortality rate of trees with basal cankers occurred in those trees located on poor or exposed sites or those which showed symptoms of die-back during the year. Plots were sprayed with pesticides between May and August 1991 to control fungal pathogens and insects that may be transmitting these fungi or creating wounds through which the fungal canker pathogens can enter. Damage to round-leaf birch leaves has also been incurred from Japanese beetles. During 1992, considerable mortality of Betula uber was attributed to deer rubs. Browsing by deer and rabbit was evident in several of the established populations. While browsing may not cause direct mortality due to the capacity of Betula uber to resprout, it may decrease the birch's ability to compete with other plants, resulting in the demise of the tree. Wire cages, which were placed around the smaller trees to prevent further loss from browsing, may have been prematurely removed from some of the birch trees in June 1991. Further fencing is needed for protection. Additionally, approximately ten were found to be leaning. The cause is unknown, but the trees were staked in an attempt to stabilize them. The maintenance activities described above will continue as part of the recovery program following reclassification of Betula uber to threatened.
