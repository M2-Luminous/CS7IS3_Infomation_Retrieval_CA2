FR940119-0-00033 FR940119-0-00008 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [OR&hyph;32&hyph;1&hyph;5935; FRL&hyph;4824&hyph;4] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Oregon AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a revision to the Oregon State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the attainment of National Ambient Air Quality Standards for carbon monoxide in the Portland and Medford-Ashland nonattainment areas. This revision provides for the adoption and implementation of a vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M) program meeting all requirements of EPA regulations, published in the Federal Register on November 5, 1992, concerning vehicle I/M programs. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action will become effective on March 21, 1994, unless notice is received by February 18, 1994, that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: Montel Livingston, SIP Manager, Air and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;082), United States Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 6th Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98101. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at: Air and Radiation Branch (Docket #OR32&hyph;1&hyph;5935), United States Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Sixth Avenue (AT&hyph;082), Seattle, Washington 98101, and Department of Environmental Quality, Vehicle Inspection Program, 1301 SE., Morrison Street, Portland, Oregon 97214. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Christi Lee, Air and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;082), United States Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Sixth Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98101, (206) 553&hyph;1814. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Clean Air Act Requirements The Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA or Act) requires states to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement new ones. Carbon monoxide (CO) areas with moderate area designation are required to implement the vehicle inspection and maintenance program described in section 182(a)(2)(B). EPA was also directed to publish updated guidance for state I/M programs, taking into consideration findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. All areas required by the Act to have an I/M program were to incorporate this guidance into the SIP. CO nonattainment areas with design classifications of 12.7 ppm and below were required to meet EPA guidance for ``basic'' I/M programs. These areas were required to submit a SIP revision to incorporate a basic I/M program by November 15, 1992. In Oregon a basic I/M program is required in the following urbanized areas: Portland and Medford-Ashland Oregon. Basis for Approval EPA believes an approval of the committal SIP is appropriate in this case because the state could not be expected to begin developing an I/M program meeting the requirements of the Act and the I/M regulation until the I/M regulation was adopted as a final rule, which occurred on November 5, 1992. EPA does believe that states can adopt revised I/M program plans within one year of EPA's final rule. Oregon submitted an I/M SIP on November 15, 1993 which contains all of the elements in the implementation schedule, including authorizing legislation and implementing regulations. The 1993 submittal also included an analysis of the program using the most current EPA mobile source emission model demonstrating that the program meets the applicable performance standard, among other features. I/M Regulation Requirements Requirements for I/M programs were published in the Federal Register on November 5, 1992, under subpart S, part 51, title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (I/M Regulation). The I/M Regulation required each state that must implement an I/M program to submit by November 15, 1992, a SIP revision including two elements, a commitment from the Governor or his designee to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting all requirements of the I/M regulation, and a schedule of implementation. State Submittals Oregon submitted a committal SIP to EPA on May 14, 1993. A public hearing on this submittal was held by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) on April 20, 1993. EPA deemed the committal SIP complete on May 14, 1993. The submittal includes a commitment to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting all requirements of the I/M regulation and the Act, and a schedule of implementation. Statement of Approvability Under the authority of the Governor's designee, the state of Oregon's DEQ submitted a SIP revision to satisfy the requirements of the I/M regulation to the EPA on May 14, 1993. The Agency has reviewed this submittal and is approving it under section 110(k)(4). Regulatory Process Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and entities with jurisdiction over populations less than 50,000. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any State Implementation Plan. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this revision will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (see 46 FR 8709). The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective March 21, 1994, unless, by February 18, 1994, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be received. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective March 21, 1994. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)) (see 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2)). SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.SE.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
