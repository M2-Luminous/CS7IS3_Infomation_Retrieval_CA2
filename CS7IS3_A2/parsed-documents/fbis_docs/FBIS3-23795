When our correspondent asked the president to comment on the Russian elections in the hallway of the parliament on 12 December she did not receive the expected comment, but gained a unique opportunity for an interview, which was surprising to the correspondent herself. [YERKIR] Mr President, what is your assessment of Armenia's socioeconomic and political condition? [Ter Petrosyan] There can be no unequivocal assessment. The only unequivocal assessment is that this is a transition period, with all of its contradictions and all the instructive elements in the process of building a state. The learning applies to the government as well as businessmen, the heads of state enterprises, our people, the banks and so forth. This is a serious issue. [YERKIR] How long may this process last? In your opinion, when can this transition period end? [Ter Petrosyan] In my opinion several decades are necessary. Of course, it is not necessary that we experience the same levels of tension and crisis as those we have now throughout those decades, but what is known as "transition," when it refers to a radical change from one system to another, must take 20, 30 or 40 years. This is the experience of all countries in the world. [YERKIR] And when can the process of decline be halted and when can stabilization begin? [Ter Petrosyan] It is hard to say. One can say that things can be worse than this. Things will be worse than this. [YERKIR] Can one conclude from your remarks that no plans are being made in that direction? [Ter Petrosyan] No, one cannot conclude that. Plans are made every day, every second. [YERKIR] Then what do you think is the cause of the current situation? Apart from objective causes, what subjective factors do you see at the root of this situation? Inadequacy of the government system or those who govern? [Ter Petrosyan] I can enumerate dozens of factors. First there is the inadequacy of the legislation. I consider that a subjective factor, because there are mechanisms to enact laws. Here both the government and the Supreme Council have their share of the blame. There is also a lack of professionalism in general. We are creating a state in new conditions. All of us are passing through a process of learning, and everyone has a right to err in that process. That is also subjective. The president takes decisions, the Supreme Council enacts laws. None of these can be turned into dogmas. These decisions and laws must be viewed as dynamic documents. We must be able to react to them very quickly and correct them as necessary. There is a certain sluggishness because of these subjective factors. [YERKIR] Do you observe any mistakes or oversights on your part? [Ter Petrosyan] As I said all these subjective factors are mistakes. [YERKIR] On your part. [Ter Petrosyan] I spoke about presidential decisions also. Why not? [YERKIR] In terms of working in the legislative domain? [Ter Petrosyan] Of course. There have been laws, for example, whose urgency I did not realize and which I submitted late when I could have done so sooner. In particular, the package of laws and decisions about privatization. I still think that we moved too slowly in that regard. [YERKIR] What serious deficiencies have you noticed in the government's work with regard to the socioeconomic situation--if any, that is? [Ter Petrosyan] It is impossible to say anything definite. I can attribute them to learning, inexperience and the current conditions of getting work done in new circumstances. [YERKIR] Do you not think that the relative instability of the domestic political situation is the result of the abnormal state of relations with the opposition? What steps do you envisage taking to strengthen those relations? [Ter Petrosyan] Is the present situation unstable? [YERKIR] Comparatively. In other words, it could be better than it is now. [Ter Petrosyan] It can always be better, but we must compare our situation with others. [YERKIR] In any event, what steps would you take to move closer to the opposition as a first step to improve the domestic political situation? [Ter Petrosyan] To move closer to the opposition? I have no demands from the opposition. I have no complaints about the opposition. The opposition is doing whatever it thinks is appropriate. That is why it is the opposition. The opposition decides on its own what its actions and policies will be. Let me say one thing: For me there is only one standard of appraisal, whether it is done by the opposition, the press or the government, or whether it is with regard to science or human relations: Objectivity. I have no other standards. [YERKIR] Can one conclude from what has been said that you think that relations with the opposition are very normal and that there is no need for the government and the opposition to communicate with or to come closer to each other? [Ter Petrosyan] I would like to emphasize one point further. When the press, the opposition or the government are striving to see and seek the truth then we have national harmony. If that happens they can always communicate with each other. But when that desire does not exist, one gets bargaining instead of harmony. Bargaining is not excluded in politics. We are not opposed to that either. Bargaining does not come about artificially but is created by life when real political forces are created. Real political forces have to reckon with each other, irrespective of whether they like or do not like each other. They are simply obligated to reckon with each other. [YERKIR] Do you foresee the creation of a coalition government as an alternative? [Ter Petrosyan] Life may mandate that. If life mandates it, we can have a coalition government, fresh elections or early elections. At this time life does not force us to do that. By life I mean political life. [YERKIR] When is the endorsement of a constitution expected? Are presidential elections envisaged after that? [Ter Petrosyan] I am the most interested person in the endorsement of a constitution as soon as possible, and I am not backing off from my terms. I have declared my position repeatedly and I stand on it: Immediately after the endorsement of a constitution there must be fresh presidential and parliamentary elections. [YERKIR] A few days ago, your press secretary, Mr Aram Abrahamyan, responding to a question about your address preceding the introduction of new currency, said that your sources passed erroneous information to you. What do you say about that? [Ter Petrosyan] Aram Abrahamyan gave the wrong answer. He was simply not careful, because the question itself contained certain untruths. I do not want to comment on what that question implied. You can examine the recording carefully. [YERKIR] I would like you to comment on the problem of the "brain drain" from Armenia and the state of the intelligentsia. [Ter Petrosyan] It is no secret that emigration is observed in such conditions. It is the war. [YERKIR] However, most of those emigrating are the scientific and technical intelligentsia. [Ter Petrosyan] I do not agree with that. You give me the numbers. What do you mean by majority? Whatever numbers you have, please show them to me. [YERKIR] I must concede that I do not have numbers at my disposal. [Ter Petrosyan] Then let me give you the numbers. It is true that these are not the latest figures; they are four months old. When there was much talk about the "brain drain" we commissioned the Academy of Sciences to supply us with official information. It was determined that 13 members of the Academy left in the last two years. I repeat, this was the situation four months ago. I am giving the numbers and I am responsible for them. [YERKIR] What steps are you taking to improve the social condition of the intelligentsia, in particular the scientific and technical intelligentsia? [Ter Petrosyan] I do not separate the condition of our intelligentsia from that of our people, that is, our entire population. [YERKIR] I mean, does the intelligentsia fall into the list of socially insecure classes for whom measures will be taken by your upcoming decree on indexation? [Ter Petrosyan] If you paid any attention, in the most recent decrees on indexation, we tried to put in place a differentiated approach with respect to people who work in science, education and health care. I agree with the principle that a differentiated approach should be taken on the indexation issue, and in the future we must try to deepen gradually the implementation of that principle. The intelligentsia is included in the groups targeted for indexation. What I am saying is not speculation. This has been put into practice in the latest decrees. [YERKIR] Thank you.
