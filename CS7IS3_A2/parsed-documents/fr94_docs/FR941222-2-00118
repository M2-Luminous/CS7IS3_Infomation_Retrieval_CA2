Action: Notice and request for comments. SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is requesting comments on its guidelines that permit national banks to appeal certain OCC decisions and actions. This Action is required by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The OCC intends to use the comments in evaluating whether changes to the proposed guidelines are appropriate. DATES: Comments must be received by January 23, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments may be submitted to Docket Number 94&hyph;23, Communications Division, Ninth Floor, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 250 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20219. Comments will be available for inspection and photocopying at that address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Heidi Thomas, Legislative Counsel, Legislative and Regulatory Activities Division, 202&hyph;874&hyph;5090, or P. Michael Yuenger, Office of the Chief National Bank Examiner, 202&hyph;874&hyph;5350, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 309(a) of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103&hyph;325 (12 U.S.C. 4806) (the Act), which was signed into law on September 23, 1994, requires the OCC, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Board (Federal banking agencies) and the National Credit Union Administration to establish an independent internal appellate process. This process must be available to review material supervisory determinations made at insured depository institutions or credit unions that the agency supervises. Section 309(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 4806(c)) requires that each Federal banking agency must provide public notice and opportunity for comment on its proposed guidelines for this appellate process by December 22, 1994, and establish this process by March 22, 1995. The Act defines ``independent appellate process'' in section 309(f)(2) (12 U.S.C. 4806(f)(2)) as a review by an agency official who does not directly or indirectly report to the agency official who made the material supervisory determination under review. In addition, this Act defines ``material supervisory determinations'' in section 309(f)(1) (12 U.S.C. 4806(f)(1)) to include determinations relating to (1) examination ratings, (2) the adequacy of loan loss reserve provisions, and (3) loan classifications on loans that are significant to an institution. This definition expressly excludes determinations to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution or a decision to take prompt corrective action pursuant to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) (12 U.S.C. 1831o). In addition, section 309(g) (12 U.S.C. 4806(g)) expressly provides that the Act's requirement to establish an appeals process does not affect the authority of the banking agencies to take enforcement or supervisory actions against an institution. Finally, section 309(b) (12 U.S.C. 4906(b)) of the Act requires that appeals be heard and decided expeditiously and that appropriate safeguards exist for protecting the appellant from retaliation by agency examiners. Existing OCC Appeals Process The OCC's existing procedures for national banks to appeal agency decisions and actions were published in Banking Circular No. 272, dated June 11, 1993. These procedures have been modified and clarified in the proposed guidelines to be consistent with the requirements of the Act. Until these guidelines are published in final form in the Federal Register , the current OCC appeals policy as set forth in Banking Circular No. 272 remains in effect. The OCC's appeals policy does not supersede any existing appeals procedures available under current law.
