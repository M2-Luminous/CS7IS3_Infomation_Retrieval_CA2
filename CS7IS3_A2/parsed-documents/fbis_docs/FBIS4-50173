The following is the essence of his speech. Lu Ping said: On 1 July 1997, the People's Liberation Army [PLA] will move into Hong Kong to be stationed there -- this is laid down by both the Joint Declaration and Basic Law. However, first, it will be small in size and symbolic. As Mr Deng Xiaoping said, it symbolizes our sovereignty. Second, the PLA will not interfere the internal affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] Government. It will merely be responsible for SAR defense affairs. Normal public order work, including border patrols, will be carried out by the Hong Kong SAR's own police force; the PLA has no duties in this area. This has been written into the Basic Law which stipulates that, in case of a disaster or under special circumstances, the PLA can assist in rescue operations or maintaining Hong Kong public order at the request of the SAR chief executive. However, this will only be under very special circumstances. As soon as these special and extraordinary circumstances disappear, Hong Kong will once again be under the rule of the SAR authorities. The PLA has strict provisions in its mandate. Moreover, the PLA will be directed to strictly observe the law of Hong Kong. If, for example, a PLA vehicle is involved in a traffic accident with a Hong Kong person, the whole thing will be handled according to the law of Hong Kong and the case will be tried by a Hong Kong judge. The PLA party will do whatever is required by Hong Kong law. There will be strict legal provisions on this and other related issues in the future. On the current state of Hong Kong real estate and the problem of the Hong Kong-U.S. dollar link, Lu Ping said: The problems with Hong Kong real estate are rather complicated. There are many causes of high property prices, one of which is inflation, though there are also many other factors behind it. For example, the fact that Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar. As we all know, the American economy has been performing very badly over the last few years and interest rates have had to be lowered, whereas Hong Kong's economy has been vibrant. But, because of the linkage, Hong Kong could only follow the United States and lower its interest rates. People find their bank deposits are suffering from negative interest rates when compared with inflation. To keep the real value of their money, people invest in stocks and the property market. Lu Ping thinks the current property situation in Hong Kong is highly abnormal. He said: Our view is that the property and land prices should be brought down. To do that we need to solve the problems from different angles. Increasing land supply is one way but not the only way. The problem of property prices cannot be solved by solely increasing land supply. Expanding public housing and the home ownership scheme is another way. The Hong Kong government is organizing manpower to study this problem. Our view is that current property prices are indeed too high and are affecting people's livelihood and Hong Kong's position as an international financial and trade center. If property prices continue to rise, the cost of investing in Hong Kong will become increasingly higher. Rent for offices in Central now is the highest in the world. This is not going to help Hong Kong. Why would foreign companies establish their Asia offices in Hong Kong when rent and wages there keep going up? It is better for them to move somewhere else. One very important factor contributing to Hong Kong's past success was its relatively low costs, wages, and prices. Whatever happens, Hong Kong must not lose this advantage. Only thus can it maintain its competitiveness. Lu Ping stated: The property market is now a key sector for Hong Kong. A very large number of listed companies are property developers and a very large proportion of bank loans are property-related. If the property market slumps, the stock and financial markets will be affected. So, we must handle this problem with great care and caution and adopt a step-by-step approach in cooling off the market. Moreover, we cannot depress the market too much but must keep a basic equilibrium and prevent the market from rising indefinitely. This is better for Hong Kong's economy. When asked how Hong Kong can now achieve a smooth transition given the present status between China and Britain, Lu Ping said: The position of the Chinese Government has been consistent: It hopes to secure Britain's cooperation in efforts to achieve a smooth transition for Hong Kong. This was, is, and will be our position. Unfortunately, Britain changed its policies toward Hong Kong and China. You all have read the report released earlier by the British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) which pointed out explicitly the fundamental change in Britain's policy toward China and Hong Kong since 1989, namely from the previous policy of cooperation with China into one of noncooperation or even confrontation. It can be said that there was very good cooperation between China and Britain following the signing of the Joint Declaration in 1984 and, in general, the two sides were able to iron out contradictions and differences through consultations. Some people dubbed this the honeymoon period for China and Britain. By 1989, however, things were different. By that time Britain had chosen to be very uncooperative with China. All in all, it is very unfortunate. Lu Ping said: Our position on the airport problem is the same -- it is very clear. The Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] was in place by then, and it was very clear. In principle, we do not want to leave the SAR government with any financial burdens and inputs should be kept low while returns must be high. Also, a minimum $25 billion must be in place for the SAR government to use as financial reserves and the debt to be taken over by the SAR government must not exceed 5 billion. We had thought that with the signing of the MOU, these problems were resolved. Go ahead and build the airport if you want to. We, the Chinese government, have made it clear that we support the construction of the new airport. So here we have a case of flying off at a tangent: The financial arrangements tabled by Britain would leave the SAR government with a debt far exceeding the 5 billion allowed in the MOU. Despite this, we were still willing to talk to Britain and we did not limit the debt to 5 billion either. It just cannot exceed the amount by too big a margin. We hope that we can first achieve some progress on the airport financial arrangements in the coming Airport Committee meeting so that there will be a new airport earlier rather than later. We would like to see Mr Chris Patten leave Hong Kong in 1997 via the Chek Lap Kok Airport on the Lantau Island and not from Kai Tak Airport. When asked if it was possible for him to meet Chris Patten, Lu Ping said: As I have said earlier, this calls for cooperation from both sides and a good atmosphere. Without a good atmosphere, there would not be any result even if the two of us sat down and talked for days on end. Very simple problems can become quite complicated if the atmosphere is not good; and very complicated problems, if the atmosphere is good, can become very simple and can be solved very quickly.
