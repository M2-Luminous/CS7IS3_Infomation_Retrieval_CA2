FR940413-0-00066 FR940413-0-00024 Benefit-Cost Analysis Current holders of flight instructor certificates may renew their certificates if they successfully complete an approved FIRC consisting of not less than 24 hours of ground or flight instruction, or both. The FAA has determined, however, that recent advances in instructional technology and training techniques allow for a reduction in the number of required instruction hours without compromising safety. The FAA will develop the standards and recommended number of hours required for an approved FIRC. This will be done to ensure that a high level of safety is maintained. The benefits of this rule are the cost savings from the reduction in required instructional hours and travel expenditures for the affected flight instructors. For example, approval of AOPA's 16 hour course would allow a 1 day reduction in travel expenses to individual flight instructors: assuming an average per diem cost of $100 and that two-thirds of the annual average of 20,000 flight instructors renewing their certificates through FIRCs would have to travel out of town, the industry could realize an annual savings of $1.3 million in per diem travel expenses. There also will be a reduction in foregone earnings. Assuming a flight instructor earns $20 per hour and provides 4 to 8 hours of instruction per day, the reduction in foregone earnings would be between $1.6 million and $3.2 million annually. In addition, the FAA believes that individual flight instructors will realize a savings in the cost of the FIRC by the reduction in the number of required instruction hours. There will be no incremental costs associated with this final rule since the number of instruction hours required in a FIRC would be relaxed. The FAA has concluded that there will be no degradation of safety as any reduction in instructional hours would be the result of advances in instructional technology and training techniques. The FAA believes that it is the content of the FIRC, not the specific number of hours of instruction in that FIRC, that is important to safety. Therefore, the FAA has concluded that the final rule is cost-beneficial. International Trade Impact Analysis This final rule will have a negligible impact on trade opportunities for U.S. firms doing business overseas or on foreign firms doing business in the U.S. The final rule primarily affects certificated flight instructors, not businesses involved in the sale of aviation products or services.
