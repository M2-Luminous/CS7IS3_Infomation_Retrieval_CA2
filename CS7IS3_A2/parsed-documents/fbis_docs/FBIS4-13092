He also categorically ruled out reduction in the national defence budget and added "We had a traditionally aggressive enemy on our borders which had exploded a nuclear device as far back as 20 years ago and was only increasing its defence budget". "How can we ignore this build up?, he asked. [no end quotes as published] He said that Pakistan would continue to strive for declaring our region as a nuclear-free zone.
