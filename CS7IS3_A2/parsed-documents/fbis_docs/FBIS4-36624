Khonsari, who earlier visited President Ilyas al-Hirawi, Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz, and some Islamic spiritual leaders, said after the meeting: "I conveyed to his excellency condolences for the martyrs who died in the latest savage Zionist aggression against Lebanon. We then discussed regional and international issues as well as bilateral relations which we agreed to enhance and strengthen with joint cooperation in all fields." He added: "We discussed developments in the region, especially the repeated attacks on Lebanon by the Zionist enemy. There was identity of views and we agreed that the Zionist enemy cannot influence the Lebanese policy with attacks, threats, and troublemaking, nor can it affect the Lebanese people's resistance which is fully supported by the Lebanese Government." He also said that "if anything, all the (Israeli) attacks and threats increase the people's and government's unity and solidarity against the Zionist enemy. We are with the resistance which is a legitimate right of the Lebanese people and which has the government's support." On the rumor that some Iranians were among the victims of the Israeli raid on a Hizballah position in 'Ayn Kawkab east of Ba'labakk, Khonsari said: "That is not the case at all. This is the first time we have heard such talk." Asked if he had any information about the Iranian diplomats who were kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982, he replied: "I have no information on that. We expect the Lebanese Government to explore the fate of these hostages as it deems fit, particularly as they were diplomats kidnapped on this territory. We have no accurate knowledge. The Iranian people, the Iranian Government, and the families of those brothers all always await positive news about them and the necessary measures to free them." On Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's assertion that the four kidnapped people are in Israel, Khonsari said that "one possibility is that they are alive and held prisoner by the Zionist enemy." He said that Iran is ready "for comprehensive cooperation in all fields desired by Lebanon." Meanwhile, a delegation from the International Political Studies Center attached to the Iranian Foreign Ministry headed by Khadem Haqiqat has visited the Lebanese University and discussed with its president, Dr. As'ad Diyab, the possibility of direct scientific dialogue between the people concerned. The delegation also visited the Arab Information Center. Elsewhere, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz said yesterday that the temporary truce between Lebanon and Israel does not mean that the latter will stop its aggressions against Lebanon. He added that "the Lebanese people's unity worries Israel and the latter has always tried to drive a wedge between the Lebanese state and the resistance but we will not fall into that trap." Editors' doyen Milhim Karam quoted him as saying that Iranian Envoy Khonsari's visit to Lebanon "has been useful and has somewhat contributed to the enhancement of trust between the state and the resistance. Iran is known to have good relations with the Lebanese resistance and that is why it has used that weight to effectively contribute to the consolidation of the Lebanese entity on foundations that cannot collapse." Buwayz believes that the United States "is not playing the role required of it as a mediator, conference sponsor, and effective element in the Madrid conference and the entire peace process. It is just being a postman but that is not its role. It should be playing an effective part." He expressed the hope that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher "would bring clear U.S. proposals." He said that he "did not agree with those calling for withdrawal from the negotiations because withdrawal would play into Israeli hands and we will not do it." He praised the work and effective presence of the Lebanese Army in the south, adding that "we are not stepping up the Army's presence for fear of an Israeli strike but the Army has been there for two years and that has moral, practical, and military significance."
