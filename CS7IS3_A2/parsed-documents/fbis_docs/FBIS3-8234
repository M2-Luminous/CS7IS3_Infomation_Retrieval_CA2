Our correspondent in Skopje Kostadin Filipov reports. [Begin Filipov recording] Dimitur Ikonomov conveyed to Mr. Gligorov a message from Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev, which was in response to a letter that the Macedonian head of state sent to Dr. Zhelev a week ago. In his message to the Macedonian president, Dr. Zhelyu Zhelev expressed Bulgaria's willingness to further develop its friendly and goodneighborly relations with the Republic of Macedonia in all spheres -- economy, trade, culture, and so on -- on a constructive and principled basis. Against the background of the complex political situation in this part of the Balkan peninsula, this is an expression of Bulgaria's willingness to help the Republic of Macedonia overcome the difficulties related to the tense relations between Macedonia and Greece. The specific issues will apparently be specified at a later date by the appropriate organs and institutions of the two neighboring states. This should by no means be interpreted as Bulgaria relinquishing its principled position of refusing to upset the balance of its relations with all states in the Balkan political space and supporting every step aimed at strengthening regional peace and stability.
