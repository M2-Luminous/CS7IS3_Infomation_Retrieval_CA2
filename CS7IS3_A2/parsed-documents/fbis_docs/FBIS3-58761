Georgia became an independent state only recently and quite naturally we seek to build our new equitable relations with other sovereign states by developing a solid legal framework for them, the Georgian leader said about the aim of his visit to France. During his two-day visit Shevardnadze will be received by French President Francois Mitterrand and sign with him a treaty of accord, friendship and cooperation between the two countries, as well as sign the Paris Charter for a New Europe. Journalists who met Shevardnadze in Paris pestered him with questions about prospects for relations between Georgia and Russia. "Directly upon my return home, I will begin preparations for a very important event -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi," Shevardnadze said. Yeltsin's trip to Georgia is scheduled for the beginning of February. "We are bound with Russia by many ties, and the Russian president's visit to Georgia is a major event in many years of our life," Georgian leader said. Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi is designed to define relations of friendship and cooperation between the two sovereign states. "Georgia is now entering a period of stability after the threat on unleashing a large-scale civil war has been eliminated", Shevardnadze said. "After we settle the conflict with, the man task for us is to ensure the country's normal economic development," he said. One of the principal conditions needed for progress in this field is Russia's continuous democratic evolution. If this evolution is disrupted, most unfavourable developments can ensue, Shevardnadze said. Also on Thursday [20 January], Shevardnadze met the leaders of two international organisations based in Paris - Federico Mayor, Director-general of the United Nations Educational,Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and Jean Claude Payem, director general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to discuss prospects for the development of relations between Georgia and UNESCO, Georgia and OECD. Business cooperation between Georgia and France was discussed in headquarters of the National Council of French Entrepreneurs.
