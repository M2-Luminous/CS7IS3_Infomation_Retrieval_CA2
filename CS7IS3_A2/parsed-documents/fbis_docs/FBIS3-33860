In a cable addressed to the UN secretary general as well as the chairman and members of the UN Security Council, Rajavi said that these impudent statements clearly show the regime's intentions to launch military attacks on the bases of the Iranian National Liberation Army, and to carry out terrorist operations against resistance elements outside Iran--something that reflects the exacerbation of domestic crises, as well as increasing popular discontent with the regime's henchmen. Rajavi urged the international community to enforce a sweeping arms and oil embargo against the Iranian regime. He indicated that a regime that advocates terrorism outside its own borders should have no place among the international community of nations.
