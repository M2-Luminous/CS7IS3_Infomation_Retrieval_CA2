Was this an appropriate reaction, Mr. Ruehe? [Ruehe] A human catastrophe on an immense scale is beginning to emerge in Gorazde, as the city is in danger of falling into the hands of the Serbs. The strike by NATO aircraft on behalf of the United Nations was, therefore, absolutely necessary. At the moment, the Serbs seem to be containing themselves, they are not advancing any further. Obviously, the Serbs only understand this clear language. Now everybody has to influence the Serbs to stop their attacks. Russia can continue to play an important role in this process. [Moniac] Should the Serbs not have been stripped of the arms that are now pointed at the Muslim enclave back in Sarajevo, instead of only making them withdraw? [Ruehe] The United Nations' military ground forces are very limited and depend on the warring parties keeping the various agreements. So far, the United Nations have had neither legal nor practical opportunities to actively disarm the besiegers. It is, therefore, all the more important now to exploit all the opportunities in Bosnia where the United Nations can fall back on NATO's resources. This means military air operations in particular. Neither the civilian population nor UN troops must come to harm in these missions. [Moniac] Do German politicians have to restrain themselves forever -- due to Germany's historical involvement in the Balkans? Can it go on like this, although there does not seem to be an end of the terrors of war in sight? [Ruehe] German soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be part of the problem rather than part of the solution, because their commitment and their work would not be supported by all the parties to the conflict. For this reason, we are not considering a deployment of German soldiers there. [Moniac] What contribution could Germany make, if a peace plan were to come into force in former Yugoslavia? [Ruehe] We should not speculate about a situation now that must be established first and toward whose realization we are all working.
