The article mentioned the efforts of the PT--the party favored by the polls to win the presidential election--to draw closer to the military. And it said that the greatest resistance to the party was to be found in the upper echelons, where there was more ideological prejudice, whereas a fair amount of receptiveness existed among the younger officers (captains, majors, and so on). That is not the way things are, according to the source. When the Cold War ended, the Armed Forces began to cultivate a new kind of behavior with regard to the ideological issue. It is obvious that such a change does not take place overnight. Complete assimilation takes time, and it is natural that within the military, the values that were a part of their training for decades should continue to exist for some time. Meaning, in this case, anticommunist ideology. But, the source says, the essential point is that for all intents and purposes, the ideological issue among the military is no longer an institutional issue or, much less, a national security issue. It is an individual matter to be decided by the soldier and his own conscience as a citizen. Everyone has his own opinion regardless of his professional duties. The point--and this is something that the source considers important and in conflict with what we said in this column--is that resistance to breaking down deep-rooted ideological prejudices is in fact greater among the younger officers. The older officers are the ones who have shown the greatest flexibility and understanding regarding the need for political coexistence with pluralism. And in any case, that split between younger and more mature officers does not in fact lead to any duality in thinking and/or behavior. Within the military, as is natural in any institution governed by a rigid hierarchical system, the feeling of unity and cohesion is what prevails. The directive from above, and it is not being challenged at any level, is simply this: the winner of the election in October, be it the PT, the PCdoB [Communist Party of Brazil], or any other party, will take power and govern normally. According to the source, that bias toward legality dates back a long way in the Armed Forces. The source says that even the Movement of 1964 was not exclusively military. He points out that "Jango" was deposed by Congress, which supported all of the initial actions (including the revocation of political rights) leading up to the election--also by the congressmen--of Castello Branco. According to the source, the break with the process did not come about until 1968, and then it occurred in a radicalized context of urban guerrilla warfare. But that is another story. Let us get back to the PT. The party today is preparing to take power, being confident that it will win the election. The source says that the initial dialogue has been taking place through the more mature officers. Lula's first contact with the officer class occurred at the start of the redemocratization process, when he spoke to students at the Army Command and Staff School. The source recalls that his speech was arranged by generals, but that the generals encountered resistance precisely among the students (majors, lieutenants, and so on). Dialogue is continuing today, and it is not by chance that the PT is advocating changes in the constitutional area that are pleasing to the military. And it is prepared to quadruple the Armed Forces budget if it wins the election. It should be emphasized that the military have been very reserved in that dialogue.
