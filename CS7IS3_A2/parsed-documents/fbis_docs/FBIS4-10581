According to the newspaper EXPRESO, National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) agents on 11 April found a trail leading to "Feliciano" when they raided a house in Lima's Callao Port where Red Path leaders held meetings. Five people were arrested in the raid and in addition Dincote agents seized guns and propaganda implicating the so-called Red Path "Central Committee" and the "Lima Metropolitan Committee" headed by Ramirez Durand. EXPRESO reported that according to a Dincote spokesperson, it is known that Feliciano is in Lima with some of his main lieutenants and that Dincote is following his footsteps. In the last two weeks, Dincote has arrested in Lima more than 20 Red Path terrorists, some of whom, it seems, have supplied information that will lead to the arrest of their main leaders. "Red Path" is an armed group that split from the "Shining Path" Maoist gang, rebelled against Shining Path top-ranking leader Abimael Guzman, and rejected the peace negotiations Guzman currently is holding with the government. Guzman decided to negotiate a peace agreement with the government in September 1993, one year after his arrest, in two letters addressed to Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori in which he admits the political and military defeat of the Shining Path, which took up arms in 1980.
