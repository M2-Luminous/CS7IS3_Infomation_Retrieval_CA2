Last night, speaking on Georgian TV, Besik Jalaghania, chairman of the Rustavi Electoral Commission, said the elections went smoothly and without hindrance until noon. At that time armed units appeared in town, who, according to Jalaghania, tried to exert pressure on voters and members of the Electoral Commission. It became impossible to continue the voting procedure in some polling stations. According to Jalaghania members of the Mkhedrioni [paramilitary units united under the Georgian Rescue Corps] were among those causing the destabilization. The Mkhedrioni press center circulated a report that the organization had nothing in common with any of the candidates. Therefore, the small units acting in Rustavi yesterday did it on their own initiative. Jalaghania also said that because of the disturbances he had to quit the elections and get away from Rustavi. He thinks that the by-election in Rustavi may be considered void.
