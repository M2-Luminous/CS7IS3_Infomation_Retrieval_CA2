FBIS4-30782 "dreeu104_b_94006" FBIS-EEU-94-104 Daily Report 27 May 1994 BULGARIA `Very Serious' Incident Alleged `Very Serious' Incident Alleged AU3005122394 Sofia REPORTER 7 in Bulgarian 27 May 94 p 4 AU3005122394 Sofia REPORTER 7 Bulgarian BFN [Article by Boyan Marinov: "Nuclear Bosses Again Covered Up the Truth"] [Excerpt] It was reported through the newspapers a few days ago that the No. 1 Reactor Unit at the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant was shut down because of a fault in one of the six cooling pumps. Kozloduy Plant Chief Dyanko Dobrev specified: "There is no danger of an accident; the unit could have continued operating, but we stopped it for reasons of greater security." According to Nikita Shervashidze, chief of the state department responsible for power supply [National Electricity Company], the fault could have been corrected very quickly, but the reactor had to be checked before reentering service. Following an old tradition, the nuclear chiefs said little, but kept quiet about much more. In this case, they failed to divulge the truth about the danger of an accident after the reactor was shut down. According to specialists, the situation that arose in the No. 2 Unit is reminiscent of the dangerous incident in September 1981 that REPORTER 7 wrote about in Issue No. 14 of 8 April 1994. The difference is that the second time the emergency situation occurred, the reactor was shut down. Following a suspected leak, the first cooling circuit was shut down to repair the vent of the No. 1 main circulating pump. While this repair was in progress, due to inadequate control on the part of the operating staff, a infraction occurred of the regulations related to the cooling of the nuclear fuel in the reactors' active zone. This led to a dangerous situation. The cooling water in the active zone boiled, negatively affecting the removal of heat, and this could have led to overheating and a risk of leakage from the heat-removing elements that contain nuclear fuel. In figurative terms, the incident was like a electric kettle full of boiling water. If the kettle boils dry, it will burn out. This popular comparison is also correct regarding the so-called human factor. Operator error, or more specifically gross negligence and irresponsibility, again produced the critical situation. Specialists assume that the rise in the radiation level in the premises housing the first circuit make the dozing staff "wake up" and react to the situation. Competent sources describe the incident as "a very serious emergency situation." It eloquently confirms once again that the nuclear plant has been left in a state of anarchy and poor control, as REPORTER 7 noted in its previous article. It seems that the maxim of "if you get away with it, that is all well and good," which seems to have been adopted almost as a rule by our nuclear managers, has been passed down the line and reached the junior staff of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant.
