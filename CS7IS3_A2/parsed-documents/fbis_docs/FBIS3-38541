The five missions -- each led by a Minister -- will support the export efforts of British contractors and consultants, and building materials producers. Unveiling the Programme, Sir George said: "I am delighted to announce that Secretary of State John Gummer, Tony Baldry and I will be spearheading a much-expanded construction trade missions programme during 1994." The programme will cover India, Kazakhstan, Indonesia and Malaysia, Chile and Argentina, and Vietnam and the Philippines. "As sponsors of the construction industry we must help ensure that the many skills and services that our industry has to offer are effectively promoted in the markets that the industry sees as providing the best opportunities overseas. "Our programme has been drawn up after careful and extensive consultation with the major construction industry trade associations. This is an ambitious but necessary programme if we are to maintain and improve our position in the fiercely competitive international construction market. "Last year's missions to Lebanon, Taiwan and China were a great success and gave an edge to the industry's efforts to compete in these markets. I, and my Ministerial colleagues, look forward to working closely with industry representatives to make this year's missions equally, if not even more, successful." Notes for Editors The Secretary of State for the Environment launched the new Construction Sponsorship Directorate on 27 September 1993 with the specific brief of "Listening to the industry"; "Explaining Government policies and priorities"; "Advocating on behalf of the industry both at home and abroad"; and "Promoting exports, productivity and innovation." A new Construction Export Promotion Division has been created within the Directorate and this is the first trade missions programme organised under the new structure.
