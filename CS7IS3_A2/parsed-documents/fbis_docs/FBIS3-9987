They affirmed that the democratic system is guaranteed by the military institutions. General Fernando Sanjinez, the Armed Forces commander in chief, today pointed out the need for a detailed investigation to see if trafficker Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez's charges are true. The arrested trafficker leveled charges during his declaration to Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) and a La Paz judge. "Meco" Dominguez, who has Chagas disease, could not finish his declaration in view of his poor health condition. He linked former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora and the leadership of his party, the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), to the top Bolivian drug traffickers who allegedly provided financial support and transportation during their electoral campaigns. Amid ever increasing dissatisfaction of their fellow party members, the MIR leaders today resumed a confidential meeting to analyze the charges of their alleged links with drug trafficking. Acting MIR President Oscar Eid was challenged by some factions which plan to "save the party," while other factions urged Paz Zamora to break his silence and isolation, "guide the party," and "face the situation" now that his leadership is under discussion. Meanwhile, newspapers published new photographs of Paz Zamora and Isaac "Oso" Chavarria -- who was arrested by the FELCN in January during one of the largest antinarcotics operations -- as well as a copy of one Guillermo Capobianco's handwritten letters dated 13 July 1987. In the letter he congratulates Chavarria on his birthday. It begins: "Dear Oso: I will not be able to accompany Jaime and Oscar at the big celebration." The letter is signed by Capobianco, who was then an important MIR leader in Santa Cruz. Other MIR leaders said that in 1987 "no one knew Mr. Chavarria was linked to drug trafficking."
