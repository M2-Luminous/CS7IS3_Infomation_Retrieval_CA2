FBIS4-26360 "drchi120_e_94008" FBIS-CHI-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 Southeast Asia & Pacific XINHUA Interviews Philippine Vice President XINHUA Interviews Philippine Vice President OW2206092594 Beijing XINHUA in English 0903 GMT 22 Jun 94 OW2206092594 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- The Philippine Government and people wish to see China "playing a positive role in political, economic and security matters in the Asia-Pacific region as a stabilizing influence in the maintenance of peace and tranquility." This was stated by visiting Philippine Vice President Joseph Estrada in an exclusive interview with XINHUA before he left here for Shanghai today. China's rapid economic development in recent years has been astonishing to the extent that the country is making efforts to cut its growth rate while other countries are seeking higher growth rates, Estrada said. He noted that the Philippine Government would like to see a stronger China in the region. The Philippine Government does not have any fears about a stronger China and "sees no threat from China," Estrada said, adding "maybe some western countries do." but as for the Philippines and other Asian countries, they want all their neighbors to become stronger. Sitting comfortably beside a dinner table in a villa of the Diaoyutai state guesthouse where the vice-president stayed during his visit to Beijing, he talked softly with occasional rises in his voice for emphasis, seemingly with a clear-cut rhythm, fully demonstrating his conversational skills as an eminent film star. Before assuming his current post in 1992, the vice-president had been a popular actor in the Philippines, staging more than 100 films in his 25-year career and starring in many of them. He described his current visit to China, his first China tour, as "quite a success", having met Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren, Premier Li Peng, the National People's Congress Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi and many other senior officials. What satisfied him most was the signing of a trade protocol between the two governments which is expected to help further boost the vibrant trade to an annual volume of 400 million U.S. dollars and enhance economic cooperation between the two countries. His coming to China is itself an indication of the Philippine Government's high regard for China, he stressed. The exchanges of visits by senior officials of the two countries over the past few years have helped strengthen the healthy bilateral relations, especially in the fields of economic cooperation, science and technology and culture. China, already a "very important player in international affairs," is naturally encouraged to assume "an active role in economic and security regional discussions," such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference and the ASEAN regional forum, the vice-president stated.
