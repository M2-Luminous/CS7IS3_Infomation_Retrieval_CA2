After the meeting, it was published by ZHONGHUA GONGSHANG SHIBAO in June, and JINGJI RIBAO in August. Proceeding from the presupposition that the issue of public and private ownership is the theoretical basis for the private economy of China, Yu's article briefly analyzes the coexistent situation of public and private property in the history of human society and brings up some new views and ideas. I disagree with some of the viewpoints in Yu's article due to our differences in viewing the history of the founding of the Chinese socialist system and the current situation of the socialist society, in understanding and applying the tenets of Marxism and the theory of building Chinese-style socialism, and in interpreting the party's principles and policies. Pursuant to the "double hundred policy" of the party, I will present some of my opinions on the following issues and submit them to Comrade Yu Guangyuan for discussions. I. Is Private Ownership an Intrinsic Quality of a Capitalist Society? Yu's article states: "Whether or not private ownership is an intrinsic quality of a capitalist society, like whether or not public ownership is an intrinsic quality of a socialist society, is a question that needs to be studied." Then, Yu's article quotes a paragraph from the "Critique of the Draft Program of the Socialist Democratic Party in 1891," which was published by Engels between 1901 and 1902: "As far as I know, capitalist production is a form of society and a stage of the economy, while capitalist private production is a phenomenon of one kind or another within this stage. But what is exactly capitalist private production? It is production managed by individual entrepreneurs. This kind of production has become more and more of an exception. Capitalist production managed by a corporation is no longer private production. Instead, it is production aimed to make profits for a group of people. If we look at the trust which controls and monopolizes the entire industry from the viewpoint of the corporation, we will know that not ony private production has ceased but...." By quoting this paragraph, Yu's article implies that after the emergence of social organizations like corporation and trust, capitalist production ceased to be private production. Because of this, private ownership is not necessarily the intrinsic quality of capitalist society and production. If I have not misunderstood the original meaning of this paragraph, then I cannot agree with the point of Yu's article which doubts that private ownership is the intrinsic quality of capitalist society. There are mainly two reasons: 1. Yu's article quotes the above paragraph of Engels out of context. Regarding the fourth paragraph in the introduction to the abovementioned draft program--"the lack of planning derived from the intrinsic quality of capitalist private production"--Engels' critique is that the word "private,' should be deleted (Volume 22 of the Complete Works of Marx and Engels, page 270). Engels' reason is the same as the quote in Yu's article. This shows that according to Engels' viewpoint, capitalist production includes not only the capitalist production of individual enterprises but also the production of corporation and trust aimed to make profits for a group of people. Undoubtedly, the statement of Engels, after deleting the word "private,' is a more comprehensive and accurate depiction of the intrinsic quality of capitalist production. Therefore, is it okay to draw the conclusion that the intrinsic quality of capitalist society is not necessarily private ownership from the abovementioned Engels' statement on the coexistence of individual enterprises and corporations? No, it is not. This is because Engels also clearly points out, when he critiques the sixth paragraph in the introduction of the draft program: "Material and ideological conditions needed to change capitalist production, which benefits individuals or corporations, to socialist production, which benefits society as a whole and is carried out according to advanced planning, are created precisely by capitalist society itself. Only through such a change can the working class, and still further, all members of society without exception, be liberated" (Volume 22 of the Complete Works of Marx and Engels, page 279). This means that neither individual capitalist enterprises, nor corporations run by a group of capitalists, is engaged in socialist production that benefits society as a whole. Instead, they are engaged in capitalist production that benefits the bourgeoisie and is based on the capitalist private ownership of capital goods. What Engels stresses here is exactly the private quality intrinsic in the production of contemporary capitalism. According to Marxist theory on the forms of social economy, capitalist society is the last society in human history where man exploits man. It is a society where the form of capitalist production occupies a dominant position, the capitalist private ownership of capital goods is the basis, and the objective is for the bourgeoisie to exploit the surplus value of hired labor. Marx said that the production of surplus value "is the direct objective and decisive motivation of capitalist production" and that "it must not be depicted as something it is not. In other words, we must never describe it as having the direct objective of enjoyment or producing goods of enjoyment for capitalists. If so, we will fail completely to see the salient feature in the entire intrinsic quality of such production." (Volume 25 of the Complete Works of Marx and Engels," page 272). This means that the essence of capitalist production is production of surplus value, whereas the precondition for the production of surplus value is the capitalist private ownership of capital goods. Because of this, we should say that private ownership is the intrinsic quality of a capitalist society. II. In the History of Socialist Nations, Why Hasn't Private Property Been Eliminated? Yu's article states: "There has been only a vain hope of eliminating as soon as possible private property, in the history of socialist nations. There has been no evidence that private property has been eliminated." What kind of private property or ownership does the word, "private property," refer to here? This has to be clarified first. Marx and Engels pointed out in the "Manifesto of the Communist Party": "The salient feature of communism is not to abolish general ownership. it is to abolish the ownership system of bourgeoisie"; communism "wants to eliminate the ownership which is preconditioned by the fact that the overwhelming majority of people in society do not own property"; and "communism does not deprive anyone of the right to own social products, it only takes away the right of using such ownership to enslave other people's labor." (Volume 1 of the Complete Works of Marx and Engels, pages 265 and 267). This means that the private property or ownership that socialism wants to eliminate is only the capitalist ownership system that uses the ownership of capital goods to exploit the surplus value created by hired laborers or the portion of bourgeois private property that belongs to the category of capital goods, not consumer goods owned and controlled by individuals in a capitalist society. According to the above theories of Marx and Engels, whether or not the conclusion of Yu's article is correct should be obvious. In light of China's history, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and through many years of struggle, the people of all nationalities in China reaped victory in the new democratic revolution, confiscated bureaucrat capital, and eliminated the bureaucrat-capitalist class (which will never be revived). Through the basic completion of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and trade in 1956, they further eliminated the capitalist exploitation system and the bourgeoisie, established a socialist system, and entered into a socialist society. Namely, China fulfilled the task of eliminating the private property of the bourgeoisie that exploits surplus value or the bourgeois system of private ownership of capital goods, which was the demand of Marxism. The reason that China had failed to fully develop socialist superiority after it established a basic socialist system is that the party committed "leftist" errors on the two major issues of how to build socialism and how to handle class struggle. It must not be blamed on the "so-called vain hope of the party and the state to eliminate as soon as possible private property," thus inadvertently playing down the great significance of establishing the socialist system in China. Like Comrade Deng Xiaopong pointed out: "Through many years of bloody struggle, our party and people established the socialist system. Although this socialist system is not yet complete and it has been undermined, it is after all much better than the capitalist system under which the weak are the prey of the strong and people harm others to benefit themselves. Our system will improve as each day goes by. It will absorb all progressive factors which we absorb from other nations and become the best system in the world." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping on the Theory of Building Chinese-Style Socialism, page 142). Perhaps someone will ask: If the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and trade was basically completed in 1956 and the capitalist exploitation system and the bourgeoisie have been eliminated, then why do we want to develop the private economy that has the nature of capitalism? Doesn't this prove that the conclusion of Yu's article is correct? My answer to this question is as follows: In 1956, around the time of the Eighth Party Congress, after socialist transformation was basically completed and China's socialist system was established, central leading comrades such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, and Chen Yun, in view of the problems arising in the socialist transformation of captialist industry and trade and of drawbacks of China's economic system created by the joint management of public and private industries, put forth a series of new theoretical viewpoints and corresponding principles and policies, on the basis of combining theory and practice. At the Eighth Party Congress, Comrade Chen Yun brought up the principle and policy of "three main bodies and three supplements." At the 52nd Standing Committee Meeting of the National People's Congress on 29 December 1956, Comrade Liu Shaoqi introduced the new thinking that "China is over 90 percent socialist. We should not be afraid to have a small percentage of capitalism as supplement and comparison." (See article by Hu Qiaomu 5170 0829 2606: "How Did China Choose Socialism in the 1950's," 3 October 89, RENMIN RIBAO) During his talks with responsible persons of the National Industrial and Commercial Association on 5, 7, and 8 December 1956, Chairman Mao brought up the new idea of "practicing capitalism after eliminating capitalism." He said: "The underground factories of Shanghai and joint ventures are also antithesis"; "To legalize them, we may hire workers"; "We may run privately-owned large factories, sign contracts, and promise that they will not be confiscated in the next 10 or 20 years. Overseas investment should not be confiscated for 20 or 100 years." "We can practice state and private ownership." "We can practice capitalism after eliminating it." (Bo Yibo 5631 0001 3134: "Review of Several Major Decisions and Events," Volume I, pages 433 and 434) Of course, by saying "practicing capitalism again," here Chairman Mao did not mean developing capitalism extensively and reestablishing the social system of capitalism. Instead, he meant that with regard to ownership structure, we should appropriately preserve and develop some private and individual economies and bring in overseas Chinese investment under the prerequisite that state and collective economies occupy the dominant position. By doing so, we can provide an "antithesis" for state and collective economies and preserve a certain amount of competitive mechanism. These new ideas of Chairman Mao revealed, in the ownership structure, a valuable spark of ideology concerning the socialist economy with Chinese characteristics. Unfortunately, these valuable special ideas and policies regarding the building of Chinese-style socialism were not put into effect. They were later interrupted by erroneous leftist policies. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, after bringing order out of chaos, the party and the state, under the guidance of the theory of building Chinese-style socialism and the basic party line, implemented a structure of ownership system under which socialist public ownership is dominant, other economic factors are supplementary, and multiple economic factors coexist. This is the carrying on and development of the new ideas and policies put forth by central leading comrades before and after the Eighth Party Congress. In addition, the reform we are currently carrying out is not to "change the nature of our socialist system. It is self-improvement and development of a socialist system." Because of this, I think that the victory of new democratic revolution and the success of the 1956 socialist transformation enabled China to eliminate the capitalist exploitation system and the bourgeoisie. This is a historical fact proving that the socialist nation has eliminated the private property of the bourgeois class. Allowing and encouraging the development of the private economy in the current stage is precisely using the private economy to develop social productive forces after "achieving success in the revolution," thereby creating conditions for ultimately eliminating the exploitation phenomenon and transferring to a higher level of socialism. These two are not contradicting or opposed to each other. Yu's article states: "There have been vain hopes, but no evidence of eliminating as soon as possible private property." I think that these are only lies of Yu's article, not historical facts." III. What Are the Characteristics of a Socialist Society? Yu's article states: "General public property is not a special feature of a socialist society. All societies in history have public property." This is another issue that needs to be clarified. It is true that all societies in history have public property. But in a slave, feudal, or capitalist society, public property belongs to, serves, and benefits a few people of the exploiting class. It does not belong to, serve, or benefit all members of society. Take the state property of a bourgeois nation for instance. It does not have the "capital property of eliminating productive forces." The more "productive forces a bourgeois nation occupies, the more likely that it will become a general capitalist who will exploit even more of its citizens. Workers will remain hired laborers and the proletariat. Instead of eliminating capital relations, it will be pushed to the extreme." (The Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Volume III, page 436) Because of this, bourgeois national public property which is used as a tool for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie does not deserve its name. It is in essence the private property of a few people of the bourgeoisie. On the contrary, in a socialist society, public property is owned by all members of society and it serves and benefits all members of society. Here, public property is public property both in name and reality. This is the fundamental difference between a socialist and capitalist society. Engels said: "The decisive difference between the socialist system and the current existing system is, of course, organizing production on the basis that all capital goods are owned publicly (first in individual nations)." (The Complete Works of Marx and Engels, Volume 37, page 443). Because of this, eliminating the private ownership and establishing the public ownership system of capital goods, namely establishing genuine public property owned by society as a whole, are the characteristics of a socialist society. IV. Why Do We Need To Advocate "Sacred Private Property"? Yu's article states: "Only by regarding both public and private property as sacred can socialist society survive and progress." This concept needs studying. We all know that the Constitution of China stipulates: "The public property of socialism is sacred and inviolable." This is completely correct because China is a socialist country whose economic basis is a socialist public ownership system. Therefore, is it necessary to consider the private property of private economy with capitalist nature in China as sacred? My answer is negative. The reasons are as follows: 1. In Das Kapital and the Manifesto of the Communist Party, Marx set forth the historical mission of "exploiting the exploiter" and "eliminating the bourgeois ownership system." The ultimate goal of communists is to eventually reach communist society via socialist society. In China, a socialist society where the capitalist exploitation system and the bourgeoisie have been eliminated, it is very strange for someone to advocate "private property being sacred," which is similar to that advocated by the foreign bourgeoisie during the period of bourgeois revolution, in order to exercise their control. 2. Although the ultimate goal of Marxism is to arrive at a communist society via socialism, it has been clearly pointed out at the same time that communists cannot abolish private ownership overnight, that socialist countries can only gradually transform existing society, and that only after producing the large amount of capital goods needed to abolish the private ownership system can the private ownership system be thoroughly eliminated. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, our party, following the tenets of Marxism on gradually eliminating private ownership, set forth the basic line of "one center, two basic points" and the structure of an ownership system under which the socialist public ownership system dominates, non-public ownership economy supplements, and multiple economic factors develop simultaneously for a long period of time. Our party also put forward the policy of allowing and encouraging the development of the private economy to achieve the goal of developing the socialist economy, increasing social productive forces, and creating material goods needed to enter into a high level of socialist society. Then, under this situation and condition, is it necessary to advocate "private property being sacred" to raise the enthusiasm of private entrepreneurs for investing in and managing the private economy and for serving socialist modernization? I think it is not necessary because the Constitution of China stipulates: "The state protects the ownership of lawful income, savings, housing, and other legal property of citizens"; and "the state protects the right of inheritance of citizens according to law." The temporary provisions of private enterprises further stipulates in concrete terms: "The assets of private enterprises belong to private individuals" and the "state protects the lawful rights and interests of private enterprises." All these laws and regulations are sufficient to protect the private property of a private economy from harm. There is no need to use the stipulation of "private property being sacred" used in foreign bourgeois laws to replace the Constitution and law of our socialist country. As for the concept that only by regarding "private property as sacred can socialist society survive and progress," it is even more impossible to find out what this means.
