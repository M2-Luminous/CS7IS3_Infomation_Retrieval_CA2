The Science Council (chairman, Ken'ichi Fukui), an MOE advisory organ, compiled a report on university research reactors confirming that such reactors would continue to be used. The debate about keeping the reactors going, which included the issues of whether universities should have their own reactors for research or whether they should use JAERI's reactors, and what sort of atomic energy research universities should do, concluded in the decision to continue along the same route as in the past. The Science Council's report is entitled "About How Nuclear Reactors for University Research Should Be." In that report the Science Council notes the importance of the KUR "as a reactor with which significant scientific research may be carried out in the future," and positively assesses the KUR's role from the viewpoint of scientific research and the cultivation of talented researchers. The report approves the continued use of the KUR with certain conditions attached, one of which is that the research to be carried out with the reactor matches the characteristics of the facility. However, in regard to how the KUR will be handled from now on, the report emphasizes that maintenance, such as "preventative maintenance of auxiliary facilities that is important for safety ensurance," is needed to guarantee the safety and reliability of the reactor. In addition, there are conditions attached to organizational management methods, e.g., every few years the reactor would be evaluated on its joint use and the state of research implementation. With that, Kyoto University will begin to formulate a new research plan based on the contents of the report. After the new plan is explained to groups such as the Osaka-fu Nuclear Reactor Problems Council and the Kumatori-machi Nuclear Power Problems and Countermeasures Conference, the organizational changes based on the new plan will be incorporated into the FY95 rough [budget] requests. The KUR is the only university-instituted megawatt-class reactor, and, as a joint-use research institute for all of Japan's universities since first criticality in 1964, over 8,000 researchers have been using the reactor in areas such as radiation medicine and materials experiments that utilize the neutrons produced by nuclear fission. In 1976 a plan to construct a second reactor surfaced because of the KUR's deterioration. Due to the local residents' opposition, however, the plan was withdrawn in 1990, and the problem of whether or not to shut the KUR down has been pending. On the other hand, because of the refurbishing of JAERI's JRR-3 research reactor (thermal output, 20,000 kW; in Tokai-mura, Ibaraki Prefecture), the JRR-3 can now be used for advanced research, and the necessity of "a university-owned nuclear reactor" is being questioned. Given such a situation, since 1990 the Science Council has been debating about whether to maintain the KUR or to shut it down.
