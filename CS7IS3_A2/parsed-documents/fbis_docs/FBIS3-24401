R. Nixon's recent meeting with leaders of the Russian opposition is a perfectly natural event, in my view. The sounding-out of post-Yeltsin Russia is beginning. For the Western perception of the situation that has taken shape in Russia since the December elections there is no precise divide between those whom we at home have become accustomed to considering political antagonists. Yeltsin and Zyuganov, Chernomyrdin and Kozyrev, and, finally, Zhirinovskiy--they are all for the Western mind primarily "Russians," and only then "democrats," "communists," or "fascists." Such, if you will, is the Western aberration with our idee fixe of "national reconciliation"--such "reconciliation" emerged for the West, apparently, even before it did for ourselves. Is, in fact, the difference between Yeltsin and Zyuganov that great, for that matter, if the first is increasingly beginning to incline toward national-state ideas, wiring for sound what was just recently being proposed by the opposition? The strong constitutional authority of the president has today neither an organizational nor conceptual pillar within the democratic camp. The government is beginning to play according to the rules of the opposition. This means that sooner or later the winner will be whoever produces political know-how, not the one who "consumes" it, stamping decisions in accordance with another's "license." The main know-how today is the party. What in political science is called "organizational authority" affording an opportunity to initiate, introduce, and polish decisions adopted at government level. Organizational authority is lacking, incidentally, not only with Yeltsin but also Zhirinovskiy. This brings them unusually close together, despite all their differences and noncomparability. The political style of both is "one-man theater" and the constant pedaling of the personality factor. But it is not the personality but the party-organizational factor that is becoming most important today. And the fact that all more or less important politicians have suddenly hurled themselves into the creation of their "own parties" is further confirmation of this. Who disposes of real organizational authority in Russia today? Gennadiy Zyuganov's party. As of the present this is not only the largest but also the most structured party, having inherited from the CPSU a sizable personnel and financial base. It has a renewed national-communist ideology, one of the strongest factions in the Duma, and, according to certain information, good connections in the elite groups. In terms of type this is a power party, proposing the traditional techniques of a solution of the managerial crisis in the base sectors of the economy (and it is the crisis of management which is determining for the so-called "economic crisis"). In an alliance with the agrarian-industrial lobby and also in a potential alliance with the center and democratic-patriotic forces Zyuganov's party has a chance of becoming a serious political factor in the country, despite all the unpopularity of its ideology. Is the West ready for a serious dialogue with Russia's communists? Strictly speaking, for Western conservatives the communist establishment has always been an object of close attention primarily as a traditional component of the Russian political elite. More, since the clamorous Fuehrer-type escapades of Zhirinovskiy, who shocked Europe with the imaginary threat of "Russian fascism," G. Zyuganov's balanced position might appear the most acceptable version of Russian revanchism. The West is looking in Russia for "righteousness" as some standard of what is to be expected from Russia in the immediate future. Neither Yeltsin nor Zhirinovskiy nor anyone else manifestly cut it as yet as "righteous." Only national communism, directly or indirectly influencing all the other currents in Russian politics, may be the "new righteous" today. Russia has approached in earnest the phase of "postdemocratic stagnation," and one has the impression that the West has waived Russia's reforms goodbye. The main concern of Western politicians are not qualitative transformations within Russia but, rather, the geopolitical controllability of the new Russian revanchism. Were not Brezhnev's stagnation of the mid-1970's and the suppression of the dissident movement not ultimately the result of a kind of "deal" between Russian and Western conservatives? It is worth remembering that the first phase of that "stagnation" pertained to the time of detente, and only after the USSR had invaded Afghanistan did the Western community return to the policy of the cold war. I see no grounds for believing that something similar might not be repeated today. The entire history of Russia's relations with the Western community indicates that its principal determining factor is Russia's geopolitical predictability, not the fate of Russian reforms and not the human rights situation. At the present time Russia is too weak for expansionist activity outside of the former USSR. An era of conciliation, a time of geopolitical deals are beginning. I have always been struck by Americans' punctiliousness with regard to the formal procedures of democracy. During his January visit to Moscow Bill Clinton observed that the results of the December elections and the democratically elected parliament were no less important to him than the popularly elected President Yeltsin. Strictly speaking, he could have said something similar in 1933 in respect to the democratically elected Reichstag and the new German chancellor.
