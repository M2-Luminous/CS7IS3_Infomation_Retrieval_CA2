Consumer prices for goods and services rose in practically all regions of Russia by 1-2.5 percent. Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in February were as follows (as a percentage of the preceding date): 02/08 02/15 02/22 Average daily price rise February January Consumer 103.3 102.8 101.9 0.36 0.68 goods and services including: foodstuffs 103.8 102.5 101.6 0.36 0.68 nonfood items 102.8 102.5 102.4 0.35 0.40 for-fee 103.1 107.4 101.7 0.54 2.38 services for the population Since the beginning of the month prices in the consumer market increased by 8.3 percent, including those for foodstuffs--by 8.1 percent, nonfood items--by 7.9 percent, and for-fee services for the population--by 12.5 percent. Foodstuffs From 15 to 22 February, prices for basic foodstuffs rose at a slower pace: by 1.7 percent in organized trade, and by 1.0 percent in nonorganized trade. Price changes by main categories of food products over this period are shown below. as % of the preceding observation date including Total in organized in nonorganized trade trade All food products 101.6 101.7 101.0 including: Meat and meat 101.5 101.9 100.4 products Fish and fish 103.0 103.1 99.0 products Milk and milk 103.4 103.6 102.2 products Eggs 101.1 101.2 99.8 Sugar 100.2 100.2 100.4 Bread and bakery 101.6 101.6 - products Cereals and 103.5 103.4 106.2 macaroni items Vodka 99.0 99.0 100.0 Potatoes and 104.4 104.2 104.7 vegetables In organized trade over the past week the pace of price increases slowed down with respect to practically all monitored foodstuffs. At the same time, prices with respect to milk products, cereals and macaroni items, vegetables, and fish products continued to rise at an anticipatory rate. There was practically no change in prices for sugar, vodka, vegetable oil, tea, flour, and oranges. Since the beginning of February prices for milk products have risen by 17.6 percent; for cereals and macaroni items, potatoes, and vegetables--by 13 percent; for bread and bakery items--by 10 percent; and for meat and meat products--by 7.7 percent. In nonorganized trade, prices rose over this week on average at a somewhat slower rate than in organized trade (1 percent). Vegetable prices rose at a higher rate. Those for fresh cabbage increased by 8 percent. Since the beginning of the month vegetable prices have risen by more than 20 percent. The cost of a consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs rose over the week by 1.6 percent and amounted as of 22 February to 40,800 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly basis. Magadan remains the most expensive city (R97,500) and Ulyanovsk--the least expensive (R23,800). Moscow is in 30th place of 132 monitored cities (R45,300 on a monthly basis). Nonfood Items Over the past week prices for the main categories of nonfood items rose by 1-3 percent. A higher rate of price increases was registered with respect to synthetic detergents and certain categories of medical supplies (5-10 percent). Since the beginning of February prices for fabrics, cultural and household items, and certain categories of medical supplies have increased by 10-20 percent. For-Fee Services for the Population Fees for services changed insignificantly over the past week (1.7 percent). Since the beginning of February the cost of municipal housing has increased 1.8-fold, hot water fees--1.6-fold, and the cost of basic residential telephone service--by almost 30 percent. Suburban train and intercity bus fares increased by 20 percent. Production of the Most Important Varieties of Industrial Output Over 20 days of February 1994, of 163 categories of products counted in periodic reports, average daily production as compared to the corresponding period of February 1993: --increased with respect to 11 items, (including polypropylene, polyvinylchloride plastics, cotton fabrics, tea, toothpaste), or 7 percent of the total number; --Decreased with respect to 149 positions, or 91 percent of the total number; and as compared to the corresponding period of January 1994: --increased with respect to 101 items, (including coal, iron ore, steel pipe, sulfuric acid, mineral fertilizers, caustic soda, synthetic dyes, polyvinylchloride tar and vinylchloride copolymers, chemical fibers and filaments, large electric machinery, metal-cutting machine tools, self-propelled cranes, rail freight cars, trolleybuses, friction-free ball bearings, wood-chip board, cardboard, cement, construction brick, roof slate, asbestos-cement pipe and couplers, soft roofing and insulation materials, refrigerators and freezers, washers, tape recorders, radio receivers, television sets, sewing machines, fabrics, knitwear and hosiery, footwear, butter, high-fat cheese and feta cheese, whole-milk products, bread and bakery items, facial soap), or 62 percent of the total number; --decreased with respect to 59 items, or 36 percent of the total number. Based on the dynamics of the output of most important categories of products, the estimated average daily volume of industrial production over the elapsed period of February 1994 amounted to 74 percent of the level of the corresponding period of last year's February. The output of main categories of industrial products over 20 days of February 1994 is characterized by the following data: Produced over as % of the corresponding period 20 days of (in terms of average daily February 1994 production) February 1993 January 1994 Electric power--billion 58.9 98 108 kw-hr Oil, including gas 15.9 83 92 condensate, million tonnes Natural gas, billion 36.8 99.1 100.0 cubic meters Coal, million tonnes 16.3 91 113 Steel, million tonnes 2.3 72 95 Finished rolled ferrous 1.8 72 94 metals, million tonnes Steel pipe, thousand 201 52 109 tonnes Large electric 156 45 156 machinery, units Metal-cutting machine 357 43 147 tools, units Trucks, thousand units 9.5 29 90 Passenger cars, thousand 44.7 83 4.7 times units Tractors, thousand units 893 12 70 Chemical filament and 10.6 47 102 fiber, thousand tonnes Mineral fertilizer 352 74 106 (recalculated as 100 percent nutrients), thousand tonnes Automotive tires for 1.4 62 105 agricultural vehicles, motorcycles, and motorollers, million units Commercial timber, 4.2 61 93 million cubic meters raft wood Lumber, thousand cubic 591 63 90 meters Paper, thousand tonnes 128 76 94 Cement, million tonnes 1.7 74 120 Roof slate, million 68.1 33 2.1 times standard tiles Construction brick, 424 73 113 million units of standard brick Soft roofing and 18.0 51 105 insulation materials, million square meters Fabrics, total, million 166 89 121 square meters Hosiery, million pairs 22.3 74 121 Knitwear, million units 12.5 78 136 Footwear, million pairs 3.0 41 143 Television sets, 166 82 122 thousand units Radio receiving devices, 64.0 48 147 thousand units Refrigerators and 174 95 103 freezers, thousand units Electric vacuum 54.3 31 64 cleaners, thousand units Washing machines, 116 53 124 thousand units Meat, including 89.6 65 84 subproducts, category I, total, thousand tonnes Whole-milk products, 342 81 104 recalculated as milk, total, thousand tonnes Butter, total, thousand 13.2 69 111 tonnes Granulated sugar, 53.4 64 76 including that produced from customer-supplied raw material Over the first three weeks of February 1994 there was no production of grain harvesting combines or electric and diesel railroad locomotives. Rail Transport As of 1 February 1994, 44.4 million tonnes of goods due to be transported by rail were waiting at enterprises and railroad stations, including 36.4 million tonnes at track-adjacent loading areas of enterprises and stations, which is 0.8 percent more than as of 1 February 1993 and 17 percent less than as of 1 January 1994. The most significant among unshipped cargo remainders were the following: Remaining cargo to be As % of the transported by rail corresponding period of waiting at track-adjacent last year loading areas of enterprises and stations as of 1 February 1994, million tonnes Total cargo 36.4 100.8 including: bituminous coal 13.5 111 oil and petroleum 1.3 89 products iron and manganese ore 3.0 110 timber 3.7 90 construction cargo 5.5 74 Kemerovo Oblast accounts for 50 percent of the total quantity of bituminous coal awaiting shipping in Russia, Rostov Oblast--for 18 percent, the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)--8 percent, and the Republic of Komi--7 percent; 12 percent of the timber is awaiting shipping in Arkhangelsk Oblast, 9 percent--in Irkutsk Oblast, 8 percent each in Kostroma and Tyumen Oblasts and the Republic of Komi; with respect to construction cargo remainders, Novosibirsk Oblast accounts for 26 percent, Sverdlovsk Oblast--11 percent, and St. Petersburg--8 percent; with respect to iron and manganese ore: Belgorod Oblast--56 percent, and Kemerovo Oblast--12 percent; and with respect to oil and petroleum products: Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast--20 percent, Omsk Oblast--18 percent, and Perm Oblast--15 percent. Privatization in Industry In 1993, 12,000 state and municipal industrial enterprises were privatized in Russia. At 3,800 enterprises the privatization process has been completed and all payments have been made in full (including at 1,900 light industry enterprises). The denationalization process has spread to all industrial sectors. It is practically complete in light industry (98.6 percent of the total number of state and municipal enterprises in the sector had been privatized as of the beginning of the year); the process is actively progressing in ferrous metallurgy (54.6 percent), the chemical and petrochemical industry (52.9 percent), and machine building and metalworking (51.0 percent). At the same time, in the construction material and food processing industries, whose enterprises are subject to mandatory privatization, denationalization is proceeding at a relatively slow pace: 35-43 percent of enterprises have been privatized. Data on privatization of state and municipal enterprises by industry sector in 1993 are shown below: Privatized enterprises Entities as % of Charter capital, R billion the number of state and municipal enterprises as of 1 January 1993 Industry as a whole 11,948 44.6 422.8 including: power generation 80 9.1 45.4 fuel industry 64 10.0 60.1 ferrous metallurgy 119 54.6 48.7 nonferrous metallurgy 80 35.1 16.5 chemical and petrochemical 281 52.9 27.5 industry machine building and 2,901 51.0 125.0 metalworking timber, woodworking, and 909 21.5 13.7 pulp and paper industry construction material 826 35.5 10.7 industry glass and 55 45.1 1.5 porcelain-stoneware industry light industry 3,374 98.6 26.8 food processing industry 2,071 42.9 29.7 Denationalization in Russian industry in 1993 was accomplished mostly through conversion to joint-stock holding. This was the preferred method chosen by 6,223 state and municipal enterprises, or 52 percent of those privatized (in 1992--19 percent of enterprises). Under this method, enterprise employees select, as a rule, the second option for preferences, whereby common stock, which comprises 51 percent of the charter capital, is to be sold to enterprise employees, as well as employees of enterprises that are linked with it in a single technological complex (in 1993, 47 percent of shares were sold to employees of privatized enterprises). This method of privatization was used most in 1993 in machine-building and metalworking, where 1,870 joint-stock companies were set up; in the food processing industry--1,732; and the construction materials industry--500. In 1993 more than 577 million shares of stock were issued and sold, with a nominal value of R1,000 per share on average, for a total amount of R416 billion. About 53 percent of all stock issued, in the amount of R187 billion, was transferred to the property fund (of them, 72 million shares were sold by the fund through auctions, 2.4 million shares--through bids, and 7.5 million shares--at investment auctions). After selling stock at auctions, through bids, and through investment auctions, as of 1 January 1994, 215.5 million shares worth R154.8 billion were left in the fund. About 23 percent of all shares were purchased by enterprise employees at the selling price set by the State Committee for the Administration of State Property, in the amount of R144 billion. Also purchased were 77.5 million shares of Class A preferred stock (13.4 percent) in the amount of R46.8 billion. Forty-five million shares of common stock worth R27.3 billion were distributed on preferential terms among enterprise employees. The Russian economy received R118.5 billion from privatization of industrial enterprises, including R15.7 billion from fully privatized enterprises. Account-Clearing Relations with CIS and Baltic Countries By the beginning of 1994 the accounts payable debt at enterprises in industry, construction, transportation, and agriculture amounted to R47.0 trillion, including R16.4 trillion, or 35 percent, in past due accounts; enterprise accounts receivable amounted to R43.8 trillion, including R18.1 trillion, or 41 percent, in past due accounts. Russian Federation enterprises accounted for the greatest share of past due accounts--R16.0 trillion, or 98 percent; and CIS and Baltic countries through direct contracts--for R0.3 trillion, or 1.5 percent. Enterprise accounts receivable in transactions between Russian Federation enterprises amounted to R16.5 trillion, or 91 percent of the total amount. Past due accounts of enterprises located on the territory of CIS and Baltic countries in direct contracts with Russian enterprises amounted to R0.6 trillion, or 3.4 percent. The status of account-clearing relations of enterprises and organizations in Russian industry, construction, transportation, and agriculture in direct contracts with enterprises located on the territory of CIS and Baltic countries was characterized by the following data (billions of rubles): Past due accounts receivable payable as of as of as of as of 01/10/93 01/01/94 01/10/93 01/01/94 Russian enterprises' 479.7 619.5 224.5 252.9 accounts with CIS and Baltic enterprises--total including with enterprises in: Ukraine 172.3 208.5 95.8 96.5 Belarus 71.2 96.2 22.4 24.5 Uzbekistan 45.8 50.0 11.3 12.2 Kazakhstan 115.8 169.2 72.8 85.4 Georgia 6.1 2.7 1.3 5.6 Azerbaijan 7.7 11.7 3.0 4.8 Moldova 0.1 11.6 1.6 3.4 Kyrgyzstan 6.7 7.6 1.5 1.1 Tajikistan 8.0 11.6 4.0 2.8 Armenia 2.3 2.7 3.7 4.2 Turkmenistan 19.1 29.1 3.1 3.9 Latvia 8.7 11.7 1.7 3.6 Lithuania 4.7 4.1 1.6 4.2 Estonia 1.2 2.8 0.8 0.7 The greatest share of past due accounts in the total amount of receivables existed in accounts with enterprises in Kyrgyzstan (51.9 percent), Belarus (55.4 percent), Kazakhstan (56.8 percent), Latvia (58.5 percent), Uzbekistan (59.6 percent), Armenia (64.2 percent), Tajikistan (65.1 percent), and Turkmenistan (69.2 percent). The greatest share of past due accounts payable existed in accounts with enterprises in Ukraine (44.6 percent), Uzbekistan (45.0 percent), and Armenia (56.5 percent). Employment in Northern Regions The situation in the labor market in the northern regions is developing unevenly. While in Tyumen and Kamchatka Oblasts and the Republics of Komi and Sakha (Yakutia) the unemployed population figures per vacancy listed with the employment service are about the same as the average for Russia, in the Republic of Buryatia and Arkhangelsk and Sakhalin Oblasts it reaches 12-24 persons. Statistics organs conducted a simultaneous survey of 500 enterprises and organizations in industry, construction, transportation, and health care, located in the northern regions of the country. The respondents were managers and employees of these enterprises' personnel department. Over the past 1.5 years the total labor force at surveyed enterprises and organizations shrunk on the whole by 9 percent. The number of employees who have moved here from other territories fell by 18 percent as compared to 6 percent among other workers; in construction--by 26 percent and 16 percent, respectively. The proportional share of contract workers who came to the northern regions on a fixed-term special northern region contract in the total labor force fell over this period at surveyed enterprises from 22 percent to 20 percent, and in construction organizations--from 24 percent to 22 percent. Below are data on changes in the number of workers under fixed-term special northern region contract in relation to the total labor force at surveyed enterprises, by individual region. Proportional share of workers under fixed-term contract in relation to the total labor force 1992 1993 total including specialists workers Amur Oblast 21 15 17 14 Irkutsk Oblast 15 9 9 10 Kamchatka 29 27 24 29 Oblast Magadan Oblast 56 56 59 55 Murmansk Oblast 35 33 45 28 Maritime Kray 22 18 26 15 Sakhalin Oblast 25 21 27 18 Tomsk Oblast 15 9 17 6 Tyumen Oblast 33 30 40 25 Republic of 9 10 16 7 Komi Republic of 33 27 26 28 Sakha (Yakutia) At surveyed enterprises in Arkhangelsk Oblast, Khabarovsk and Krasnoyarsk Kray, and the Republic of Buryatia, workers attracted from other territories comprise between 2 and 7 percent. Among workers under fixed-term special northern region labor contract, 71 percent came from other regions of Russia, and 29 percent--from former USSR republics. Among the guest workers, 21 percent are under 30, and 12 percent are over 50. One out of every two surveyed workers has worked in the northern regions for more than 10 years, and 13 percent--for more than 20 years. According to the estimates of personnel department managers, about half of surveyed enterprises and organizations are experiencing a labor shortage. This problem is most acute in Murmansk Oblast, Khabarovsk Kray, and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), where between 55 and 63 percent of enterprises are short of skilled workers. A shortage of specialists was noted by 26 percent of managers of industrial enterprises, 21 percent of construction organizations, and 55 percent of health care institutions. In addition, the situation is substantially exacerbated by a mismatch in professions and skills on the demand and supply sides of the labor force. In the opinion of personnel service managers, in 1994 the labor shortage will be exacerbated at one out of five enterprises, and at one out of six a shortage may arise. In Buryatia, Sakhalin, Kamchatka, and Magadan Oblasts and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), 45-53 percent of surveyed managers expect this situation. At the same time, 31 percent of surveyed enterprises are not experiencing labor shortages, and 17 percent of surveyed managers indicated a potential labor force surplus. This will affect to a greater extent enterprises on the territory of the Komi Republic and Krasnoyarsk Kray (28-35 percent). In Tyumen Oblast one-third of personnel department managers assume that labor force requirements at their enterprises will decrease. The prospects of enterprises in northern regions with respect to labor force supply depend to a great extent on the intentions of individual workers currently working at enterprises regarding future work in the northern regions. To determine these intentions, a survey of 5,400 guest workers from other regions was conducted. More than one-half of respondents (53 percent) indicated that they intend to leave their current place of residence and employment; two-thirds of them do not have housing in the area they intend to move to. Of those workers who intend to leave the northern regions, 73 percent are persons with higher and secondary vocational education. One out of three is between 30 and 40 years old. Among the respondents who intend to leave the northern regions, 3 percent indicated that their labor contract for work in the northern regions is about to expire; the rest name other reasons prompting them to move. One out of four respondents indicated dissatisfaction with the pay level as one of their main reasons for leaving. The survey results showed that the system of preferences and allowances for people living and working in the northern regions has lost its determinant role in attracting labor resources to work in harsh natural and climatic conditions. Despite the higher nominal wages of workers in the northern regions, the pay's purchasing capacity does not provide substantial advantages as compared to other territories in Russia. For instance, the average monthly wage in Arkhangelsk, Kamchatka, Magadan, and Sakhalin Oblasts and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) recalculated as the cost of a comparable consumer food basket is on the same level as central and southern regions of Russia. Among the reasons for leaving, 13 percent of workers named poor food and consumer products supply. This problem is most acute in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) and Tyumen and Irkutsk Oblasts. A large group is comprised of workers who intend to leave the northern regions because of dissatisfaction with housing conditions. This reason was named by 10 percent of respondents, and in the Republic of Buryatia and Arkhangelsk and Amur Oblasts--by more than 15 percent. Ecological factors have a substantial influence on workers' migration mobility. The poor state of the environment was named as one of the main reasons for leaving by 24 percent of workers in Arkhangelsk Oblast, 19 percent in Irkutsk Oblast, 15 percent in Murmansk Oblast, and 11 percent in Khabarovsk Kray and Tyumen Oblast. In addition to the aforementioned main reasons prompting people to leave northern regions, the respondents indicated that they had to leave because of poor health, dissatisfaction with social and household services, difficulties in providing summer recreation for children, and access to school and other education for children. Many of those returning to near abroad countries before their labor contract expires are not certain that their housing, reserved for them for the period of absence, is still there, or that the preferential length of service record earned in Russia will be taken into account in qualifying for retirement. To the question regarding on what terms the respondents would agree to continue work in the northern regions, 9 percent replied that they would not stay under any circumstances. In the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Khabarovsk Kray, Arkhangelsk, and Tyumen Oblast the proportion of such workers was 14-16 percent. If material incentives are improved, 25 percent of workers and professionals among those who intend to leave would stay. Among managers, the share of those who would stay on condition of better pay is lower than among specialists and workers. In health care, 28 percent will reverse their decision to leave if their pay is increased.
