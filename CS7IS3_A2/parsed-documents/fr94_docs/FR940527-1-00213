FR940527-1-00213 FR940527-1-00014 Appendix E: Development of Update Framework for Prospective Payment System for Inpatient Hospital Capital-Related Costs I. Introduction For FY 1992 through FY 1995, ยง412.308(c)(1) provides that the update for the capital prospective payment rates (Federal rate and hospital-specific rate) will be based on a 2-year moving average of actual increases in Medicare inpatient capital costs per discharge. The regulations provide that, beginning in FY 1996, HCFA will determine the update in the capital prospective payment rates based on an analytical framework that will take into account (1) changes in the price of capital (which we will incorporate into a capital input price index), and (2) appropriate changes in capital requirements resulting from development of new technologies and other factors (such as the diffusion of existing technologies and existing hospital capacity and utilization). The objective of the capital update framework is to determine a rate of increase in aggregate capital prospective payments that, along with a rate of increase in DRG operating payments, ensures a joint flow of capital and operating services for efficient and effective care for Medicare patients. Although the analytical framework will not be employed to determine the annual update factor until FY 1996, we are presenting a series of preliminary models, using available data and concepts, of an update framework for the prospective payment system for hospital inpatient capital-related costs. We have presented a series of models in our FY 1992, FY 1993, and FY 1994 rulemaking documents. We received no comments on the most recent model of the framework, which appeared in the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46489). Below we discuss the current version of the model, based on our previously published version and our continued analysis of the data and concepts incorporated into the framework. The model update framework includes a capital input price index (CIPI) that parallels the operating input price index. The CIPI measures the pure price changes associated with changes in capital-related costs (prices x ``quantities''). The composition of capital-related costs is maintained at base-year FY 1987 proportions in the CIPI. As such, the composition of capital reflects the underlying capital acquisition process. We selected FY 1987 as the base year for this preliminary CIPI for consistency with the operating input price index. We would periodically update both the operating and the capital input price indexes to reflect the changing composition of inputs for capital and operating costs. We expect to have rebased the capital and operating input price indexes by the time we implement the final capital update framework for FY 1996. The CIPI below illustrates the methodology we propose to employ. The model capital update framework, like the revised operating update framework, incorporates several policy adjustments in addition to the CIPI. We would adjust for case-mix index-related changes, for intensity, and for the efficient and cost-effective use of capital (such as movable equipment, buildings and fixed equipment) in the hospital industry, as well as for error in the capital input price index forecast. In developing the model framework, we are attempting as much as possible to maintain consistency with the current operating framework, in order to facilitate the eventual development of a single prospective payment system update framework. We are also concerned with promoting the goals that motivated the adoption of the capital prospective payment system, especially the goals of promoting more effective and efficient utilization of capital resources in the hospital industry and establishing incentives for hospitals to make cost-effective decisions regarding acquisition of new capital resources. It is important to emphasize that this presentation represents our current thinking, and that we continue to encourage submission of comments and recommendations for further improvements. We are interested in suggestions regarding the CIPI, the proposed policy adjustment factor for intensity, and alternative methodologies for deriving the factors. We also welcome information concerning empirical studies and sources of data that could be useful in developing the framework. We will consider comments and recommendations on any aspect of the model framework in making further developments for presentation in the next version of the model. Our plan is to consider comments received on this model for inclusion in one further preliminary model to be included in this year's final rule for the prospective payment system. We will then formally propose an analytical update framework for implementation in FY 1996 during the rulemaking process for that year. II. ProPAC Recommendation for Updating the Capital Prospective Payment System Federal Rate ProPAC recommends the use of an update framework that includes a capital market basket component that measures 1-year changes in the purchase prices of a fixed basket of capital goods purchased by hospitals (Recommendation 10). The ProPAC framework also includes several policy adjustment factors. A forecast error correction factor adjusts payment rates so that the effects of past errors are not perpetuated. A financing policy adjustment accounts for the effects of substantial deviations from long-term trends in interest rates on hospital capital costs. The capital update framework also includes adjustments for scientific and technological advances, productivity, and case-mix change similar to those employed in the ProPAC operating update framework. In Recommendation 11, ProPAC also recommends the development and use of a combined update framework for the prospective payment systems for operating and capital-related costs for FY 1995. Response: Our long-term goal is to develop a single prospective payment system update framework. Currently, the regulations provide for the determination of the capital prospective payment update by means of a lagged 2-year average of actual Medicare capital cost increases. Once we have completed work on an analytical framework for the capital prospective payment update, we will begin to study development of a unified framework. In the meantime, we will continue to maintain consistency as much as possible with the current operating framework in order to facilitate the eventual development of a unified framework. The basic objectives of the ProPAC and HCFA update frameworks are compatible. The goal of each framework is to provide a rate of increase in capital prospective payments that, along with the rate of increase in operating prospective payments, will ensure a flow of capital and operating resources that will allow for efficient and effective care for Medicare patients. Both frameworks are designed to provide increases for the purchase of quality-enhancing new technologies. Both frameworks provide for case-mix adjustments to remove the effects of upcoding and to adjust for changes in within-DRG severity. Both frameworks also seek to encourage efficient capital spending behavior and to adjust the overall size of capital stock to appropriate levels. Although the frameworks adopt different methodologies for promoting some of these goals, they are philosophically compatible to the degree that they share these goals.
