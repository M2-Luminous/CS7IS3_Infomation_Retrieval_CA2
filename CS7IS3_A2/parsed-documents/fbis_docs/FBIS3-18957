The 20 billion-franc (3.5 billion-dollar) recapitalization plan is to be spread over three years, according to company officials who handed the plan to the group's unions Thursday. The plan includes 5,000 job losses, though no sackings, and a three-year wage freeze. The recapitalization is conditioned on the plan's acceptance by the workforce. Apart from the capital injection, the plan calls for increased productivity, a cut in the wage bill and reorganization of the company. The aim is to transform Air France from an "institution" into an "business," with a 30 percent increase in productivity over three years to achieve balance by 1997. Union leaders are to meet the new president of Air France, Christian Blanc, who replaced Bernard Attali after a strike last October, on Thursday to discuss the plan. Francois Cabrera of the CFDT [French Democratic Confederation of Labor] union said early Thursday that the refusal to inject vital resources without first guaranteeing union acceptance amounted to blackmail. Blanc's plan outlines a "wage freeze over three years with a complete block in the first year and possible adjustments in 1995 and 1996 depending on results," Cabrera said. The government said Wednesday that the allocation of second and third tranches of new capital would depend on the success of the restructuring. Since a strike last October forced the government to abandon an earlier restructuring plan, Air France's bankers have been paying its monthly fuel and salary bills. Under the Blanc rescue plan, Air France workers, who last October stopped flights into Paris by occupiing runways at the city's two main airports, were offered shares in the national carrier in return for the pay cuts. "The goal is that in three years a significant part of the capital of the company should belong to the personnel of Air France" (now 99.3 percent state-owned), Blanc said in a letter to workers. French Industry and External Trade Minister Gerard Longuet, in Tokyo Thursday, said that the need to recapitalize Air France had forced the government to privatise insurance group Assurance Generales de France (AGF). "We need a little more money, because you don't get something for nothing. We need money for Air France," he said. "We are selling one asset in order to revive another asset." Air France lost around 7.5 billion francs in 1993, equivalent to 13 percent of sales, and has debts totalling 6.1 billion dollars.
