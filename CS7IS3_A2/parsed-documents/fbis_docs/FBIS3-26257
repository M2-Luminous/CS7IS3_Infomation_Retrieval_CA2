At the conference, Governor Wan Xueyuan delivered a speech on implementing guidelines of the national economic work conference and the ninth provincial CPC congress, and on doing a good job in this year's economic work. Vice Governor Chai Songyue presided over yesterday's conference. Among the other provincial government leaders present at the conference were Liu Xirong, Long Anding, Zhang Qimei, and Xu Zhichun. In his speech, Wan Xueyuan first analyzed the current economic situation and said: Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, governments at various levels in the province have firmly grasped the central task of economic construction, and have made new achievements in deepening reform and stepping up development in 1993. First, having achieved a higher economic growth rate in the previous year, Zhejiang still maintained the trend of rapid growth. Second, following the guidelines of the central authorities, Zhejiang paid attention to making due efforts in straightening out financial and taxation order and has accomplished positive achievements in macroeconomic regulation and control. Third, centered around the establishment of a socialist market economic system, Zhejiang has taken new action in reform and opening up. One of the important features in last year's economic work was: While strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, Zhejiang continued to maintain a higher economic growth rate and take a still greater step in reform and opening up, and accumulating preliminary experience for doing a good job in macroeconomic regulation and control under new economic conditions in the future. Wan Xueyuan said: The year 1994 is an important year for comprehensively promoting reform and continuing to step up economic development. It is also a year of crucial importance to the implementation of the 8th Five-Year Plan. The international and domestic environments will provide favorable conditions for a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth this year. The reform in the systems of taxation, banking, investment, foreign trade, and management of state assets will offer more opportunities for accelerating economic development, and Zhejiang will continue to expect a favorable trend in economic development this year. Naturally, some contradictions inherent in the economic life remain to be solved, and after the release of the central authorities' significant reform measures, the impact of the friction aroused from the transfer of the old system to the new one on Zhejiang's economic development at a certain stage brooks no underestimation. Despite many difficulties, opportunity is still the priority. We should fully recognize the favorable conditions for reform and development, and seize the opportune moment to promote reform and step up development. Wan Xueyuan expounded the guiding ideology and tasks for provincial economic work this year. The guiding ideology for this year's economic work is: Comprehensively carry out the guidelines of the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 9th provincial CPC congress; further emancipate the minds; seize the opportunity; deepen reform; improve infrastructure; develop markets; upgrade quality; bring about a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth; promote social and political stability; and strive for basically fulfilling various targets of the Eighth Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. Speaking on further emancipating minds and intensifying reform, Wang Xueyuan said: In reforming the macro system, we should follow the national plan and take the initiative in adapting to this plan on the basis of Zhejiang's actual situation. After we have adopted the new financial and tax systems, we should make genuine efforts to shift the focus of our financial and tax work to readjusting the industrial structure and product mix, achieving higher economic returns, tapping new tax resources that will increase our revenues, and striving to make a bigger "cake." According to the demands of the CPC Central Committee, we should conscientiously reform the systems governing banking and investment affairs, the management of fixed state-owned assets, and the management of external economic relations. The reform of the property rights system will be the center of this year's reform. In accordance with the requirements set for modern enterprises, we should categorize various projects and achieve breakthroughs in key areas. Collective enterprises in urban and rural areas should carry out the corporate system, and some fair-sized private enterprises should also be guided to adopt the corporate system. Large and medium state-owned enterprises should be restructured to become corporations, most enterprises should be restructured to become limited-liability companies, and some enterprises should be turned into incorporated companies. As for those small enterprises and those operationally hopeless medium enterprises, they should be handled with even more flexible measures. Some may be leased or auctioned off, some may become collectively or independently operated units, and some may go bankrupt. Under the premise of ensuring the dominant role of public ownership, positive efforts should be made to develop private economies. To supplement the modern enterprise system, we should quicken the pace of cultivating the market system, and give priority to cultivating markets of important production ingredients such as banking, property rights transfer, labor, technology, real estate, and capital goods. The reform of the social security system is a very important supplementary reform vital to whether enterprise reform can go deeper. It is also important for maintaining social stability. The general orientation of the reform is to break the bounds among workers of various enterprises; consolidate the management, separate enterprises from the government, and adopt different measures in urban and rural areas. The cost should be rationally borne by three sides -- the state, units, and individuals. We must speed up restructuring of the urban housing system. While focusing on selling public-owned quarters, we should "sell, rent, and build" living quarters at the same time to quicken the construction of urban housing projects -- especially those housing projects for easing housing congestion and affordable housing projects for low-income people -- and promote the construction of living quarters sold as a commodity. Speaking on heightening the awareness of opening up and developing an open economy, Wan Xueyuan said: The key for Zhejiang to develop an open economy and open up wider to the outside world still lies in further heightening the awareness of opening up. We should perfect Zhejiang's development strategy by putting ourselves in the great international environment, and adjust Zhejiang's economic structure according to the requirements set for an open economy. This year we should launch a provincial campaign to remobilize and reeducate the people on the need to heighten the awareness of opening up and opening wider to the outside world and seize current opportunities at home and abroad to promote Zhejiang's external economic relations to a new level. To develop an open economy, we should open wider to the outside world by following the plan drawn up by the provincial party committee and the provincial government. In foreign trade, we should do a good job in linking up the old and new systems to guarantee a smooth transition. We should systematically rewrite the rules governing property rights of foreign trade enterprises, and their organization and management. We must have a stronger concept for developing "sizable economy and trade" and encourage all quarters to earn more foreign exchange through expanding export. We should continue to steadily develop businesses of contracting foreign projects, exporting labor services, and providing consultative services for designs so that we can promote export of equipment and ordinary commodities through economic ties, trade, and technological services. We should actively and steadily develop enterprises abroad and encourage overseas enterprises with the necessary resources to gradually develop into overseas enterprise groups with multiple functions such as production, trade, export of labor services, bringing in foreign capital, and training qualified personnel. Speaking on intensifying the construction of agriculture and the infrastructure to lay a firm foundation for stepping up economic development, Wan Xueyuan said: The role of agriculture has become even more important as the foundation of Zhejiang's economy. Governments at various levels and all departments concerned must implement the measures set by the rural work conference to the letter. It is necessary to use various economic and administrative means to keep the sown area for grain at a certain level. First, the fields for growing grain must not be left uncultivated; we must take necessary administrative measures, intensify supervision, and speed up the cultivation of such fields. Second, it is necessary to control the farmland that switches to new crops after growing certain crops for years. Third, we should increase economic returns by improving and popularizing strains of grain, promoting economies of scale, and running well the sophisticated processing of grain and cooking oil. We should continue to readjust and optimize the structure of Zhejiang's agricultural production and take the advantage of the province's supremacy in diversified agricultural production to actually push the agricultural production to the market. The development of village and town enterprises, and high-yield, high-efficiency, and fine-quality agriculture are the two wheels carrying our rural areas toward market and overall development; we should continue to promote the process of turning rural areas into markets through deepening reform in accordance with the principle of making progress in the course of development and developing in the course of reform. We should stabilize the right of contracting land and make good use of land use rights. The economies of scale in agriculture should be vigorously promoted in areas where rural economy develops at a faster pace to raise the level of socialized division of labor and coordination in agriculture. The partnership system in the form of stock sharing should be popularized and promoted in village and town enterprises, and energetic support should be given to sizable village and town enterprises in re-organization and transformation so they will be upgraded to a new level. In the meantime, the partnership system in the form of stock sharing should also be promoted in various sectors such as rural plantations, aquatic product breeding, and circulation as soon as possible. Regarding this year's work on rural areas, agriculture, and peasants, we should strive to increase peasants' income: On the one hand, we should vigorously expand production and strive for a good harvest of agricultural production, particularly grain, cotton, cooking oil, and vegetables. We should increase peasants' income through developing high-yield, high-efficiency, and fine-quality agriculture as well as developing village and town enterprises and private enterprises. On the other hand, we should continue to look to the work of reducing peasants' burden, step up the formulation of laws and regulations, standardize the collection of fees from peasants, and protect peasants' interests. We should continue to make greater efforts to eliminate poverty, step up the pace of relocating people in order to improve their living standards, and attach importance to anti-poverty policies. Speaking on strengthening the construction of the infrastructure, Wan Xueyuan said: We must keep the idea of advancing ahead of others in mind, and pool the strength of the entire society to steadfastly construct Zhejiang's key infrastructure including transportation, power supply, telecommunications, and water conservancy. We should come up with more ideas for raising funds and, along with the reform in the investment system, constantly deepen the reform in the system of investing in infrastructure such as transportation, power supply, telecommunications, and water conservancy. We should gradually introduce the corporate system and improve and perfect the responsibility system of investment by legal entities. Speaking on using the market as a guide, and scientific and technological progress as a motive force to raise the quality of economic growth, Wan Xueyuan said: As market forces play an increasingly bigger role and as reform deepens, market competition will become increasingly fierce and economic growth achieved through the increase of output will be more difficult to sustain. We will lose many markets if we do not step up readjustment of our industrial structure, pay more attention to product quality, and increase economic returns. We must ensure tangible progress in this year's economic work. First, we must pay attention to the economy of scale and raise the standards of our industry-based economy. While continuing to maintain the vitality of our "light and small" enterprises by raising the level of cooperation in their specialized fields, we must select large and high-standard projects when we establish new enterprises. Particularly in developed coastal areas, we must raise the threshold of new projects and approach the question from the viewpoint of restructuring the province's industry. On no account should we launch low-standard, duplicate processing industrial projects. Second, we must adjust product mixes and raise product qualities. We must guide enterprises in vigorously developing readily salable new products and new varieties in different categories to satisfy consumers in different sectors and at different levels; and at the same time, we must earnestly protect the reputation of Zhejiang's products by mercilessly cracking down on the manufacture and sale of substandard and fake products. To raise the quality of Zhejiang's products, we must rely on science and technology and education, intensify technological transformation, and encourage technology research and new product development. We must select a number of industries to carry out industry-wide technological transformation. In accordance with the demand to industrialize scientific and technological undertakings, transform research institutions into enterprises, and commercialize scientific and technological achievements to sell them in the market, we must actively reform our science and technology management structure, and establish and develop a mechanism that encourages enterprises to take the initiative to obtain scientific and technological research results. We should put more emphasis on training practical personnel in schools. We should deepen education reform and step up training talented personnel, using the resources of our entire society. Third, we must step up our efforts to develop backbone industries. We must further work out sound plans to develop electric, machinery, textile, silk, chemical, food, and building materials industries, and draw up specific plans for implementing development of such industries as power and telecommunications equipment, transportation equipment, pharmaceuticals, construction machinery, new-type high-grade synthetic materials, and new-type building materials. Speaking of ways to show earnest concern for and arrange well the people's daily life, and to do tangible things for them, Wan Xueyuan said: This year's reform will enter a period during which difficult problems will be tackled. We must not take the price situation lightly. Governments at all levels must show concern for and arrange well the people's daily life and earnestly do some good things for the people from the viewpoint of stabilizing the general situation and society, and ensuring the smooth progress of reform. First, we must make adequate arrangements for the people's food and vegetables. To resolve the problem of "vegetable basket," we must first stabilize and develop vegetable bases; second, actively create conditions to gradually set up funds to regulate the prices of vegetables, pigs, and other products; and third, implement sound reform of the vegetable circulation structure, and cultivate and establish a market system. The price issue involves the question of the capacity of our budget, enterprises, and masses to tolerate the changes, and the question of social stability. We must do everything possible to successfully manage the market and increase the residents' income and effective supply. We must continue to strengthen our supervision and control of commodity prices and strictly forbid speculation and hoarding to jack up commodity prices and manipulate the market so as to reap exorbitant profits. We must bring into full play the role of public opinion and the masses in monitoring commodity prices. We must establish a mechanism promoting normal income growth and do our utmost to ensure that the increase in workers' wages exceeds the level of price increases. Wan Xueyuan stressed: Our tasks related to reform, development, and stability are extremely heavy this year. New situations and problems will continue to emerge. To achieve our economic goals, governments at all levels must pay particular attention to and strengthen leadership over economic work. First, we must change the government's leadership functions in economic work. Second, we must intensify study, investigation, and research. Third, we must strengthen leadership and pay close attention to implementation. While conducting economic work, governments at all levels should also firmly uphold the policy of fostering both material and cultural and ideological progress, and attach equal importance to both. We must pay close attention to building spiritual civilization, comprehensively tackling problems of public order, building a clean government, and carrying out other undertakings of social development. Wan Xueyuan concluded by urging everyone to use their brains, spend more time on the question of development, and pay more attention to stability. He asked them to think ahead, boldly practice, have the courage to lead and make breakthroughs, seek development in the course of reform, and deepen reform in the process of development. At the same time, he urged them to pay particular attention to social and economic stability, and set people's minds at ease. Responsible comrades from various city (prefectural) and county governments as well as provincial departments attended the meeting. Meetings on planning, economic work, financial work, economic restructuring, and foreign relations and trade were simultaneously held.
