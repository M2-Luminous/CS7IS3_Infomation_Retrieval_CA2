FR940826-2-00090 FR940826-2-00055 15 U.S.C. 16(e) (emphasis added). The courts have recognized that the term ``public interest'' ``take[s] meaning from the purposes of the regulatory legislation.'' NAACP v. Federal Power Comm'n, 425 U.S. 662, 669 (1976). Since the purpose of the antitrust laws is to ``preserv[e] free and unfettered competition as the rule of trade,'' Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States , 356 U.S. 1, 4 (1958), the focus of the ``public interest'' inquiry under the Tunney Act is whether the proposed final judgment would serve the public interest in free and unfettered competition. United States v. American Cyanamid Co., 719 F.2d 558, 565 (2d Cir. 1983), cert. denied , 465 U.S. 1101 (1984); United States v. Waste Management, Inc. , 1985&hyph;2 Trade Cas. ¶66,651, at 63,046 (D.D.C. 1985). In conducting this inquiry, ``the Court is nowhere compelled to go to trial or to engage in extended proceedings which might have the effect of vitiating the benefits of prompt and less costly settlement through the consent decree process.'' 12 Rather, 12 119 Cong. Rec. 24598 (1973). See United States v. Gillette Co. , 406 F. Supp. 713, 715 (D. Mass. 1975). A ``public interest'' determination can be made properly on the basis of the Competitive Impact Statement and Response to Comments filed pursuant to the APPA. Although the APPA authorizes the use of additional procedures, 15 U.S.C. 16(f), those procedures are discretionary. A court need not invoke any of them unless it believes that the comments have raised significant issues and that further proceedings would aid the court in resolving those issues. See H.R. Rep. 93&hyph;1463, 93rd Cong. 2d Sess. 8&hyph;9, reprinted in (1974) U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 6535, 6538. Absent a showing of corrupt failure of the government to discharge its duty, the Court, in making the public interest finding, should *␣*␣* carefully consider the explanations of the government in the competitive impact statement and its responses to comments in order to determine whether those explanations are reasonable under the circumstances. United States v. Mid-America Dairymen, Inc. , 1977&hyph;1 Trade Cas. ¶61,508, at 71,980 (W.D. Mo. 1977). It is also unnecessary for the district court to ``engage in an unrestricted evaluation of what relief would best serve the public.'' United States v. BNS, Inc., 858 F.2d 456, 462 (9th Cir. 1988) quoting United States v. Bechtel Corp. , 648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1083 (1981). Precedent requires that The balancing of competing social and political interests affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must be left, in the first instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General. The court's role in protecting the public interest is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree. The court is required to determine not whether a particular decree is the one that will best serve society, but whether the settlement is `` within the reaches of the public interest. '' More elaborate requirements might undermine the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement by consent decree. 13 13 United States v. Bechtel, 648 F.2d at 666 (citations omitted); see United States v. BNS, Inc. , 858 F.2d at 463; United States v. National Broadcasting Co. , 449 F. Supp. 1127, 1143 (C.D. Cal. 1978); United States v. Gillette Co. , 406 F. Supp. at 716. See also United States v. American Cyanamid Co. , 719 F.2d at 565. A proposed consent decree is an agreement between the parties which is reached after exhaustive negotiations and discussions. Parties do not hastily and thoughtlessly stipulate to a decree because, in doing so, they Waive their right to litigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable risk of litigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in exchange for the saving of cost and the elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the litigation. United States v. Armour & Co. , 402 U.S. 673, 681 (1971). The proposed consent decree, therefore, should not be reviewed under a standard of whether it is certain to eliminate every anticompetitive effect of a particular practice or whether it mandates certainty of free competition in the future. Court approval of a final judgment requires a standard more flexible and less strict than the standard required for a finding of liability. ``[A] proposed decree must be approved even if it falls short of the remedy the court would impose on its own, as long as it falls within the range of acceptability or is `within the reaches of public interest.' (citations omitted).'' 14 14 United States v. American Tel. and Tel. Co. , 552 F. Supp. 131, 150 (D.D.C.), aff'd sub nom. Maryland v. United States , 460 U.S. 1001 (1982) quoting United States v. Gillette Co., supra , 406 F. Supp. at 716; United States v. Alcan Aluminum, Ltd. , 605 F. Supp. 619, 622 (W.D. Ky 1985).
