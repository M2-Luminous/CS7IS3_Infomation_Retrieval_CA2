Participating in the joint program are four Japanese organizations including the governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp., which operates Japan's prototype fast breeder reactor "Monju" in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture. France's Atomic Energy Agency and British Nuclear Fuel Ltd., both involved in the development of the European Fast Reactor (EFR), represent the European side. Japan plans to have its first demonstration fast breeder with a planned output of 660 megawatts early next century. The EFR, designed to generate 1,500 megawatts of electric power, is still in a conceptual stage. In the agreement both sides pledge to promote the mutual use of existing research facilities to improve knowledge about reactor coolants, fuel and safety measures.
