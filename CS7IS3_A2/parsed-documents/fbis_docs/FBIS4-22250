[Question] Sergey Mikhaylovich, there are many very anxious letters in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA's mail from pensioners, especially from the "sovereign" territories. [Answer] Pension guarantees really do not directly relate to the problems of our ministry. But I am not surprised that you are asking me this question. I cannot help but recognize that the disastrous position of pensioners is an all-Russian calamity. And it is even broader if one recalls the position of our fellow countrymen, especially pensioners in the so-called near abroad. One wants to exclaim: Look how these people live today! Do you want to live that way tomorrow? In my time I more than once raised the problem of pension guarantees in the country. I was concerned and am concerned most of all about the situation in the "hot spots," in regions of interethnic conflict. The Ministry of National and Regional Policy Affairs receives, for example, hundreds of letters from pensioners in Chechnya. For a year they have not been able to receive their humble pensions. It is impossible to read these appeals without an ache in your heart. People write who have worked for decades for the good of our Fatherland. Many of them whose health was undermined during the Stalinist years when they experienced deportation or lived in exile. Why are they being punished again--now in their old age?! What kind of price is this for the Law on the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples? As a politician, a jurist and simply as a person I see the task of our leaders, the task of reform as creating a society in which each citizen would be reliably protected from accidental occurrences, would be guaranteed a peaceful old age. [Question] You are saying that you have raised the question of pension guarantees more than once. What happened? Did you achieve anything? Is it the same as Chechnya in other republics? [Answer] What is the reason for the nonpayment of pensions in Chechnya? It is simple to open the coffer but the key to it is in the pocket of the politicians or pseudopoliticians, whichever you prefer. The system of pension guarantees, simply speaking, is built on the basis of mutual credits of the generations. We use the fruits of our labor for those who are now, as they say, on a well-earned vacation, but a pension is paid to them from the pocket of those who are working today, by deductions of taxes into the Pension Fund. There is one fund for the whole country but each republic or each oblast has its own branches where they receive deductions from enterprises and local organizations. It would seem that nothing could be simpler: the money arrives in the local branch of the fund and the local pensions are paid. But everything is much more complicated. In many regions the receipts do not cover the demands for payment. Here the better-off regions (more tax-intensive, if it can be expressed that way) come to help them, whose deductions enter the federal Pension Fund and the corresponding subsidies are distributed. Thus here is interdependence. Now imagine that one of these republics, especially a subsidized one, declares its sovereignty. But why imagine? This is precisely what Chechnya did. And the National Bank of the Chechen Republic unilateraly severed its relations with the Russian Federation Central Bank and was no longer able to finance these expenditures from the Russian Federation Pension Fund. What that led to, we have already talked about. In the beginning of 1993 Chechnya was allotted 2.5 billion rubles [R] to pay pensions. [Question] Did this resolve the problem? [Answer] Of course it did not resolve it. They stopped talking about this fact itself, and I think that not even all the pensioners in Chechnya suspect it. And although the money finally reached them, we together with the Russian Federation Ministry of Social Security and the Pension Fund adopted a decision allowing the Russian social security organs to pay pensions until the normalization of the situation in Chechny, excluding pensions to inhabitants of the given republic outside its borders. In order to receive the money due them, the pensioners living in Chechnya have to appeal to the social security organs of any region of Russia. Of course, this is not a way out. It is possible that the latest decisions of the Duma will help stabilize the situation. Here it is appropriate to say that it would seem that for our ministry the particular part of the problem of nonpayment of pensions in Chechnya focuses on a whole complex of complicated tasks. Millions of Russian citizens are living in other regions outside of legal and social security. I have to say that for more than three years the Russian Federation Constitution, laws or Russian legality have not existed on the territory of Tatarstan. In essence, Russia's general state sovereignty has not been disseminated in Tatarstan. Now we have concluded a well known treaty with Tatarstan. Has it removed all the problems? I don't think so. Has it eased the situation? Yes, it has eased it. In any case, it gave us the possibility to remove the formal contradictions between the constitutions and provides a legal basis for resolving other disputed issues. In a word, it is necessary to actively seek ways out of situations that at first glance seem to be dead ends. [Question] In general how much is it possible to influence the state of affairs under the current conditions? How do you influence, let's say, the course of elections to local organs of power which are collapsing in a whole number of regions? What do the facts about the confrontation between elected and appointed representatives of power say about this? [Answer] You are asking questions for which there are no simple answers. They are all interconnected. Let's take them in order. Yes, elections to the local organs of power are proceeding with difficulty. It is obvious that the facts about opposition to the representatives of executive power in local areas reflect negatively on the preparation for the elections. Let's say that in Yaroslavl Oblast the administration ratified the decree "On Organs of Local Power..." only on 20 December and then three times, up until 8 February, changes were introduced into it. The President's representative proposed holding the elections of organs of local self-government (except for the oblast duma) in the autumn. As a result of the elections 17 out of 23 districts made up the oblast duma. In six districts they were disrupted due to the [neivka?] of the voters. In Yaroslavl, Uglich and Tutayev the dumas will work without a full complement. I think that problems of local self-government are now coming into the forefront. It is precisely on this level that we can and should resolve many questions inlcuding those that are national in their essence and in their form. We in the ministry are creating a department on issues of local self-government. [Question] Sergey Mikhaylovich, it is the general opinion that you are one of the most mobile politicians and that more often than the others you are in the local areas. How do you evaluate the situation in Russia as a whole? [Answer] The general situation in the Russian Federation can be evaluated in two ways. On one hand the government and society have recognized the failure of shock therapy. On the other hand, it is reassuring that a realistic way out of the dead end has been outlined in the president's messages and in the program of the government leaders. This course toward the social orientation of economic policy, stabilization of production, its structural restructuring, serious anti-inflationary measures and federalization of Russia is opening up the potential of the Russian regions and is the only way of maintaining the integrity of the Russian state. Unfortunately, political instability is being maintained. Disinformation about some kind of plot is being spread, which further destabilizes the situation in society. [Question] This is your first appearance in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA as a minister. Therefore, please, say a few words about the tasks of your ministry. [Answer] Structurally we divide them into three large blocs. The first of these is nationality affairs: repressed and deported peoples, problems of the Russian Germans, a program for rebirth of the peoples of Russia which the Supreme Soviet Council of Nationalities is still working on. It needs to be implemented. The second bloc is purely regional policy in its financial and economic sense. We will create interdepartment structures jointly with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economics to deal with oblast, kray, and republic budgets and the siting of production forces, and to create funds for supporting the regions. Without real financial resources we cannot launch one program, cannot resolve one national conflict. The third bloc touches on regional policy but is also sufficiently autonomous. It is the the North. Problems of its socioeconomic development, small peoples, maintenance of its ecological assets and traditional ways of life. Much can be said about our plans and ways to realize them, but I think that there will still be possibilities to meet with the readers of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. [Interviewer ends] Of course.
