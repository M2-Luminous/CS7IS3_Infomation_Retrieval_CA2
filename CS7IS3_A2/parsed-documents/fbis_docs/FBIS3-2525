"This shows that to attack China by using the human rights issue is unpopular," he said, to a thunderous applause from the NPC deputies. The premier said, "deputies, I would like to tell you a just- received news dispatch. In a vote yesterday evening by the U.N. Human Rights Commission, an anti-China motion raised by some countries met with failure once again. This shows convincingly that it is unpopular to attack China by using the human rights issue. Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all justice- upholding countries for their support to China on behalf of the Chinese Government and people." The premier said, "China values human rights and is willing to discuss the matter with other members of the international community on the basis of mutual equality." "However, it will never allow anyone to interfere in its internal affairs under any pretext," he said. The Chinese Government supports a latest resolution adopted by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights denouncing certain countries for putting pressure on developing countries in this regard, he added.
