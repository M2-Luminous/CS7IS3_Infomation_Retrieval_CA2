Addressing the Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, the leader of the Pakistan delegation, Mr. Iqbal Akhund, said the only possible solution to the Kashmir dispute is the one which is acceptable to the people of Kashmir. He said that it will bring peace to the people of the subcontinent and strengthen the forces of democracy and progress in Pakistan and India. The Pakistan delegate said that over the last 45 years, India has maintained its occupation of occupied Kashmir, but has been unable to win the support of the Kashmiri people.
