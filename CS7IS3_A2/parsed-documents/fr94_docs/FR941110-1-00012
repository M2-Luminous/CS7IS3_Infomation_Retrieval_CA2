ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations in order to more clearly reflect Customs statutory authority to open and examine baggage and vehicles without the permission of the owners of the baggage and vehicles. These amendments will make the pertinent Customs regulations consistent with Customs statutory authority to inspect and search baggage and vehicles coming into the United States. DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 9, 1995. ADDRESSES: Written comments (preferably in triplicate) may be submitted to and inspected at the Regulations Branch, Office of Regulations and Rulings, U.S. Customs Service, 1301 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, D.C. 20229. Comments submitted may be inspected at the Regulations Branch, Office of Regulations & Rulings, 1099 14th Street NW., Suite 4000, Washington, D.C. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lars-Erik Hjelm, Office of the Chief Counsel, U.S. Customs Service, 202&hyph;927&hyph;6900. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background There are several statutory provisions which give the U. S. Customs Service the authority to open and examine baggage. The primary provisions are sections 482, 1461, 1462, 1496, 1581 and 1582 of Title 19, United States Code (19 U.S.C. 482, 1461, 1462, 1496, 1581, and 1582). Section 482 authorizes Customs to search vehicles and persons and to seize undeclared merchandise or merchandise imported contrary to law. Section 1461 authorizes Customs to inspect all merchandise and baggage brought into the United States from contiguous countries. Section 1461 also authorizes Customs officers to require that owners of baggage open it or furnish keys for doing so. Section 1462 authorizes Customs to inspect the contents of all baggage and vehicles brought into the United States. Section 1462 also authorizes Customs to seize and forfeit the contents of such imported baggage or vehicle which is subject to duty or which constitutes a prohibited importation. Section 1496 authorizes Customs to examine the baggage of people arriving in the United States. Section 1581(a) authorizes Customs to board vessels and vehicles and to examine, inspect and search the vessels or vehicles and everyone and everything thereon. Section 1582 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to write regulations concerning the search of persons and baggage. It also authorizes officers or agents of the United States Government to detain and search, under such regulations, any persons coming into the United States from foreign countries. Proposal The statutes cited above grant Customs broad authority to inspect, search and seize baggage and vehicles coming into the United States. The current Customs Regulations do not accurately reflect these statutes; therefore, Customs intends to revise the regulations, specifically 19 CFR 123.63 and 19 CFR 148.21, to more clearly reflect the fact that Customs has the statutory authority to open and examine baggage, vehicles and compartments thereof without the permission of the owners. Of course, if at all possible, Customs will ask the owner or operator to unlock the vehicle, compartment or baggage. Comments Before adopting this proposal, consideration will be given to written comments timely submitted to Customs. Submitted comments will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Inspection Act (5 U.S.C. 552), ยง1.4, Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and ยง103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., at the Regulations Branch, Office of Regulations and Rulings, 1099 14th Street NW., Suite 4000, Washington, D.C.
