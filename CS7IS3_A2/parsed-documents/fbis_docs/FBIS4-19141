This time, the bombs were dropped in passing, as it were, despite the fact that the attacks on the Serbian ground positions were a more dramatic precedent than the downing of the aircraft in February. UN Commander Michael Rose called for air support; his boss in New York approved the operation; and NATO dispatched two U.S. F-16 fighters from Italy to Gorazde, which were followed by more attacks on Monday [11 April]. The pilots dropped three normal 250-kg bombs on Sunday, which hit two tanks. It was as simple as that. A look at the tactical side should sober up a little all those who have always rejected an armed intervention with military arguments. They claimed that the territory is too broken and that the targets are too mobile to be discerned and hit. In fact, NATO is quite familiar with the territory and the targets. During the shelling of Gorazde, it was not even necessary to use sophisticated weapons for the minibattle. The attack was carried out in the same way as that of 1917 -- with aircraft in the air and UN observers on the ground who determined the targets and passed on the coordinates. One should not yet speak of a success after the isolated attacks on Sunday and Monday. A "real" war is a thousand times more difficult -- not least because the most stupid opponent also learns from his defeats and acts in a cleverer way the next time. Yet the downing of the four Serbian planes at the end of February and the air strikes at the beginning of the week have shown that there are military options that may have the desired political effect if a credible NATO ultimatum alone led to an easing of the Serbian stranglehold of Sarajevo in February. Still, one cannot really be happy about what happened -- for numerous and very different reasons. First of all, it is obvious that U.S. aircraft took the initiative in both cases. Are there no F-16 fighters in the European arsenals? Well, there are large numbers -- which is a sad symbol indeed. In spite of the fact that Bosnia is not situated in the Rocky Mountains, the Europeans seem to lack the required courage and cooperation. The objection is correct that the large UN contingents of the British and the French on the ground are facing the biggest risk in the event of a Serbian retaliation. However, a decision has to be made: Either one accepts the hostage fate and renounces military gestures -- or one makes it clear to the Serbs, including those in Belgrade, what they are facing in the event of such an adventure. The "escalation dominance" (jargon for the "stronger battalions") does not lie on the side of the Serbs. Second: Why, for such a long time, have NATO and the United Nations allowed the Serbs to gradually conquer the official "protected zone" of Gorazde? Washington in particular only acted after pursuing a zig-zag course for months. It was the Pentagon that conveyed the impression of a "green light" to the Serbs (as opposition leader Dole pointed out) by making statements that sounded as though the United States was not at all interested in Gorazde. However, it was easy to foresee that the Serbs would do two things after their forced withdrawal from Sarajevo: Test the resolve of the Europeans again and make up for their loss. One must now ask the fundamental question: What is to be done? The hesitant attitude in Gorazde has shown that the West does not act, but only react -- at the last minute. We know the reasons, which are weighty indeed: Differences of opinion, lack of leadership, the attitude of the Germans who want the others to take the lead, and the legitimate fear of a "Beirut in the Balkans." Also, peace cannot be achieved by dropping bombs in this inferno. But those who issue guarantees that turn out to be a mere bluff after several weeks -- as happened in Gorazde -- will not achieve anything. Moreover, sudden strikes out of the blue are no strategy either. What can the West do now? It can certainly not produce peace like a rabbit out of a diplomat's hat. Yet it might prevent the Serbian imperialism from triumphing. It might curb the military advantage of the Serbs with well-dosed and predictable force -- but no more. Like in Kurdistan, protection zones must really be protected. In this way, the insight might grow in Bosnia and Belgrade that the war must after all be transferred to the negotiating table after two years. It is a matter of course that the Russians must also be involved in the talks so that they are not offended and undermine what is also in their interest: Peace in the Balkans. (Boris Yeltsin has already complained to President Clinton in a piqued manner and demanded "consultation between Moscow and Washington prior to such decisions.") It also goes without saying that Muslims and Croats must not be free to wage wars of conquest. The West must not unconditionally support one side or the other. Washington and its allies may not be able to pursue such a complicated policy over a longer period. However, a peace policy based on hesitation and a zig-zag course are not useful concepts either.
