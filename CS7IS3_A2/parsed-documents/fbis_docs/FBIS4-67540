KYODO NEWS SERVICE obtained a copy of the draft program sketched out by the agency's central environmental council, headed by University of Tokyo Professor Emeritus Jiro Kondo. The draft says, "the expansion of human social and economic activities...led to the excessive use of natural resources so as to nullify the environment's ability to restore original levels of the resources, while depleting wildlife and reducing its ability to survive." "It also triggered pollution of the environment by expanding the discharge of unnecessary waste," it said. "It is also important to defend and preserve the environment by conquering the sort of environmental destruction attributable to modern lifestyles in cities," it said. The draft urged the public in developed countries to "question the current mode of civilization where prevailing values have encouraged mass production, huge consumption and the subsequent vast discharge of waste into the environment." The report also urged individual members of Japanese society to "take action" useful in staving off environmental deterioration. However, it stopped short of setting numerical targets and specific timetables that could be referred to as yardsticks for attaining the cleanup of contaminated areas. The report also urged the government and local communities to step up efforts to preserve and protect small forests in cities that have survived the rapid urbanization of Japan. It cautioned that such forests, beaches and paddy fields in mountainous areas are on the brink of losing their natural capabilities to provide shelter to small animals and to clean up contaminated water. The draft also urged efforts to prevent wildlife not native to Japan, like the black bass, from damaging Japan's ecosystem. Such wildlife have infiltrated the Japanese environment following their intentional or unwitting importation, the report said.
