They feel that if funding remains fixed at the level of 1993 and the first quarter of this year, meeting only 10 percent of the SNF's requirements, then by the year 2000 the strategic missile forces (SMF) will have only 90 launch facilities left at their disposal. Three years after that there will be none left at all. So, the whole point of complying with the stipulations of the START I Treaty and of ratifying START II will have been lost. The aims of these documents, which set out parameters for reduction of strategic offensive armaments, will have been achieved and exceeded "automatically." Colonel General Vasiliy Vorobyev, head of the main directorate for the military budget and funding of the Russian Defense Ministry, told ITAR-TASS today that the funds earmarked for the Defense Ministry are scarcely enough to settle debts for electricity, food, property services, and municipal charges. He said that the payment of debts for supplies of equipment and armaments was also in doubt. There is no funding for research and development work, including research in areas regarded as crucial to national security. Military experts are of the view that the budget should be adjusted in order to ensure that Russia remains a nuclear power and does not lose its status. When defense spending comes up for consideration in the State Duma for a second time, it would be expedient, they say, to take account of the need to maintain nuclear parity as the main guarantee of the state's national security. In accordance with the international treaties, by the year 2000 Russia should have 900 SMF launch facilities. The aviation component of the SNF should have 900 weapons and the naval component 1,700. In line with the treaty, the total number of Russian nuclear warheads should be 3,500. This is rather fewer than the United States, but wholly sufficient to deter a potential enemy. This provision is enshrined in the new military doctrine and corresponds to the interests of national security.
