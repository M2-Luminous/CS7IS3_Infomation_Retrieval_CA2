Maj. Gen. Mufaz told correspondents that so far three bodies were found in the building in which the terrorists barricaded themselves. Mufaz says these terrorists were involved in a long series of attacks, including the murder of Mordekhay and Shalom Lapid in Hebron, and the murder of Avraham Zarbiv near the Cave of the Patriarchs. Maj. Gen. Mufaz said that following the operation in Hebron only 10 Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad terrorists remain operating in Judaea and Samaria. Mufaz added that the Hebron operation was made possible by strenuous Shin Bet efforts. According to Mufaz the house in which the terrorists hid served as a storehouse and a launch pad for Hamas terror acts.
