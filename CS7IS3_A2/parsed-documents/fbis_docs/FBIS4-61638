Nikolay Ilyich, this appointment is quite unusual, at least it seems so to journalists: a member of the opposition, an opponent being appointed a member of the government. What will you be doing in the government without a portfolio? [Travkin] First, a few words about opposition. We have two types of opposition in society--the criticizing opposition, which simply keeps barking and the working opposition. I had nothing to do with the former. [passage omitted] The government today has two tasks: to reform Russia's economy, not just the oil and gas sector or agriculture. Second, we must build the state, with all its institutions. [passage omitted] [Medvedev] Are we to understand that you will take a decision in the government, carry it out in your Shakhovskoy rayon, and then, as leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, criticize it? [Travkin] No, that is not how it will be. [Medvedev] In effect, you will be a government representative in the Duma? [Travkin] No. Why? I was a deputy and leader of a faction in the Duma and remain such. I will represent the interests of the local economy. [Medvedev] A representative of the local economy at the top? [Travkin] This is right. We cannot be apes and set up everything in the rayons that has been set up at the level of the federation. [passage omitted]
