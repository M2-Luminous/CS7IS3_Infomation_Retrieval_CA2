It is such an exaggerated expression of support for multilateral action that to less alert readers it can give the impression that foreign policy and international law are exact synonyms, and that the only solution for any country, especially Brazil, can be found in international organizations. Minister Celso Amorim, who completed the brightest part of his career in multilateral discussions before becoming foreign minister, is aware however that a consistent foreign policy cannot do without the rude power balance contingencies stemming from bilateral relations. In his article, Amorim has precisely failed to describe the objectives and strategies orienting external action to countries like the United States, which are so relevant for Brazil. It should be noted that since Celso Amorim has headed Itamaraty, Brazil has been relieved of part of the burden of its conflicts with industrialized countries. Next to Amorim's article, we published on 10 April an article by our Washington correspondent reporting a change in the attitude toward Brazil from some of the most influential U.S. policy makers [two preceding words in English]. They are people who were removed from their universe of reflection that fed on negative, mistaken perceptions of Brazil, perceptions that concealed the efforts Brazil has made over the past three years to modernize itself and to adapt itself to the new situation in international commerce. Part of this change in perception was caused by the weight of facts. But part of it also was caused by a systematic effort by Itamaraty to show in the big capitals of the world that the dynamics of Brazilian society and the Brazilian economy are leading the country along the path followed by industrialized nations. There are, of course, differences in speed and rate, but not of the goal. It should be noticed, however, that the assistant secretary of state for Latin American affairs and the under secretary of commerce for international affairs [titles as published] -- as well as other people in the U.S. Government or outside it -- did not realize the changes that occurred in Brazil thanks to the country's presence at multilateral forums. An essential factor for them to realize that something positive was happening here was the resolution and settlement of matters dealing with bilateral conflicts that, because of today's interdependence, have affected relations between Brazil and other countries that share some of the principles upheld by the United States. In this way, the tension in Brazilian-U.S. relations dropped considerably after the Brazilian Congress approved the quadripartite nuclear safeguard agreement, an action that also permitted our relations with Germany to reach -- or return to -- a higher level. Likewise, the annoying question of the foreign debt was not blessed by the multilateral IMF; instead, the agreement with creditor banks moved forward thanks to the U.S. Treasury's support. Brazil has good reasons to seek the protection of international organizations. A big country, yet unwilling to project its own power far beyond its borders, those in charge of Brazilian diplomacy prefer the legal protection granted by multilateral forums. This formula yielded results for some time, and it is still yielding good results in specific conditions. The problem is that Brazilian interests are becoming excessively complex to be handled exclusively with the consensus method of international bodies. For a country demanding rapid and original solutions, such organizations can delay the answers too long, and, since their answers are based on consensus, they will not fully take national interests into account. From this viewpoint, multilateral organizations entail "compulsory support," with which it is better to do away. Therefore, many multilateral organizations administer justice in business and politics because those organizations will always give mankind a basis for moving toward utopia. But many efforts also concentrate on the fast resolution of problems that affect our everyday life and that can be resolved only through direct dialogue between two sides. Itamaraty has properly given priority to the new action aiming at promoting economic and political cooperation and integration in South America. New actions should preferably concentrate on our neighboring areas. It is important, however, that the search for new courses not erase old trails. Brazil's future will certainly depend on South American integration. But it is also true that the present is the platform of the future, and the present is linked to the United States and other industrialized nations.
