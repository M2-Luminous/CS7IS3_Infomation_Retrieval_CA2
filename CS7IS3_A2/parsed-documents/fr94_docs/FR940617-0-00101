FR940617-0-00101 FR940617-0-00024 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Parts 216 and 229 [Docket No. 950542&hyph;4142; I.D. 050394B] Interim Exemption for Commercial Fisheries AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this final rule to reinstate the regulations implementing the interim exemption from the general prohibition on taking marine mammals in the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) for certain incidental takings of marine mammals by commercial fishermen until September 1, 1995, or until superseded by regulations prescribed under section 118 of the MMPA. This reinstatement is required by section 114 of the MMPA, as amended by section 15 of the MMPA Amendments of 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective on June 17, 1994 through September 1, 1995. ADDRESSES: Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas C. Eagle, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2319 or Patricia A. Montanio, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2322. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The 1988 amendments to the MMPA directed the Secretary of Commerce to implement an interim exemption from the general prohibition on taking marine mammals in the MMPA for certain incidental takings by commercial fishermen during the period November 23, 1988, through October 1, 1993, while a permanent regime to govern interactions between marine mammals and commercial fishing operations was developed. Congress subsequently extended the interim exemption until May 1, 1994. For background on this issue, refer to earlier regulatory actions (56 FR 23958, May 24, 1991; 57 FR 59832, December 16, 1992; 58 FR 51788, October 5, 1993; and 59 FR 17048, April 11, 1994). The MMPA Amendments of 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;238, among other things, amended the MMPA by adding a new section 118 to establish a permanent regime to govern interactions between marine mammals and commercial fishing operations. Section 15 of the MMPA Amendments of 1994 amended section 114(a) of the MMPA to extend the interim exemption through September 1, 1995, or until superseded by regulations prescribed under new section 118 implementing the new regime, whichever is earlier. Due to an administrative delay, 50 CFR part 229, the regulations implementing the interim exemption, expired on May 1, 1994, and now must be reissued. This final rule reinstates those regulations until September 1, 1995, unless they are superseded earlier by regulations implementing new section 118. The reissued regulations are identical to those that expired except for changes in the addresses of the Southwest and Southeast Regions, NMFS. This reinstatement is required by section 114 of the MMPA, as amended by section 15 of the MMPA Amendments of 1994. This rule also amends a note in 50 CFR part 216 to conform to a cross reference from part 50 CFR part 229. Classification This rule is not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. Under section 114 of the MMPA, as amended by Public Law 103&hyph;238, the interim extension was extended until September 1, 1995, or until superseded by regulations prescribed under new section 118, whichever is earlier. This rule merely reinstates the regulations which, through administrative delay, were allowed to lapse. The lapsed regulations were subject to full notice and opportunity-for-public-comment procedures and no useful purpose would be served by delaying their reinstatement to provide notice and opportunity for public comment. Full notice and opportunity for public comments will be provided for the section 118 regulations presently being developed. Further, to delay reinstatement of the interim exemption regulations would be inconsistent with section 114 whose clear intent was to have the exemption and its implementing regulations continue to avoid any disruption to our commercial fisheries. Accordingly, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), finds, for good cause, that providing notice and opportunity for public comment is unnecessary and would be contrary to the public interest. Because reinstatement of the regulations relieves a restriction of commercial fisheries, under section 553(d)(1) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1), this rule is not subject to a 30-day delay in effective date.
