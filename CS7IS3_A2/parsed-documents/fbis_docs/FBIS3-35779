He said so in an exclusive interview with Interfax on the first anniversary of his appointment. In his words, the fleet was very much alive and proved its worth in exercises. Baltin, like all his men, wants the uncertainty about the fleet's future to end and the two heads of state to arrive at mutually acceptable decisions. The admiral emphasized that he opposed involvement of the fleet in politics and participation of servicemen in partisan activities of any kind, pro-Ukrainian, pro-Russian, communist or democratic. In his view, participation of armed men in political games may lead to unpredictable consequences. Baltin believes that the politicians must provide concrete aid rather than empty promises if they want to show that they care for the fleet. He said that the fleet faced problems of logistic, moral, and human relations natures. As Ukraine and Crimea are short of fuel, energy, food and cash, the fleet is blamed for all the troubles, he argued. He recalled that the Sevastopol authorities demand that the fleet help them with fuel, money and energy while the land tax alone that the fleet had to pay amounted to nearly 13 Bn karbovantsy in 1993. The fleet received from Russia 77 percent of the total amount of credits and from Ukraine, as little as 23 percent. Admiral Baltin said, "In our relations with the Ukrainian Navy command we have to recognize the fact that they represent a foreign navy and so our relations are business-like." He admitted that "we are tied by numerous links" but emphasized that "we cannot afford the upkeep of the units and ships of the Ukrainian Navy." On the other hand, Baltin said that he was "prepared to have a closer cooperation with the Ukrainian Navy and its commander."
