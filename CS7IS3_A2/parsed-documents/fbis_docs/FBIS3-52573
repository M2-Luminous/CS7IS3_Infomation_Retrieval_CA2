O great people, O stalwart men in our valiant Armed Forces, O glorious Arabs, O honest men and those have faith in justice and right wherever you may be: Greetings. On this blessed day, the 6th of January, the anniversary of the birth and founding of Iraq's Army in modern times, important meaning and values glimmer here, and in the life of the nation and mankind every year. The first nucleus of Iraq's modern Army; the Musa al-Kazim Regiment was founded on 6 January 1921. On that date, the old colonialist powers, with Britain at their forefront, which used to control major parts of the world, exploited hundreds of millions of the sons of mankind, plundered their resources, and resorted to force and repression against those who called for freedom and justice. A scientific comparison of the potentials of the poor and weak people of the world, including the people of Iraq, against the armies, fleets, aircraft, and other huge material potential of Britain and the other colonialist countries was not in favor of our people and others like us. Such a comparison may instill despair and result in capitulation to the will of the oppressive and colonialist tyrants. However, in spite of the difficult circumstances and the meager technical and material potential in general, the people of Iraq rebelled against these oppressive tyrants. Our people did all that they could do under those circumstances and affected the plans and the stands of the leaders of evil, achieving certain results on the road to freedom and independence, including the establishment of the nucleus of a national army, which is this great Army whose anniversary we celebrate today after 73 years. This Army stands loftily, crowned with pride, capability, and honesty. This is because the people's will is second to God's will; stronger than all circumstances and state of affairs. All that leads to a better life, therefore, stems from this will. In those days, the stalwart Iraqis imposed their will on the colonialists by founding their national Army. Afterward, the sly colonialists and their stooges tried to make this Army a tool in their hands against the people and their national objectives of freedom and independence and against pan-Arab objectives and genuine faith, honesty, and loyalty. However, the then budding Army, which now has great experience, is the righteous son of Iraq and the descendant of Iraq's great armies known by this land for more than 5,000 years. This Army has disappointed their malicious hopes and remained the way the unyielding people of Iraq wanted it -- an Army for Iraq and the nation. As time went by, the Army became a bulwark for nationalism and pan-Arabism and a school for the brave men who advocate Arabism and champion Islam. This was the history of the Army in the 1930's; in the 1941 revolution; the revolution of 14 July 1958; the Ramadan revolution in 1963; and also under the leadership of the party of the people and the nation, the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, in the 17-30 July 1978 revolution. This is the role played by our valiant Army in defending Iraq and Arabism against the racist anti-Arab expansion that came from the east for eight fierce years in successive epics of the glorious al-Qadisiyah. Finally, manifest victory was scored on the day of days, 8 August 1988. This is its role, which is unprecedented in the history of mankind, in the immortal Mother of Battles, when it withstood the aggression of 28 armies and more than 30 states, including three super powers. There were other supporters who were among the people of a superpower that was a friend of the Arabs and Iraq until part of its leaders conspired against the great people of Iraq. O brothers, O brave fighters, the elite of the nation's men and the slogan of its glory: The deluded colonialists have tried for more than 70 years to strike at this Army and to turn it into a tool in their hands against the people, homeland, and the nation. Following the criminal aggression -- in which they used all manner of weapons of killing and destruction in their arsenals, including the banned weapons -- after launching large-scale propaganda campaigns full of lies and falsehood and on which they spent large amounts of money from the treasuries of the renegades who stole the wealth of the Arab nation; after the unjust blockade through which they aimed at starving the people; and after imposing the no-fly zones in the north and the south, those colonialists imagined that they could achieve today what they failed to achieve in the past. The lowly ones were disappointed. The Army of the nation, the brave and great Army of Iraq, which was a national and pan-Arab bastion throughout its glorious history, remained, even after the aggression, Iraq's lofty Arab bastion to defend dignity, sovereignty, independence, and the homeland. It also remained a school of sacrifices, giving, and creativity in the times of peace and construction as well as on the fields of combat. O brothers, armies and nations, which exist on the same surface, live their values and follow basic criteria in terms of seriousness and nonseriousness toward principles and stands. And when a nation or an army retreats from its course and remains under the effect of this setback, not trying to stand up, the other party will follow suit. Whenever a nation rises up and holds on, the Army will also rise up and hold on. Anyhow, in this era of the history of nations, armies and nations exist on the same surface, see each other, and interact with each other. They live with a common conscience and historical sense. If any of them represent both at the beginning of a historical era in a situation like this, then, everybody will follow the party that represents all even if certain factors have placed one of them in the position of the initiator and the other in the position of a follower because it is burdened by responsibilities that prevent it from taking the lead position. This is exactly how the relationship has been between our people and Army throughout history. If the people or the Army take a step forward on the road to historical achievement, and both are part of the nation's conscience, this step encourages the adoption of another one and both interact and form a great historical era. This relationship has been clearly embodied in the details and picture of what happened whether in Al-Qadisiyah battle, which our comrades have named Saddam's al-Qadisiyah, or in the Mother of Battles with all its arenas and chapters. The people during al-Qadisiyah and the Mother of Battles have been the backbone of the Army, the secret of the great sense of national and pan-Arab affiliation, and the source of the conscience of history and the aspirations from which the Army gains its readiness for sacrifice and optimism for the future. The Army, with its ideological, psychological, and professional training has always been the people's support when ill winds sap the determination of some, or when the march does not equip them to complete the march. We experienced circumstances in al-Qadisiyah during which the people took the initiative to give another chance to the Army to enable it to portray the image it wishes to portray. When the major fighting began in the glorious Mother of Battles, when the fighting intensified and pressures were brought to bear from all sides, and after the first chapter of the 30-state attack, when the action of the evildoers and the treacherous took place within the framework of the Iranian conspiracy that complemented the comprehensive aggression and when the chapters of the conspiracy, treachery, and treason intensified, some were shaken and feet slipped from the right course. The Army, and we mean the knights of the Armed Forces, those who have a principled historical stand and enjoy excellent values, have been those who entrenched the banners on lofty hills so that every eye would see the banner of God is great and so that this banner would announce to the four corners of the earth that right is here, that honor is here, that the present is here and the future passes through here, that capability and impregnability are here. May evil befall all the weak, and accursed be the treacherous, those who assist the foreigner. Nationalism and pan-Arabism are here. Woe to the foreigner when he crosses the borders and commits crimes. The sublime meanings are here. Long live Iraq and our glorious Arab nation. God is great. Long live Iraq. God is great. Long Live Palestine, free and Arab. Long live Palestine. Brothers, by what we have said, we meant to tell our dear, valiant, and militant Army and our great, glorious people that sincere, principled, and historically perceptive leaders may commit mistakes as regards what should be done. Only God is infallible. Some may recall part of the mistakes in isolation from the circumstances of the comprehensive situation. They may think that it would be right to feel angry or imagine that it would be legitimate to react angrily. However, as long as leaders do not commit historic mistakes that will be regretted by the people or the Army, or the people and the Army together, God forbid, the traits and meaning of historic leadership will continue to be associated with them. If remorse affects the Army and the people in general--any people and army--then this means that a mark of disgrace has been recorded against them in that particular era. Thus, they will lose an historic opportunity to have a record of great honor. Despite all the injustice and humiliation that affected the great Iraqi people and valiant Armed Forces by the opponent's technical force and the broad enemy front, your leadership has not pushed you to remorse and disgrace. Most often, it has saved some from their own selves, having pulled falsehood from under their feet and supported their backs with right. Brothers, these lessons are not only meant as a source of pride, but they lead to important conclusions in our daily struggle and steadfastness in the face of tyranny and the embargo imposed on our people and country. The steadfastness of the Iraqi Army and the fact that it has maintained its defensive capabilities and bright national and pan-Arab traits is a prominent, shining aspect of the steadfastness of Iraq, in all its sectors and among its zealous sons, in the face of aggression, tyranny, malicious plots, false propaganda, and the embargo imposed by the forces of evil and darkness since 6 August 1990. The Army of the people has maintained its steadfastness; the people of Iraq have also remained steadfast, in the face of all plots and wagers at a stage when U.S. tyranny is dominating the world in alliance with world Zionism. During this stage, many armies were humiliated. Also, many peoples and countries, some of them big, were disgraced. However, the enemies, before the friends, have acknowledged publicly and secretly that their wagers on Iraq, its Army, people, and leadership have failed utterly. May God disgrace them, make their sides bleed, and throw them in hell. Zealous brothers and glorious sisters: Among the prominent facts about the outcome of the Mother of Battles and its continuation until this day in various forms and methods, we feel confident that steadfastness, adherence to the principles and values of freedom, justice and right, as expressed by the Mother of Battles in their highest meanings, and pursuing reconstruction and creativity, represent the right course. There is no other course to remove injustice, tyranny, the unjust embargo, and any weakness that besets the followers of God. These lessons have so far, with God's help and blessings, facilitated Iraq's steadfastness and the capabilities to pursue reconstruction. They also ensure the necessary requirements for safeguarding our dear homeland, making it free, lofty, and capable of awakening and continued reconstruction and progress. Brothers, honorable people of the world: We have always been inspired by our noble religion and the traditions of our Prophet Muhammad, God's peace and blessings be upon him. We have also been inspired by the noble principles of the Ba'th [Party]. We have always been advocates of peace and brotherliness, believing in right, justice, and equality and struggling for our rights and principles without encroaching on the rights of others. We in Iraq and as free Arabs in the Arab nation want to have in this world a respectable position, which we deserve due to what the Iraqis and Arabs have contributed to human civilization and to upholding the principles of right and justice throughout history. Today, the tyrants and the oppressors who are hold sway over the world's destiny cannot--no matter what they do--prevent the great people of Iraq from occupying the sublime status for which they are struggling, nor can they prevent the world nations from realizing their freedom, progress, and right to choose their way of life through their free, dignified will. Glorious Iraqi men and women: A few days before the third anniversary of the 30-state aggression, we are confident that the wicked objectives the sought by the wicked ones before, during, and after the aggression are collapsing one after the other. The remaining chapters of aggression will also collapse the way many of them collapsed in the past, God willing. They will collapse with the determination of the zealous Iraqis and the support of the free people and faithful ones in the world. Regarding this issue, I would like to say that some rulers in the region--rulers who betrayed the trust, lost honor, plotted against Iraq, and took part in the sinister schemes against it and in aggression against its people--are still trying with all their means to maintain the embargo imposed on the Iraqi people. They are spending what has remained of the funds to this end. They are also supporting the illegal interests of those laying traps and the polytheists at the expense of the wealth of their peoples and the poor sons of the nation. They are paying bribes here and there to stop the growing trend that is calling for the lifting of the unjust embargo imposed on the Iraqi people. May God disgrace and uncover them. Those who lost their honor, independence, and money to fund the intrigues against Iraq will lose more of what has remained with them of the money of the poor. They will waste the wealth of their peoples and nation. However, they will not be able to harm Iraq's steadfastness and ability to forge its way ahead over the debris of the wall of the blockade and injustice, protected by the banner of God is great, which has been maintained by the most gracious, most compassionate. Those who are wallowing in treason and are blinded by evil imagine that lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq is a wicked political game or a dirty diplomacy that can be obstructed by illegal payments and bribes. They do not know that the basic reason that will lead to the ending of the blockade is the steadfastness of Iraq and the Iraqis, their adherence to faith in their principles and their rights, their clinging to honor and virtue, and their loyalty to their noble nationalist, pan-Arab, and human objectives. These bases, which cannot be shaken or changed by funds, evil intrigues, or the meanness of the wicked ones, are the Iraqis' ammunition in facing the embargo and their path toward ending it and any ordeal. Dear Iraqis, brave men of our national valiant Armed Forces, the Army of July 1958, Ramadan 1963, July 1968, al-Qadisiyah, and Mother of Battles: In this new year, like the previous years, we are looking forward to more work, training, vigilance, efficiency, and more creativeness and innovation of methods, through which we will defeat the enemy of both God and you. Through such methods, we will defeat the unjust blockade, hold fast in the face of the arrogant ones and henchmen, and prove to the enemies that their blockade is useless, that their intrigues will be defeated, and that the values and rights of our nation and people are well protected and that God is their protector and defender. Greetings of love and pride. Peace be upon our victorious Army, the descendent of the great armies of Iraq and the holder of the banner of Arabism and the message of good, justice, and right. Peace be upon the Army of Iraq, the Army of the Arab nation. Peace be upon the martyrs. Peace be upon the martyrs. Peace be upon Palestine. Peace be upon every Arab who has rejected and rejects wrongdoing. Peace be upon everyone of you and your families. May God preserve you and protect you. God is great. Accursed be the lowly.
