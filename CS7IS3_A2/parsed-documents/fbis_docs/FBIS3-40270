The deficit for the first 10 months of last year stood at only Sk10.2 billion. According to an analysis carried out by the Slovak Statistical Office, the greatest deficit -- Sk23.129 billion -- is in the Slovak Republic's trade with the former CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] countries, excluding the states of the Visegrad Four, that is, the CEFTA [Central European Free Trade Association] countries. The Slovak Republic's foreign trade balance with CEFTA countries shows a surplus of Sk7.449 billion, Sk2.858 of which is accounted for by the Czech Republic. In the first 11 months of the year, the Slovak Republic also had a surplus, amounting to Sk1.72 billion, in its trade with the states of the European Union. Trade with the states of the European Free Trade Association shows the opposite trend. In the first 11 months of 1993, the Slovak Republic recorded an Sk6.012 billion deficit in trade with these countries. On the other hand, the Slovak Republic had a surplus in its trade with Asian countries and with the states of the African continent. An Sk2.235 billion deficit was recorded in the Slovak Republic's trade with the United States and an Sk118 million deficit in trade with Australia. According to the Slovak Statistical Office analysis, the Slovak Republic primarily imports raw materials, fuels, mineral oil, bitumen, and wax. The number one item among Slovak exports are iron and steel. Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery, and appliances and their components are in second place, and motor vehicles, tractors, and motorcycles in third.
