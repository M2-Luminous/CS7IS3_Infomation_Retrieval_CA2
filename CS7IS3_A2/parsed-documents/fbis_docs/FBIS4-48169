This is a historic day for which the world has long awaited and I dare say the path has well been laid to welcome South Africa back to United Nations. Mr. Mandela, when he visited New York and I had the pleasure of speaking with him on that occasion, made it quite clear that the United Nations will represent a cardinal feature of South Africa's foreign policy and I think we there at United Nations are very ready to welcome your country to the organization once more. [Robinson] Now those are very kind words, Mr. Insanally, but the point that I am trying to make is this: It is a question of South Africa being obliged to formally readmit credentials. Is that the position or not? [Insanally] I dare say South Africa will have to formally express its desire to return and as I said I am pretty sure that that request will be very spontaneously entertained. The other matters, all the residual matters of financial standing, the question of contributions, clearly are -- as in the case of all countries -- there's a question of a assessment of contributions. I imagine that this is a matter that will have to be discussed with the South African Government. There is a scale of assessment and I imagine this will have to be through a dialogue between the government of South Africa and the United Nations Secretariat. [Robinson] As I understand it, South Africa is about $100 million in arrears. So what is going to happen as far as that is concerned? [Insanally] As I said, the primary criterion I imagine the United Nations will use is to open its doors to South Africa, an important member of the United Nations family. I do not believe that the question of arrears will be a stumbling block to its reentry into the organization. Clearly.... [Robinson, interrupting] But will South Africa have to pay that amount? [Insanally] I really can't say. I really would be very...[pauses] I would be hazarding an answer there. It would be for the committee on contributions to study the case. Let me say that, you know, the United Nations is composed of a number of bodies and South Africa has in fact not been entirely excluded from participation in some of the agencies, so one has to look at it in fine [as heard], and it would be very presumptuous of me to give you a sort of blanket answer. As I said, many countries are in arrears. I am sure that some arrangement can be worked out which would facilitate South Africa's entry as soon as it expresses a desire to return to the international family. [Robinson] The United Nations arms embargo against South Africa is still in place. Are you going to take the initiative to remove that? [Insanally] That is a matter for the Security Council, and again I do not wish to sort of tread on their prerogative. I would think that in so far as it does not affect the general purposes of the United Nations, such an embargo will be reviewed with some...[pauses] with a new eye and in an attempt to respect the sovereignty of South Africa. I am sure the Security Council will take the necessary measures in that regard. [Robinson] One of the bodies of the United Nations is the Special Committee Against Apartheid. One might expect that the duties of that particular committee will now lapse. [Insanally] Oh yes, that I can say positively. I was, myself, a vice president of the council for Namibia and that was one body which I was very glad to see pass out of existence, although it's left me without a particular job. The same will occur for the Special Committee -- apartheid -- and as I said we'll be very happy to see the end of it. It will take a little time to dismantle, to redeploy, but that certainly will go now that South Africa is now with us, fully, in the United Nations family. [Robinson] If South Africa reenters the United Nations, do you see any specific or special role for South Africa in that body? [Insanally] Indeed I do. I see it as a sort of a two-way street. I see, first of all, South Africa playing a very key role in United Nations affairs, in all its aspects. South Africa, indeed, is an important nation, not only within Africa, and indeed I must say that we look upon South Africa as the dynamo for development in the region, in all of Africa, and in the political sense what South Africa has been able to accomplish through excellent leadership, excellent vision for the future, and the process of dialogue and reconciliation -- that can be a model for other countries in the region. At the same time the United Nations, as I am sure the secretary general may have mentioned to the president of South Africa, I think we can look to South Africa also to making a contribution to international affairs, in the areas of peace keeping, peace making, technical cooperation. You are indeed, in this part of the world, a very advanced country and, therefore, can play a very preeminent role in the furtherance of peace and development in the continent.
