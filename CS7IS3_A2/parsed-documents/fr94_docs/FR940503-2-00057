FR940503-2-00057 FR940503-2-00039 In those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated based upon DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis. Therefore, based on the above, DOE is granting DMO an Interim Waiver for its HDS series gas furnaces. Pursuant to paragraph (e) of ยง430.27 of the Code of Federal Regulations part 430, the following letter granting the Application for Interim Waiver to DMO was issued. Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR Part 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the ``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety. The petition contains no confidential information. The Department solicits comments, data, and information respecting the petition. Issued in Washington, DC April 19, 1994. Frank M. Stewart, Jr., Acting Chief of Staff, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. April 19, 1994. Mr. Kyu S. Hwang, P.E., Manager of Engineering, Research, and Development, DMO Industries, P.O.

Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay. DMO's Application for Interim Waiver does not provide sufficient information to evaluate what, if any, economic impact or competitive disadvantage DMO will likely experience absent a favorable determination on its application.
