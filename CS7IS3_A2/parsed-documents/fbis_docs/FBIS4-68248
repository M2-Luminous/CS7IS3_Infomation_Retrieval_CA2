How could the document be passed from the RF Ministry of Defense to the president's administration, if Minister of Defense Pavel Grachev knew nothing about it? 2. Why is it mentioned in the document that the MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] is informed of the initiative, while this ministry in reality had no knowledge of it whatsoever? Why did the document, (which is directly concerned with foreign policy), not receive the stamp of approval by the very ministry involved with foreign policy? 3. How is it that, in the president's administration, the document bypassed the people who are directly involved with coordinating Russia's foreign policy actions and who are responsible for the president maintaining communication with the MID and RF MO [Ministry of Defense]? It would definitely appear that they should be informed of all initiatives associated with these ministries. 4. Why indeed did the president, who is informed of the progress made in the talks being held between Russia and Latvia, sign the document? 5. Why is it that the document (the text is not an issue here), in which the RF MID and the MO were to merely hold the attendant TALKS with the CIS member countries and Latvia, did not bear the secret security classification? 6. How did the document fall into the hands of ITAR-TASS? 7. The failure to coordinate the actions taken by the MO, MID, and president's administration became an object of scrutiny by the press twice in 10 days (counting as the first time the changing of the day of signing of the Partnership for Peace), smacking of a scandal. What is this? Deep political differences which cannot be kept hidden, or is it bureaucratic confusion carried to absurdity? 8. Who (other than the Ministry of Defense clerk who included Latvia in the list of states on whose territory it is proposed to create Russian military bases) will be held responsible for what has happened? It must be realized that the scandal not only reinforces the world's thinking that Russia's foreign and domestic policy is unpredictable, but it also exerts a direct influence on the political, economic, and social conditions attending the Russian-speaking minority residing in the Baltics. 9. Can it be guaranteed that the same thing will not occur in the future? Any citizen of Russia can and does ask himself the above questions. And if it so happens that an "explanation via diplomatic channels" satisfies Riga, this would definitely be insufficient as far as the Russian public is concerned.
