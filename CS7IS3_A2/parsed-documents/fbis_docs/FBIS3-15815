In particular, he pointed out that the removal of nuclear warheads from Ukraine to Russia for their subsequent dismantling and utilization is being carried out as scheduled and in accordance with a defence capacity of enterprises which will carry out processing. The expert said that during transportation and storage of nuclear warheads at enterprises serious attention is paid to ensuring their safety. At the same time, there is no point in closely watching the movement of each convoy since secrecy during the transportation and storage of nuclear warheads will be fully observed. The first convoy with nuclear warheads from "Ukrainian missiles" is bound to arrive at its destination in the near future. The destination is not disclosed for reasons of secrecy, but it was announced that in accordance with tripartite Russo-American-U.S. agreements signed in Moscow on January 14, 1994, the warheads will be dismantled for being subsequently processed at one of Russia's enterprises. Under the agreement, in exchange for the warheads Russia has pledged to supply fuel to Ukrainian nuclear power stations, but not in the form of processed nuclear material obtained from withdrawn missiles. The processing of this nuclear material will take from several months to one year, experts said. The supplies of nuclear fuel to Ukrainian nuclear power stations will be carried out from Russia's fuel reserves. According to the Russian Defence Ministry, on the Ukrainian territory there are about 1,300 warheads for intercontinental ballistic missiles an over 600 - for cruise land-based missiles. The condition of part of nuclear ammunition causes special concern of nuclear experts which might promote the speediest removal of nuclear ammunition from Ukraine.
