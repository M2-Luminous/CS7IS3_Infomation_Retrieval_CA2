The production process can be improved by using indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) thin-film crystal which is suitable for highly mobile electrons. In this way, an operational frequency of 176 gigahertz, a new world record, has been achieved. High-speed operation of 100 GHz or more is achieved even at low operational current of 1 milliampere or less. The subminiaturization of devices clears the way for integrating the HBT. Efforts will continue to pursue even higher speeds to prepare devices for use in optical communications having a transmission capability of 40 gigabits per second, which is the latest research objective. Until now, the world's fastest transistor achieved to date was an HBT developed by NTT which operated at 171 GHz and which used gallium arsenide (GaAs) crystal. Since using GaAs has approached the limitation with regard to higher operational frequency, NTT used InGaAs to break its own world record. It has been known that InGaAs is well suited with regard to high electron mobility, device miniaturization and lower operating current. However, until now there has been little know-how pertaining to process technologies. Therefore, a transistor which takes full advantage of the characteristics of this material has not been achieve,d and the quality of the material has been compromised. By modifying the etching process during formation of the device, NTT was able to achieve a transistor with three strong points--high speed, low power consumption, and subminiature device size. Not only is it the world's fastest operating transistor, but achieving an operating frequency of 100 GHz on one milliampere or less of current is also a first. More specifically, at one milliampere of current, an operational frequency of about 130 GHz is possible. NTT plans to achieve an optical communications network which can transfer 10 gigibits of information per second, and various laboratories are involved in developing devices and exchange equipment technology which allows transfer of 40 gigabits per second. The new achievement greatly promotes the practical use of the HBT in future optical communications systems. Applications of the HBT are also likely to increase when it is incorporated into integrated circuits.
