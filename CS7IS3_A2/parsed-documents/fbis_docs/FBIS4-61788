FBIS4-61788 "drsov090_u_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-090 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 Latvia Revised Draft of Citizenship Law Prepared Revised Draft of Citizenship Law Prepared WS1005105794 Riga DIENA in Latvian 25 Apr 94 p 1 WS1005105794 Riga DIENA Latvian BFN [Article by Sanita Upleja: "Second Reading of Citizenship Law Expected in Mid-May"] [Text] Riga, 22 Apr -- Apparently, the second reading of the draft law on citizenship will take place on 12 or 19 May, when the plenary sessions of the Saeima [parliament] are scheduled. The working group established by Latvia's Way has prepared the draft, which is to be discussed by the Judicial Commission next week. In accordance with the draft, the naturalization of noncitizens would begin on 1 January 1996. In the case of noncitizens who are entitled by this law to preferential treatment, it would be possible for them to apply from the moment the law becomes effective. As DIENA was told by Aivars Endzins, chairman of Saeima Judicial Commission, the naturalization of noncitizens would be carried out in a set period of time and order of events, which will state which categories of people and in what order they will have the right to apply for citizenship. In the draft, prepared for the second reading, Latvia's Way has abandoned the primary principle of naturalization quotas, and due to the recommendations of experts from the European Council, they are now arranged in a precise order. Beginning on 1 January 1996, noncitizens, who were born in Latvia and are between 16 and 23 years of age, would be able to apply for citizenship. The draft law foresees a five-year period for obtaining citizenship; at the beginning of 1996, this period will be completed, so it will be possible to begin naturalization. After that, beginning on 1 January 1997, the next group of noncitizens, those who were born in Latvia but are older than 23, will be addressed. In 1998 -- people who arrived in Latvia as infants. According to the draft law, all other people wishing to obtain Latvian citizenship would be able to apply beginning in the year 2000. The draft law foresees preferential treatment for people who are permanent residents in Latvia, whose relatives are of second- generation Latvian or Liiv origin, and their spouses, as well as for people who have legally arrived to Latvia before 1940, people who were brought to Latvia by force during the German occupation and their descendants, and spouses of Latvian citizens. As A. Endzins explained, these people can submit naturalization applications as soon as the law becomes effective. The naturalization of this category of individuals could be finished before the next round of Saeima elections, therefore these people will be eligible to vote by that time. The draft law on citizenship foresees that Latvian citizenship can be obtained by so-called Russian Latvians, whose ancestors were living in Latvia before 1 August 1914, and who now permanently reside in Latvia. The draft also states that retired Russian military personnel and their family members cannot apply for Latvian citizenship, except in cases where they have were born or mobilized in Latvia, but even then the naturalization process takes place in due course, according to the obligations fixed by the law -- knowledge of the Latvian language, Latvian history, and the Latvian Constitution, as well as loyalty and the number of years [of residency] defined by the law. Regarding military pensioners as well as other foreigners and stateless individuals, their status should be defined by the law on foreigners and stateless people, which should be adopted in concert with the citizenship law, stated Judicial Commission Chairman A. Endzins. The Juridical Commission is currently drafting the said law for its first reading, on the basis of drafts submitted by Latvia's Way and the Concord for Latvia. In addition, the Latvian National Independence Movement and "Fatherland and Freedom" have submitted their own draft laws on foreigners and stateless people.
