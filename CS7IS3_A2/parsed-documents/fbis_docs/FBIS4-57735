Remember that the FSLN, in which women have had a role, did not have a regulation compelling recognition of women. This is the first failure. The other thing that makes this decision very welcome is that when one takes into account 30 percent against the true number of women in the party -- in my opinion this is not enough. It obliges us to pursue more participation by women. Thus in practice we are making a decision that can take immediate effect and continue forging ahead. If we go to the other extreme, this is still a good intention, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I believe this is the best thing that could have happened to us. [Monterrey] Remember, Henry Ruiz, that according to the media a proposal has been circulating to have the FSLN congress discuss a return to what was once called political commissars. This would empower the Sandinist Assembly to elect editorial boards and directors of Sandinist media. What is your opinion? [Ruiz] I do not agree with this. [Monterrey] Why? [Ruiz] Two things are new to Nicaragua: First, real freedom of expression does exist. No party can have freedom of expression if decisions are made within the party to reduce this freedom. This is what makes the existence of parties possible, especially in the case of a revolutionary party. If we adopt this proposal, we would be going back to old practices. Second, publishing houses are our own media, but they are also businesses that have to compete. They must have an open market. If you place the media on a political footing with no eye on profits, it is very unlikely that it would survive. The FSLN, despite suspicions to the contrary, does not have large financial resources. Thus owners have to survive, so publishing houses, in an example of essential respect, must be so administered. [Monterrey] If Commander Henry Ruiz is elected FSLN secretary general during this congress, what will your immediate action be: preserving FSLN unity or reducing the effects of what pessimists are forecasting if Commander Ortega does not win? [Ruiz] I do not like to forecast schisms. I believe we have been and will emerge united. Some comrades have told me that there is already division. I have replied that it is not yet entrenched. (?Those who accept this have already committed suicide.) If the party is not unified, we are obliged to seal it up. I say let us bolt the party together, tighten the clamps, use some glue, and launch the party forward. As we approach 1996 we will see a split. I hold that if we don't win in 1996 -- in addition to the (?good people they have) and all these things that many times prove to be ideas on and intuitions of what is going on or has happened -- will be consolidated if they defeat us. [sentence as heard] What is currently operating is a substitute model of the revolution, but it is a neoliberal model. If you add the fact that this has advanced so much, added to the three years remaining in this administration, added to a possible defeat, then you can forget about the revolution. Here is where Sandinists will have to implement other plans. If we as Sandinists have any conscience, we must realize that unity is the only chance if this fatality were to occur. [end recording] On another topic dealing with events in Nicaragua, Commander Henry Ruiz, alias Modesto, told us: [Begin recording] [Ruiz] I am happy because we have points of reference in Sandinism. The sad thing would be if Sandinism had no points of reference and everything were a crisis, chaos, and that we had to seek points of reference elsewhere, in other parties. That would be bad. Tardiness does not matter; the important thing is that points of reference have been found. The sad thing is that I am the only other candidate. It would be good if several of us were candidates for FSLN secretary general. On the question of what must be done to regain our power, I believe that if we use our historical strength... [pauses] we have always been dynamic, strong, mystical, and [words indistinct] when our goals are unclear. I believe there is a key goal, but we do not know how to reach it. This requires a national plan that includes what I call the regaining of power. I do not say government because I insist this is not a government problem. It has to do with providing the executive branch and the legislative branch with enough power so that they can exercise other policies and lead the country out of stagnation while stopping neoliberal policies. If we examine this in the face of international realities, it is obviously not an easy task. Look at Venezuela. Carlos Andres lost the elections [as heard] and see where he is now. But Caldera is committed to the neoliberal plan, and there is already word of a future social explosion in Venezuela. We are committed to this neoliberal plan because this is what the government established and signed. It will last until 1997. We need to pursue a kind of national referendum in connection with the country's problems and see how we -- the government -- can deal with them, establish what we are going to propose, what solutions to offer, and how these solutions are attainable. When we put all these things down on a single piece of paper I believe this will once again give Sandinists a point of reference and the resolve to work. I believe that the debate, which we have tried to run down, has given us something that is quite tangible: We have risen, and we are [words indistinct] and energy. So if we find these things we will have moved ahead. [end recording] These relations will improve to the extent the United States allows them to improve. We cannot stop supporting just causes we have supported in the past, we are supporting now, and as we will hopefully continue to support in the future. The fact that we have been so supportive of our brothers in El Salvador caused us serious problems with the United States. Nevertheless, just for the sake of avoiding problems, we could not stop supporting our Salvadoran brothers. For the sake of avoiding problems with the United States, we will never stop supporting our Cuban brothers. This means that in the face of our efforts to improve our relations with the United States, we must not turn our backs on our principles and our historic roots -- things we are obliged to maintain. In this sense, I think we must carefully examine the evolution and developments that have taken place in the United States. The Reagan and Bush administrations are not the same as today's Clinton administration. There are substantial differences, and, I might add, numerous differences. President Clinton has assumed certain positions for reasons of political interest, and also for reasons linked to his own personal choices. He has shown openness in relations with ethnic groups, with homosexuals, and with women -- an openness which, at the same time, has not been manifested in relations with countries that have been under attack, such as Cuba. Perhaps the alignment of various forces within the United States is not permitting President Clinton to be more broad in his openness. [two-second break in reception] As congress president, I ask you to grant me a few more minutes. Much has been said about this topic. Some have mentioned the problem of the Sandinist anthem and suggested we eliminate the words of the anthem. I believe that, in fact, there are other anthems in the world which have their own characteristics and which are historic. I think, however, that the words of the Sandinist anthem go far beyond this and reflect a deeply historical significance. We have been victims -- and I reiterate this -- and we have not been responsible for victimizing others. Aside from maintaining and carrying out efforts to establish relations with the United States, we must keep our anti-imperialist principles intact. I also believe it is necessary to say here and now that the Sandinist Front is, and will continue to be, anti-imperialist. [applause] We have proposed other motions within this same spirit. I would like to see an overall approval of these motions. There are some portions to which you contributed with words and actions, which will be reviewed by the commission to summarize and improve, if possible, this important portion of our program.
