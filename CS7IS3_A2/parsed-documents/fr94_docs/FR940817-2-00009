FR940817-2-00009 FR940817-2-00006 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE International Trade Administration [A&hyph;570&hyph;832, A&hyph;570&hyph;833, A&hyph;821&hyph;805, A&hyph;821&hyph;806, A&hyph;823&hyph;806] Postponement of Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determinations: Pure and Alloy Magnesium From the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation; and Pure Magnesium from Ukraine AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Erik Warga (202&hyph;482&hyph;0922) or David Golberger (202&hyph;482&hyph;4136), Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20230. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (``the Department'') is postponing its preliminary determinations in the antidumping duty investigations of pure and alloy magnesium from the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation (Russia), and pure magnesium from Ukraine. The deadline for issuing these preliminary determinations is now no later than October 27, 1994. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 20, 1994, the Department initiated antidumping duty investigations of pure and alloy magnesium from the PRC, Russia, and Ukraine (59 FR 21748, April 26, 1994). The notice stated that we would issue our preliminary determinations on September 7, 1994. On May 16, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission determined that there was not a likelihood that a U.S. domestic industry was materially injured, nor threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of alloy magnesium from Ukraine, thereby terminating the investigation of alloy magnesium from Ukraine. With regard to pure and alloy magnesium from the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation and pure magnesium from Ukraine, the ITC found that there was a reasonable indication that an industry in the U.S. is materially injured, or threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of pure and alloy magnesium from the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation and pure magnesium from Ukraine. We have determined that the remaining investigations are extraordinarily complicated within the meaning of section 733(c)(1)(B)(i) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(2). Given the non-market economy status of all countries subject to these investigations, the nature of government ownership of the participating companies must be clarified for each country. Additionally, these investigations involve unusually complex foreign trading channels as well as possible sales from foreign government stockpiles. Furthermore, we have determined that the parties concerned are cooperating, as required by section 733(c)(1)(B) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(1), and that additional time is necessary to make these preliminary determinations in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(3). For these reasons, the deadline for issuing these determinations is now no later than October 27, 1994. This notice is published pursuant to section 733(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(d). Dated: August 8, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20201 Filed 8&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
