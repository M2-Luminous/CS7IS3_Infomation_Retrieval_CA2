The spokesmen for the Foreign Affairs Ministry said no foreign country, organization, or individual has the right to make irresponsible remarks or interfere. The spokesman said China's questioning of more than a dozen dissidents in Beijing and Shanghai was within its rights as a sovereign nation, and had nothing to do with the visit this week by the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
