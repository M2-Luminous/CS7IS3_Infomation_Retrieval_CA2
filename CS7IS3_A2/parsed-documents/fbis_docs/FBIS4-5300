Technical discussion on this subject is often tinted in rosy colors. But a business economics analysis shows that without fundamental changes in Japanese telecommunications structure, it will be useless to wait for the coming of the multimedia age in Japan. In a NEW YORK TIMES special report, which appeared last November, Japan was said to have already fallen considerably behind the United States in networking. In a country without a long acquaintance with keyboard culture, Japan's information system is not only being held back by attempts to maintain the status quo for telephone services but also by Japan's outdated telecommunications system. Without reforming its current system, attempts to lay optical fiber lines will be a waste of the investors' money, and the dream of having high-speed information networks will probably go unrealized. This writer would urge the following reforms. Hampered by Old Ways First, current telephone charges are based on a meter-rate system, which adds sharply to the cost of longer calls. This system is the first thing that has to be revised. Otherwise the system, as it exists, is hardly suitable for the transmission of large amounts of data. The ISDN [integrated services digital network] charge, for example, for sending 90 seconds of high-resolution images (at an estimated 10 megabits per second), using the conversion rate for 64 kilobits per second per telephone line, would run up a bill of 47,000 yen. Even if the amount of information were cut down to one-tenth of this by reducing the quality of the resolution, it would still cost 4,700 yen and cannot compete with videos. We can hardly expect the multimedia age to come to us with this sort of fee structure. Second, it is necessary to do away with fencing policies that divide the field along regional, city, service, and international lines to prohibit territorial crossovers. In the United States, the ability of businesses to cross over regional lines has encouraged the diversification of services and the lowering of fees. Regional fencing in Japan has the opposite effect, protecting NTT's monopoly and obstructing the entry of competition into high-level services where communication has to be controlled from start to finish. Third, abolishing restrictions on the resale or leasing of lines (connections between private and public lines) should also be considered. Use restrictions, besides reducing the incentive to develop ways to apply new technology, serve as deterrents to developing a rich array of telecommunication services through competition. Linked to the fact that the Japanese have fallen behind in the use of communication networks is the failure of domestic equipment manufacturers to develop suitable products for the market. It is symbolic of this failure that all of the network equipment for communication services known as "frame relays" that have been introduced in the last year or two are foreign-made. The problem isn't that Japan is technically weak. Rather, unlike the United States, where products are actively developed to meet actual demand, in Japan, the development of new products has to meet "projected" demand. But that sort of demand may not materialize under the type of restrictions and fees that currently exist. The problem is not limited to the telecommunications industry or to telecommunications equipment. The lack of progress in developing distributed processing information networks will probably hamper the efforts of Japanese enterprises trying to recover their competitiveness through downsizing and reengineering. For the telecommunications industry, too, this failure has become an important factor in its falling behind in the competition among carriers that are in the process of globalizing their operations. Under the protection of the postwar years, the telecommunications industry has led a life far removed from international competition. But, as will be shown, in the age of multimedia and distributed processing, global competition will be a necessary fact of life. The day is nearing when dramas played overseas -- the struggle between British Telecommunications (BT) and American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) over entering each other's domestic market or the tie-up between BT and MCI of the United States -- will be replayed on Japan's shores. No longer about international territory, global competition has already moved into an age when the struggle will be over entering another country's domestic communications market. One can safely say that neither Japan's administrative agencies nor those in the telecommunications business are prepared to respond to this trend. The activities of global telecommunications companies in Japan have not gathered a great deal of general interest because regulations limit their services to data communications, and at the present time, they cannot handle voice communications (i.e., telephone services). But their packet communications technology is considered the forerunner of technology known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode [ATM], used for switching equipment. This technology is said to be central to communications in the 21st century. Functionally, these companies already have the technology to make voice services possible and will be able to realize multimedia networks that combine voice, image, and text data. They are working out a system, including a system of fixed charges, that users will find easy to use. Regulations that would restrict these companies, especially in the United States and England, were done away with long ago. This writer would basically welcome the changes that foreign carriers would bring to Japan. Their entry would probably lower communication charges while providing users with a greater diversity of services and serve as an impetus to the high-level use of networks. Rather, the problem is with the administration and an industry that tries to maintain the status quo. If things are left as they are, Japanese industries as a whole will be left behind other advanced nations in the information revolution, losing their global competitiveness, and in the short run, bear the seeds of new trade friction. The Age of Distributed Processing Here, a short description of leading trends in the multimedia field may be helpful. News reports about major trends in the telecommunications industry focus on the growing use of distributed processing computer networks and, along with this, the growing use of computer networks as communication tools. Because the price of smaller computers has gone down dramatically just as there have been marked improvements in their capabilities, there has been a move away from the kind of centralized processing of information that was done primarily by large computers and mainframes toward its distribution to personal computer workstations and smaller computers. There has been a rapid conversion toward distributed processing, where only necessary information is passed on and exchanged through workstations. The distributed processing system has broken through the limitations of centralized processing, making it possible to expand greatly one's data processing capabilities with only a small investment of money. Able to be used for "on-the-spot" system development and for a system that matches one's particular needs, it has also become a powerful reengineering tool for corporations. In distributed processing, since the system is being designed so that computers set up in various locations can communicate with other computers, information can be processed as it is being exchanged; therefore, it is an excellent communications (media) tool. In U.S. workplaces, local area networks (LAN) linking workers, each with a personal computer on his or her desk, are used in communicating through such means as electronic mail, facsimile, and voice mail (multifunction answering machine) and are starting to get popular in Japan, too. As far as distributed processing networks are concerned, multimedia has become a real possibility. A characteristic of communications based on this kind of computer network is that nearly every network function will be carried out by equipment in the office rather than by the telephone company's switchboard. We are in the process of moving from a centralized network system to a distributed processing network system. The telephone company's role will merely be that of maintaining and servicing its cable lines. All other advanced functions will be carried out at [computer] terminals. An important point for such telephone companies is that these terminals in most cases will be provided, not by themselves, but by equipment manufacturers. Telephone companies, their services reduced to "wiring," a term which is used by the telephone companies, are afraid that their value-added services will flee into other hands. Carriers in every country, fearful of losing revenue, have come out of their offices to adopt a strategy which transcends existing jurisdictions and national boundaries to cover advanced communication needs from start to finish. Cases in point are the purchases by American regional telephone companies of cable television companies in other regions and BT's global enterprise communications service. The pressure is building to break down regional fences. Rate Structure To Encourage Use Another characteristic of distributed processing networks has to do with their fee structures. Generally, almost all communication networks have fixed costs that are passed on to users according to some kind of formula or method of allocating these costs. In Japan, during the age of centralized processing, the basis for allocating costs was time and distance -- the time on a "switch" [device used to transmit and route data] and the distance between them. Today, with distributed processing, however, this switching ability exists in the user's office, making it meaningless to base charges on time and distance. With the technology employed for distributed processing -- the use of fiber optics and packet switching -- distance is not such an important factor in determining transmission costs, and it has become meaningless to impose charges on the basis of distance. Thus, what is becoming more and more popular is a system of fixed charges or some variation of that. Fixed-charge systems are set up to allow unlimited use of a network for a fixed charge, thus encouraging a high-level of use of information systems. This idea of fixed charges is not new. Until 1971, Japan had a system of fixed charges for calls made within city limits. In the United States, a system ofintra-city fixed charges is employed in many areas. To think that the meter-rate system is the one and only arrangement possible would be hasty. In Arlington, a suburb of Boston where this writer lived for two years, residents had the option of fixed rates, enabling them to call anywhere within the city or neighboring areas (including Boston) as much as they wanted for the set charge of $29.29. For this writer, this meant being able to call up the computer at Harvard University, from home and to send electronic mail anywhere in the world. It also meant being able to make connections to computers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other universities without any additional charge. This writer's monthly phone bill, on average, came to about 3,100 yen for the equivalent of about 2,400 minutes on the phone. In Japan, on the other hand, for a connection between Tokyo and the neighboring city of Kawasaki, callers would have to pay a basic charge of 1,550 yen along with an additional 16,000 yen for the call, for a total of 17,550 yen. This doesn't mean, however, that calls within city limits are necessarily cheaper in the United States and higher in Japan. Japan's rate structure is clearly more favorable for shorter calls. The problem is that, for users who want to transmit a large volume of data, a necessity in multimedia, the fee structure in Japan is very onerous. If this fee structure reflected true costs, there might not be anything that could be done about it. In today's age of distributed processing, however, the existing fee structure has lost its meaning, and maintaining it will only stand in the way of users. Relaxing restriction on the resale or leasing of circuits is an important basis for a system that hopes to correct its fee structure and encourage providers to cross over into new territories, disregarding existing fences which mark off city, regional, and national boundaries. Specifically, it is necessary to deregulate the connections, or hook ups, between private and public services. In the telecommunications industry, there are public services that are comparable to buses, an example of publicly owned, public (mass) transportation, and there are private services that are comparable to chartered buses. The business of leasing out private lines is like the business of setting up scheduled tours, using buses chartered from the bus company. Connecting public and private services, then, is like setting up a tour that uses both chartered buses and regular (publicly accessible), scheduled airline flights. That such tours (at least, in regard to voice services) are not recognized is a fact of life in Japan and a major deterrent to the development of diverse services. To continue with our analogy, the tour business would fold if one of the conditions for a tour was that everything up to [but not including] the planes that were used had to be chartered. Doing away with regulations regarding the leasing of private lines would be a valuable step for those in the telecommunications industry who hope to regionally expand their services and, without the confusion over ownership rights to telephone lines and facilities within city limits, will make it possible for them to quickly develop advanced services covering large areas. In fact, in the data communications field, where deregulation has been occurring, powerful carriers like BT and AT&T have sent in their globalizing forces and are leasing services here, in Japan, too. Not only are fees below those charged for public services offered by the telephone companies in the past, a savings due to the development of technology which makes use of circuits with greater efficiency; with a fixed-rate system, an alternative is being offered that better matches the needs of high-volume system users. Symbolic of what is happening is the fact that AT&T-JENS is leasing services connecting users to local area networks at a cost four times lower than the fees charged domestically by NTT. Internet and other U.S. "information highway" networks as well as other foreign carriers are in the process of expanding their presence in Japan as fixed-rate, leased services. In Japan, the resale or leasing of private lines--something which introduces competition into the telecommunications service area and brings about diversity as well as lower costs--is strictly regulated. In the United States and England, this type of restriction was quickly done away with; in Japan, where such restrictions still exist, they have become barriers to the development of advanced services by foreign carriers and to new businesses entering Japan's domestic market. What would be desirable is for restrictions on the leasing of private lines to be relaxed as soon as possible and for the situation to exist where foreign and domestic companies compete regardless of existing fences. In this article, major problems standing in the way of these things happening have been discussed in terms of the telecommunications administration's fencing policy, which divides the industry by regional, city, and national boundaries and prohibits businesses from crossing over into each other's territory. This policy may have been appropriate for Japan's old, centralized telephone network. But it is clear, from the above discussion, that it hampers competition and technological progress in an age of global, distributed networks. Reform Is Essential Unlike other major countries that are revamping rate structures and outdated telecommunications systems built on a telephone-based concept of communications, Japan has stuck to its old ways, unable to discard either its existing rate structure or its outdated telecommunications system. If Japan retains these old ways, the multimedia age will be a long time in coming. Adjusting the ISDN rate structure to the existing telephone rate structure may be a good way to preserve the old order, but like a wall, it blocks the way to a new era. And it will have serious repercussions for the competitiveness of every Japanese company. The kind of system reform that has been discussed here will inevitably profit some businesses and hurt others, and it calls for some tough decisions for government administrators. It may even call for a political solution. But the type of reform that has been advocated here is, for Japan's future, necessary and essential.
