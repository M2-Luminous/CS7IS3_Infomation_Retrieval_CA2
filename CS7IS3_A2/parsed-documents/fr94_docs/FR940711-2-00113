FR940711-2-00113 FR940711-2-00049 In response to the field comments several changes have been made to the incentive policy guidance as originally proposed. First, Governors will be encouraged, but not required, to include these criteria in State incentive policy for PY 1994. States will be required to incorporate these criteria (i.e., they cannot be zero-weighted) beginning in PY 1995. In the interim States can use data from the Standardized Program Information Reports (SPIR) for PYs 1992 and 1993 to establish performance benchmarks for programs serving out-of-school youth and job placements providing employer-assisted benefits. Therefore, the Department is giving Governors maximum flexibility in terms of how these criteria may be applied. Suggested approaches for rewarding improved service to out-of-school youth and placements in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits will be included in the Training and Employment Guidance Letter appended to this Notice. Several commenters noted that the intent of the incentive provisions is to encourage service to more out-of-school youth; thus, SDAs should be rewarded solely on the extent to which they exceed the statutory minimum service levels. The Department's position is that rewarding SDAs simply on the basis of increasing the numbers of out-of-school youth does not go far enough in addressing the disappointing findings from the National JTPA study. Thus, while SDAs will not be exempted from the statutory requirement to serve at least 50% out-of-school youth, ETA is encouraging States to use incentive funds to pilot innovative youth models and to evaluate and replicate promising strategies. 20-Hour Requirement Section 106(k) of JTPA requires for performance standards purposes that employment be for at least 20 or more hours per week. This requirement applies to Title II&hyph;A (adults), Title II&hyph;C (youth), Section 204(d) (older workers), and Title III (dislocated workers) programs. About 15 percent of the comments questioned the reasonableness of this requirement for in-school youth, older workers, or disabled participants, and requested that the Department waive it in these cases. Since this requirement is explicitly defined in the statute, it cannot be waived. Several commenters also requested clarification about the reference period, i.e., whether a ``week'' means 5 or 7 days and whether follow-up is needed to verify that an individual actually worked for at least 20 hours. For determining compliance with this provision, a ``week'' means a period of 7 consecutive days, and the 20 or more hours is to be understood as a condition of employment. (See section 5 of the attached TEGL.) No formal verification is required, but the Department encourages States to set up a system that would, at a minimum, provide for random checking to assess compliance by SDAs.
