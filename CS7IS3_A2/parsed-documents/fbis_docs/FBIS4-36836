He said in a statement that he doubts that Damascus is prepared for real peace. It is natural that Peres has no evidence of this, while the whole world has proof that Israel not only rejects peace, but seeks to sabotage it, divide its basic concepts, and besiege its objectives. It does this so that peace, which the world thinks should be comprehensive and just, is transformed into incomplete deals and separate and paralyzed agreements that preserve the occupation and strengthen hegemony, and entrenches aggression against the Arabs -- aggression which has been continuing since 1948. The Israel that continues to launch blatant aggressions against south Lebanon in the atmosphere of peace for which the international community has aspired, does not want peace. The Israel that kidnaps a Lebanese citizen, while he was safe among his family and children in a condemned act of piracy, does not want peace. The Israel that looks at the comprehensive peace process through narrow holes, and draws weak parties to the cycle of its interests, and exploits them for its objectives, does not want peace. It seeks to sabotage peace and to empty it of its just humanitarian contents. Israel seeks to change peace into mere deals between two parties: one that dictates, and one that submissively signs under the pretext of international circumstances and developments that cannot be confronted. These are some of Israel's practices aimed at aborting the peace process. These practices emphasize that Israel understands peace far from its reality, and believes in it away from the facts of the region and logic. Israel wants to isolate parties, and then replace the comprehensive solution with partial solutions that serve its concept of peace and its interests while continuing the occupation and dictating other conditions that serve its future aggressive objectives. Regrettably, Israel has realized what it wants, due to Arab division and the weakness of certain parties and individuals as a result of shortsightedness, limited vision, and weakness of their pan-Arab affiliation and understanding of the objectives which the Arab people aspire to realize. Nevertheless, while Syria is seeking to realize comprehensive and just peace it will never relinquish a grain of sand or a single right whether Peres casts doubts or not. No progress in the peace talks will be made unless Israel stops these practices and responds to the requisites of comprehensive peace, foremost of which is full withdrawal from the land to the borders of 4 June 1967 as one of the pillars of real peace--peace whose requisites were understood by the whole world, not the peace that Peres speaks about and wants. Peres is fully aware that Syria wants peace, and this peace does not cope at all with Israel's aggressive aspirations, but it restricts these aspirations in a manner that corrects things and restores just balances. This is how peace can be realized, and without this there will be no peace.
