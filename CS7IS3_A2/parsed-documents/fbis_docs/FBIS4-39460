FBIS4-39460 "drsov110_a_94037" FBIS-SOV-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Turkey to Provide $35 Million To Gagauzia Turkey to Provide $35 Million To Gagauzia LD0706205394 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1613 GMT 7 Jun 94 LD0706205394 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Turkey will allot a 35 million dollar-credit for development of Gagauzia. President of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic Stepan Topal told Interfax in an interview on the results of the visit of Turkish President Suleyman Demirel that 32 million would be utilized for supply of the region with drinking water and 3 million would go for development of the infrastructure. Topal hoped that the problem concerning the political status of the southern Moldovan region mostly populated by Gagauz, would be resolved in the near future. He suggested that this would help to stabilize the social-political situation in the region and to attract foreing investments. Commenting on relations with the Transdniestrian leadership, Topal said they remained the same and were proceeding from the treaty on friendship and cooperation signed in 1992. The fact that Gagauzia seeks cooperation with Turkey rather than with Transdniestria cannot hinder our relations. "Together with Transdnietsria we have stood for preservation of the USSR and we will not refuse from cooperation with the ex-Soviet republics, primarily with Russia," Topal pointed out.
