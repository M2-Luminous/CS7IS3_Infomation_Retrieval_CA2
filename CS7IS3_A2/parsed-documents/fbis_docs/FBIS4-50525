The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, made the remarks at the weekly press conference here this afternoon. On may 17, Fredrick F. Chien claimed in Taiwan's "Legislative Yuan" that Taiwan was prepared to accept South Africa's dual recognition of the two sides across the Taiwan straits. Wu said, this is yet another ploy of the Taiwan authorities aimed at creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" in disregard of the overall interests of the Chinese nation. He noted that it is a fact recognized by the United Nations and the international community at large that there is only one China in the world, the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. "It is on this basis that China has established diplomatic relations with 158 countries in the world," said Wu. "It is futile for the Taiwan authorities to try to end Taiwan's isolation in the world by way of 'dual recognition'", he said. "the only right choice is for them to go along with the historical tide by helping bring about national reunification at an early date." The Chinese Government appreciates the position of South African President Mandela and the African National Congress to pursue a one- China policy and their pledge to address their relations with China in accordance with the practice of the United Nations and other international organizations, Wu said. "We believe that the relations between China and the new South Africa will develop in an all-round way on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence," said the spokesman.
