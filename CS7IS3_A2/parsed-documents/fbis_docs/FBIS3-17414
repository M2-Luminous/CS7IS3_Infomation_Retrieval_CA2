Co-Authors of the Provocation Stay in the Shadows": "A Joke of Yesterday's Dissident"] [Text] On Thursday, 24 March, Gleb Pavlovskiy, a well-known journalist and editor-in-chief of the VEK XX I MIR [The 20th Century and the World] magazine, came to our editorial board and said that the theory of the alleged coup, which, upon OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's publication, has been keeping both domestic and foreign mass media in suspense for a week already, was his "working text," a "routine working fact-sheet -- a compilation of open data, including reports of news agencies, primarily TASS, POSTFACTUM, and RIA, and also press, radio reports, and so forth." Mr. Pavlovskiy told us that "the text was prepared by various people using a production line method..." It is analytical material for official use only, and it found its way into the hands of high- ranking officials and to newspaper editorial boards without his knowledge. Mr. Pavlovskiy believes that the "version" was stolen from his work table or from his computer and was distributed by "well-wishers" with whom he is not familiar. Having neither the possibility nor any wish to verify the authenticity of the details given by Mr. Pavlovskiy, the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board believes that the theory he divulged is scarcely more convincing than the scandalous "Version No. 1." Mr. Pavlovskiy tells a lie in calling his "working text" "a compilation of open data." The existence of a group of coup plotters, their names, and the details of their "conspiracy" are a wholesale fabrication of the "version's" authors. The way the "facts" were presented is not reminiscent, even remotely, of the drafting of a hypothetical theory. What kind of theory is it if the names of those who are preparing a coup d'etat are written in black and white? It looks much more like an anonymous report to the competent bodies. The former dissident (and, to our great regret, a member of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's editorial board) appears to have forgotten how much blood the country had to shed because of such "analytical memos." Presumably, the author of the theory is suffering from exaggerated curiosity and was anxious to find out how his words would echo. That is to say, he was guided by a pure researcher's interest. But so foolish experiments are also too dangerous in a country with a bad heredity. It cannot be ruled out, either, that Mr. Pavlovskiy simply wished to get embroiled in a scandal: how can one become famous without a scandal? This could have been done in a more humane way, however. But we do not think it necessary to go into the personal plans of the "Version's" author. What's done is done, and it stinks. The author's self-esteem may be considered to have been flattered, though: his initiative (if it is really his, of course) turned out to have many co-authors. After all, someone has started distributing "Version No. 2" following "Version No. 1." This means that is has come in handy for someone. I would dearly love to learn for whom. The provocation's co-authors are still hidden in the shadows.
