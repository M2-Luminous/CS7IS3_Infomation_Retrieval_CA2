The newspaper O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO today reported that in the face of the indignation caused by the salary privileges the STF granted to itself and a similar attempt by members of Congress, the eight military ministers suggested President Franco carry out a coup. During a meeting held five days ago with Franco in Planalto Palace, the commanders found President Franco "receptive" to their criticisms and demands to approve a salary equity law for the three government branches. Following the meeting, which was attended by some civilian ministers, President Itamar Franco officially expressed his discontent with the decision made by the STF and Congress, and he then refused to grant them the wage increase, calculated to be 10.9 percent and possibly amounting to more than $1.25 billion, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso said today. When EFE asked a Government House spokesman about the "self coup" idea, he answered: "No comment." The military chiefs sent their message in different ways. The newspaper states that Strategic Affairs Secretary Admiral Cesar Flores made the strongest proposals like closing down Congress, the replacement of the STF justices, and earlier elections -- except for president. As a result of this crisis, President Franco, a 63-year-old civil engineer, has come out stronger in his position and, according to O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO, he has become a chief of state "under military tutelage with a discredited Congress and a Judicial Branch that insists on not bending." Franco said the STF decision "is outside the law," which brought him applause from the Armed Forces, opposition leader and presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula Da Silva, several governors, and the public in general. Franco, whose popularity has dropped constantly, was supported by 85 percent of the people surveyed by the Instituto Soma polling company. "Franco has proceeded correctly. I do not know if he has followed military instructions but the Judicial Branch has committed a shameful action instead of creating justice," said Da Silva, who is the favorite candidate for the 3 October elections according to polls. The STF justices and Judicial Branch employees today received their salaries without the 10.9-percent increase implemented to compensate for an alleged salary loss as a result of the salary conversion into the Real Value Unit (URV) based on the dollar exchange rate and the plan implemented to curb inflation, which amounts to 40 percent per month. With the purpose of appeasing the spirits, the Senate has rejected a decision by the Chamber of Deputies to follow the STF's example and increase the salaries of members of Congress and Legislative Branch employees by 23.5 percent. The STF's discredit before the public and which Congress has been suffering for several months has encouraged several military chiefs to bring up the constitutional precept that allows the president to declare a state of national defense and they recalled the atmosphere preceding the 1964 military coup. "The troops are not indifferent to the people's demands. Thirty years ago we attended to a demand by the people for ideological reasons, and now it may be for reasons of `privileges' [the Judicial and Legislative Branches' salaries]," said Federal Police chief and retired Army Colonel Wilson Romao. Navy Minister Ivan Serpa criticized the justices and members of Congress, but he also rejected any eventual coup attempt by military units. "If I find someone defending that position I will either arrest or discharge him," Serpa said.
