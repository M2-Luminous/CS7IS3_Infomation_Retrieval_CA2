He told the news conference Lithuanian Army could not fight against an aggressor for any longer period of time, therefore the national defence conception should be based on the resistance of all the nation. But the Army is not ready even for that -- it seems to be very poor. Meanwhile, bureaucrats of National Defence Ministry live in prosperity. Petkevicius said the committee would do its best to leave not more than 30-40 employees in the ministry instead of 214. And the Army is needed as much as the state is capable to maintain. 130 million lats [as received] are provided for needs of national defence in 1994 and this reflects real possibilities of today. Petkevicius expressed indignation the means were used irrationally and sometimes even wasted. Voluntary National Defence Service /SKAT/ should be a reserve of Armed Forces, a sub-unit of National Defence Ministry and not an organization organizing rallies, Petkevicius said. Some units and services of SKAT are headed by people with no understanding of military things. Speaking about state border protection Petkevicius said it should be and will be given over to the border police. National Security service was in principle destroyed by earlier governments and now the things must be newly restored, Petkevicius said. Lithuania had become an object of international spying. Foreign secret services knew about Lithuania, its national defence and national security more than Lithuania itself, he added. The committee is preparing draft laws determining activity of services of national defence and national security, Petkevicius said.
