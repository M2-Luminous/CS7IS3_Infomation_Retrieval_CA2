This is the first time a Chinese prison has introduced such a system. With a view to better transforming prisoners and ensuring production safety, the Lunan 7 May Prison has decided to try out among its prisoners a graded wage system, which consists of 1) a basic wage, including 45 yuan as living expenses and 5 yuan as pocket money; 2) a graded wage varying from 10 to 35 yuan, with a 5- yuan difference at each grade; 3) an incentive wage depending on the output of production; 4) various allowances; and 5) a frugality award. It has been learned that under the graded wage system, prisoners with an outstanding performance in transformation and production can earn a monthly income of over 200 yuan. The graded wage system practiced in the 7 May Prison has helped stimulate the enthusiasm and consciousness of prisoners in remolding themselves, ensure safety in transformation and production, enhance the labor and technical qualities of prisoners, and put an end to waste.
