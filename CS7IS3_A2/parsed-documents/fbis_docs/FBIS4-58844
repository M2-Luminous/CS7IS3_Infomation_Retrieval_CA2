They, therefore, are considered rebels against the constitutional legitimacy around which the people are rallying and which they freely chose. We want to explain here that we appreciate the interest and sympathy of brothers and friends. We also want to make it clear that there is no longer any excuse for mediation. Also, the forces of apostasy and secession are on the verge of surrender and they will be taken into account for their acts. This matter is known by everybody. The armed units that receive orders from al-Bid and his clique, which dominates the [Yemeni] Socialist Party, are collapsing one after other. Many of these units' officers and personnel have surrendered now that they have become aware of the objectives of those who misled them. The door is open before the other units to join the units that are defending unity and chasing those rebelling against constitutional legitimacy. We want also to say that through their calls for mediation the leaders of apostasy and separation want another opportunity to continue their game of undermining Yemen's unity. This is rejected by the legitimate leadership, which was patient for a long time and tried to achieve reconciliation with the gang of apostasy, separation, and evil, but to no avail. Since the gang of apostasy and separation has not desisted from its path and is not aware of the pains caused by its practices, the only way is to apply the law on the criminals who worked to drive a wedge among the people, ignite the fire of sedition, and launch a all-out war [words indistinct] units of our Armed Forces, which they deceived, to fight the units defending unity and constitutional legitimacy. What, then, is the meaning of the talk about mediation? In the past, the gang of apostasy and secession resorted to maneuvering and procrastination in the face of mediation. It used to ridicule the mediators and the legitimate leadership in order to evade all agreements. Arab brothers and friends became aware of this fact and knew full well the practices and twisted methods of the gang of apostasy and secession, which is considered -- in accordance with the Constitution, law, and reason -- a rebellious clique. It even committed crimes of high treason. It ignored national constants, called for estrangement, and worked to destroy unity. It tampered with public funds, shook security, and undermined the stability of the whole Yemeni people. After long patience and indulgence, can we ignore all this and accept any mediation just so that the gang of apostasy can regain its breath and prepare to replace the scenario of this war, which it ignited, with a scenario of another war? Our country -- leadership and people -- are awaiting the natural end of the gang of apostasy and secession that aimed at spreading bloodshed throughout the homeland and which is still dreaming of spreading a civil war in the streets. [words indistinct] know that there is no civil [word indistinct] at all. What is taking place are military operations aimed at subjugating the party rebelling against constitutional legitimacy, the party that seeks (?separation) and bloodshed.
