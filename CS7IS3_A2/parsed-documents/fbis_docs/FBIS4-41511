[Lukashenka] What took place was a sensation only for those who did not want to see the truth. For our team, however, this was a disappointment, because we had counted on more votes and a victory already in the first round. I believe that this is not a sensation for the people either. The impoverished, destitute people for the first time had an opportunity to elect a man from their circles. So the people expressed their views. I would like to show my gratitude to everyone who voted in my support. This is first. Second, I believe that all the best, the most suitable Supreme Soviet deputies found themselves in my ranks. [Nazarovich] How are you going to work on the second round of the presidential election -- to unmask corrupted officials or to present a creative program? [Lukashenka] I was simply responding to all those assaults and mud that was thrown at me. Regarding the unmasking, I will again repeat: Those who are involved in corruption must not remain in power. After all, all who were debunked by our commission have not repented. They are ready to give up everything, in order to complete construction of their houses. Yet, can one do that at the current wages? This means that the people are again being plundered. Regarding the second part of your question, during these two weeks we will pay special attention to explaining the creative potential of our program. We have set up three primary directions -- curbing inflation and price hikes, fighting corruption, and establishing close ties between Belarus and Russia. We have currently prepared a package of issues concerning resolutions to economic problems, in order to stop decline in production as early as in six months, to put enterprises into operation, to return fired people to their old work places, and to create new work places. We want to do that with the help of Russia, which, I hope, will meet us half-way. I will not retreat from the electoral battle, and I will not withdraw my candidacy, even under the most extreme threats against me.
