Algerian Prime Minister Kokdad Sifi said after a meeting with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe that stability in his country concerned not only Algeria but also "its close and distant neighbors and all Europe." Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri said that he would not rule out the release of Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] Leader Cheikh Abbasi Madani. The Algerian minister escalated his country's position on the issue of the Western Sahara and warned of the consequences of holding a dishonest referendum. At a press conference he held Wednesday evening [22 June] in Washington, Dembri said that he discussed with the U.S. officials he met with the question of the Sahara crisis, particularly the question of support for the UN plan. "We discussed the difficulties which appeared in the past few months as far as fulfillment of the appropriate prerequisites for an impartial and fair referendum, the most important being the determination of identity, the number of voters, organization of the election campaign, and the required guarantees after the referendum. These matters have not been tackled yet. They should be tackled in accordance with the Security Council resolutions through direct negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario. We encourage that. At the same, if the negotiations led to a Moroccan-Saharan Evian...why not?" The Algerian minister said that the U.S. side confirmed continued "support for the UN plan and for the solution of the outstanding problems." Asked about the possibility of an Algerian-Moroccan confrontation, he replied that Algeria is a state with responsibilities, does not want adventurism over the region's stability, and is willing to work for the promotion of the necessary solutions "but we warned all parties, including the United Nations, that if no impartial referendum is carried out...that might lead us to a situation similar to what happened in Angola ...." The Algerian minister expressed satisfaction with the results of his talks with senior officials in Washington, especially Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Presidential National Security Adviser Anthony Lake. He said that President Bill Clinton's administration showed understanding and support for the Algerian Government's reform steps in the political and economic fields. He saw "the observations made" by the U.S. side "as part of the exchange of views" between the two governments, and said that Algeria is not prepared "to seek advice on how to run our own home" because that would be "like interference in our internal affairs." The Algerian minister confirmed that he explained to the U.S. side the efforts his government is making "for an open dialogue with all on the condition of respect for the constitution, the rule of law, the component of the national identity, separation of Islam from the political debate, plurality, the republican regime, and exclusion of violence as a means of reaching power or staying in power." He added that Washington expressed support for that and for the expansion of participation, and condemned terrorism. He considered that the U.S. criticisms on human rights violations were aimed directly at "terrorist practices and not the Algerian authorities." He noted that Secretary Christopher expressed the administration's satisfaction with the "serious approach" of the government and "its way of reviving the election process as soon as possible." He added that there was an exchange of views on the need to enlarge the circle of dialogue which, he said, "is open to everyone without exception, only barring elements who take up arms against the rules of the political game." He added that the U.S. Administration wished to see "the dialogue broadened at the earliest opportunity to ensure the success of the political process. That is also our hope. We in Algeria are working for broader participation...." He also said that Christopher told him that the U.S. press reports of a change in the position of the administration and reapprochement with the opposition "did not reflect its position." The Algerian official said that he noticed that some U.S. officials had misunderstood the facts of what is happening in Algeria as some of them still believed that what used to happened in the days of the government of Abdesselam Belaid "is still happening now." Asked about the possibility of releasing Cheikh Abbasi Madani, the Algerian opposition leader, he replied: "Everything concerning the issue of the prisoners is possible in a democratic regime because that is linked to the powers of the head of state. I do not know if there is any possibility in this connection but I do not rule out such a possibility...." Asked about the nature of the differences between France and the United States on the situation in Algeria, he replied that he knew the nature of the U.S.-French differences "but we proceed on the basis of: What interests does Algeria have with France and what interests does it have with the United States?" He said that Algeria occupies the top position among the Arab states in terms of trade and economic relations with France, and comes third after Saudi Arabia and Egypt in its trade and economic relations with the United States. "With the Americans and the French we discuss common interests...and we do not waste time on the differences. At the same time, when they behave in a manner denoting interference in our affairs, we tell them that is unacceptable...." In Paris, Mokdad Sifi met on his last day in France with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. After the meeting, which was held at the Quai D'Orsay, the French minister said: "We exchanged views on the situation in Algeria and the region. I restated to Sifi France's position since he became prime minister. It is a position of full solidarity with Algeria. We wish Algeria stability because it is a part of a region of direct interest to France. We had expressed the hope that Algeria would start economic reforms in the direction of a market economy. That is now being done. As regards the agreements signed with the IMF, they were very positive and we have honored our commitments in them. France has made large contributions to international and bilateral aid. We had also expressed the hope that a political dialogue would begin with all parties which agree to join. We have received assurances that this is what is happening now. I welcomed the fact that the European troika ministers have visited Algeria to confirm that position which is also France's position." In reply to a question from AL-HAYAH on the difference between the U.S. and the French positions on the situation in Algeria, Juppe said: "We discussed this issue with President Clinton who recently visited Paris. There was an identity of views. President Clinton assured us that he supports the stabilization process and the economic reform program in Algeria." Asked if Sifi's visit was more economic than political, he replied: "There are two aspects to his visit. Stability in Algeria depends on the success of the economic reform in improving the conditions of the population. The Algerian prime minister stressed to us the need to improve the standards of the population, provide work opportunities, and improve living conditions, but that must be coupled with political dialogue with anyone willing to abandon the knives and the Kalashnikovs. That should begin quickly in order to lead to legislative elections as soon as possible." Sifi said that he agreed with everything Juppe said, and he emphasized that he found that "our French partners understand our situation and the challenges we face, particularly as they have placed Algeria's problem in the broader framework of European-Maghreb relations." He aded: "We are satisfied with that assessment which was also confirmed to me by the officials I met with in Europe. They conveyed to me their multifaceted support in all fields to enable Algeria to end its crisis and contribute to the region's stability. Stability concerns Algeria first but it also concerns its near and distant neighbors as well as all Europe."
