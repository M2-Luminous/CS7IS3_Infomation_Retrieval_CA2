Mihail: "Concerted Fire Upon the Leu"] [Text] Recent recommendations of the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and the World Bank laid a special emphasis on the reduction of the arrears. These are unpaid and overdue debts over many months, sometimes even years. Besides hindering production, the arrears cause great delays in the paying of debts toward suppliers, banks, the state budget, and so on. Over the past years, the overall amount of money blocked in this way in our economy varied between 1 and 3 trillion lei. This is a monetary mass parallel to the monetary issue proper. The discount documents issued for money that has never been cashed in are actually unproductively piled up money. This artificially created monetary mass generates inflation because the initially blocked companies, as well as those subsequently blocked in a kind of a chain reaction resort to anti-economic steps in order to overcome the situation: They reduce production, personnel, and salaries, prefer to manufacture goods solely for export, and hoard the hard currency they earn. All this generates inflation. Arrears are a breeding ground for inflation, because the money they represent, regardless whether they are debts to be paid or debts to be cashed, never returns to the monetary circuit. This is money that is actually buried in a genuine cemetery of dead money. The covering of arrears of any kind by taking or granting further bank loans represents inflation caused by inflation. It is tantamount to a genuine financial disaster. We resolutely assert this so that the grave mistakes made over the past years should not be made again. Because it is not the money that makes the economic situation recover, but rather the other way round, that is, a betterment can only be achieved by economic measures, above all by restructuring and re-equipping the economy. Besides the state budget deficit and the arrears, the most grave current aspect of Romania's finances is represented by the huge volume of the so-called current bank loans, which cannot be paid back. This is a source of catastrophic inflation. Currently, the overall volume of bank loans amounts to 4 trillion lei, which greatly exceeds the maximum limit established by the IMF, a limit which is considered by them as one of the performance criteria they expect us to comply with. That criteria was not imposed whimsically by those international financial and banking bodies, but rather by force of the objective fact that the loan bleeding also means inflation, as such money never returns to the circuit of production. Out of the total amount of loans, worth 4 trillion lei, over 3.5 trillion, that is, about 90 percent, was granted to the state-owned economic sector. Some of the public corporations and the state-owned companies that perform badly, lose money, produce for stockpiles, or work at low efficiency are unable to repay the loans they were given. In despair they plunge further into the red, because they take newer loans that are increasingly expensive. This may be regarded as a genuine cemetery of loans, which is continuously growing, and to which also the due interest ought to be added, which currently amounts to about 250 billion lei per month. The growth of inflation, as well as the danger of being left without capital made the BNR [Romanian National Bank] increase the interest rate of loans granted in auctions to 120 percent and the interest rate of the so-called overdraft loans to 250 percent. The other banks cannot reactivate the loans taken previously and therefore they are compelled to take new loans from the BNR at a 250 percent interest rate, which they cannot possibly pay back. Under such circumstances, the latest restrictive measures and the increase of the interest rates block economic activity more and more severely. Currently all ways to finance economy by means of loans are quite discouraging, because the loans granted in auctions are offered for merely a few weeks, while in case of the overdraft loans obtained from the BNR, the commercial banks apply an interest rate amounting to 260 percent. Under such circumstances, merely a few hundred million lei's worth of loans at a 260 percent interest rate were taken, which is very little compared to the companies' desperate need for funds. Worried by the rate of inflation, not only companies, but also banks began to invest their own financial resources in buildings, automobiles, and other highly valuable goods, which further reduced their resources to be used to offer loans. The banks' fear of losing their capital is a far graver phenomenon than the paralyzing of the economy by prohibitive interest rates and the cessation of new loans owing to the lack of capital. Under the circumstances of the rampant increase of the inflation rate, the excess amount of money existing on the market cannot be absorbed by the issuing of state bonds or other similar things, such as the shares of privately owned companies. This is why the state failed when it issued bonds trying to borrow money from the population and companies in an attempt to cover the budget deficit to curb inflation. Each time they tried, they failed because only a handful of persons were willing to invest money in slips of paper the value of which was continuously dropping and their refund date for which lies years away. Besides, why should the citizens and the companies trust the correctness of the state's policy, after they got used to their hard currency being confiscated, the leu's exchange rate being arbitrarily established, and their salaries and pensions being indexed in a proportion that by far does not cover the price hikes and the increase in taxes, fees, and the suffocating interest rates? Those who today own bonds issued in the previous years by the state are currently struggling to regain their money, as the amounts they invested have depreciated gravely. The same lack of confidence of the citizens and companies made the National Road Administration refrain from issuing bonds so that it could pay back to the state the 14-billion-lei loan it had been given from the state budget for the initial works on the Bucharest-Constanta freeway, although Government Decision No. 472 of 29 August 1993 stipulates the issuing of such bonds. In order to make bonds more attractive, not only the interest, but also the invested money should be periodically indexed on the basis of the evolution of the lei-dollar exchange rate. But who would venture to do such a thing over many years in the name of the state, which is accustomed to always gaining and never losing money in its economic relations with companies and citizens? The shares issued by certain privately owned companies also have a limited scope, first because, in our country, there is still no stock exchange market where one can trade one's shares freely; second, because the stock companies do not offer sufficient shares because they cannot offer annual dividends that exceed the 100 percent interest rates paid by the BCR [Romanian Commercial Bank] or the Agricultural Bank. Generally speaking, bonds and shares, regardless of whether they have been issued by the state, private companies, or banks, cannot absorb the inflation. The fact that bonds and shares, under the circumstances of the decline of economy, are inefficient means to curb the aggressive growth of inflation is also proved by the fate of the so-called property vouchers, which were handed out to the almost 16 million adult citizens of Romania. Considering the value of 140,000 lei attributed by the state to each of those vouchers, the whole amount exceeds 2.2 trillion lei. However, owing to the fact that the vouchers cannot be used as shares of very profitable companies, their actual value is much lower than the one attributed to them by the state. This is proved by the fact that in railway stations and markets people offer them for sale for a few thousand lei. Let us not deceive ourselves: We have always been and continue to be owners of mere slips of paper. The ridiculous dividend amounting to 400 lei offered for each share of the Cluj-based Ursus company -- the first company that ever issued shares to the population -- clearly reveals the fate of the property vouchers when they are turned into company shares.
