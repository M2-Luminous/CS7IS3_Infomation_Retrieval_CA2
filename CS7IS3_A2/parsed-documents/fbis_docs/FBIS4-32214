This was unofficially stated by reliable sources in Kriva Palanka. On Sunday [19 June] morning the "captured" Macedonian officer was allowed to go back to the Macedonian side of the border. The soldiers of the so-called Yugoslav Army who have taken over the strategic point of Mount Straza on Macedonian territory do not show any intention of leaving it, and in the meantime the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] observers moved their headquarters to a safer place than Cupino Brdo -- the village of Podrzikonj.
