With the enforcement of the law Korea became the first tax-free country in the world. The Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that regard it as the supreme principle of their activities to promote the welfare of the people have paid deep attention to making the working people evenly well off and steadily improving their living. Under the popular policies of the party and the state the predatory tax system, a leftover of the old society, was destroyed to give place to a popular tax system after the liberation of the country. More than fifty kinds of miscellaneous taxes were abolished and tax was unified. Even in the difficult period after the war measures were adopted to systematically reduce the tax burden of the people. In 1955 the income tax of the factory and office workers was cut by thirty percent and the tax burden of the handicraftsmen, entrepreneurs and traders slashed drastically. The rate of the agricultural tax in kind which accounted for 25 percent of the harvest dropped to 20.1 percent on an average in the same year and it again went down to 8.4 percent in 1959. The agricultural tax in kind from which farmers had been partially exempted was completely abolished in 1966 so that all the farm produce could be turned entirely to the improvement of the living standards of the agricultural working people. Later, even the negligible income tax levied upon the factory and office workers was completely repealed. The word "tax" is gradually fading in the memory of the people. The younger generation does not know what it means. The people enjoy the daily growing, enormous benefits from the state, far from paying taxes to the state. The additional benefits rendered by the state under the social and cultural measures such as free education, free medical service, paid leave, free accommodation at sanatoria and holiday homes, old age pension and social security, exceed the wages of the working people.
