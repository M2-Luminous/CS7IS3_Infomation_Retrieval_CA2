The U.S. television network CNN today said that an official of the British Lyon Corporation, which specializes in the production of sweets and chocolates, has revealed that U.S. counterparts used banned chemical products in the production of sweets that were specially prepared for the U.S. troops taking part in the Gulf war. CNN quoted Edward Harrison as saying that if it were not for the chemical products used in the production of sweets, the sweets corporations would not have been able to cope with the problem presented by chocolate melting under the extremely high temperature in Saudi Arabia, where the U.S. troops were deployed. It is to be recalled that U.S. troops complained that the sweets they received at the time were not in good shape. This prompted the U.S. military command to ask U.S. sweets corporations to find a rapid solution to this problem. An official source in Baghdad commented on this news report, saying that the U.S. Department of Defense is making various attempts and promoting various lies to obliterate the facts pertaining to the mysterious disease that has plagued U.S. and British troops. Independent U.S. scientific quarters, he added, have said that the cause of this disease is the handling of shells coated with depleted uranium, which produces radioactive reactions inside vehicles, aircraft, and tanks, thus affecting the health of troops, not to mention the impact the on environment.
