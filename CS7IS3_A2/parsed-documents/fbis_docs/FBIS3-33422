The Fourth District judge was unable to enter the National Palace because of the crowd outside the building. Tight security measures have been implemented and the doors to the building have been closed. Meanwhile, the government minister, along with several of his associates, remains in his office inside the building. The workers, Fenasep members, announced a few minutes ago that the president of the Republic has authorized the attorney general and government minister to hold talks with them. Nevertheless, this is opposed by the majority of the workers. Here is government worker Armando Sanchez who is outside the palace. [Sanchez] [passage indistinct] [Reporter] In addition, we also want to report that besides the five diplomats we mentioned in an earlier report who are inside the National Palace, the Paraguayan Ambassador Gilberto Caniza also finds himself trapped inside. These diplomats, along with those people who went to the National Palace today to carry out normal business and reporters who normally cover events at the palace, have been prevented from leaving. This is also true of officials who went to the Foreign Relations Ministry today to attend a diplomatic event that has been canceled in the wake of this situation.
