ACTION: Notice of Revocation of Countervailing Duty Order. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (the Department) is revoking the countervailing duty order on leather wearing apparel from Uruguay because it is no longer of interest to interested parties. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian Albright or Mercedes Fitchett, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On July 5, 1994, the Department of Commerce published in the Federal Register (59 FR 34410) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on leather wearing apparel from Uruguay (47 FR 31032; July 17, 1982). Additionally, as required by 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served certified written notice of its intent to revoke this countervailing duty order on each party listed on its most current service list. Domestic interested parties who might object to the revocation were provided 30 days to submit their comments. Scope of the Order Imports covered by this order are shipments of Uruguayan leather wearing apparel and parts and pieces thereof. This product is currently classified under item numbers 4203.10.4030, 4203.10.4060, 4203.10.4085, and 4203.10.4095 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. Determination To Revoke The Department may revoke a countervailing duty order if the Secretary of Commerce concludes that the order is no longer of interest to interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in a countervailing duty order when no interested party has requested an administrative review for at least five consecutive review periods and when no domestic interested party objects to the revocation (19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii)). In this case, we received no request for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested party as defined under ยง355.2 (i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed opposition to revocation. Therefore, we have concluded that the countervailing duty order covering leather wearing apparel from Uruguay is no longer of interest to interested parties, and we are revoking this countervailing duty order in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii). This revocation applies to all shipments of leather wearing apparel from Uruguay exported on or after January 1, 1993. Shipments of this merchandise exported during the period January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993, will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR 355.22(g)(1). Further, as required by 19 CFR 355.25(d)(5), the Department is terminating the suspension of liquidation on the subject merchandise as of the effective date of this notice and will instruct the Customs Service to liquidate, without regard to countervailing duties, all unliquidated entries of this merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1994. This notice is published in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii). Dated: October 26, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance.
