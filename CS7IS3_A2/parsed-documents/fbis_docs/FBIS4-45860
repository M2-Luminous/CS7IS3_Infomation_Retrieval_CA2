Vladimir Kotlar, a former senior employee at the research laboratory where the virus was kept, has claimed that -- despite a strict ban --this dangerous virus was used in diagnostic exercises in the military institute in Techonin in the Orlicke Mountains. "This was an inappropriate prank by an officer," declared Kotlar. He added that the officer filled the test tubes whose contents the military scientists were to have ascertained in the exercise with the smallpox virus. "Doctors immediately vaccinated all of the approximately 20 people who came into contact with the virus and ensured that the smallpox was not passed on," he said. A Defense Ministry inspection team has now begun an investigation into what happened to the smallpox virus specimen after the military scientists had stopped working with it. This was confirmed by an army source who also said that the inspection team has meanwhile come to the conclusion that this dangerous virus was undoubtedly destroyed in 1975.
