On Thursday [2 June], the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] spoke of a "major departure" from current practice concerning the granting of export permits, and demanded that the relevant Bundestag committees be informed. The reason is a decision by the Federal Security Council reached some time ago, whereby individual permission will no longer be required for deliveries of weapons parts to the 25 countries of the OECD. The Economics Ministry confirmed this resolution last week, and said that the Association of German Industry [BDI] would now be informed about it. BDI spokesman Volker Franzen welcomed the decision, saying that German enterprises would no longer be at a disadvantage vis-a-vis other European firms. On the other hand, Hermann Bachmaier, the SPD Bundestag faction's expert on arms exports controls, criticized the whole procedure, saying that the government's principles governing arms exports, laid down in 1982 and never officially abolished, would thus be circumvented to a major extent. According to the government's resolution, supplies of weapons parts to partner enterprises in the OECD will be permissible provided that the German share in the final product does not exceed 20 percent. This relaxation does not apply to nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, nor to carrier systems. In addition, the partner firms are to reach agreement with each other on "which countries can and cannot receive supplies." The current practice of individual permits will continue to apply to exports of weapons to Third World countries. The Economics Ministry claimed that the new rules lie "within the framework of the export-political principles" of 1982, adopted by the government of Helmut Schmidt. Without specifically mentioning the OECD, the Ministry said that the exports of armaments outside NATO remains restricted and, in particular, "may not lead to the expansion of export-capable armaments production capacity." Employment considerations should also play no special significance in exports of war weapons, it was said. According to SPD deputy Buchmaier, the new resolutions will lead to a "massive expansion" of arms exports by German firms to areas beyond NATO. That would also make German weapons firms "indirectly" involved in weapons deliveries to the world's crisis spots. Buchmaier also referred to the Defense Ministry's "planning games" on the subject of establishing a European "Agency for Arms Exports." Plans like this would cause a further departure from the relatively strong German control criteria governing arms exports. Apparently, German industry has been eagerly expecting the new regulations. In a statement replying to the government resolution, German Aerospace said that European defense industries, beset by falling personnel levels, shrinking markets, and exploding costs, will be forced to adopt new forms of cooperation. "What is needed now is real Eurofirms that are capable of transcending all levels of depreciation and political borders, and can operate on the basis of their own entrepreneurial responsibility," said German Aerospace.
