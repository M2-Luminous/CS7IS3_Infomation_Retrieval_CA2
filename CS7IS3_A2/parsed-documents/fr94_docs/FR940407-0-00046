FR940407-0-00046 FR940407-0-00009 Regulatory Assessment This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Assessment is unnecessary. This rule is operational in nature and, if adopted, will result in no cost to the public. Small Entities This rule requires no new equipment and imposes no additional expense on small businesses. Additionally, this rule will decrease vehicular delay. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rulemaking contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rulemaking in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that it does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The authority to regulate the nation's drawbridges across the navigable rivers and other waters of the U.S. has been committed to the Coast Guard by Federal statutes. Therefore, the Coast Guard does not expect this rule to raise any preemption issues with respect to State actions on the same subject matter. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this final rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rulemaking is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation because it is a Bridge Administration Program action involving the promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges. For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Coast Guard amends 33 CFR part 117 as follows: PART 117_DRAWBRIDGE OPERATION REGULATIONS 1. The authority citation for part 117 continues to read as follows: Authority: 33 U.S.C. 499; 49 CFR 1.46; 33 CFR 1.05&hyph;1(g); section 117.255 also issued under the authority of Pub. L. 102&hyph;587, 106 Stat. 5039.
