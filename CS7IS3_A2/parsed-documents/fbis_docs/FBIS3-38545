However, we have two quality companies coming together and they will be able to pool research and development resources." Why should it be a great shame for Rover to become part of a larger European group? What is the downside of foreign ownership? BMW's price looks good, jobs are secured, the merged group will be a quality player in European and world markets, its scale will attract new investment, its prestige will help pull in the best managers and staff. And yet and yet; the instinctive hesitation persists. Won't key decisions now be taken by Germans? In the event of a downturn, won't the British end be the first to suffer? More generally, why are so many top-class, hi-tech British businesses now being acquired by French or German companies? The truth is that more overseas acquisitions of British companies are both likely and desirable. They are likely because Britain's post-war economic underperforrmance and the steady devaluation of the pound against the mark, and more recently against the franc, makes for a ratchet to overseas ownership. Accommodating overall economic underperformance by devaluation -- most recently on Black Wednesday -- eases political pressures at home but increases the supply of the best British businesses available to purchasers based in strong currency zones. Rover is now a manufacturing star: but in the latest World Competitiveness Report, British manufacturing is perceived to be bottom of the list: 22nd out of 22 developed countries assessed. The paradox is that our historical weakness in manufacturing makes the exceptional performers tempting takeover targets. Foreign ownership can be positively desirable. All the evidence is that European or North American purchasers of hi-tech companies have every incentive to give them maximum business autonomy, to preserve their brand images, to allow competing centres of excellence to flourish while squeezing costs. Where British businesses have achieved turnrounds on the scale of that achieved by Rover, it would be crazy for their new owners to lose their identities or make them mere outstations: the purchaser needs their distinct strengths to help capture markets that are at once larger and more discriminating. The net effect of overseas interest in Britain's economy has been foreign direct investment of more than 3 percent of GDP (in 1990) -- higher than manufacturing investment itself. This has had a tangible result: by the end of the 1980s foreign-owned firms were getting 45 percent more output from their British workers than their British equivalents (a net output per employee of 39,260 pounds compared with a domestic 27,157 pounds). Rover is a textbook example of the process. It was rescued from its past by Japanese investment. It was freed from political control by privatisation. Now German resources can turn the new group into a truly world-class player. When heavyweight British businesses are acquired by foreign owners of the scale and resources of BMW, there is no economic disadvantage. The domicile of its ultimate parent has little or no bearing on Rover's prospects; its parent's commercial commitment and compatibility with the rest of the group are far more important. A new wave of acquisitions and mergers is likely to accompany global recovery, but it will be particularly acute in Europe as the business community restructures to take advantage of the large single market. Economic liberals, especially those who supported both a floating currency and the single market, can hardly complain as this integration takes place driven by markets not politics and with competition laws in place to guard against abuse. Britain has forced upon itself the structural changes to labour markets and state-owned industries which our European rivals -- even those with fundamentally stronger economies -- have yet to face. If we cannot be frank about the traditional weaknesses -- in productivity, growth, and in stop-go economic lurches -- then public understanding political backing and coherent strategy for revival will all suffer. Equally, ministers must accept that the widening of markets may mean more familiar names going to foreign owners. At the same time, we must continue to remove blockages impeding British business expansion overseas. British Gas, National Power, PowerGen, British Telecom, Mercury, BAA and other privatised success stories have huge expansion opportunities, not least into France and Germany, as liberalisation and privatisation get under way and public procurement opens up. In many of these areas, the pace is too slow, strong domestic monopolies are well dug in, and markets are being protected. Britain seems to be recognising that a German owner of Rover could mark that company's rebirth, and be a sign of Britain's liberal, open and strong economic positioning. But we are entitled to expect that similar attitudes should prevail elsewhere, as British-owned businesses start providing energy, power, telecoms, transport infrastructure and other former state services across Europe.
