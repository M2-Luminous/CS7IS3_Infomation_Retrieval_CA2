Foreign Ministry sources believe that the negotiations will resume in Cairo, and will be held on the level they were held so far -- delegations under Major General Amnon Shahaq and Dr. Nabil Sha'th. Speaking in Cairo, Sha'th announced that negotiations on the return of tens of thousands of misplaced Palestinians from 1967 will begin next month. Jerusalem confirmed that the negotiations will be held according to the Oslo agreement in a four-way committee of representatives from Israel, the PLO, Egypt, and Jordan. According to Sha'th, Jordan has agreed to participate in the talks at the beginning of next month. Foreign Ministry sources said that they do not know that a date has been set for the convention of the committee, but they said that Israel has agreed in principle that the committee convene in some two months.

There were only several dozen thousands [as heard], mostly from three villages from the Latrun region." Eytan further says that "the public is being misled, and that through these refugees, the government wants to grant the Palestinians the right of return it had canceled in the past. ["The Likud says that the government no longer serves Jewish and Zionists interests, as seen in its readiness to implement the Palestinian right of return. The Likud spokesman has said that returning hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees into the boundaries of Eretz Yisra'el will result in a demographic disaster for Israel."]
