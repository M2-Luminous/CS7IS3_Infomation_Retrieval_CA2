Serb military sources are saying that the pull-out of Muslim units and military equipment from Sarajevo has continued via a tunnel underneath Sarajevo airport and on board lorries across the runway, before the very eyes of UN peacekeepers. The Serb military sources are also saying that, once out of Sarajevo, Muslim units are setting off in the direction of Hrasnica and Mount Igman in an attempt to link up in force with the area around Gorazde. The VRS are foiling all these attempts, while Muslim soldiers, who surrendered to the Serb side upon leaving Sarajevo, are talking about an "extremely low morale among Muslim formations" which are heading toward Gorazde, because "a vast majority do not want to take part in these senseless actions," the VRS sources explain.
