Peres said there is no indication that Syria has softened its demands from Israel. Peres seems quite pessimistic concerning the prospects of advancing the negotiations with Syria. He said their acceptance of his suggestion to expand the Syrian-Israeli negotiations to several tracks would have indicated that they seriously meant to promote the peace process. For Peres, their rejection of his proposal was another unfavorable sign of Syria's intentions. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 13 February cites Peres as saying that "Israel prefers a confederation between the Palestinian entity and Jordan. If such a confederation is not established, conflicts may arise between Jordan and the Palestinian entity, entangling Israel."]
