Last month, the company concluded two technological cooperation agreements for development of mobile satellite communications systems and optoelectronics components used in optical communications. The first agreement, signed with Embratel [Brazilian Telecommunications Company, Inc.] and Simac Systems, a Dutch company, calls for distribution of the Logiq system in Brazil. That system is used to manage fleets of vehicles via Inmarsat satellites, owned by an international consortium of which Embratel is a member. Avibras, according to its vice president Rubens Domingues Porto, will supply the complete system, including installation, training, and technical assistance. The Logiq system, Porto said, will permit a user to locate and track his fleet automatically, to plan routes, give instructions and directions, and exchange information between each vehicle and the user's company. "Communications can be exchanged 24 hours a day," the vice president emphasized. Optoelectronics Through its Fiber Optics and Telecommunications unit, Avibras will also manufacture optoelectronics components (lasers, optical receptors, amplifiers, etc). The project is being carried out with technical support from Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc.] and Hewlett-Packard's Components for Fiber Optics Division. The firm, according to Porto, will initially supply submodules for assembly and encapsulation of the devices in Brazil. The partnership agreement with Hewlett-Packard, the Avibras official said, will permit nationalization of the production and exclusive distribution of the components in Brazil and the rest of South America. Avibras Fiber Optics is also preparing to enter the fiber optics market within the next 12 months. "We are finishing work on the facilities for the unit, in which $6 million has already been invested," he reported. Before it can begin operating, Porto said, the fiber optics will need another $4 million, which would be used to import equipment. The company predicts an annual market for 100,000 to 150,000 kilometers of fiber optics in Brazil. The new Avibras factory will make fiber optics by the MCVD (Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition) process, using technology developed by Telebras's Research and Development Center (CPqD) and support from S.G. Control, a British firm.
