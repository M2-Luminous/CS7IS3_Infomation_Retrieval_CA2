In a statement for the Yemeni news agency, SABA, the source said these reports were totally untrue. Dar-Sa'd town is tranquil and under the total control of the forces of national alignment, unity and democracy. Moreover, the battles are taking place in the areas of al-Dali, Karish, and Mukayras, which are hundreds of kilometers from Aden. The source stated that the forces of unity and democracy are winning victories on all battle fronts, seizing advanced positions and routing the forces of the oppressive al-Ahmar gang. The source said putting out such reports reveals the state of confusion and hysteria afflicting the forces of the gang of the al-Ahmar clan, who in their sick dreams are hiding the truth to obfuscate the successive defeats they are suffering by turning them into imaginary victories.
