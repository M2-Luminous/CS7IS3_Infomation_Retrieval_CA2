FR941020-1-00022 FR941020-1-00004 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 61 RIN 3150&hyph;AE88 Land Ownership Requirements for Low-Level Waste Sites; Extension of Comment Period AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: On August 3, 1994 (59 FR 39485), the NRC published for public comment an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to consider amending its regulations to allow private ownership of Low-Level Radioactive Waste facility sites as an alternative to the current requirement for Federal or State ownership. The comment period for this advance notice of proposed rulemaking was to have expired on October 3, 1994. The Nuclear Information and Resource Service has requested a 30- to 60-day extension of the comment period. They believe that there are many potentially affected individuals, communities, and organizations, who will need more time, and whose input could be useful in NRC's analysis of this proposal. In view of NRC's desire to get relevant information which is needed to determine the advisability for rulemaking on the land ownership issue, the NRC has decided to extend the comment period for an additional 60 days. The extended comment period now expires on December 2, 1994. DATES: The comment period has been extended and now expires December 2, 1994. Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical to do so but the Commission is able to assure consideration only for comments received before this date.
