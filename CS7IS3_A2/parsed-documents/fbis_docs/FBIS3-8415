"We will not join the current government coalition of the HZDS and the Slovak National Party (SNS) and this is our fundamental position, " Weiss said. He was trying to dismiss the impressions about his party possibly shifting into the government camp which have been created by his intensive talks with Slovak Premier and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar. However, immediately after that Weiss elaborated that it was primarily the SNS which did not suit the SDL in this coalition. "We are not even considering government cooperation with the SNS as led by Jan Slota," Weiss said, adding that he did not rule out other forms of cooperation with the HZDS. SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik admitted that the HZDS tried to persuade his party into joining the current government coalition with the promise of highest state offices including the office of president for Weiss during the talks. "If such an offer has been made it has been rejected. But I am not saying it was made," Ftacnik said. Meciar has allegedly acquainted the SDL leadership with his idea about the filling of the foreign minister post. Ftacnik refused to give the names of the three people discussed but said that one of them was a woman. According to journalists' circles Minister of Labor, Social Affairs and Family Olga Keltosova could be that woman. Pressed by journalists, Weiss confirmed his recent critical statements characterizing the HZDS as a "a pro-state vulgar right-wing movement." But he explained his turn in the direction of possible cooperation with the HZDS by the fact that the HZDS "won the elections and still enjoys considerable support from the public." "The time when a political adversary should be necessarily stamped on and destroyed has passed," Weiss said. He said that at talks with the HZDS the SDL concentrated mainly on achieving an agreement on what legislative processes were to be concluded before possible early elections and what are to be handed over to a new parliament. The SDL rejects any changes to the constitution, to the current administrative division of Slovakia and any restructuring of the state administration or of its individual structures, he said. The SDL does not, however, refuse to cooperate with the opposition, Weiss said, adding that he was going to inform the opposition parliamentary parties about his last night's talks with Meciar in the evening.
