FBIS4-51568 "dreas084_i_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-084 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 Cambodia Reportage on Roundtable Meeting Continues Reportage on Roundtable Meeting Continues KR Accused of Avoiding Meeting BK2904160994 Phnom Penh National Radio of Cambodia Network in Cambodian 1300 GMT 29 Apr 94 BK2904160994 Phnom Penh National Radio of Cambodia Network in Cambodian 1300 GMT 29 Apr 94 Cambodian BFN [Station commentary: "The Khmer Rouge's Game"] [Text] People still well remember that on 22 April 1994, Khieu Samphan, head of the party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK]-Khmer Rouge [KR], sent a letter to His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman stressing that, in line with the profound aspiration of our entire nation and people, the PDK would like to express full support for the proposal, the product of His Majesty's profound insight, to organize a roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation. But hardly had the ink on this letter dried up than Khieu Samphan sent another lengthy and detailed letter to the king expressing concern over security for himself and his delegation during their trip to Phnom Penh to attend the roundtable meeting under the king's chairmanship, to be held in the Royal Palace from 2 to 7 May. On 27 April, the British REUTER news agency excerpted the statement of a Khmer Rouge representative [words indistinct], in which he said shamelessly that the Khmer Rouge would seize Sisophon and Poipet next month. This man stressed further that the Khmer Rouge would start moving to gradually seize positions until they had total control of Poipet and Sisophon. The above cases clearly attest that the Khmer Rouge have continued to play their old trick of catching a fish with two hands [words indistinct] won over the republic regime of Lon Nol in 1975. This game is played by holding negotiations while launching attacks or holding negotiations in order to launch attacks; and by holding negotiations in order to postpone any solution and to facilitate attacks aimed at seizing as many positions as possible. (?In other words), they have striven to attack in order to bargain on the negotiating table. This is why, although the Royal Government has made many concessions, the Khmer Rouge have stubbornly sought one pretext after another in order to prolong the solution to the problem and enable them to sell logs and gems and gain money to buy weapons for storage to serve their guerrilla war. However, after His Majesty the King issued a statement on 22 April calling for a roundtable meeting, whether they liked it or not, the Khmer Rouge pretended to support this idea. Later, they have sought pretexts to foil the roundtable meeting, or at least to delay it or move it from one place to another. The main pretext raised by the Khmer Rouge is the so-called issue of their personal security [words indistinct]. In fact, it is widely known that Khieu Samphan's security can not be the cause. This is because the security of the Khmer Rouge representative in Phnom Penh is fully guaranteed. On the night of 25 April, His Excellency Ek Sereivoat said that the security for Khieu Samphan has been arranged very thoroughly: that is, as soon as he comes out of the plane, he will get into a car. The well-wishers, including journalists will not be allowed to get near him. Observers of Cambodia have also pointed out that Khieu Samphan has raised the issue of security in order to avoid coming to attend the roundtable, scheduled to be held from 2 to 7 May. In fact, this is just a pretext. Our people wonder why if the Khmer Rouge are patriots and really want to solve the Cambodian problem through political means, have they hesitated to come to Phnom Penh? Since they dare not come even to attend the roundtable, what can they do? If the roundtable meeting is held somewhere other than Phnom Penh; and if through that meeting, the Khmer Rouge are given some posts in the Royal Government, will they dare to come to work in Phnom Penh? Do the Khmer Rouge know how to carry out the role of officials only in the jungle? And must their meetings be held only in foreign countries? Due to all these matters, our people are not very optimistic about this roundtable meeting. And even if the meeting is successful, the implementation of the spirit of this roundtable meeting cannot be guaranteed. This is because everyone knows very well that so far the Khmer Rouge have never respected anything, such as the Paris agreement, that they have signed. Our people persistently ask everyone to stop playing the Khmer Rouge's game.
