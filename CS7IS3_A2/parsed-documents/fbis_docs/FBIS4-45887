As of January 1, 1994, medical establishments in Moscow can practice only if they are licensed by the city. Medical offices, businesses, or practitioners who choose to work without a license face serious consequences, including penalities imposed by tax authorities. V. I. Shastin, head of the licensing department for the Main Medical Authority in Moscow, and Ye. V. Polivoda, a top official in the same office, told this paper that the list of those who have successfully applied for and obtained licenses numbers 795 offices, businesses, and private practitioners. Although most of the nation's public health-care system is in the hands of licensed professionals, this cannot be said about private medical practice. Only three individuals have been officially authorized to practice medicine. They are Pastor Chzhu Ok, an acupuncturist from the Republic of Korea, M. A. Chkhikvadze, and D. M. Filler, all of whom are in private practice. No more than 30 partnerships and cooperatives have obtained licenses, although another 107 have applied for them. There are nearly 2,000 medical establishments in private practice. Shamans, psychics, and folk healers must also obtain licenses that state the types of medical services they offer. None of the practioners listed on the "hot line" have done so. Incidentally, practioners of traditional or folk medicine must undergo a different type of licensing and be regulated by a special subcommission made up of those of their peers and colleagues with a medical background. Any traditional or folk healer wishing to treat people must have a medical diploma. Today, inasmuch as the process of issuing licenses is being bogged down by paperwork, the department responsible for licensing is, in exceptional cases, issuing temporary authorizations to practice medicine. Temporary licenses are good for three months, whereas regular licenses are good for one year. Anyone seeking medical help should be sure that the person or establishment they consult is properly licensed. This will help to avoid problems.
