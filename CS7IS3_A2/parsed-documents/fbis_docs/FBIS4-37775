FBIS4-37775 "drnes122_l_94007" FBIS-NES-94-122 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Territories Coordinator on State of Autonomy's Economy Territories Coordinator on State of Autonomy's Economy TA2106143594 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 21 Jun 94 p A4 TA2106143594 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by Gabi Zohar] [Text] The way the Palestinian police has managed to take control over security in the Gaza Strip and Jericho is "not bad," but the civilian institutions are still at the beginning of being formed. This was stated yesterday by Major General Dani Rothschild, coordinator of government activities in the territories, at a seminary on the political economy of peace in the Middle East, held at Haifa University yesterday. Rothschild explained that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad are not interested in holding a dialogue with Israel. "At best, they consider taking part in the Palestinian establishment, but they are opposed to the peace process. "Should they become part of the Palestinian autonomy, this will not happen as part of a democratic process in which a society votes and makes democratic decisions. This could lead to problems, if Hamas wins a majority in the Palestinian autonomy. Israel is trying to help with a money-equivalent and today employs 25,000 Palestinians from the autonomy. Work in Israel is not granted automatically -- it is a consequence of the security situation and economic needs. "The number of Palestinian laborers permitted to work in Israel is occasionally considered with regard to these two criteria. If in the future we will see that the Palestinian police and security forces are managing to take control over the self-government regions and keep them quiet, we will further increase the number of Palestinian laborers in Israel." Gen. Rothschild noted that the standard of living in Gaza and Jericho has deteriorated since Israel pulled out from there. Nevertheless, it will take a few months before these things can be statistically examined. "At the same time, I am optimistic and I do not believe that a financial or economic problem can foil the agreement. It seems to me that the Palestinian Autonomy is stable enough to improve its situation even if the process takes a month or two. There will be cause for concern if the Palestinian establishment does not show the residents that their standard of living is improving. There will be no vacuum in this place. If the situation does not improve, Islamic forces that oppose the peace process will step in. Gen. Rothschild estimated that the economic situation will improve in Gaza and Jericho within the coming two weeks, after the donor countries last week agreed to transfer $42 million to the autonomy. Contacts between the Palestinian body, set up to coordinate the transfer of money from the EU, and the European donor countries will continue next month. The money that will arrive in two weeks will provide for immediate needs, and the funds that will arrive later are earmarked for various projects. "The Palestinian self-government authorities should make a list of priorities for the donors. You cannot pay for the construction of houses before an infrastructure and a sewage system is built, and the donor countries do not know that," Rothschild said. He added: "One of the donor countries' foreign ministers told me recently: We will provide for 5,000 houses. When I asked him: what about schools and infrastructure? he said: `It is their problem.'" Referring to the Palestinian aspiration to cut themselves off from Israeli aid at once, Rothschild said that they will have to choose which is more important to them: national pride or economic needs. The idea to construct a power station on a ship at sea only because they do not want to receive electric power from Israel is economically wrong. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 21 June reports that "Major General Dani Rothschild, the coordinator of government activities in the territories, said that Israeli companies tried to take over Palestinian businesses by flooding the territories with goods. That is why the Palestinians seek to cut themselves off from the Israeli economy. At the same time, Rothschild made the assessment that despite all the talk about separation from Israel by politicians in the territories, Palestinian businessmen and economists would prefer ties with the Israeli economy rather than with Jordan. The coordinator warned that if the Palestinian authorities did not rapidly improve the standard of living in the autonomous areas, the PLO may lose control of the streets to radical elements. Israel, therefore, must do all in its power to help the PLO."]
