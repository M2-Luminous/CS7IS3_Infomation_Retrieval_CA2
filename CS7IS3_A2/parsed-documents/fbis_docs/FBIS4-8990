"Under an agreement between the republic of Srpska authorities and the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], a cease-fire on the Gorazde front comes into force immediately and UN troops will be able to enter Gorazde today. This will help the international humanitarian organizations to resume their work in the town," the statement says. It is noted in the statement that the Serbian side's unilateral move is a republic of Srpska response to yesterday's declaration by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the position of U.S. President Bill Clinton on the crisis in Gorazde. "We appeal to the international community to put pressure on the Muslim side to make possible a resumption of the peace negotiations," the statement says, adding that the time has come for the Muslims to state clearly if they favor war or peace. "The Muslim strategy of maintaining a state of neither war nor peace is a crime," the statement stresses and reminds the international community that the Serbs did not start the conflict in Gorazde, that they want a just agreement, but will not allow themselves to be dictated to.
