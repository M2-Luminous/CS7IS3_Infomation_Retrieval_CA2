The insect is a symbol in a certain sense: It was not its tiresomeness that threatened the bolshevik revolution -- louse-borne typhus mowed down people on both sides of the barricades. Typhus is not yet among us. Just as before, however, infections are approaching and compelling us to understand that regardless of whether you are red or white, you may end up in a convulsive fever and set your hopes on the Lord God and your physician, if he is at your side and if he has the necessary drugs. Today cholera is causing serious alarm. An outbreak in Central Asia resulting in active antiepidemic actions on the part of local physicians has worried Russia. But what if it suddenly starts off here? Indeed it will start. The extremely rapid spread of the infection is being discussed. As I was informed in the Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, there are currently 15 cholera patients and eight carriers of the infection in Russia. The disease was mainly carried in from abroad: Nine persons were infected with cholera in Pakistan, and seven tourists ``acquired'' it in Turkey together with leather consumer goods. It is hardly worth grieving over the ``iron curtain'' in this regard, but a system to protect the population from imported infections in view of snowballing black-market tourism must be devised in good time. In any case, the draft law developed by the sanitary-epidemiological committee regarding protecting Russia's territory that regulates sanitary inspection at the border should be considered without delay. Yuriy Fedorov, chief specialist of the Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, believes that the newspaper panic regarding cholera is unjustified: There is not even any basis for announcing the quarantine that usually follows the infection of 50-60 persons. The country has a sufficiently strong public health service despite the break in ties between epidemiologists of the new independent states. The preparedness of special antiepidemic teams has been increased. The country's leadership is well informed of the epidemiological situation that has developed. The situation is under control... I remember how during the years of perestroyka, the renowned specialist A.I. Kondrusev, chief public health physician of the USSR, said, ``Politics does not worry me. It is all sovereignization, etc. You come together, you break apart. But do not break the single sanitary-epidemiological service. Let's not look for trouble.'' It was as he was looking in water. Infections are approaching on all fronts: cholera, diptheria, measles, hepatitis. Morbidity due to tuberculosis is threatening... No matter how much we now talk about integration and strengthening intergovernmental economic ties, let us not put off until tomorrow the restoration of our sanitary-epidemiological system. Infection, if you will forgive the banality, does not recognize borders, and it is easier to surmount together. Some coordination center that would react instantaneously to danger no matter where it approaches from and that would direct integrated teams to ``extinguish'' epidemics without delay at any point in the CIS is likely necessary. Today no one is even obtaining elementary information about the dynamics of an infection's spread within the framework of the former USSR. At least call the World Health Organization. And I suspect that in Geneva they now know more than our people do. Nevertheless, I do not want to leave the reader in fearful anticipation of raging epidemics. There is good news: The epidemic season, which usually lasts from May to October, is coming to an end. Perhaps it will pass.
