One of the particularly tough problems in the military planning law is to be found in the fate reserved for the future M5 missile. Between 2005 and 2010, this missile could replace the M45, which is currently under development for the new generation of submarines. The M45 will carry the latest nuclear warhead, the TN75. Thus renovated, the French strategic ocean force will comprise, by unanimous opinion, a tool for deterrence whose reliability can be guaranteed for the next 10 years. In this context, what question should the politicians in charge be asking? In my opinion, the immediate development of the M5 is the most serious mistake that could be made in the drafting of the planning law. Not only would it be a mistake in technological terms, but also in budgetary, strategic, and therefore political terms. Technologically, the gain in performance attributed to the future missile -- and the gain which is likely to be achieved -- concerns range, accuracy, payload, and stealth. So far, however, this improved missile is felt to go hand in hand with a new warhead, the TN100, which is already in the design stage at the Atomic Energy Commission. This load will yield enhanced performance in terms of penetration and accuracy. Is all this so very urgent? This does, it is true, represent decisive progress, but in only one area: The enhanced range "gives water" to submarines, i.e., it allows them to patrol in warm waters and to increase their potential and safety. However, as for the rest, there are a great many contradictions and uncertainties in the process! Contradiction We are increasing the surface of the targeted objective, while at the same time a consensus is emerging for moving away from a "city- oriented" doctrine of deterrence toward a doctrine based on the destruction of forces, in other words one that is more "targeted" and sophisticated. We are increasing the volume and payload of the missile's warhead, while every indicator points to a constant move toward nuclear warheads which are smaller in volume and weight, but which have equal strength. This is even one of France's specialties. Moreover, we are implementing a new armaments system based on the TN100 -- a warhead that is innovative in terms of design and operation -- at a time when we are suspending nuclear tests and when, as a result, we are banning the validation of its design and development, and therefore the verification of the sought-after results. To get around this contradiction, it is said that the current TN75 warhead, which will soon be in service, can be improved and adapted to the new M5 missile. This weakens the rhetoric and the deterrence. We find ourselves involved in an approach based on opportunity and not efficiency. Such opportunism has characterized the M5 missile since its birth and places a terrible financial burden on the defense budget and planning law. It is estimated that the M5 missile alone, without its nuclear warhead, will cost around 65 billion francs. Its launch was announced to the Aerospatiale group in January 1992 -- two months before the last legislative elections -- in a letter from the defense minister (Pierre Joxe). This baptism may appear blighted with some suspicion of electioneering, even if I do not ignore the problematically low order load of Aerospatiale's "strategic missiles" division. Yet, was the military staff in favor of this? Was a decision made in the Defense Council? At the same time, the Defense Ministry published a "reference document" on planning, the stand-in for the law that was not discussed in Parliament. This "reference document" clearly showed that merely pursuing the irreversible programmes already under way would put too much pressure on the budget capacity in the medium term. Of course, funding allocated to the M5 missile in the 1993 budget was low, and it will be equally low in 1994. However, what will become of the new planning law if program authorizations have to be increased in the short term? We thus deprive the law of any maneuvering room, unless one major ongoing project is canceled. And who will take that risk? Deterrence Thwarted Consequently, we are blocking the development of our deterrence strategy. This development, which now enjoys broad consensus within the Armed Forces and the majority, is imposed by geopolitical upheavals. We know the broad outlines of this consensus. Submarines are an important -- if not key -- strategic element in our defense apparatus, but the search for greater flexibility and improved adaptation to the new context has led to the implementation of a second airborne "component" fitted with the LRAS (long-range air-to- surface) missile. This "component" would have strike capacities for a second and final warning. At the same time, the discussion of the implementation of antimissile protection is necessary in our country. From now on, Aerospatiale -- despite the defection of the British over the LRAS -- is in a position to develop missiles capable of stopping ballistic missiles at mid-altitude. In addition, the company alone can equip France with a long-range air-to-surface missile. All this will be made financially impossible by the further development of the M5 missile. This missile will destroy what little flexibility a sustained budgetary effort could give to the planning law. It is here that we meet up with politics again. The trap which the president of the republic has just set for the government and its majority was laid out in a sentence spoken in an interview given to AFP by Francois Mitterrand (LE MONDE of 11 January). He spoke of a "new missile which comprises a major improvement, namely in terms of range, and which could also be installed on the Albion platform." So here is the M5 destroying the entire planning with all its might. Here is the compromised strategic development, the second weakened nuclear "component," and the antiballistic protection system postponed indefinitely. Here, lastly, is the Albion platform put back in the saddle and the "sanctuarization" of the reactivated territory. Such a regression in our nuclear strategy is inconceivable. Or perhaps we are to think that Mr. Mitterrand, who came to power with a strong prejudice against deterrence, will leave his post by depriving his successor of this powerful tool, after he himself made use of it. The halting of nuclear testing and the fate of the M5 make one wonder. My feeling is that it would be desirable to stagger the implementation of the M5 in order to give France some latitude in adapting its strategy and equipping its forces for a new and dangerous world that is now emerging.
