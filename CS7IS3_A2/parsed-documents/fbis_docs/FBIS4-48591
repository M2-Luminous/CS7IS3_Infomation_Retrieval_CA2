FBIS4-48591 "drafr099_d_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-099 Daily Report 21 May 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Angola Government Issues Statement Government Issues Statement MB2105205494 Luanda TPA Television Network in Portuguese 1930 GMT 21 May 94 MB2105205494 Luanda TPA Television Network Portuguese BFN [Communique issued by the Government of the Republic of Angola on 21 May] [Text] The Government of the Republic of Angola strongly condemns the actions carried out by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] against the World Food Program [WFP] planes rendering humanitarian assistance to the victims of war and other disasters. The government feels that the actions against WFP planes in the city of Malange on 16, 18, 19, and 20 May, forcing the WFP to suspend humanitarian assistance to Malange residents, constitute a flagrant violation of UNITA's pledge regarding the distribution of humanitarian assistance to all needy Angolan people, regardless of the area where they are found. The government would also like to inform the national and international communities about the raids carried out by UNITA armed elements against the warehouses of international nongovernmental organizations in the provinces of Uige and Huambo. It also condemns the diversion of goods destined to the needy for military purposes. In view of this unfavorable picture created by UNITA, the Government of the Republic of Angola has decided to temporarily suspend the WFP and international nongovernmental organizations' flights to the provinces of Huambo and Uige until the United Nations is able to inform the Government of the Republic of Angola that conditions have been reestablished for the continuation of humanitarian flights in conditions of security. The government would once again like to call on the international community to exercise pressure on UNITA to respect the principles of humanitarian assistance and not use this assistance for other purposes.
