FR940930-1-00054 FR940930-1-00016 Currently-produced EVs carry onboard the vehicle a relatively large number of batteries, and therefore a substantial amount of electrolyte solution. Because of the hazards of electrolyte, there is the potential in a crash or rollover for injury to vehicle occupants, bystanders, and emergency rescue and clean-up personnel. The agency requests comments on the potential safety hazards for EVs with a GVWR of 4536 kg or less, and all EV school buses regardless of weight. 1. Describe the different types of propulsion batteries which are expected to be used in EVs over the next five and ten years, including the form (liquid or gel), chemical properties, and temperatures of the various electrolyte solutions. Which of the electrolyte solutions are acidic, basic, or water reactive, and to what extent? How many batteries and what quantity of electrolyte are expected to be onboard EVs over the next five and ten years? Where will the batteries be located on EVs? 2. Is there a potential safety problem with electrolyte contacting occupants, bystanders, rescue teams, or clean-up personnel as a result of an EV crash or rollover? If so, what are the potential safety consequences? Can chemical or thermal burns result? Is there the potential for toxic or asphyxiant vapors? If so, from which electrolytes and due to what quantities of spillage? 3. What is the potential fire hazard of spilled or sprayed electrolyte in a crash or rollover? Could battery electrolyte ignite in the same way as a fuel? If so, which electrolytes and in what quantities, concentrations, or mixtures, and at what temperatures? What is the likelihood that leaking electrolyte at a crash scene could serve as an electrical conductor or short circuit, thereby creating a fire hazard? 4. The agency understands that sodium-sulphur batteries operate with liquid coolant at approximately 316 degrees C., which circulates around the batteries and through a heat exchanger onboard the EV. The temperature of liquid coolants for internal combustion engines on conventional vehicles is much lower, approximately 91 degrees C. Further, sodium-sulphur batteries require an extremely strong vacuum insulated container to retain the heat and prevent spillage in an accident. Sodium can explode if it comes into contact with water. Is there a potential safety problem with high temperature battery coolants contacting occupants, bystanders, rescue teams, or clean-up personnel as a result of an EV crash or rollover? If so, what are the safety concerns? Can burn injuries result? What types of coolants are used with EV batteries, and what are their corresponding temperature ranges during driving and charging operations? 5. Describe the likelihood and potential safety consequences of having spilled electrolyte from an EV crash mix with a different electrolyte or with other vehicle fluids, such as gasoline, diesel fuel, engine coolant, or oil. Could a chemical fire or explosion occur, and if so, with which electrolytes and fluids? Is there the potential for toxic or asphyxiant vapors? Please discuss. 6. Describe all EV crashes or rollovers or noncrash events involving spilled electrolyte, including the sequence of events, a description of the EV, and the type of electrolyte which spilled. Were there injuries or fatalities as a result of the spilled electrolyte? If so, please describe. 7. Discuss the need for federal regulation to address the potential safety hazards of battery electrolyte spillage in a crash or rollover, or noncrash event. Possible FMVSS Performance Requirements One approach which the agency could use to address electrolyte spillage in a crash or rollover is to limit the amount of allowable spillage through a performance test. This could be similar to the requirements in FMVSS No. 301, Fuel System Integrity, which limits the amount of allowable liquid fuel spillage after barrier crash and static rollover tests. FMVSS No. 303, Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles, contains similar crash test limitation requirements. FMVSS No. 301, for example, after barrier crash tests requires that there be no more than (1) One ounce (28 grams) by weight of liquid fuel loss from the time of barrier impact until vehicle motion has ceased, (2) five ounces (142 grams) during the next five minutes, and (3) one ounce (28 grams) per minute during the next 25 minutes. These requirements apply to vehicles of 10,000 pounds (4536 kg) GVWR or less when subjected to a 30 mph (48 kph) frontal fixed barrier crash test, or 20 mph (32 kph) lateral or 30 mph (48 kph) rear moving barrier crash test. For school buses with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds (4536 kg), FMVSS No. 301 requires a 30 mph (48 kph) moving barrier impact at any point from any angle on the bus with the same allowable fuel loss. FMVSS No. 301 has similar fuel spillage limitations during a static rollover test, following a crash test, for vehicles of 10,000 pounds (4536 kg) GVWR or less. Comments are requested on possible approaches for addressing the safety hazards of electrolyte spillage in a crash or rollover for EVs with a GVWR of 4536 kg or less, and for all EV school buses regardless of weight. 8. Discuss the appropriateness of using an approach similar to that of FMVSS No. 301 to regulate the safe performance of EV electrolyte spillage in a crash or rollover. 9. What would be an appropriate amount of electrolyte spillage to allow after a crash or rollover test? Please discuss. Should it be based on the number or type of batteries onboard the EV, or whether spillage occurs inside or outside the passenger compartment or cargo areas? If so, how much should be allowed? For example, should a ``level of hazard'' be defined by battery type, which would allow spillage of larger quantities of less harmful electrolytes and smaller quantities of the more harmful electrolytes? Would it be appropriate to require no spillage? Is there an amount that would approximate the no-spillage condition?
