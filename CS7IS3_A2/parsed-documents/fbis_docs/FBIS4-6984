Expressing her personal opinion at a regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting, the director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said, "I am worried that it might have a bad effect on the economy." Kubota urged that conditions be attached to any tax change, such as putting such an overhaul in the context of administrative reform, cutting unnecessary spending and reviewing government subsidies. The Social Democratic Party, of which Kubota is a member, compromised on taxes early Friday, agreeing to shift the tax burden away from such direct levies as income taxes and toward indirect taxation with "the understanding of the people." Kubota said her fellow socialists appeared to have "jumped the gun" in agreeing to the tax overhaul before details have been worked out, although she stressed that she had not heard details of the agreement. She said it is easy to take the tax overhaul as a rehash of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's failed attempt to replace the 3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax," which Kubota branded as just a change of packaging while leaving the content the same. Noting that she had opposed the introduction in April 1989 of the consumption tax, Kubota apologized to the women's groups with whom she had worked to block the levy.
