Any talk about regional cooperation in any field in the post-peace phase will be meaningless without Jordan's participation for reasons connected with Jordan's position with all the meaning that this word implies, be it geographic, political, or historical. Therefore, Jordan's stand to boycott the multilateral negotiations, on whose results the features of the post-peace phase will be drawn up, has started to make its effect felt and to drive home the message that methods of pressure and blockade on this country to facilitate the negotiating process will be of no avail. It is certain that by sending only an observer to the Muscat multilaterals, and hinting that the same thing will be done in the upcoming negotiations in Doha, Cairo, and Rabat as long as the blockade continues on al-'Aqabah Port and the pressure is maintained, Jordan is demanding that those who say they want to establish a lasting peace and a broad regional cooperation in the Middle East reconsider their stands in light of the Jordanian position which links a positive Jordanian role in the negotiations with fair dealings and justice for both Jordan as well as the Palestinian and Arab peoples who came under aggression and injustice. It is hoped that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's expected visit to Jordan during his upcoming tour of the region will carry with it a change in the U.S. stand on the blockade imposed on Jordan's lone maritime lifeline. The United State is aware of the extent of Jordan's commitment to its responsibilities toward international resolutions and its concern to promote the march of regional cooperation and peace provided that this is done without any encroachment on its national dignity, pan-Arab commitments, and its belief which was reiterated on all occasions; namely, that genuine peace is one based on justice, that it should be acceptable to people who will coexist with and defend it to pursue the interests of their future generations and draw benefits from it. Based on such a premise, blockades and pressures will not lead to such peace but will make the possibility of realizing it remote and will prolong the suffering and pain in which the peoples of the region have been living for decades.
