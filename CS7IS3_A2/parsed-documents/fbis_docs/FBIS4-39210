The presidium instructed the Central Electoral Commission to determine which of the candidate deputies from the Way of Latvia union will take Andrejevs' place. According to unofficial information, Saeima Deputy Georgs Andrejevs will be replaced by Maris Zvaigzne, head of the Foreign Ministry's department of archives and chancellery. On 4 June Andrejevs submitted a letter to Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs asking him to accept his resignation as foreign minister, and today Andrejevs submitted a letter to the presidium of the Saeima on giving up his mandate. Georgs Andrejevs has also distributed a statement sayimg that the Supreme Council's electoral law, which he believes was formulated erroneously, has been preserved by the law adopted in the Saeima on 19 May. The statement also says that the events in recent days after the publication of the open letter in the press on 28 May prevent him from continuing work not only as a Saeima deputy, but also as foreign minister. In accordance with international standards in legislation, each person's guilt is determined by his specific activities and not by where he belonged. This also applies to collaboration, because the need for more exact definitions is dismissed in advance. By disregarding this, we are moving further away from the Western world into which we want to become integrated. Only a proven fact may serve as an argument for restricting the activity of an individual and for punishment of a different kind, considers Georgs Andrejevs, expressing the hope that his resignation will assist the public and the legislators in realizing the need for changes in the legislation of the Republic of Latvia. Information: The electoral law of the Fifth Saeima provides that any citizen of the Republic of Latvia can be nominated as a candidate deputy if he has signed a statement that he has not been nor is now a staff or nonstaff employee of the USSR or Latvian SSR state security committees; of the USSR Ministry of Defense; of Russian security services, army intelligence services, or counterintelligence services; an inheritor of the rights of the USSR and of other countries; or an agent, resident, or keeper of a safe house belonging to these bodies.
