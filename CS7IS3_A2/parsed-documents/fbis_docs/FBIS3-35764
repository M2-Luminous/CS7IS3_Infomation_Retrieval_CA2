[passage omitted] Outlining his main positions on getting the republic out of crisis, Mechyslav Ivanovich focused on the possibility of new elections. [Hryb] We assume -- as I have said before -- that we must resolve the issue of how our state system is structured. Whether we should we have a strong president, elected by the people; or perhaps the Supreme Soviet will decide that we should have a parliamentary republic. I absolutely do not rule out the likelihood that this issue will be raised in the Supreme Soviet in the future. [Makritskiy] The new chairman was asked what his first steps would be in his new post. [Hryb] I shall try to look into the activities of our Supreme Soviet. We are not pulling together at all at the moment, and in our present situation it will be very difficult to emerge from the critical economic state we are in. We must learn to listen to one another, understand one another; we have a lot to learn in the way of patience in our work. [Makritskiy] The journalists asked whether there would be any change in the foreign policy priorities of the Republic of Belarus. [Hryb] Our state's foreign policy course will not change. Our course has been set: peace, friendship with all states, with all peoples, recognition of our existing borders -- we recognize those borders which are established today. We are Slavs, we are neighbors, we hope to be good neighbors, first and foremost to Russia and the Russian people, to treat one another with respect. [Makritskiy] Journalists got the following reply to a question about the unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and Russia: [Hryb] I support the point of view voiced by esteemed Stanislav Shushkevich in regard to the unification of currencies and exchange rates and fuel prices. This option would suit us very well indeed, then we could somehow regulate the prices of our goods and sell them on the Russian Federation market.
