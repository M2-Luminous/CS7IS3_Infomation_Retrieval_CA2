FR941007-0-00039 FR941007-0-00011 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [IN 40&hyph;1&hyph;6342A; FRL&hyph;5067&hyph;4] Approval and Promulgation of a New Source Review Implementation Plan; Indiana AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: The USEPA is approving the State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Indiana for the purpose of meeting requirements of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990 (amended Act), with regard to new source review (NSR) in areas that have not attained the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). This SIP revision was submitted by the State to satisfy Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area NSR SIP for Indiana. The USEPA is approving the recodified version of the Indiana permitting rules to replace those in the existing SIP. The USEPA is also removing references in the Code of Federal Regulations to the construction ban imposed in Lake and Porter Counties for failure to have an approved ozone plan since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 removed this ban. In the proposed rules section of this Federal Register , USEPA is proposing approval of and soliciting public comment on this requested SIP revision. If adverse comments are received on this direct final rule, USEPA will withdraw this final rule and address the comments received in a final rule on the related proposed rule which is being published in the proposed rules section of this Federal Register . Unless this final rule is withdrawn, no further rulemaking will occur on this requested SIP revision. DATES: This final rule will be effective December 6, 1994, unless adverse comments received by December 6, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Comments on this rule should be addressed to: J. Elmer Bortzer, Chief Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (5AR&hyph;18J), United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604.

Anyone wishing to come to the Region 5 offices should first contact Mr. Portanova at (312) 886&hyph;3189. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The air quality planning requirements for nonattainment NSR are set out in part D of title I of the Act. The USEPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing its preliminary views on how USEPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under part D, including those State submittals containing nonattainment area new source review (NSR) SIP requirements [see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)]. Because USEPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of part D advanced in this rule and the supporting rationale. In this final rule on the Indiana nonattainment NSR SIP, USEPA is applying its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. II. This Action Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing USEPA's action on SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). Analysis of State Submission 1. Procedural Background The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions for submission to USEPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. 1 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. 1 Section 172(c)(7) of the Act provides that plan provisions for nonattainment areas shall meet the applicable provisions of section 110(a)(2). The USEPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further USEPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) of the Act and 57 FR 13565). The USEPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The USEPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law under section 110(b)(1)(B) if a completeness determination is not made by USEPA within 6 months after receipt of the submission. The State of Indiana held public hearings on March 22, March 25, and April 1, 1993, to entertain public comment on the requested NSR SIP revision. Following the public hearings, the plan was adopted by the State on July 21, 1993, became effective on December 12, 1993, and was submitted to USEPA on February 25, 1994, as a requested revision to the SIP. The SIP revision was reviewed by USEPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria referenced above. The submittal was found to be complete on April 8, 1994, and a letter dated April 8, 1994, was forwarded to the Governor's designee for SIPs, Timothy J. Method, indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. In this action, USEPA approves the Indiana nonattainment new source review SIP submittal, and invites public comment on the action. At this time USEPA is also approving the recodified permit rules to replace those in the existing SIP which were approved as APC 19 at 40 CFR 52.770(c)(24). Since the time of this approval, Indiana has recodified its air pollution control rules into Title 326 of the Indiana Administrative Code (326 IAC). As requested by the State on August 15, 1994, USEPA is approving the incorporation of recodified rules into the SIP to replace those previously approved as part of APC 19. This action is intended to make it easier for the public, the State and USEPA to precisely identify what provisions covering permits are part of the SIP. 2. General Nonattainment NSR Requirements
