[passage omitted] Comrade al-Ahmar delivered a speech in which he stressed Syria's adherence to its firm principles to build a new society, to deal with the current peace process in our region, and to establish a just and comprehensive peace based on international legitimacy and its relevant resolutions, particularly Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, which stipulate the need to return the occupied Arab territories and the usurped rights to their rightful owners. Comrade al-Ahmar stressed that Syria wants to make this process successful by achieving its goals and to seriously contribute, along with the honest forces in the world, to efforts to make this march successful. He also explained that the peace process is stumbling because of Israel's intransigent position and its refusal to commit itself to withdrawing from all the Arab territories, which it has occupied since 1967, as stipulated in UN resolutions. In his speech, comrade al-Ahmar called on the international community, foremost of which are its active forces, to exert efforts to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy and to force Israel to implement its relevant parts in order to end its occupation of the Arab territories, to remove hotbeds, and to achieve security, stability, and peace for everyone. He pointed out that Syria would continue efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace and would not relinquish an inch of its occupied territories in the Golan, or any Arab right. For his part, Comrade Jianxing, head of the Chinese Communist Party delegation, spoke about current developments in China and the successes achieved in recent years under the policy it has defined for itself. He also stressed his party's desire to promote relations with the ASBP and between his country and Syria and urged continued consultations on the most important current international issues. He then stressed his country's support for the implementation of UN Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict in order to achieve a solution to the Middle East problem based on these resolutions and in a way that achieves just and comprehensive peace in the region. He also praised Syria's position, its desire to achieve peace under the leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad, and its status and role both on the regional and international levels, as well as the developments and successes he has seen in Syria. He wished Syria and its people further progress and prosperity.
