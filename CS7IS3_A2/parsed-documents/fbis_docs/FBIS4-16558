Even before the talks provided for in the agreement, where the parameters of how the fleet is to be divided are to be discussed, the Ukrainian side began to put forward through the mass media its own options of the lease itself, its length, and the locations where the Russian Black Sea Fleet is to be based, says a statement by Vyacheslav Kostikov, the press secretary of the Russian president. In it, Kostikov said the following: Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday stated during the talks that he does not accept the haggling tone, which is lowering the level of relations and trust. The Russian side has to remind Ukraine once again about the harsh realities and imperatives that underline the agreement just signed. Careless words and actions are out of place here when the Black Sea Fleet is at stake. Moscow urges the Kiev politicians and the military not to embark on unilateral actions that could cast doubt on the sincerity of the negotiation process.
