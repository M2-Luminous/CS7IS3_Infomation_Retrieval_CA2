The EMOR market and opinion research center questioned 1,000 people between 16 and 74 years of age of whom 62 percent were Estonians, 31 percent Russians, and 7 percent people of other nationalities. Those polled were asked to state whether they favored restoration of the pre-war border line or would agree to a compromise. The poll showed that Estonians were divided on the issue: 53 percent supported restoration of the border line as set under the Tartu Peace Treaty, while 40 percent were prepared to accept a compromise. The share of those supporting the pre-war border line was the greatest among the 16-24 and the 65-74 age groups as well as among the respondents who lack a secondary education. People with a higher education and those living in northeast Estonian towns were more inclined to accept a compromise. Non-Estonians' attitudes toward the border issue differed from those of the Estonians: 69 percent were of the opinion that Estonia might accept a compromise and only 15 percent backed the restoration of the border line as set under the Tartu Peace Treaty. The poll showed that, if the question were to be put on a referendum where all people over 16 living in Estonia could participate, 39 percent would back restoration of the pre-war border line and 52 percent would vote for a compromise. The respondents who favored a compromise were also offered a choice between two compromises: giving up Ivangorod and the territories beyond the Narva River, or giving up the Petseri region. The Estonians' and non-Estonians' positions differed cardinally. Most non-Estonians agreeing to a compromise -- 55 percent -- would give up both the territories beyond the Narva River and the Petseri region. Estonians, on the other hand, are divided into two more or less equal groups: 32 percent would be prepared to surrender both territories, while 24 percent would agree to give up only Ivangorod and the other territories beyond the Narva River. Some 10 percent of Estonians and 11 percent of non-Estonians, who backed a compromise, suggested another option, while 25 percent of Estonians and 26 percent of non-Estonians failed to provide an answer.
