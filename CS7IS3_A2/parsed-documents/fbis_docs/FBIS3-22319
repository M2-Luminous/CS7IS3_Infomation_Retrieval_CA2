So can United States. Even though national observations may be giving the issue low billing, diplomats say the next battle between the North and the South will revolve around linkages between environment and trade. The next GATT round which will be flagged off when Uruguay Round deal is signed in April is already being termed the `green round'. Since India and Brazii are standard-bearers of the South's concerns, both countries can be expected to be on a collision course with the West, led by the United States. Two questions need immediate attention -- How does the South convert its concerns into a negotiating strategy in GATT ? How much store can countries place in GATT's professed claim to multilateralism when the United States maintains all its unilateral options to strike trade partners thus violating everything GATT stands for? At a recent consultation on environment and trade in Geneva, Kamal Nath said that developing countries were apprehensive of the nexus between trade and environment and feared that the latter would be used as a protectionist instrument by high-cost economies against exports from the developing world. The North received social and environmental subsidies from the South which made the former's developments patterns unsustainable, he stated. "It makes a mockery of free trade and if we have to set things right then the subsidy has to be recognised and accounted for," he said adding that what the debate needed was more science and less scare. Brazilian Minister for Environment Rubens Ricupero said that countries need to "strengthen a multilateral approach of building a consensus rather that resort to unilateral measures that could be used under the guise of environment protection." There were over a 150 international agreements that could guide the world on how to deal with trade and environment issues, he stated. India and Brazil have formidable and rich foes, beginning with Washington. Timothy Wirth from the office of U.S. Secretary of State has fired the first salvo. Reports say he told U.S. Congress that his country would use trade measures to support its environment objectives, listing the following tour as primary tasks: -- Trade measures required by an international environmental agreement to which the United States is a party and assuring non-discriminatory treatment of those nations that are not party to it; -- When the environmental effect of an activity is partially within U.S. jurisdiction and there is reasonable scientific basis for U.S. concern; -- When a plant or animal species is endangered or threatened or where a particular practice is likely to cause a species to become endangered or threatened assuming there was reasonable scientific basis for U.S. concern; and, -- Where the effectiveness of a scientifically-based international environment or conservation standard is being diminished, provided the standard was specific enough to judge that it was being diminished and could be made objectively. In other words, what Washington wants is what India calls 'economically driven regulation packed in green paper', an insidious way to keep competition from developing countries at bay. "One way of doing this is to specify standards for either manufactured items or worse still the processes by which the items are manufactured, which developing countries do not have the capacity to meet," Nath said. For instance, some eco-labelling schemes in western countries give value only to environmentally friendly chemical dyes and ignore natural dyes completely, even though they are equally if not more ecologically sound. "Thus, Asian countries which are major manufacturers, and exporters of textiles cannot earn `Ecolabels' which should rightfully be theirs," he said. What India wants is that guidelines should recognise national environmental and economic policies of developing countries and that certification procedures should be based on internationally approved criteria that would outline guidelines for such certification. That would leave the formulation of specific standards, testing and monitoring of the application of procedures to local standardisation bodies. What the West wants is a free run for its multinationals, propelled by their limited environmental concerns. The problem is not just the West as Kamal Nath laments, "nobody in India takes these issues seriously." Remember the Uruguay Round ?
