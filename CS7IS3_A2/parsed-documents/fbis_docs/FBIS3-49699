Defense planning and spending need to be more open and in line with NATO standards, and under stronger civilian control. Defense Ministry and Army Command links, cut in 1989, need to be repaired. In future, Hungarian soldiers will participate in peace-keeping operations not just as observers, and there will be independent subunits for humanitarian assistance and tackling disasters. Various subunits will be picked to cooperate with NATO troops. Small-scale joint exercises are expected in the second half of this year. Hungary's air defense and airspace observation should also be converted to NATO formats, airplanes being fitted with friend-or-foe identification systems and ground radars overhauled so as to be able to communicate with NATO planes. Two Hungarian military planners will soon go to NATO's Brussels headquarters. Kiss hopes the Ministry can cover extra costs from involvement in the new NATO program out of budget reserves.
