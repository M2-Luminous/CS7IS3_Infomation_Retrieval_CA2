Chuang Ming-yao will resign Saturday [16 April] to take responsibility for a cash-for-secrets scandal sweeping the Navy's top ranks, Defense Minister Sun Chen said Friday. Vice Defense Minister Adm. Ku Chung-lien, 62, will succeed Chuang, who will become a strategy advisor to the president, Sun added. "Chuang, whose resignation comes only two weeks before his two-year tenure expires, will step down to take responsibility for a major arms procurement scandal involving many of the Navy's top brass," Sun explained. Investigation into the scandal was sparked last December by the murder of Navy Captain Yin Ching-feng. Chuang, 65, is the first senior naval officer to step down since the body of Captain Yin was found floating in the sea off Taiwan's northeastern coast December 10, 1993. Meanwhile, Chang Chen-ya, director of the Navy's Political Warfare Department, will also leave his post Saturday, Sun said. "The personnel changes are the first step the government has taken to assume responsibility for the Yin case," Sun noted, adding more military officers will be disciplined for the arms purchase scandal which includes bribe-taking and leaking of military secrets in addition to the death of Yin. Disciplinary measures will be announced after judicial authorities make a final judgment on those involved, Sun added. On Thursday, military prosecutors indicted Captain Kuo Li-heng, a Navy weapons procurement officer who has been in custody since late last year, for corruption and leaking military secrets. Kuo allegedly took bribes totaling NT$12 million (us$452,830) offered by civilian arms dealers in exchange for military secrets, the Ministry of National Defense said. The ministry did not detail what secrets were leaked and whom the information went to, but the local media said earlier that Kuo gave the information to an arms dealer who worked for a foreign arms supplier. Kuo will be tried by a military court and if convicted, he will face either the death penalty or life in prison. Kuo faces a separate trial by a civilian court for his alleged role in the Yin murder case. A Taipei prosecutor has promised to issue indictments for Kuo and three other suspects before the end of April. Yin, whose killers have not yet been identified, is believed to have been murdered as he was about to disclose irregularities in the awarding of lucrative military contracts, the local media said. The Defense Ministry and police have offered cash rewards totaling NT$7 million for information leading to the arrest of Yin's killers. At least eight other military officers and six local arms dealers have been detained for the case.
