Located in east China's Jiangsu Province, which faces the newly-rising Pudong area zone in Shanghai, Lusi received 50 groups of foreign investors last year. After feasibility studies, Chinese and foreign experts agreed that the port is a natural link on the marine lines from Dalian in the northeast to Ningbo in the east and to Hong Kong in the south. It is suitable for building at least 100 berths to accommodate ships of 10,000-dwt and 20 deepwater berths for 100,000-dwt ships. The port is listed in the national port planning and construction program, and will be developed into an international port soon.
