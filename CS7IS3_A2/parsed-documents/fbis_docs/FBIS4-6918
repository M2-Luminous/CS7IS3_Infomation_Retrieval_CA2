FBIS4-6918 "dreas080__a94005" FBIS-EAS-94-080-A Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Turning Point Seen in DPRK Nuclear Issue Turning Point Seen in DPRK Nuclear Issue OW2604090094 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 25 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2604090094 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The issue concerning the DPRK's suspected nuclear program will reach a turning point by early May because that is when the time limit is due for North Korea to respond to the presidential statement issued by the UN Security Council [UNSC] at the end of March. The statement calls on the DPRK to accept additional nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Pyongyang recently announced it would allow IAEA inspectors to monitor the exchange of fuel rods at an experimental reactor, though it is not among the nuclear facilities for the IAEA is demanding inspection. This move was unexpected. Nevertheless, the DPRK's nuclear issue may enter a severe phase depending on the contents of the report the IAEA will soon submit to the UNSC. The new Hata administration will face this grave issue immediately after its inauguration on 25 April. A top Foreign Ministry official pointed out a change in the DPRK's attitude toward the nuclear problem, saying "Pyongyang appears to have dropped its conventional attitude of `refusing to talk with anyone'" in the face of the time limit. As an indication of the change, he cited recent "soft-line remarks" by President Kim Il-song. The president said to foreign news media: "If the United States provides North Korea with a light water reactor, it may make the existence of a radiochemistry research institute in Yongbyon unnecessary"; "the remark by a North Korean Government official that `Seoul will be engulfed in flames' was inappropriate"; and "I would like to visit the United States." Nonetheless, a prevailing view in Tokyo is "it is too early to conclude that North Korea has changed its stand." Concerning Pyongyang's proposal to allow the IAEA to monitor the exchange of fuel rods, a Foreign Ministry source said: "The proposal does not include the acceptance of additional nuclear inspections, which is of great importance. Although the proposal may be a strategic move towards accepting additional inspections, we need more time to find out." Japan will be urged to prepare itself for various situations. In particular, it will be asked to cooperate in imposing economic sanctions against the DPRK, which will possibly be carried out without a UN resolution. While examining for reference the sanctions against Iraq during the Gulf war, the Foreign Ministry, the Finance Ministry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and other government offices have studied relevant laws and government and ministerial ordinances. As a result, the government has decided to place priority on unified actions by Japan, South Korea, and the United States whether or not the United Nations adopts a resolution. If economic sanctions are imposed, a naval blockade will be enforced by U.S. and other foreign warships. In this case, the issue will be taken up for discussion when reviewing the Self-Defense Forces Law and the Commodity Control Law to enable Japan to provide "logistical support" to those warships, including suppling such commodities as foodstuff, fuel, and weather service vital to navigation. It will also be necessary for the government to draw up a rescue plan to evacuate Japanese nationals in South Korea in case of emergency.
