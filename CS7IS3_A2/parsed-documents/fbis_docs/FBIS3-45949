Mahmoud Vaezi [name as received], deputy foreign minister for Euro-American affairs, said in an exclusive interview with XINHUA, "We believe that this action will not happen because the United States knows us better than other countries." He said that Iran is not a small country like Libya, but it is a big nation with an internal unity and abundant resources. He noted that the so-called U.S. war against Iran is merely a psychological war by writers in Western countries. "You can't hear this from any officials." However, since the beginning of last year, the Western media have occasionally reported that the United States and Israel would launch a war against Iran before 1996 and they would strike Iran's nuclear facilities and military bases. According to reports, there are certain Pentagon plans to start a war against Islamic Iran. Some Pentagon analysts believe that a military confrontation between Iran and the United States will be inevitable at some stage. When asked about the Iranian Government's response to the possible U.S. military strike on Iran, the deputy foreign minister said, "Our government, our Army and our people are ready for any kind of actions." Relations between Iran and the United States have been strained for 14 years since 1979 when the U.S. Embassy in Tehran was seized by Moslems students. Vaezi noted that the United States has kept a hostile attitude toward Iran. "We should not have normal relations with them unless they change their attitude and give us money back." "This is a prerequisite for normalization of relations between Iran and the United States," he added. Meanwhile, Iranian leader Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i late last year explicitly ruled out the possibility of negotiations between Iran and the United States and renewed his support for the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy. Khamene'i also described those Iranians who advocate talks with Washington as "naive, coward and ignorant," saying they are unfamiliar with political issues and unaware of the dangers such negotiations will entail. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in Brussels last month that Washington still considered Iran an "outlaw nation" involved in terrorism. "And we think that strong action should be taken to deny them dual-use technology as well as other steps," he added.
