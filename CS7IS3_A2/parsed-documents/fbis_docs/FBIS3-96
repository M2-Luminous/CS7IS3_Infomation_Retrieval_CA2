The alleged meeting took place a few days before the resuming of the plenary session of the transition parliament, due to open Saturday in Kinshasa to elect the prime minister. The papers said the meeting between the two was the crowning of a series of secret deals which have been undertaken by a number of prominent Zaireans. Among those who involved in the secret conciliation efforts was the chairman of the Zairean National Union of Employers, Bemba Saolona, who is a close associate of President Mobutu. Tshisekedi and his radical Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UPDS) have insisted that his sacking from the premiership was illegal because he was democratically elected by the 1991 national conference and not by the president.
