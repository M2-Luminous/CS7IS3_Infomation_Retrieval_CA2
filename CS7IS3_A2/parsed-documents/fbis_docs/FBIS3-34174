The court ruled Chad was the rightful owner of the Aouzou strip, ending a 22 year argument over ownership of the 114,000 square kilometer (45,600 square mile) border territory. Judges ruled 16 to one, the one being the Libyan judge, in favour of Chad's claim to the desert strip, inhabited by semi-nomadic herdsmen and farmers. "It is a victory," said Chad's representative at the court, Abderahman Dadi. The sooner Libya keeps its word to abide by the court decision and end its occupation of the area, the better, Dadi added. Neither the Libyan authorities nor the Libyan media made any mention of the ruling. Libya annexed Aouzou, the only town within the 1,000 kilometer (620 mile) long strip, in 1972, citing an unratified 1935 treaty between Italy, Libya's former colonial master, and France. Court judges said the 1955 border established by a "friendship and good neighbour" agreement between France, Chad's former colonial power, and Libya, should stand. The Libyan representative at the court left without making any comment. The two sides opted to take the dispute before the UN's highest court in August 1990. Libya like Chad agreed to abide by the court's decision.
