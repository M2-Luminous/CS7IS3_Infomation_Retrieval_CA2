The yes vote won over the no vote by a minimal margin, which means that the Ramiro de Leon Carpio government, and especially the politicians, received one of their worst setbacks because most of the population did not vote. The controversial politician said the president should abstain from making decisions to solve the country's crisis because it is obvious that the Guatemalan people have rejected the package of constitutional reforms that Congress approved. These constitutional reforms were also backed by presidential scheming, which translates as a deep rejection of the traditional political classes and the maneuvers of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio.
