The Korean Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City has been seeking the return of the 162-pyong (534.6-square-meter) two-floor community building that was used as a Korean school and Taekwondo gym until the withdrawal of Korean troops in 1975, when Saigon fell to North Vietnamese Forces. Ho Chi Minh City officials have pledged that they will soon return the building, currently used as an English-language institute, the official said. An estimated 600 Koreans including diplomats and expatriates are in Vietnam: If the building becomes a Korean school as before, their children's education problem will be resolved to some extent, he added. As there are no Korean schools in Vietnam, Korean students currently attend nearby Malaysian or Singaporean international colleges and French or Australian primary schools.
