Russia and China have established new relations characterised by normal cooperation without any "special adjustment" between the partners. The Russian foreign minister said this responding to an ITAR-TASS question on board the airplane which brought him back to Moscow from an official visit to China. "Our relations now contain elements of geostrategical mutual understanding," Kozyrev said. "We are not working against any third country, or the West, for example. We do not have any anti-Western overtones in our cooperation, but no more do we look back at the West or depend on the West," Kozyrev said. "The two great powers feel the need for interaction relating to an extensive range of questions both on the regional and global scales". These circumstances enabled Russia to raise the question about constructive partnership with China, and the response of the Chinese leadership to this idea was "very balanced, and positive in principle", Kozyrev said. He expressed confidence that this idea "in one form or another, enriched and mutually filled with specific substance" can be implemented ahead of Chinese leader Jiang Zemin's forthcoming visit to Moscow this year. Speaking about his impressions from visiting the free-enterprise zone in Shenzhen, Kozyrev called it "very useful" and stressed that reforms in the zone were an example of economic development "Chinese style". It can be seen as part of "great Chinese experience of reforming its economy in a more modern direction". It is obvious that China is "looking for ways of entering the modern world, a world of high technologies and living standards". But the main thing is for us is to entertain no illusions about the possibility of copying this experience. We tend to idiologise and idealise now Western, now Chinese experience, or vice-versa, Kozyrev said. My visit to Shenzhen showed that neither exists "per se", although there are specific conditions in both places. One can say that Shenzhen is one of the regional versions of the development of Chinese reforms and the conclusions to be drawn from this is that Russia should look for its own versions of economic development applicable in the specific conditions of its own regions. The minister explained what he meant when referring to China as a country "near abroad". "There are now and can be no countries of the first rank and the second rank. When we speak about the development of ties with one or another country "near abroad" we mean that it is one of the closest neighbouring states and we must have goodneighbourly relations with it. One of the high priorities in the Russian foreign policy has always been the creation of a belt of goodneighbourliness and cooperation, Kozyrev recalled. "I am seeking to affirm the most direct, and if you will sound sense of the words "West, East, near abroad. The countries "near abroad" are those which are closest to us and with which we need to develop relations as we do with any other state without forgetting that they are our neighbours," Kozyrev said. As concerns prospects for the democratic movement in Russia, Andrey Kozyrev said he did not see Yegor Gaydar's resignation as a necessity, and had strong doubts on this score. "I respect personal motives, including Gaydar's political ones. Everyone may make some long-term tactical and strategic moves, but from the point of view of the post-election correlation of forces in Russia and prospects for the democratic movement I think he should have tried and worked in the government for some more time and thus affirm his own viewpoint," Kozyrev said. According to him, Gaydar should not have "weakened his democratic potential in the public eyes, especially after the relative defeat in the elections. According to the minister, resignations cannot help strengthen the democratic movement. Kozyrev stressed that he had sought to help resolve the problem by meeting President Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yegor Gaydar last Monday on his own initiative as a mediator. He found it strange that Gaydar left the reform team which is effectively headed by Yeltsin. Differences have occurred among other ministers on the presidential team, and it is not always difficult to hold one's own but the president is a uniting force and a guarantor of the reformist character of all changes, he said. Kozyrev pointed out that temporary setbacks were possible, but on the whole it was possible to achieve corrections and stand one's ground. He said it was not advisable to transfer acute questions to the sphere of public and political polemics, but resolve them within the team instead, just as it was and is being done all the time. Nonetheless, what has been done has been done, and it might somehow stimulate the democrats to re-align forces and draw "very serious conclusions" collectively. It is easier to resign from the government than to make it clear to oneself and society what had really happened in the elections and how we are going to carry on reforms in a democratic and not an authoritarian way. "The version of reforms which relied on, and even exploited the president's popularity and mandate is exhausted," he said. Reformers, who are also democrats, claim, as they do here now, a political role for himself and politicize their activity. But for this they must get a popular mandate in the elections on their own. The past elections did not give them a mandate which could justify their claim to domination in the government. This means they have to learn their lessons and think about the following elections. "I hope the present situation will prompt not only dramatic resignations but also substantial self-analysis," Kozyrev said.
