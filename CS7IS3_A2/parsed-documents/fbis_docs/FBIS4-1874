FBIS4-1874 "drchi065_o_94008" FBIS-CHI-94-065 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 REGIONAL AFFAIRS East Region Zhejiang Industrial Output Increases by 40% Zhejiang Industrial Output Increases by 40% OW0404092294 Beijing XINHUA in English 0644 GMT 4 Apr 94 OW0404092294 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Hangzhou, April 4 (XINHUA) -- The co-existence of the state-owned, collectively-owned and private sectors has enabled Zhejiang Province in east China to become increasingly prosperous. An official of the provincial statistics bureau said that Zhejiang's value of industrial output shot up 40 percent in 1993 to 87 billion yuan. State-owned enterprises registered a 14-percent increase in output value, collectively-owned companies scored a 49 percent rise and private companies reported a 110 percent surge, he said. He described foreign-funded businesses as a "newly emerging" economic sector in Zhejiang. In 1993 the provincial authorities approved the setting up of 4,487 foreign-funded businesses, up 92 percent over the previous year. Exports from operational foreign-funded businesses climbed nearly 65 percent in 1993 to 850 million U.S. dollars. The official said that these businesses accounted for 19 percent of Zhejiang's exports in 1993, up five percentage points. Multi-economic sectors began to co-exist in the province in the late 1970s, he recalled. Since then the ratio of the state-owned sector to Zhejiang's economy has dropped to 30 percent from 60 percent, while that of the collectively-owned sector grew to 60 percent from 40 percent and that of the private sector rose to 10 percent, he said. Local economists said that the simultaneous growth of various sectors has led to intense competition, benefiting both consumers and manufacturers. The co-existence of these sectors has also made it possible to rationalize the distribution of natural resources, they noted. Township-run factories, a major component of the collectively-owned sector, have become a new driving force behind Zhejiang's economic expansion, one economist said. Zhejiang now has 550,000 such factories, which produce 60 percent of its industrial output value, he said. Furthermore, the number of self-employed people reached 1.24 million and that of private companies 19,400 at the end of 1993, he said. These two sectors were virtually non-existent in Zhejiang before China initiated the policy of reform and opening to the outside world in 1979, he said. The co-existence of various sectors has enabled populous yet resource-deficient Zhejiang to become a rising economic power in China, he explained. For example, Zhejiang's gross domestic product -- the value of goods and services produced -- totaled 164.5 billion yuan in 1993, almost matching that of Shanghai, China's leading manufacturing center. The average per-capita income of rural residents in Zhejiang was 1,746 yuan last year, higher than any other province-level area in the country, he said. Moreover, during the 1953-1978 period, when the state-owned sector dominated, Zhejiang's economy's grew at an annual rate of seven percent. However, its economy has been growing at an annual rate of 18 percent since 1979, he said.
