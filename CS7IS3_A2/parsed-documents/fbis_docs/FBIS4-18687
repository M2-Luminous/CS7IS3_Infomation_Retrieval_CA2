Alfredsson; place and date not given] [Text] The Liberal Party, like the Center Party, is welcome to work together with the Social Democrats if there is a change of government in the fall -- and perhaps even form part of that same government. Party secretary Mona Sahlin is happy to repeat this invitation six months before the election, despite the fact that it is not that popular in all circles of the Social Democratic movement. All those at the Confederation of Trade Unions [LO] and in Sweden's workplaces who are impatient and are waiting for an announcement about the levels of compensation that will be paid out by the unemployment benefit fund will have to go on waiting. Mona Sahlin refuses to tie herself to a date. The unemployment benefit will be raised to 90 percent again "at some point in the future," when the economy has improved. That is all the Social Democrats will promise before the election. More or less the same phrase has been used about parents' insurance. The message a few years ago was that the Social Democrats would honor their abandoned promise to extend parents' insurance as soon as the economy improves. It would be the first thing they would do. What is top of the list now -- the unemployment benefit or parents' insurance? Mona Sahlin shied away from the question a little. If I had 5 billion, she said, it would be spent on jobs and training places. As far as benefit levels are concerned, the long-term sick are first in line. They are being promised more than the 70 percent from the sickness insurance fund they get today -- when the economy improves. "But obviously increased benefits from the unemployment fund take precedence over longer vacations and an extension of parents' insurance. Yes, these latter two are quite a way down the list now. Unemployment and the poor state of the economy -- things that are interconnected -- push them down the list." Mona Sahlin was not particularly surprised by the diagram from SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Institute for Market Research that shows that 20 percent of Social Democratic sympathizers could envisage voting for the Moderate Coalition Party. But she believes that "the threshold for them actually voting like that is very high." She has no doubts that views on some issues can coincide. "If you want me to be extremely surprised -- well, I am not. It is probably possible to find workers in the metal industry, for example -- now people in the Metalworkers' Union will probably be angry -- who sympathize with the idea of low taxation, who feel that people should look after themselves, that there should not be a whole mass of benefit payments and the like. You often run into this sort of view in workplaces." She believes that the diagram also reflects that fact that voters are moving across party boundaries more nowadays and make up their minds at a late stage in election campaigns. "For a very long time we had a very good life as a result of the fact that many people voted Social Democrat out of tradition, because that's the way things were supposed to be. In recent years voters have become more and more unfaithful. What class you come from means less and less." Mona Sahlin is happy to admit that things certainly do look good in the opinion polls, but she warns against banking on a victory in advance. She is in the habit of reminding her party colleagues that there are more than 170 days left before the election. She is careful not to appear too optimistic. "It is more my job to see to it that everybody works their butts off between now and the election." "To the annoyance of many people," as she put it, more than a year ago she and Ingvar Carlsson said publicly that broad agreements and close cooperation with other parties will be needed to solve the challenges facing Sweden. Even with their own Riksdag majority the Social Democrats could contemplate a government coalition with the Liberal Party, for example. Mona Sahlin adheres to this view. "Yes, that still applies. The problems that will have to be solved by the government that is in power after the election will not be dealt with in the life of a single Riksdag. The market, companies, citizens have to be able to be confident that the decisions that are taken will apply for a long time. This applies, for example, to social insurance, the pension system, the financing of homes, European policy." In Mona Sahlin's view, if it proves impossible to create this sort of trust and confidence in the political decisionmaking process, it will also be impossible to successfully tackle the issue of jobs and social welfare. The open flirting with the Liberal Party has been conspicuous by its absence for a while, but this does not mean that the suitor has lost interest. "No, we have said what we think and we stand firm on that. But there has indeed been a lot of discussion of this at party meetings. `Why are you flirting and why are you talking; will Wibble really have a seat in our government?' people ask. At every meeting I am asked the question: Why do you go on about cooperation with other parties when we have 50 percent in the opinion polls and are going to win the election? That is when I generally ask a counterquestion: How many people here think that we will win 50 percent of the vote in all the elections over the next 30 years? No one raises a hand." She described a coalition with the Left Party as completely out of the question. Nor does she believe in any form of closer cooperation in the Riksdag -- if, that is, the Left Party manages to hang on in the Riksdag ("there is probably a major risk that they will end up outside it"). "They have a lot left to prove if they are to be a partner to really rely on. They are not showing this today." No one needs to have any doubts about "what the Social Democrats want" in the election campaign: "We want a majority of our own -- this is really our first objective. The most important thing is to win the election; the second most important thing is to remove the right wing from influence over Swedish politics for decades to come. For me the right wing is the Moderates, New Democracy, and the Christian Democratic Party. Our main opponents are of course the Moderates." Mona Sahlin believes that it will be a "real right-left election, an ideological election. ``It will be a test of the strength of solidarity. It will be those who have jobs and incomes and are well showing their solidarity by making sacrifices for those who are not as well off. It is a question of realizing how much this will require.'' For the Social Democrats an important goal is to win over the whole of the movement to this realization. Mona Sahlin claimed, as is customary, that relations with the LO are good. The unemployment benefit fund is the only dissonance. The situation regarding a joint election campaign leadership this year is unclear. The LO and the party has traditionally always had such a joint campaign leadership. "My point of departure is that everything is not hunky-dory simply because that is the way you have done things in the past," she replied when asked if it is desirable that the LO chairman should be part of the election campaign leadership. She worked well with Stig Malm, she said, even though he described things differently in a recent radio program. "Yes, it is clear that he did not think so. He can think exactly what he likes about me as a person. I will not descend to the level of any talk about what he is like. However, I am happy to repeat that I think that he was an excellent LO chairman who forced the pace on many important issues. It is very sad that he is so bitter now." Alongside the normal political issues the party will devote itself to the EU [European Union] over the next few months. The Social Democrats will reach their decision on membership at an extraordinary congress immediately before midsummer. Why is this so important? There is after all going to be a referendum, and the Social Democrats have committed themselves to falling in with the result. "I think that it is important that citizens receive some guidance about what the parties think and how they have argued their way forward to a decision. It is not simply a question of a yes or a no; it is also a question of how the parties think we should work in Europe, what we should do with a possible future yes." One or two people have expressed concern that the party's approach to the issue could split the party, that a factional conflict could arise that could leave deep scars for a long time to come. Mona Sahlin does not share this concern. "What is new and different for us is that even after the congress no one is going to hit someone else across the head simply for continuing to promote the line he believes in. This is a pretty new way for our party to work. We have often had a tendency to carry on all debates internally and then when we have voted and found a party line, we open the door and say not a word about where we have disagreed. On this issue we have chosen to do the reverse." Mona Sahlin assured me that the Social Democrats will view the referendum as binding -- that is, in the Riksdag they will vote for the line that wins most votes regardless of the number who abstain. This is how Ingvar Carlsson's talk of "50.5 percent" is to be interpreted. There is no suggestion of a demand for an absolute majority for yes or no.
