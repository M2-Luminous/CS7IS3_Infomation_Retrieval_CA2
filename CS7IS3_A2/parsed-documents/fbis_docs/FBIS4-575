The two parties wish to stress that Article 155 of the Togolese electoral laws provides for by-elections, quote, only in case of vacancy as a result of death, resignation, or appointment of a candidate's alternate to any other post incompatible with his status, unquote. Therefore, the three challenged constituencies cannot be a pretext for the government to organize by-elections in the these constituencies in order to (?accept) new candidates. Annulling a poll can only lead to fresh elections for candidates who previously stood for the same elections. It is, therefore, surprising that the above-mentioned decree makes people believe that there could be two rounds of election in the constituencies, where the second round of the previous elections was challenged by the Supreme Court's constitutional chamber. 2. The CAR and UTD also consider that only a government duly formed after the 6 and 20 February elections, in accordance with the Togolese Constitution, can organize any by-elections or fresh elections, but not the outgoing government. 3. The CAR and UTD are surprised that the outgoing government published a decree organizing elections in the three constituencies in question at a time when the head of state is trying, along with the leaders of the parliamentary majority, to find ways of resolving the institutional crisis that resulted from the rejection of these three invalid constituency results. 4. The CAR and UTD regret that after attempts to withhold the results of five constituencies, the outgoing government is doing everything to overthrow the parliamentary majority obtained by the opposition and to deprive the people of their victory. Despite the negative maneuvers of certain troublemakers, who have been identified and who should have been brought before a court, the elections were described as satisfactory by all the international observers. 5. The CAR and UTD, considering all the above, denounce the organization of so-called by-elections by the outgoing government on the basis of the 6 April decree. 6. The CAR and UTD urge the head of state to continue to seek a political solution with the leaders of the parliamentary majority in order to put an end to the suffering of the people. Signed by attorney Yaovi Agboyibor for the CAR and Edem Kodjo for the UTD.
