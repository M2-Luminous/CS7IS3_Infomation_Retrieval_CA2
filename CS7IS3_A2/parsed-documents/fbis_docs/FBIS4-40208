V. Potyko] You travel abroad often, and I believe, not as tourist. Did you acquire any experience during your travels which could be of use for our Republic? What is your attitude toward IMF activities and its proposals regarding the resolution of our financial problems? [Bahdankevich] I have often been abroad as Belarusian representative to the IMF and the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development [as published]. The IMF allots a considerable degree of technical aid to the Republic. It aids our banking system, primarily by teaching the basics of market economy to our personnel. As for the European Bank, our relations are most productive. This bank has already issued four lines of credit on very favorable conditions for us. We are conducting negotiations on some 20 investment projects and we have principally agreed on opening a credit line for small and medium-sized businesses. [Samusev] It seems to me that the independence of the National Bank cannot be compared to that of any central bank in Europe. Your bank is forced to execute such measures which lead to increases in inflation and other negative consequences. Should you not reconsider the status of our National Bank? [Bahdankevich] Not only the Belarusian National Bank but also other central banks are experiencing certain pressure from both their governments and national business circles in terms of issuing loans. In our state, increases in inflation are primarily explained not by the issuing of credits but rather by a lack of market levers regulating the economy under situations whereby the state has refused to directly manage it. Of course, the independence of the National Bank should be encouraged. However, the key point is not in the juridical independence of the bank but in the stalling of reforms. [passage omitted] [Zhuk] Kebich blames the nonimplementation of the monetary union with Russia on Bahdankevich. Who is correct? [Bahdankevich] The National Bank has never opposed the preservation and strengthening of economic integration with the Russian Federation. We favor such a union, which is based on equal rights and does not destroy our independence. We do not agree that a foreign state -- even a friendly one -- should begin to formulate our economic policy. We oppose the transfer of the National Bank -- with its assets and liabilities -- to the ownership of another state; the approval of the Belarusian budget and the amount of its deficit by the Russian Duma; the recalculation of our banks' and enterprises' funds on the basis of an unprofitable-for-us exchange rate. [passage omitted] [Nalivayko] What about the unification of the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems? Proceeding from the words of our prime minister, I can understand that if not today, then, at least, tomorrow, the Russian ruble will become our legal currency. However, you told NARODNAYA GAZETA that there is virtually no agreement at all. I trust more in your professionalism. The second question is whether Russia has set similar -- with its domestic market -- prices for energy resources for Belarus? [Bahdankevich] Many factories and businesses in Belarus can work normally only when they have foreign markets for raw materials and can sell their products overseas -- primarily, in Russia and Ukraine. The preservation and extension of markets is always a positive rather than a negative factor. We kept this in mind when we planned to establish an equal banking union between two sovereign states based on a common currency. However, I think that the monetary merger -- one based on conditions which violate our Constitution and contradict our economic and political interests -- should not be implemented. Instead of the monetary merger, it is possible to sign an agreement on bilateral payments with Russia. I would like to emphasize that in early June, the Russian side sent an official proposal and a draft agreement -- regarding measures to provide for the mutual convertibility of our national currencies aimed at establishing a monetary union based on their national currencies -- to V. F. Kebich. This testifies to the fact that the Russian Government also has no illusions as far as the monetary merger -- based on inadmissible and contradictory conditions for the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus -- is concerned. The Russian side has not even lifted customs duties and taxes, while we lifted them back in April. All the statements made by our government do not correspond to reality, to say the least. The Russian Government has already drawn up a draft agreement regarding customs duties and taxes. Proceeding from this document, these duties and taxes will be lifted beginning on the day it is signed. I believe that this agreement will be signed in the next few weeks. At the moment, our Republic is experiencing huge losses. [Lisitskiy] I think that it is the Cabinet of Ministers, headed by Kebich, which has ruined our economy. However, Kebich blames the National Bank for this. What is wrong with your bank? [Bahdankevich] The National Bank opposes injections of "noncovered" money into our economy. This leads to increases in inflation and prices, to decreases in the exchange rate of our ruble. To cover the money, the government should pursue a rational price policy. Currently, one liter of milk in a shop costs 180 rubles [R] while it costs R1,860 to produce. This difference is covered from the state budget. This money is mine and yours. We believe that the government should issue subsidies not to producers, but to consumers to enable them to buy milk or bread. It is the price that makes the economy function. This is the key contradiction between the National Bank and the government, which wishes -- how can I put this -- to lay the blame on someone else. [passage omitted] [Samalyuk] Would the economic situation in Belarus become stable if a national currency were introduced? Who has a real chance of becoming president of Belarus? [Bahdankevich] Currently, I would not make any recommendations as to changes in the National Bank payment notes for a national currency. To stabilize the economy, it is necessary to promptly reconstruct it. This means, first of all, setting conditions for competition, capital investment, cutting the budget deficit and number of uncovered loans. In my opinion, a decrease in the inflation rate and stabilization of the economy -- merely on the basis of a tough monetary policy along with the introduction of a national currency -- are impossible. I hold out hope that the Belarusian people did not lose their common sense. They will elect a president who will attract the best creative forces to the leadership of the state and will count not on Western or Eastern tips, but on the diligence and creative potential of its own people. [passage omitted] [Petrov] Kebich met with intelligentsia in Nesvizh. He spoke unfavorably of the "chief banker." Why? Is this because Bahdankevich does not want to issue loans to the agricultural sector or because he opposes the monetary merger with Russia in the form the prime minister signed it? Kebich said if the National Bank does not issue a loan to the government, the government will then take credits in dollars from abroad and give them to agricultural workers. Who will pay back those dollars? Kebich or the people? Why were two people -- one from the Supreme Soviet and another from the Cabinet of Ministers -- included on the National Bank board? Does this mean that Bahdankevich has to resign? [Bahdankevich] Mildly speaking, Mr. Kebich lied in Nesvizh. This year, the National Bank did not grant credits to businesses or the government at a 210-percent, or even higher, interest rate. We earmarked R1 trillion in credits -- with a yearly interest rate of 6.5 percent -- for the sowing campaign through the budget. In addition, we extended credits for advance payments for state procurement of agricultural products with a yearly interest rate of 20 percent, for investments -- 60 percent; for production requirements -- 100 percent. As for the refusal to grant regular credits to the agricultural sector, the truth is that our Republic has created conditions for setting a constant breakaway gap between procurement prices for agricultural products and prices on industrial products for the agricultural sector. The more milk, grain, or meat a kolkhoz or sovkhoz produces, the more unprofitable it is. By not restricting prices on industrial products for the agricultural sector and simultaneously restricting procurement prices -- given the lack of funds to cover the breakaway gap in prices -- we push agricultural producers toward bankruptcy. The government sees salvation if the National Bank issues free and blank credits. However, this is the path to nowhere -- to a dead end. The National Bank has repeatedly recommended that the government cover the carrying costs by setting prices and issuing credits to agricultural businesses only for seasonal work and stock provisions. This year, 97.2 percent of National Bank assets were injected into the agricultural-industrial complex [APK]. We expected the government to at least adopt the necessary measures. However, it has done nothing. Any nonexperts -- industrial or agricultural sector workers -- realize that in addition to the APK, industry, transport, trade, and other sectors of economy also require state credits. A continuous imbalance in supporting only one sector will only intensify our problems. Prime Minister Kebich should render support to the agricultural sector, however, he should not do this by means of such highly unprofessional moves. As for the introduction of the Supreme Soviet and the Cabinet of Ministers' representatives in our bank, this was done according to changes introduced to the Law on the National Bank. I am not going to resign in the immediate future. Not because I care for the chair and a high salary. Were I a chairman of a commercial bank, my salary would have been at least twice as high as my actual salary from the state. [passage omitted] [Tolkachev] How much time, do you think, will be required to stabilize the economy once the economic reforms are implemented? What will cover and support the national currency? Western credits or land mortgages? Anything else? How do you view Kebich's desire to join the Russian Federation? [Bahdankevich] I believe that at least to minimally stabilize the economy -- that is, to reduce the inflation rate to a level of less than 10 percent per month, to stabilize the exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble -- we require between six and eight months. After this issue is resolved, we will need between two and three years to profoundly reconstruct the economy, to stop the drop in production, and ensure a gradual increase in economic productivity. As for the introduction of our national currency, the national wealth -- at first, Belarus-produced products, goods and services, given the tough budget and credit policy -- will guarantee its stability. [Bahdankevich] I would not comment on Vyachaslaw Frantsevich's position, however, I do favor the preservation of Belarus' complete political sovereignty and close economic integration with the CIS states and our Western neighbors. [passage omitted]. [Bakun] Why did you, Stanislaw Antonavich, not clarify your position -- regarding the union with Russia -- earlier? Why only now? Also, I'd like to know which presidential candidate you will vote for? [Bahdankevich] According to our verbal agreement with Chernomyrdin, it was decided that the final draft of the agreement could be changed after the consultations. However, you know that Russia did not accept any changes and even toughened its position. Therefore, I not only had to publicly express my opinion but to write a letter -- which contained my principal disagreement with the merger on such conditions -- to the Supreme Soviet.... I will vote for Stanislaw Shushkevich. [passage omitted] [Kholod] Do you have a program regarding the stabilization of our "hare" outside of the ruble zone? [Bahdankevich] Yes. We have recently discussed key trends in the money and credit policy for 1994. This program has already been adopted. [Kholod] However, the government is pushing the Republic toward the money merger. At the same time, you have adopted a program of measures aimed at stabilizing the national currency outside the ruble zone. Why is there no single opinion on the issue? [Bahdankevich] Currently, the agreement with Russia is virtually not effective. The expectation that it would begin functioning leads to big losses due to chaos in calculations. The point is that the Russian ruble was balanced and accounted on par with the Belarusian ruble. We virtually decreased our assets by 10 times.... [passage omitted] [Burmako] What do you, an expert, think about the economic concept of the Belarusian Popular Front? Will you cooperate with them if they come to power? [Bahdankevich] I am ready to cooperate with any parties and movements that will be able to implement a program of market reforms.
