He added: We have also maintained a policy toward the international commercial banks, which I have repeated over 100 times, and that policy remains the same; it has not changed. Robalino said that negotiations with the commercial banks are still under way and that no agreement has yet been reached with the creditors grouped in the Paris Club. He said the government will soon present a refinancing plan to the Paris Club, but he did not outline what that plan would be. Robalino said that problems emerge whenever there is a plunge in the prices of basic products such as oil, which is so important to Ecuador's economy. But, he added, the negotiation process with the banks must continue. He said that it is not easy to reach an agreement with the banks, but the country has been working on the refinancing process for many years and will continue to do so. "We hope to reach an agreement and the date on which that happens is important because it is a complex process," Robalino said. The finance minister admitted that the commercial banks are asking Ecuador to resume interest payments so that an agreement can be reached but not because they want to hold serious discussions.
