Andoni] [Text] After a week of difficult negotiations, Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat has successfully talked prominent personalities from the Israeli occupied territories and the diaspora into joining a Palestinian authority to run autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. By Friday night, at least 17 personalities accepted to take part in the 25-member authority. Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) officials expected a complete list to be ready in the next 24 hours. In addition to 15 names announced by the PLO, Palestinian officials said that prominent Palestinian businessman Munib al-Masri has joined the authority, while Dr. As'ad 'Abd-al-Rahman, the Amman-based head of Shuman Foundation, is considering the offer. Initial reluctance by key Palestinian figures was replaced by approval, apparently in response to Israeli threats to suspend the entry of the Palestinian police force into the Gaza Strip and Jericho and influenced by the wave of popular celebrations that swept the territories over the transfer of Israeli responsibilities to the PLO. At least two PLO executive committee members, Jamal al-Surani and Jawid al-Ghusayn, were expected to join the authority, and even Dr. Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, who has condemned the economic part of the agreement, might change his mind. The officials said that Arab -- mostly Egyptian -- and international personalities involved in the peace process have been trying to convince the architect of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement, Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin) to join the authority. The Palestinian authority is expected to include 15 personalities from the occupied territories and 10 from the diaspora -- including two women from each category. Three key figures who had initially refused to take part in the authority either in protest against the terms of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement reached in Cairo on May 4 or against Mr. 'Arafat's single-handed leadership style appeared on top of a list officially delivered by the PLO to the Israeli government on Thursday night. Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni, head of the Palestinian team to the bilateral negotiations with Israel, Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, and former Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan 'Ashrawi, accepted to join the Palestinian authority after having snubbed the offer. Both Mr. al-Husayni and Dr. 'Urayqat have expressed serious reservations about the autonomy deal and had urged Mr. 'Arafat not to sign it. But the biggest surprise was Dr. 'Ashrawi, who has repeatedly declared that she wanted to remain independent to head a Palestinian human rights commission. In a lecture at the Shuman Foundation two weeks ago, Dr. 'Ashrawi lambasted the PLO leadership for its handling of the negotiations with Israel. By accepting the post, Dr. 'Ashrawi became one of two prominent Palestinian women on the Palestinian authority. Fatah Central Committee Member Intisar al-Wazir, widow of PLO military leader Khalil al-Wazir, who was assassinated by Israeli squads in 1988, was among the first to accept the appointment to practically the first Palestinian administration of part of the occupied Palestinian territories. There were no statements made by the leaders especially Mr. al-Husayni, Dr. 'Urayqat and Dr. 'Ashrawi, explaining their position. But it seemed that they had decided to work from within the authority in spite of their dissatisfaction with the agreement itself and Mr. 'Arafat's modus operandi. Mr. 'Arafat himself was undeterred by the three key leaders' negative comments about the agreement, and instead had challenged them to either join him to shoulder the responsibility or confine themselves to the role of disgruntled observers. "'Arafat has been calling each nominee, especially the ones who oppose the Cairo agreement, and urging them not to abandon him at this critical stage," one PLO official said. According to different accounts, the master tactician has been effectively challenging his critics to join him to face the task of building a Palestinian state instead of taking, "the easy way out." Israeli threats to delay the entry of Palestinian police if a Palestinian authority was not declared and the enormous shift of the mood in the occupied territories in favour of the agreement have contributed to mellowing the initially vehement opposition to the provisions of he deal. Mr. al-Husayni, however, is said to have asked for assurances that his authority as leader of Fatah in the West Bank should not continue to be marginalised and bypassed by Mr. 'Arafat, who has been using other channels to convey orders and instructions to the organisation. Furthermore, the position of Mr. al-Husayni and Dr. 'Urayqat is to a large extent reflective of the stand of the Fatah organisation in the West Bank, that insists on being represented in the Palestinian authority. According to information available from the West Bank, some influential Fatah rank and file, including young deportees who were allowed to return last month had urged Mr. al-Husayni and Dr. 'Urayqat to accept. Information available from Tunis and the occupied territories also suggest that many Fatah leaders feared that by boycotting the authority, the actual leadership will be confined to "traditional personalities" that have already accepted Mr. 'Arafat's offer dealing a blow to Fatah. Faced with reluctance by the historic leaders of the pro-PLO groups in the occupied territories, Mr. 'Arafat went straight to more traditional and conservative figures, sending alarms among the Fatah rank and file. According to well-placed officials, Fatah officials strongly protested Mr. 'Arafat's attempt to appoint Jamil al-Tarifi, head of the Palestinian liaison committee with Israel, but who is not seen as part of the more militant leadership that secured and sustained support for the PLO over the years. As names of members of the Palestinian authorities were starting to leak, many feared that it will be a weak body that would further consolidate Mr. 'Arafat's domination and will not challenge further concession to the Israelis. Yet, it remains to be seen how Mr. al-Husayni, Dr. 'Urayqat and Dr. 'Ashrawi will reconcile between their misgivings about the agreement and being members of the body entrusted with implementing it. Well-informed Palestinian sources said that the three feel that they could influence the continuing process of negotiations, instead of leaving it to Mr. 'Arafat and a small circle of aides in the hope that future steps will pave the way for Palestinian sovereignty. Other PLO officials were very critical of what they viewed as the contradictory position of the three leaders, who confined themselves to verbal protest but "towed the line" in the end. Opposition officials, however, declined from attacking any of the personalities who accepted to join. It was a sign that even the opposition hopes that the presence of outspoken critical members in the authority will pressure Mr. 'Arafat to yield some authority and not to block elections as many fear he would. So far the Palestinian authority is basically a coalition of Fatah and independents. The major other group is the Palestinian Democratic Union, FIDA, led by Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh. It was still unclear whether Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh himself will join or confine FIDA's representation to personalities from the occupied territories. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, FIDA's leader in the West Bank, was already included in the authority and FIDA officials Sami al-Kilani and Zahirah Kamal are strong nominees. If Ms. Kamal is appointed, the Palestinian authority will include three women. FIDA has publicly condemned the Cairo agreement but nevertheless decided to join the authority. The Palestine People's Party (PPP), which has boycotted the last rounds of negotiations, has maintained its stand of refusing to be part of the authority. Agencies add: PLO difficulties in naming a full slate of 24 member for the Palestinian National Authority has become the latest snag in the much-delayed self-rule plan agreed last September. The list so far includes Mr. 'Arafat, PLO Executive Committee members Samir Ghawshah and Yasir 'Amr, chief economist Ahmad Quray', two deportees and many of the prominent Palestinians who have taken part in peace talks with Israel since 1991, PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said. Asked if all the nominees had agreed, he said: "None of these names is nominated without being fully negotiated first." The PLO Executive Committee had approved all of them, Dr. Sha'th added at a news conference in Cairo. Dr. Sha'th transmitted the list to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on Thursday afternoon and Israeli consent to it was only a formality, he said. Dr. Sha'th said Mr. 'Arafat would appoint the remaining nine members within a week. Asked why the PLO decided to send an incomplete list, he said: "It's because there was a need by the Israelis to be assured on our seriousness in starting to conduct the authority's business." The PLO has spent much longer than expected making the nominations, which the Israelis had originally hoped to receive about the same time as the signing ceremony on May 4. Other members including Dr. Sha'th himself, Zakariya al-Agha and Furayh Abu-Middayn from Gaza, Riyad al-Za'nun, Bethlehem Mayor Ilyas Frayj and deportee 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Hajj Ahmad. Dr. Sha'th said he expected the Palestinian authority would be in place in Gaza and Jericho by next Tuesday but it is too early to say which members would have which responsibilities. He said he himself had been reluctant to take part but did not feel he could refuse at this stage in the process. Dr. Sha'th also said that the signing of agreement in Cairo has triggered a "faster pace of fund giving" by Western nations. He disclosed new donations including 14 million francs ($2.45 million) from France for a police communications system, $2 million from South Korea for computers and other equipment and 58 military vehicles from Greece. He said that 176 jeeps and trucks donated by the United States for the police from their European stock would arrive in Egypt next Sunday. The police have been hampered by a shortage of vehicles.
