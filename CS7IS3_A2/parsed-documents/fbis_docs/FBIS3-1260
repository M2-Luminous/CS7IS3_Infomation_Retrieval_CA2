After analyzing in detail the situation prevailing in country and taking into consideration the emotions and anxiety that misunderstandings between the two parties have raised, the UTD hereby appeals for calm. The UTD has decided to send the following letter to Mr. Yaovi Agboyibor, president of the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR]: Following the discussions that we held recently, I would like to bring the following clarifications to your attention in my capacity as president of the UTD: 1. The UTD has no intention to vie for any government or parliamentary post in the institutions of the Fourth Republic under any controversial circumstances. It is therefore clear that in the absence of any consensus, the UTD will not accept any of these posts. 2. The UTD understands that as far as it is concerned, the CAR wants to occupy all or part of these posts. The UTD does not find this inconvenient at all. 3. The UTD is on the side of the Togolese people in their march toward the establishment and consolidation of the rule of law and democracy. 4. The UTD hopes that these points will help clarify the present situation and strengthen the cohesion of the parliamentary majority so much yearned for by the Togolese people.
