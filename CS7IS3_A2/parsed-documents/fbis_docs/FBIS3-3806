Meng Fulin, chairman of the provincial people's congress Standing Committee, presided over a plenary meeting on the morning of 22 February. Present at the meeting were Vice Chairmen of the provincial people's congress Standing Committee Shao Ming, Liu Guangcai, Lu Shengdao, Wu Changqi, Lu Zixiu, Jiang Zehui, and Chen Jiyu as well as Secretary-General Lu Desheng. Present as non-voting delegates were Wang Yang, vice governor of Anhui; Han Yunping, president of the provincial higher people's court; Liu Sheng, chief procurator of the provincial people's procuratorate; and persons in charge of city and county people's congress Standing Committees and perfectural people's congress Liaison Committees. The meeting heard explanations by Jiang Dexin, vice chairman of the Rural Economic Work Committee of the provincial people's congress Standing Committee, and by Hou Yukun, vice chairman of the Legislative Affairs Committee of the provincial people's congress Standing Committee, on revision of the drafts of the "Regulations of Anhui Province for Handling Disputes Over Land Use Rights" and the "Regulations of Anhui Province on the Protection of Minors" respectively. Zheng Zikuan, director of the provincial Department of Agriculture, explained the draft of the "Procedures of Anhui Province for Implementing the `Agrotechnique Diffusion Law'" on behalf of the provincial people's government. He said: The utility rate of agrotechnical achievements is low, and many major agrotechnical achievements have not yet been widely used in Anhui Province. This has become a major factor impeding further development of Anhui's agriculture and rural economy. For this reason, it is necessary for us to sum up our own practical experience, learn from others' experience of success both at home and abroad, and formulate local regulations for agrotechnical diffusion which suit the conditions of this province so as to ensure sustained agricultural development and rural prosperity in this province. Huang Rongzong, vice chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee of the provincial people's congress Standing Committee, explained the drafts of four regulations and provisions concerning the Wuhu Economic and Technological Development Zone. He stated: Since its promulgation, the "Regulations on the Wuhu Economic and Technological Development Zone," adopted by the sixth session of the provincial people's congress Standing Committee, has played a guiding, promoting, and protecting role. However, the "regulations" deal more with principles. In view of the current situation and contradictions, we are urgently in need of more clear and definite legislation governing land management, the sale and transfer of land use rights, construction planning, project examination and approval, enterprise registration, and labor management in foreign-funded enterprises. The new legislation will certainly promote further development of the economic and technological development zone, improve the investment environment there, improve the rules and regulations for the development zone, and accelerate the process of attracting foreign investment in the development zone. The revised draft of the "Regulations of Anhui Province for Handling Disputes Over Land Use Rights" was examined and discussed at small group meetings in the afternoon.
