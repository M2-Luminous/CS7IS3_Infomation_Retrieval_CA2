FR940607-2-00091 FR940607-2-00062 In the initial approval order, 8 the Commission stated that GSCC should encourage its members to be more accurate in the data they submit in order to reduce, and eventually eliminate, the need for GSCC to substitute or supplement data on behalf of members. The Commission also stated that GSCC should track the identity of the submitting member and the executing firm in order to identify by type of match each trade involving a non-member. The Commission stated that the tracking should provide a basis for GSCC to test the accuracy of member input. Finally, the Commission requested that GSCC provide on a quarterly basis during the temporary approval period data concerning GSCC's comparison rates. 8 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30078 (December 13, 1991), 56 FR 66110. GSCC reports that since January of this year, the rate of successfully compared trades executed by non-member firms was 63%. 9 This figure is down slightly from the 69% figure reported to the Commission for the third quarter of 1992. 10 In order to increase the comparison rate, GSCC issues a report each month to members indicating the comparison rate for member trades and for non-member trades. 11 GSCC will counsel firms that have low comparison rates for non-member trades. 9 During this same period, forty trades for non-members have been submitted each day on average. Telephone conversation between Jeffrey Ingber, General Counsel, GSCC and Christine Sibille, Attorney, Commission (April 8, 1994). 10 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31651 (December 23, 1992), 57 FR 62586. 11 Telephone conversation between Jeffrey Ingber, General Counsel, GSCC and Christine Sibille, Attorney, Commission (April 11, 1994). Currently, twelve firms act as submitting members for a total of 271 non-member executing firms. This is a substantial increase from December 1992, when four firms acted as submitting members, for a total of fifty-eight non-members. GSCC should continue to attract more firms that provide a correspondent clearing service. The Commission believes that GSCC should be able to deem a trade as compared when both sides of the trade do not agree as to the executing firm information. 12 GSCC structured the proposal in this manner to facilitate the successful comparison of trades because not all GSCC members' internal systems are equipped to accommodate additional information fields. The Commission believes that as participation in the executing firm program grows, the exceptions to the requirements for a matched trade will help bolster the percentage of successfully compared trades. 12 Other clearing agencies have programs which allow trades to compare even though certain items do not precisely match. Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 31352 (October 23, 1992), 57 FR 49728 (MBSCC's Comparison and Clearing System); and 32747 (August 13, 1993), 58 FR 44530 (NSCC's Fixed Income Transaction System). GSCC has had more than two years experience in administering the program. To date, GSCC has not experienced any operational or other problems with regard to the executing firm feature. While the Commission believes that GSCC should continue to work to improve the comparison rate, the Commission also believes that GSCC has demonstrated sufficient expertise to warrant permanent approval of this rule filing. III. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;GSCC&hyph;94&hyph;02) be, and hereby is, approved. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
