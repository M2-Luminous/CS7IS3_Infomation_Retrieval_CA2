The visit, which will start "immediately" after the Moscow summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, is the first by the U.S. Treasury Secretary in a year. Bentsen, speaking here today, said his visit was to follow up on the progress made in Seattle last November during the ministerial meeting and informal leaders' meeting of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. "We must recognize that the United States has a substantial interest in the Pacific region," Bentsen said. "The Asia Pacific region today is the fastest growing economy in the world and we must be part of it." The secretary said that his mission in the forthcoming tour was to finalize the APEC finance ministers' meeting scheduled this year, and was "about how each of us sees APEC as a vehicle to further growth and development." Indonesia, with the fourth-largest population in the world, has an average real growth rate of six percent for the last 25 years, while Thailand's gross domestic product has been over seven percent for the past seven years. The economic growth of China was estimated at 13 percent last year.
