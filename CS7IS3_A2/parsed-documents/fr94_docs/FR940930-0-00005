FR940930-0-00005 FR940930-0-00002 Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing both AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;1759, and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1, Amendment 39&hyph;5944, and by adding a new airworthiness directive to read as follows: 94&hyph;20&hyph;04␣Beech Aircraft Corporation: Amendment 39&hyph;9032; Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;37&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;1759, and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1, Amendment 39&hyph;5944. Applicability 1. Models 35, 35R, A35, B35, C35, D35, E35, F35, G35, H35, J35, K35, M35, N35, and P35 airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any category; 2. Models S35, V35, V35A, and V35B airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any category, that do not have the straight tail conversion modification incorporated in accordance with Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SA2149CE; and 3. Model Super V airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any category. Compliance: Required initially within the next 100 hours time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished, and thereafter as indicated in the body of this AD. To prevent structural failure of the V-tail, which could result in loss of control of the airplane, accomplish the following: Note 1: Any of the actions specified by this AD may have already been accomplished in accordance with either AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1, which are superseded by this AD. The intent of this AD is to clarify, update, and incorporate the actions of those AD's into one AD while maintaining the repetitive inspections schedules already established by the superseded AD's. Note 2: The paragraph structure of this AD is as follows: Level 1: (a), (b), (c), etc. Level 2: (1), (2), (3), etc. Level 3: (i), (ii), (iii), etc. Level 4: (A), (B), (C), etc. Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4 structures are designations of the Level 1 paragraph they immediately follow. (a) For all airplane models, balance the elevator/rudder (ruddervator) control surfaces in accordance with Section 3 of Beech Shop Manual 35&hyph;590096B; and verify that the ruddervators are within the manufacturers specified limits as specified in the applicable shop or maintenance manual. (1) If any ruddervator is found outside of the specified limits, prior to further flight, obtain manufacturer's modification instructions by contacting the Wichita Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) at the address specified in paragraph (k) of this AD, and modify the ruddervator in accordance with these instructions. (2) Repeat these requirements any time the ruddervator is repaired or painted (even if stripes are added). (b) For all airplane models, visually inspect the fuselage bulkheads at Fuselage Station (FS) 256.9 and FS 272 for damage (cracks, distortion, loose rivets, etc.) in accordance with the procedures in the instructions to Beech Kit 35&hyph;4017&hyph;1 ``Kit Information Empennage & Aft Fuselage Inspection'', as specified in Beech SB 2188, dated May 1987. Visually inspect the fuselage skin around the bulkhead for damage (wrinkles or cracks). Prior to further flight, repair or replace any damaged parts. Repeat this inspection at each 100-hour TIS interval thereafter. (c) For all Model Super V airplanes, check the static balance of the ruddervator in accordance with Beech Shop Manual 35&hyph;590096A, Section 3, pages 12A, 12B, and 13. Repeat this check anytime the ruddervator is removed or repainted. Prior to further flight, make applicable corrections if any of the following is not achieved: (1) With the root weight removed and a tip weight attached, static balance of 19.80 (plus or minus 1.00) inch-pounds tail heavy; and (2) With the root weight added to the condition specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this AD, static balance of 7.00 (plus or minus 1.00) inch-pounds tail heavy. (d) The following placard, airspeed indicator markings, and POH/AFM requirements are retained from AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1, and are no longer mandatory when paragraphs (e) and (f) of this AD, as applicable, are accomplished:
