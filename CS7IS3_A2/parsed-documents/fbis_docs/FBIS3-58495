Briquemont -- who will be replaced by British General Michael Rose on January 24 after asking to be relieved of his functions -- said in an interview to be published by the German weekly DER SPIEGEL Monday [17 January] that he was tired of hearing about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's threats to carry out air raids against Serb positions. Such raids would not solve the problem of surrounded and besieged cities like Sarajevo, he said, adding that continual threats of this nature would not make the warring parties any more willing to discuss peace. In his interview, an excerpt of which was released Saturday, the UNPROFOR commander accused the West of lacking a clear strategy in Bosnia. Too many different opinions have been expressed, too many resolutions have been adopted and there are not enough resources allocated to carry out policy, he said. Briquemont said he feared that "the blue helmets will soon no longer be able to continue their humanitarian aid." "It's an illusion to think UN troops can continue to supply humanitarian aid for an unlimited time if firing continues," he said. If no peace agreement is reached soon the UN peacekeeping mission will have to be reassessed, he added. [passage omitted]
