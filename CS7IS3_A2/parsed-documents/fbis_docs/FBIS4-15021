The dollar-ruble exchange rate is expected to reach 3,000 rubles to the dollar by the middle of the year and 4,000 to 4,500 rubles by the end of the year. This forecast was given by Vladimir Petrov, first deputy minister of finance, at today's hearings on the draft state budget at the State Duma. [passage omitted] The government is proposing a tight financial policy. The main priority is to quickly suppress the inflationary process and to achieve financial stabilization. The principal methods are to cut state spending, to be strict about granting credit, and to extend the deadline for repayment of debts. In this context, the government intends to continue looking for investment resources, to increase centralized capital investment, and to attract resources accumulated in the private sector. There will also be tight monitoring of the effective, well-targeted use of state resources. It is expected that as long as an active policy of economic stabilization is implemented, the population's real monetary incomes will not fall by a significant amount. The government and parliament are organizing working groups, which are planning to complete work on the budget by the end of May. In the same month, the parliament and government will begin working together on the 1995 budget. In other words, one may conclude that the conditions have been created for constructive cooperation between the two estates without conflict.
