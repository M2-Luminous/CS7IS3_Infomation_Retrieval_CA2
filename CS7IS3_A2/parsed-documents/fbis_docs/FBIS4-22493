What are the results? [Petrov] A year is not too great a period to build up a serious organization. We have obtained the money to create the charter fund with great delay and the total amount of the funds we have received comes to about 10 percent of that envisaged by the Russian Federation President's decree about forming the corporation. That is why, based on the actual amounts which we managed to nevertheless obtain with great difficulty, we did not set ourselves the goal of investing it in projects right away since we understood perfectly well that their implementation would not have been able to have had any substantial influence on the structual reorganization of the economy. That is why the main attention and efforts were concentrated on the working out of economic and legal mechanisms ensuring an inflow of domestic and foreign investments into the economy of Russia. Strictly speaking, precisely this goal was pursued also in the creation of the corporation. [Yakushev] What sort of mechanism do you have in mind? [Petrov] The question is one of creating an integral system capable of mobilizing and optimizing financial flows and of achieving the concentration of resources in the most important directions, of ensuring effective control and, what is the main thing, of protecting investments from risks. Probably not everybody knows, but based on the degree of political risk for the investor, Russia occupies 50th, and based on the degree of economic risk, 53rd place among 54 countries of the world. We have done all the necessary work to inspire the confidence of foreign investors that their capital is protected. Literally a few days ago the Russian Investment Insurance Company (Rossiyskaya kompaniya po strakhovaniyu investitsiy) was registered abroad. Its assets have also been invested abroad. The goal of the company is to secure the insuring of the foreign investments from political risks (war, expropriation, currency inconvertibility, the alienation of property rights, etc.). As yet the company's charter capital is relatively small and is capable of ensuring the protection of investments in the amount of US $350-400 million. And this is no longer a little. Moreover, the organization of insurance will give rise to an "avalanche" effect and the example will indicate also Russia's concrete steps in creating real guarantees for Western investors. The most important world insurance companies have already expressed a readiness to associate themselves with our insurance fund. We propose to insure the commercial risks of investors through our insurance company currently being established in the territory of Russia. [Yakushev] What could you say about the structure of your organization and its associates? [Petrov] From the very beginning we set a goal of taking on only the strictly necessary number of associates. That is why the entire central staff of the corporation numbers a little more than 40 persons. Most of them are highly skilled specialists. Besides the central staff a number of subsidiary khozraschet enterprises, such as Gosinkor-trast, Gosinkor Torgovyy Dom, and Gosinkor Lotereya have been established. The regional representatives of the corporation are beginning to work more actively. We have been the founders of such financial structures as the inter-bank investment association Invest-kredit and the Entrepreneurship Development Bank. Gosinkor will become a powerful financial holding company in the future. Expert appraisal and project financing groups have gradually been formed in the corporation. Work in training personnel for Russian institutions related to the investment process is expanding. About 2,000 projects have been certified and the data base is steadily being enlarged. The Partners of Russia investment fund has been created jointly with the OPIC (an American foreign private investment corporation). Moreover, we have paid in $5 million and issued insurance for $20 million. The total amount of the fund will come to about $100 million, which will permit the attraction of almost $1 billion in investments into the Russian economy. This is already quite decent. We are participating in the creation of several more such funds. All these are the components of a single mechanism, without which one cannot efficiently carry on the investment process. [Yakushev] Why wasn't the edict of the president of the Russian Federation about alloting you the necessary monetary funds carried out? [Petrov] Because in the previous government there were people for whom a presidential edict was not a guide to action. Of course, one should also take the difficulties which the country's economy has faced into account. However, I think that the government's leaders should have looked ahead. There's no need to talk about this now. The main thing is that the corporation is standing firmly on its feet and the battles have only hardened us. [Yakushev] Do you have an investment policy concept? [Petrov] Yes, we have such a concept. In the very near future we intend to give a report on it to a meeting of the Commission on Day-to-Day Problems of the Government of Russia (Kommissiya po operativnym voprosam pravitelstva Rossii) which Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets heads. We expect that, taking into account the structures which have been formed and the experience that has been accumulated, we will be able to become a serious partner, or, more precisely, a mechanism of the government in conducting investment policy and improving the legislative base of the investment process. It is my profound conviction that Gosinkor should become the mechanism for converting from a centralized administrative investment system to a market system relying on fundamentally new sources and utilizing the methods of the investment banks of the West, which have also provided the financial basis for the prosperity of the capitalistic economy. Analysis of the investment readiness of our plants has revealed a paradoxical result--not a single facility is ready for correct and sound investment. From force of habit all state a need for money "from Moscow," and not one ponders over actual repayment and even survival. To give them money today is to simply mechanically continue free financing and to irretrieviably waste the latest budget funds on potential bankruptcy. That is why we set ourselves the goal not to delay the tragic outcome at the price of the latest money but to create a mechanism and conditions which will not tolerate, first, the continuation of cost-based financing, and, secondly, will really help an enterprise to switch over to the rules of market investment, to adapt itself and to survive under modern conditions. The fact is that there are not enough budget funds and even the market theory of investing regards centralized resources only as a component of the investment flow where the basic accent should be put on traditional sources--the funds of the population and of enterprises, pension, insurance and other funds, and foreign investors. [Yakushev] What goals are you setting yourselves for next year? [Petrov] Much depends on what resources will be given over to the State Investment Corporation for the fulfillment of its charter tasks. In the present case I mean the financial resources and property intended for filling up the corporation's charter fund, centralized capital investments, as well as the state shares of the stocks of privatized enterprises which, on the basis of agreements already achieved with the Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration of State Property and the Federal Property Fund, will be transferred to us in trust management or for sale at investment auctions. On the whole the mechanism created by the corporation and the experience accumulated permits one in the shortest time possible to expand the attraction of investments along a broad front through insurance activity and to more efficiently manage centralized capital investments, having ensured their maximum use and a high return. The creation of an investment-tender center, where, after the appropriate preparation, blocks of shares of privatized enterprises will be offered, will be an important direction. The stage of the practical implementation of an entire series of investment projects with the participation of both the corporation's internal capital funds and domestic and foreign capital will begin in the current year.
