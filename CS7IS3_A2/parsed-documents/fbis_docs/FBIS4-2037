What are the guiding thoughts for Hebei to deepen reform this year? [Wang Dongjin] This year, Hebei should adhere to the basic idea of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability, firmly aim at establishing the socialist market economy system and building an economically strong province, and emphasize the further transformation of the operating mechanism of state-own enterprises and the exploration of effective ways to establish the modern enterprises system. It should accelerate the reform of the fiscal and tax, banking, foreign trade and foreign exchange, planning, investment and money lending, and state asset management systems and make a substantial step in establishing a new-type macroeconomic regulating and controlling system. It should promote correspondingly the establishment of the market system focusing on the markets for the essential elements of production; add impetus to the reform of the social security and housing systems; and continue to deepen the rural reform, carry out the reform of the scientific and technological system and educational system correspondingly, give a free hand to the development of the nonstate economies, coordinate reform, development, and stability, realistically address the conspicuous contradictions and problems in economic activities, and facilitate Hebei's sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. [Reporter] As deepening the enterprise reform is the central link of the entire economic structural reform, what are Hebei's major measures for it? [Wang Dongjin] The basic orientation for enterprise reform is establishing a modern enterprise system under which the property rights as well as the rights and responsibilities of enterprises are clearly defined, government administration and enterprise management are separated, and scientific management is established. Based on our specific conditions, this system should be promoted step by step by closely coordinating it with the transformation of the operating mechanism after experiences are accumulated and favorable conditions created. Focusing on the transformation of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises into shareholding ones and the reorganization and flow of the property rights of difficult small and medium-sized enterprises, we should carry out in a down-to-earth manner the various basic work for establishing the modern enterprise system. There are five major measures: First, we should thoroughly enforce the "PRC law on the industrial enterprises owned by the whole people" and the "regulations on transformation of the operating mechanism of the industrial enterprises owned by the whole people," resolve well the difficulties in delegating power to enterprises, and grand enterprises all the rights and responsibilities they are entitled to. Second, we should continue exploring the specific ways to effectively transform the operating mechanism of enterprises, pay attention to the various measures for enterprises to manage their property, and provide favorable conditions for establishing the modern enterprise system more rapidly. Third, we should follow the law governing the market economy and the state's industrial policy to greatly facilitate the restructuring of the organization of enterprises and enliven the existing property. Fourth, we should deepen the supporting reform within enterprises in line with the requirements for establishing the modern enterprise system. Fifth, we should realistically reduce the burdens on enterprises and provide an environment for enterprises to compete on an equal footing. [Reporter] All circles in society are deeply concerned about the work to bring the relations in property rights into better balance and to establish the modern enterprise system. Please give us more specific details about it. [Wang Dongjin] Based on state's unified arrangements and Hebei's reality, we will focus on the implementation of the following six measures for property management this year in our effort to probe into establishment of the modern enterprise system. First, based on the stipulations of the "PRC corporation law," we will speed up transforming large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises along the direction of the corporation system. 1) Based on requirements, we will transform the following enterprises into limited liability companies or limited liability stock companies in line with their different conditions: state-owned enterprises provided with the necessary conditions for the transformation, whose products conform to the industrial policy and which are highly competitive and create good economic efficiency, especially the large- and medium-sized enterprises listed in the "dragon and tiger plan;" enterprises that develop high and new technology and new industries; real estate enterprises engaged in large-area renovation of old city proper; enterprises that expand exports to earn more foreign exchange and draw in foreign capital; and nucleus enterprises that help improve the property right relations of enterprise groups. In coordination with the reform of the investment system, we will organize the key enterprises approved by the state and the province in line with the shareholding system as long as they are provided with the necessary conditions so that new enterprises will implement new mechanisms. 2) We will select 30 enterprises which possess the necessary conditions and which are invested exclusively by the state (mainly the state-owned enterprises in the competitive trades which cannot be transformed into shareholding enterprises for the time being and the enterprises and construction projects in some monopolizing trades, basic industries, and public welfare industries) to experiment with the system of exclusively state-invested companies and gradually disseminate this system after experiences are gained. We will strengthen the standardized management of the pilot enterprises experimenting with the corporation system so that they will fully perform the function of transforming mechanisms. 3) We will actively recommend the limited liability stock companies with necessary conditions and outstanding business performance for listing their shares and strive to win approval for about five enterprises to issue A and B shares and list their shares outside the border. We will continue exploring the ways for legal persons to list their shares. Second, enterprises under contracted management which do not have the necessary conditions to transform along the direction of the corporation system for the time being may renew their contracts to last until the end of the Eighth Five-year Plan period. They should conscientiously enforce the "general rules on financial affairs of enterprises" and the "business accounting standards" and successfully link them with the policies for the new fiscal and tax systems. Policies for the enterprises operated under the overall input and output contracts as approved by the provincial government will last until 1995. The investment of these enterprises should be properly restructured, and efforts should be concentrated on key projects so that they can yield output as soon as possible. Third, when transplanting and renovating state-owned enterprises with foreign capital, we should pay particular attention to the coordination of mechanisms, tie the capital of foreign firms in with the property of state-owned enterprises to cultivate the operating mechanism compatible with international practice so that the numerous purposes of clarifying the property right relations, effectively using foreign capital, delegating import and export authority, and exploring the world market can be attained. Cities and prefectures should select a number of projects to be transplanted and renovated, adopt various measures to invite investment, and aim at the large corporations, consortia, and companies with substantial economic and technological strength in the world to develop large-scale development. Some enterprises may try out the operating mechanism of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises, gradually suit their mechanism to the international practice, and open up the channels for using foreign capital. Fourth, regarding the small and medium-sized enterprises that earn little profits or lose money, some may continue the contract system, and others may adopt various measures for property management which are characterized by state ownership and management by the people, such as contracting or leasing out an entire enterprise to a natural person who brings in funds, leasing out branch plants (workshops), production lines, single machines, or whole sets of equipment, and entrusting households to produce the products which require simple techniques or are more suitable for manual operation but letting the enterprises to conduct the accounting. Fifth, enterprises suffering long deficits may be put under the management of the large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, scientific research units, township enterprises, or foreign firms, which then get reimbursement from this. Sixth, while actively promoting the public-owned economies, we will encourage the development of individual, private, and foreign-funded economies and create favorable conditions for the economies of various ownerships to participate in the market competition on an equal footing. We will speed up reforming the property right system of collective enterprises and actively promote the shareholding system. Urban and rural collective enterprises and nongovernmental scientific and technological enterprises may be transformed into shareholding enterprises, shareholding cooperatives, or enterprises instituting the partnership system in line with their specific conditions. When building new collective enterprises, we should strive to adopt the shareholding cooperative system from the very beginning and operate them under new mechanisms. Small state-owned enterprises may also be turned into shareholding cooperatives. [Reporter] The state has issued fairly many measures for reform of the macroeconomic system. How will Hebei implement them? [Wang Dongjin] The state has issued an unprecedentedly large number of measures for reform of the macroeconomic system and pressed ahead with them to an unprecedentedly large extent. In line with the principle of doing active and prudent work and ensuring their implementation, we will emphasize seven aspects. First, in line with the requirement for establishing the socialist market economy system, the principle of separating government administration from enterprise management, and the principle of simplification, unity, and efficiency, we will accelerate the organizational reform at governments at all levels, change their functions, bring the relations between various sectors into better balance, streamline their organizations, and divert their personnel so that government departments will truly change their habitual direct management of the production and operation of enterprises into management mainly through economic, legal, and necessary administrative means and will provide favorable conditions for enterprises to transform mechanisms and establish new ones. Second, we will promote reform of the fiscal and tax systems in an active and prudent manner. We will further rationalize the relations between the central and the local governments in the distribution of revenues and change the current system of progressive increase in the revenues to be turned over by provincial governments to the central government into the revenue-sharing system. We will ensure the smooth transition to the revenue-sharing system in line with the principles and targets defined by the central authorities and, at the same time, carefully formulate and implement the policies for the province to reform the fiscal and tax systems of cities and prefectures, stimulate their enthusiasm, and facilitate economic development. To coordinate with the institution of the revenue-sharing system, local tax organizations should be established as soon as possible. We will reform and improve the tax collection system in line with the principle of "unifying the tax laws, levying taxes fairly, simplifying tax systems, and dividing power in a reasonable manner." We will extend the indirect tax system based mainly on the value-added tax, cancel the tax on raw materials and the industrial and commercial integrated tax levied from the three types of foreign-funded enterprises, and implement the new value-added tax system. We will improve the methods for collecting value-added tax and implement the system whereby the amount of tax to be levied is written in the dispatch lists and the tax is collected according to the dispatch lists. Meanwhile, the consumption tax, in addition to the value-added tax, will be collected from some special commodities during their production and marketing. The business tax will continue in the noncommodity businesses from which the original business tax levied does not include the new value-added tax. A unified tax rate will be applied to the income tax levied from state-owned enterprises, collective enterprises, shareholding enterprises, and the enterprises exercising various forms of joint management; and the new personal income tax law will be enforced to strengthen the collection and management of personal income tax. Collection of the resources tax will be expanded to promote the effective utilization of resources. Real estate value-added tax will be levied in the trade of real estate. Third, we will facilitate the reform of the banking system. We will accelerate the transformation of the functions of the People's Bank of China at the provincial level and below to strengthen their responsibilities for monetary supervision and management, investigation and statistical analysis, regulation of lateral money supply, management of the state treasury's cash allocation, foreign exchange management, and joint accounting. Various specialized banks will be transformed into commercial banks and will carry out management of the proportions of assets and liabilities and management of property risks. We will strive for establishment of agencies of various state policy-lending banks in Hebei; rural credit cooperatives will be separated from agricultural banks and will carry out management of the proportions of assets and liabilities based on the evaluation of the remaining sum to provide favorable conditions for establishing rural cooperative banks; and transformation of urban credit cooperatives into urban cooperative banks will be accelerated, monetary institutions other than banks, such as trust and investment companies and security companies, will be greatly developed, and the managerial system for rural cooperative foundations will be improved. We will deepen the reform of the insurance system and establish Hebei branches of the Taipingyang and Pingan Insurance Companies. We will create favorable conditions to bring in institutions of foreign funds and strive for foreign loans. Fourth, we will speed up the reform of the planning system. We will further reduce the mandatory plans in the fields of production, commodity circulation, and distribution; establish and improve the systems for state ordering, storage, and allocation of goods; accelerate establishment of the new guidance planning system; put the focus of the planning work on the research and formulation of medium- and long-term plans, comprehensive coordination of macroeconomic policies, and application of economic levers; properly draw up the strategies for provincial economic and social development, targets of macroeconomic regulation and control, and industrial policies; do a good job in economic forecast; plan for the economic structure and production layout; and combine the fundamental role of the market in distribution of resources with the advantage of macroeconomic regulation and control through planning. Fifth, we will deepen the reform of the investment and money-lending systems. We will further apply the mechanism of market competition to the work of investment and money-lending, strengthen the position of enterprises as major investors, and gradually establish the risk-taking responsibility system for legal person investment and bank credit. We will standardize the activities of the major investors, reform the methods for investment and money- lending, and improve the investment efficiency. Enterprises as legal persons hold the responsibilities and bear the risks for all the preparations, fund-raising, designing, and construction of construction projects and even the production, management, debt repayment, and the maintenance and increase of the value of assets. Regarding the new projects to be started and the projects already under construction, we will determine their major investors and, based on the sources and structure of the capital, establish the enterprises which institute the corporation system to hold the responsibility for the entire process of the construction. We will fully develop the role of the provincial construction investment company as the major investor in the basic industries. We will establish and improve the investment service systems provided by consulting, designing, auditing, construction supervisory, and other social intermediary organizations which serve the major investors. Sixth, we will unify the exchange rate in line with state unified arrangements, abolish the foreign exchange retention and quota management systems, exercise unified foreign exchange purchases and sales, and establish the system whereby enterprises report foreign exchange income and expenditure. Seventh, we will reform and improve enterprises' state-owned asset management system. We should look squarely at the serious losses in enterprises' state-owned assets, step up establishment of the "methods for the supervision and management of the property of Hebei's state-owned enterprises," and implement the system under which state-owned assets are owned by the state in a unified manner, supervised at different levels by governments, and managed independently by enterprises. We should explore ways to establish the major operators of state property rights and entrust certain units or establish supervision councils to experiment with the supervision and management of the state-owned assets of selected key enterprises subordinate to metallurgical industry, foreign trade, building materials, chemical industry, auto industry, and petroleum industry departments. After experiences are gained, they will be extended throughout the province. In this way, the supervision councils, while ensuring the enterprises' property right, will conscientiously hold the responsibility for supervising the maintenance and increase of the value of the property, but they should not intervene in the management of the enterprises. In the process of the reorganization and flow of the enterprises' property, it is strictly prohibited to covert state-owned assets into shares and sell them at low prices or even distribute them to individuals without compensation; and it is strictly prohibited to infringe upon state-owned assets and their interests. To overcome the defects in the traditional managerial system for state-owned property, we should follow state arrangements to make inventory and accounting of property step by step to ascertain the quantity, determine the property right, clarify debts receivable and debts payable, appraise property, verify the amount of property used by enterprises, and adopt effective property organizations and property managerial measures to make state-owned property yield due returns.
