De Leon compared peace to a train, and sectors that fail to hop aboard are left at the station. The CACIF has realized that it must join efforts to reach peace, he added. As for the petition made by business circles to the Attorney General's Office that UNRG commanders must be legally prosecuted, the head of state deemed it somewhat hard to understand as CACIF is holding talks with the URNG. This shows peace is more difficult to achieve than war. I want to clarify, however, that I respect all decisions made by CACIF, he pointed out. As for the talks held by conflicting parties on the uprooted population, the president said he has little to say because civilian sectors have already made their proposals and the delegations will make the final decision. President De Leon also said he was pleased with the visit he paid to the refugees who returned to Guatemala in the last few days because he regards them as apolitical Guatemalans, although some leaders are trying to use or manipulate them.
