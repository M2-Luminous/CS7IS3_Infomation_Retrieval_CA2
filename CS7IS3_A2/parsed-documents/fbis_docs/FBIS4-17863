The news conference noted that the first group of Russian police observers, numbering 14 people, was sent to Yugoslavia in April 1992 at the request of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. Russian militiamen were working as part of the UN police forces, who perform peacekeeping functions. The tasks of these forces include monitoring the observance of human rights by the local police and the distribution of humanitarian aid. The staff of the police forces also undertook the organization of exchanges of POWs. The second group of militiamen went to Yugoslavia a year ago. Anatoliy Tsoglo, the commander of the Russian police contingent, informed a CRIME-PRESS correspondent that our militiamen were serving in all sectors of the UN police mission, including those in areas with an extremely exacerbated military situation, such as Sarajevo and Tuzla. According to Colonel (militia) Boris Rakitin, deputy commander of the contingent, the group of observers working in the area of Sarajevo airport, where there was practically no local police, had the hardest time. The Russian contingent was involved in the evacuation of sick and wounded from the area of Sarajevo. According to Anatoliy Tsoglo, Russian militiamen enjoy high prestige both among the local population and among their colleagues from other countries. Twenty-six people from the staff of the mission (altogether it has 41 people) are occupying leading posts in the structure of the UN police forces. The next group of Russian police observers is now getting ready to be dispatched to Yugoslavia.
