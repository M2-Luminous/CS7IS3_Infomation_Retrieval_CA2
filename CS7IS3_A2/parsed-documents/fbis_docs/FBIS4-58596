These forces have ignited an infernal fire wherever they can. Their hegemony went to the point of issuing the utmost instructions they could give. However, this bridge soon collapsed at the hands of those who chose the trench of defending the homeland, the revolution, unity, and the new life in the Yemen of 22 May. These are the faithful men among the sons of our people and among their valiant Armed Forces, who fulfilled their pledge to God and valiantly sacrificed themselves, so unity would remain brilliant in the homeland, and so democracy would illuminate the darkness of the totalitarian and dictatorial one-party system, and so the people would have the final say because it is derived from God's sayings, and so the dreams of devils would be shattered. These devils sold themselves, their fate, and everything that is dear and sacred in the market of ill wagers, in the face of the will of life, of maintaining democracy, and of raising high the flags of the Republic of Yemen. To these heroes of our Armed Forces, we say: May you rejoice in the new chapter of pride and glory you are writing everywhere as a great victory. May you rejoice in the homeland and unity. To all those who fell victim to their disease and rancor, we say: History is pouring on you the dust of shame and disgrace, exactly as it poured dust on similar traitors and agents. History is also closing the doors to what you planned and to what your minds and acts sought to achieve. You may face a dark and bad fate. We tell the deceived ones whose loyalty is still to God, the homeland, and the revolution, and who offered dear sacrifices to protect the achievements of the September and October revolutions: Disregard the instructions of the murderers and executioners and the advocates of secession. Join the honorable trench, the trench of all valiant men and the trench of protecting legitimacy and preserving unity and democracy. This is our inevitable path to achieve all aspirations and hopes. It is our path to heal the wounds of the hearts through the beginning of a new life, in which there is no room for crises and fabricators of crises or those who tried to take dirty money to foil unity and democracy by fabricating crises and igniting the crime of war and fratricide among the children of the one Yemeni homeland. We also hail the brave heroes in the army of the revolution, unity, and democracy who are now foiling the conspiracy of secession and raising high the banners of unity. We also hail all officers, NCO's, and soldiers who refused to fall in the quagmire of the conspiracy against unity and democracy and proved that they have cleansed themselves of the filth of the era of the class vindictiveness and the dictatorship of the one party and sided with the people, unity, and constitutional legitimacy. We stress to the people and history that the crime of the ugly war ignited by the malicious persons in the Yemeni Socialist Party, particularly traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his secessionist gang, has clearly exposed the nature of the enemies of the people, revolution, unity, and democracy. The chance is now available once again to all heroes in our Armed Forces and security agencies in Sa'dah, al-Mahrah, Hadhramaut, Ta'izz, and all parts of the united homeland to join the ranks of all those who hold unity dear in their hearts. They now have the chance to prove once again -- with valor, heroism, and with their warm, pure blood -- that they can defend the most hallowed value of the people, and to confirm their readiness to offer the dearest sacrifices to ensure that this homeland will remain united and its will unbreakable. They have the chance to confirm the people's democratic choice, upon which the enemies of the people tried to encroach through all devious means for the sake of filthy money and a mad attachment to power. Here they are today digging their own graves so that they will not remain a source of shame for the homeland and a heavy burden on the new Yemeni life; so that our people will not live again in the eras of suppression, terrorism, and bloodbaths, and the rule of terrorism, suppression, and mass murders of the cream of the Yemeni society; and so that the future of the people and country will not be controlled by that gang of tyrants, murderers, thieves, and criminals, and the madmen of the blind, vindictive theories and false slogans, which will only bring to the people death and suppression and to the homeland fire, destruction, and damage, which they wanted to afflict on everything beautiful in it.
