Our continent's most senior body (elected, let us not forget, by universal suffrage by all the community's peoples) "demands" --this is the word used in the document -- that all member states call our country to order and urge it to observe the founding principles on which the European Community was created after the disasters of the war and after the defeat of fascism, which cost bloodshed and lives not only to the European nations but to the entire world. This has never happened before. Never has a sovereign body such as the Strasbourg parliament, a body which derives its legitimacy directly from the people, issued such a lofty and solemn signal, such an imperious warning, and never has one of the member and founding states of the European federative structure found itself in such a distressing and humiliating position of international isolation. Evidently the Europeans -- of whom the Strasbourg parliament is the representative expression -- regard political events in our country from a profoundly different viewpoint from the relative majority of Italians, who voted for the right-wing alignment 27 March. We said the "relative" majority, and this aspect of the matter should be stressed: Even if the League is included in the right-wing alignment, which has always declared itself to be antifascist, the total amounts to 42 percent of the votes cast; 58 percent of voters, of the center and the Left, voted against it. The attitude of the 42 percent of Italians who voted for Berlusconi's coalition (though, without the League, the figure falls to barely over 30 percent) is to forget the past; the European Parliament, however, has reaffirmed the importance of memory, of historical identity, of the constitutional legitimacy on which basis democratic Europe was rebuilt. Europe fears contagion by Italy: This is the sad fact conveyed to us from Strasbourg. For that matter, we have received the same message in recent days from all the European and Western capitals -- whispered discreetly by government officials and shouted out loud by the democratic parties and major newspapers of the West. The new political class that emerged victorious from the 27 March elections underestimated these events. They paid them no heed. They blamed them on foreign newspaper correspondents "manipulated by the Communists," as Mr. Berlusconi contemptuously declared. Well, it was, and is still, a much larger issue than that; the conflict is much more serious than was imagined by a businessman who within the space of three months has become a political leader and prime minister-designate. He thought that management of a television firm was sufficient experience in order to manage a major country set in its international context. He thought that his redeeming presence was enough to cancel out historical and political ascendancies that have never been disavowed. It is not so. Europe disagrees and is issuing a warning; Europe is protecting us. It suffered contagion once, and it does not want that fact, that disaster, that tragedy, to be forgotten. Our chief of state has proudly rejected Europe's warning; our democratic principles are firm, he stressed, and we do not accept lessons. And we Italian democrats feel torn by conflicting feelings. On the one hand, we would like to express solidarity with Scalfaro in his proud defense of our people's free and democratic decisions against any foreign interference. But, on the other hand, we wonder: Is Europe foreign? Are we not Europeans as well as Italians? Was this not the profound principle that emerged from the disastrous war? Are we not members of that same family, and should we not therefore respect the principles and institutions that we all freely provided for ourselves? This is the serious dilemma with which the European Parliament has confronted the Italian people's political conscience. Meanwhile, we learn that Mr. Berlusconi convened the management of the Fininvest company to examine the situation last night, while [Northern League leader] Bossi is threatening to withdraw from the coalition. This is the state we have reached: the victors still arguing about the sharing out of the ministries after a month, the prime minister-designate consulting the managers of his company-party on matters of state, and Europe alarmed by the prospect of neo-Fascist ministers. It is a sad spectacle, and the future is uncertain. The stock market was the first to recognize the fact, and after so much euphoria, selling began to increase.
