FBIS4-48100 "drafr092_e_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-092 Daily Report 11 May 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia Factional Clashes Continue Factional Clashes Continue AB1105220994 Paris AFP in French 1321 GMT 11 May 94 AB1105220994 Paris AFP French BFN [Text] Monrovia, 11 May (AFP) -- The fighting between Mandingos and Krahns, the two rival clans within the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia [ULIMO] -- Liberian armed faction -- continued today, north of Monrovia, despite the cease-fire reached in principle by the two warring sides which have been involved in negotiation efforts since 9 May. The continued fighting was noted by the Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group [ECOMOG] and confirmed to AFP by a spokesman for the Mandingos who stated that the Krahns attacked them yesterday evening at Suehn, 35 km north of Monrovia. Colonel Wealtu Sawyea, commander of the Krahn forces, told the media today that the cease-fire order had not been sent to him up to now by the clan leader, General Roosevelt Johnson, the ULIMO military commander. The general's supporters stated that his "old mother" as well as a ULIMO Krahn leader, Harry Nayou, were "taken hostage" by Mandingo fighters in Tubmanburg, 60 km north of Monrovia. They stated that the fighting would not stop as long as these two people were not released. The continued fighting did not prevent the negotiations from resuming this morning at the ECOMOG headquarters in Monrovia between Gen. Johnson and Alhaji Koromah, the Mandingo clan leader and ULIMO chairman. On the third consecutive day the discussions were to center on the sharing between Mandingos and Krahns of the posts allocated to ULIMO within the transitional institutions. Gen. Johnson's supporters continue saying that their rivals have taken hold of most of these posts -- two in the Council of State, seven in the government, and nine in the Parliament -- while the two ethnic groups have the same number of members within the ULIMO. Mr. Koromah and his supporters, according to an informed source, dismissed these allegations, describing their adversaries' demands as "irrealistic and potentially harmful."
