"Only recently New Wave was inclined to support Ivan Plyushch," he said. "But today there are two presidential candidates who really stand a chance to be elected, Leonid Kuchma and Leonid Kravchuk. Considering this setup, and also the fact that Kuchma represents pro-Russian forces in Ukraine, New Wave has decided to support and campaign for the current president of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk. "Although we have certain reservations about him, and we are particularly dissatisfied with his indecisive attitude to economic reforms and his personnel policy, New Wave sees no alternative to Kravchuk," Shveda told UNIAN.
