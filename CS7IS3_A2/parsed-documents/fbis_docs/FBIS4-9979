At least this is what we infer from the plans announced last week by Army Minister Zenildo de Lucena during a lecture at the Army General Staff School (Eceme) in Rio de Janeiro. According to the minister, this year the Army will get $200 million to purchase weapons and equipment. The money is part of the $800 million that the government is supposed to inject into the Army's bank accounts over a four-year period. "We will not be able to leap into total modernization, but we will get up out of the bottom of the pit where we have been since the Collor administration," an official who attended the Eceme lecture told ISTOE. The military command's idea is to split this year's $200 million into two parts. Half will be used--on the domestic market--to buy personal equipment, such as helmets. The other half will be spent on armaments imports. One of the stars of the transaction will be the purchase of fifty 105mm guns, the Light Gun model made by the British firm Royal Ordnance that was used in the Falklands War (1982) and the Gulf War (1991). Four units had already been bought by the Army last year. Each gun costs between $800,000 and $1.2 million and has a maximum range of 24 km, twice that of the American M-101's, the venerable survivors of World War II that the Army now uses. Interest in the Light Guns goes way back, but the military budget squeeze led the government to make the purchase of the guns conditional on extremely favorable financing over a 10-year period. Of course the purchase did not go through. But, attention! The deal with Royal Ordnance does not involve merely a potential arms purchase. "We are dreaming big," said General Armando Paiva Chaves, president of War Materiel Industry of Brazil (IMBEL). "We see this as a long-term relationship," a spokesman for the British company told ISTOE in London. Royal Ordnance has long-term experience--400 years of it, since it descended from the first British weapons factories. Its approaches to the Brazilian army gained new energy in 1991. The company is aiming high; it wants to retire a good part of Brazil's approximately 570 old 105mm guns, as well as some 155mm guns. The British firm and the Brazilian military really embraced each other in 1992, when they formed the joint venture known as South America Ordnance. There are three partners, with equal shares: Imbel, the Schahyn Cury group and, of course, Royal Ordnance. The objective is to use Brazilian influence in Latin America to market British weapons. On the other hand, Royal Ordnance's worldwide network would enable Imbel to expand its business. The joint venture is exporting about $10 million every year in munitions. One of its customers is the Philippines. Malaysia and Thailand are likely to follow. All this is very hush-hush, according to a golden rule of the explosive world of the arms trade. On Wednesday, when the Brazilian military command was already rubbing its palms together in contented anticipation of the new Light Guns, Lenio Zimmer, director of South America Ordnance, was denying that the transaction had occurred. "We are only concerned with the technical part, we have nothing to do with the commercial aspects," was the justification he gave later. There are some who say that the marriage between Royal Ordnance and the Brazilian Army is destined to fly even higher. For example, there could be an agreement that would write a happy ending to the soap opera of the bankrupt Engesa [Specialized Engineers, Inc.], the manufacturer of a good part of the Army's vehicles and tanks. That and any other flight would probably have as takeoff point the willingness of the Brazilian Government to beef up the military budget. The $200 million installment that is expected to be received by December, it is well to remember, was promised for 1993.
