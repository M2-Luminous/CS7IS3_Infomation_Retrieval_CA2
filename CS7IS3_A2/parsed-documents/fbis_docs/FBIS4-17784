With this in mind, Armenian Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan sent letters to the prime ministers of the CIS countries today, noting that the existence of the decades of unified system over the territory of the former Soviet Union is making the independent economic development of the CIS countries impossible without painful consequences. The Armenian prime minister reminded his CIS colleagues that since the introduction of the national currencies in these countries, the financial transactions between them has been considerably difficult. The Russian ruble has become the means of payment for any trade transaction with the result that these states are appealing to Russia for additional credits to settle accounts between them. In this way, they are contributing to the Russian budget deficit. In its turn, the devaluation of the Russian ruble is causing even further devaluation of the national currencies. The Armenian Government sees the mitigation of the financial difficulties in the wider use of the national currencies and therefore proposes the creation of a single CIS currency to settle the mutual accounts through a CIS interstate bank. This will broaden the opportunities of using the national currencies, assist in their stabilization, and establish exchange rates between them as eventually the interstate obligations will be regulated through the national currencies. This will make it possible to spare the CIS countries from accruing debts to Russia, alleviate Russia's credit problems, and contribute to the stabilization of the Russian ruble. In the opinion of the Armenian Government, the creation of an interstate bank will be beneficial for all the CIS countries. Therefore, Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan has called on all his colleagues to defend the idea of the creation of such a bank. In his letter, Grant Bagratyan also detailed his views on how to set up the bank and form its initial capital.
