What the Kremlin Is Whispering About"] [Text] There are three laws that define the "dogfight" under the Kremlin carpet. In the first place, it is constantly going on and never ceases even for a single hour. In the second place, this refined battle consists of a number of bilateral duels in which analytical notes, telephone calls, proximity to Banana's (the Kremlin nickname for Yeltsin) aides, etc. are used. Third, periodically they all gang up against one who is bothering many of them and at whom the finger of the "leader" (another nickname for the president) is pointed. Yuriy Baturin, the president's aide for national security is persistently intriguing against Oleg Labov, the secretary of the Security Council. So successfully that a couple of weeks ago he forced him to hastily hide in the hospital. But Baturin (the Kremlin's nickname--Sour Cabbage Soup) and S. Filatov, who supports him, miscalculated and underestimated the traditions of the "Sverdlovsk grouping": The president and Labov communicated in a friendly way for a long time on the eve of the meeting of the Security Council last week. Incidentally, at that same meeting of the Security Council the president blew up at A. Kozyrev. "There is no Russian policy regarding the Caucasus." And what about the other regions or problems--is there a policy for them? The foreign affairs minister turned pale. He had prepared to answer on the Yugoslav crisis and managed to warn his deputy, V. Churkin, that he would be the scapegoat. One can assume that of those present at the meeting of the Security Council, the newly appointed Deputy Prime Minister S. Shakhray would gloat the most. Because the conflict in the Northern Caucasus was largely on his conscience. Incidentally, observers doing time and motion studies of the Kremlin intrigues are more and more frequently asking one another this question: When will Shakhray "deny" Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin? Recently S. Shakhray persuaded the prime minister to abandon the idea of creating his own party and proposed his own PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] "to rule and guide." S. Shakhray had turned the ministry entrusted to him into a PRUA staff headquarters. You cannot deny him the ability to speak intelligently and significantly in the provinces, supposedly on behalf of Yeltsin or Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, and get his own people elected as deputies in the localities. Recently he received another "trump card" from the prime minister: Credits for Northern deliveries will go through the PRUA. But observers find that S. Shakhray is "too frisky." Does he want to turn the PRUA into the CPSU? But there is still the law on de-party-ization held in reserve. The necessary people also recall the strong hostility the deputy prime minister felt for Viktor Polyanichko, who was still alive at the time. And they also note S. Shakhray's desire to play on the disagreements between the president and the prime minister. Observers are inclined to think that eventually he will have to choose between the two gentlemen. Ultimately, even Yu. Luzhkov--that successful member of the nomenklatura, steeled by swimming in ice holes on the coldest of days, recently read with terror in an official communication: "...acting mayor of the city of Moscow Yu. M. Luzhkov." In the darkness of the political blind alley everyone tries to kick the "acting mayor" harder. "Why stick your neck out? Did you want to become president? Do you think that just because you have money you can be impudent! We will show you the presidency!" Yu. Luzhkov was denied access to the president's physical presence. V. Chernomyrdin is confidently attacking "the acting mayor." First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets, who also "placed his bets" both on the prime minister and on Yu. Luzhkov has begun to cautiously distance himself from the lover of the ice holes. And they continue to whisper to the president: Yu. Luzhkov and V. Pankratov, the chief of the Main Administration of Internal Affairs of Moscow, as before, are mourning the early demise of their close friend Otari Kvantrishvili. The president, they say, is downcast and taps his pencil on the desk. And in the Kremlin offices they are whispering: "Why does Luzhkov want to move several domestic troop divisions from Yerin's command to Pankratov's? To fight crime? Do not make me laugh, Ivan Ivanovich...indeed...", smiles are stretching from ear to ear, and even the excellent microphones cannot catch it. Spring had a favorable effect on the president of the Strategy Fund, G. Burbulis. Under the influence of the rays of the sun Gennadiy Eduardovich again felt like a strategist and a fighter. According to rumors, he calls V. Chernomyrdin "Viktor Boozevich" and Ye. Gaydar, in his own words, he has "crossed off his list for good," and he wants somehow to make B. Fedorov, a member of the State Duma and former finance minister of the Russian Federation, the leader of the younger generation of "democrats." Who needs G. Burbulis today, observers ask themselves; and they answer--S. Filatov. Under the influence of the warm spring weather ties between the radical democrat S. Filatov and the social democrat I. Rybkin have become closer. The speaker of the State Duma, for example, phones the leader of the president's administration: "OMON [Special Missions Militia Detachment] representatives are coming to us here at the Duma from various parts of the country and demanding that we adopt a law on the inadmissibility of using the OMON against the people." "But you have more important draft laws" comes the answer. "And that is right," answers the speaker. ...Sun, warmth, spring. Last year's leaves and illusions are burning. Green grass and new intrigues are ripening.
