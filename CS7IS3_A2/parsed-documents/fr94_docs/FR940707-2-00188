FR940707-2-00188 FR940707-2-00099 As discussed more fully below, options market maker short sale transactions unrelated to normal options market making activity ( e.g ., index arbitrage and risk arbitrage) are not exempt. Nonetheless, the rule provides that a member would not violate the short sale rule if it executed an order for the account of an options market maker with the good-faith belief that the order was in full compliance with the rule, even though a subsequent determination was made that the order was either not entitled to the exemption or was incorrectly marked ``long.'' 3. The Warrant Market Maker Exemption The rule also extends an exemption to registered warrant market makers, with restrictions similar to those imposed on qualified options market makers. To be eligible for this exemption, the warrant market maker must be registered as a market maker in the warrant and the short sale must be an ``exempt hedge transaction'' that results in a fully hedged position. The rule defines the term ``exempt hedge transaction'' as a short sale to hedge an existing offsetting warrant position or an offsetting warrant position that was created contemporaneous with the short sale. 24 24 The phrase contained in the proposed rule ``contemporaneous with the short sale'' is meant to include transactions occurring simultaneously as well as transactions occurring within the same brief period of time. Short sales unrelated to normal warrant market making activity ( e.g. , index arbitrage and risk arbitrage) would not be exempt. As with short sales executed on behalf of options market makers, a member who executes a short sale on behalf of a warrant market maker will not be deemed to violate the short sale rule if it executed the order with the good-faith belief that the order was in full compliance with the rule, even though a subsequent determination was made that the order was either not entitled to the exemption or was incorrectly marked ``long.'' 4. The Exemptions Mirroring Rule ␣␣␣ 10a&hyph;1 The rule also incorporates the exemptions in the Commission's short sale rule that are relevant to trading in Nasdaq. 25 In addition, the Commission recently proposed an amendment to Rule 10a&hyph;1 to codify an interpretation with respect to liquidating index arbitrage positions. 26 The NASD has requested that if approved by the Commission, it intends to conform its rule to the Commission's rule and will file the proposed rule change with the Commission. 27 25 Specifically, the rule exempts: (1) A broker-dealer from a sale that is for an account in which it has no interest and that is marked long; (2) Any sale by a market maker to offset odd-lot orders of customers; (3) Any sale by a market maker to liquidate a long position, which is less than a round lot, provided the sale does not change the dealer's position by more than one unit of trading (100 shares); (4) Certain short same arbitrage transactions, in special arbitrage accounts, by a person who owns another security or presently will be entitled to acquire an equivalent number of securities of the sale class as the securities sold (provided the sale, or purchase which the sale offsets, is made for the bona fide purpose of profiting from a current price difference between the security sold and the security owned) and that the right of acquisition was originally attached to the security or was issued to all holders of any class of securities of the issuer; (5) Transactions made as part of an international arbitrage opportunity, whereby the seller must have a bona fide purpose to profit from the price difference between a security on an international market outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. and a security listed as a Nasdaq National Market security (for the purposes of this section, a depository receipt ( e.g. , ADR) for a security shall be deemed the same as the security represented by the receipt); (6) Short sales by an underwriter or any member of the distribution syndicate in connection with the over-allotment of securities, or any lay-off sale by a person with a distribution of securities pursuant to a rights offering (17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;8) or a standby underwriting commitment; and (7) Liquidations of blocks acquired by a market maker acting in the capacity of a block positioner even if the block positioner does not have a net long position in the security if and to the extent that its net short position in such security is the subject of one or more offsetting positions created in the course of bona fide arbitrage, risk arbitrage, or bona fide hedge activities. 26 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30772 (June 3, 1992), 57 FR 26891 (June 16, 1992). 27 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31003 (Aug. 6, 1992), 57 FR 36421 (Aug. 13, 1992) (publication of the Commission's original notice of SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;92&hyph;12). III. Comments As indicated above, the Commission received a total of 397 comment letters on the NASD's proposed short sale bid-test, with 275 opposing approval of the rule change and 122 supporting approval. 28 In addition to amending the proposal several times, the NASD responded to issues raised by the commenters in a letter dated June 24, 1993. 29 28 A list of comment letters received in connection with the publication of the rule change is available for inspection in the Commission's Public Reference Room. 29 Letter from Richard Ketchum, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, NASD, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 24, 1993). Commenters in support of the proposed short sale bid-test are mostly issuers whose securities trade on Nasdaq. 30 Many of these issuers report that they have experienced short selling ``abuse'' and several commenters provide what they believe are specific examples of ``piling-on'' and manipulation. These commenters make four principal arguments in favor of the proposal: (1) The short sale rule is necessary to reduce intra-day volatility on Nasdaq; (2) the proposal will reduce market manipulation that threatens the integrity of the Nasdaq market; (3) short selling abuse undervalues stock prices; and (4) the proposed rule will provide more equal regulation of short selling between the exchange and Nasdaq markets. 30 The Commission received approximately 120 letters from issuers and issuer trade groups. Commenters opposing the rule change make three principal arguments that remain relevant after consideration of the NASD's amendments: (1) The NASD has failed to provide sufficient evidence of the need for a short sale rule or demonstrate the appropriateness of a bid-test; (2) the ``primary'' market maker qualification standards will have negative effects on both market makers and the Nasdaq market; and (3) the proposed rule is inconsistent with the requirements of the Act.
