The representatives of the government want the number of trade union members who are included in the team not to exceed 15 people, while the trade unions wish to participate in the dialogue with a team that includes 40 people. A psychological war has started in front of the government headquarters. The first demand voiced at Victoria Palace [government headquarters] is that the outside yard in front of the government building should be cleared, or the government will be compelled to resort to shield bearers. We protest such methods of intimidation, the more so since the bilateral dialogue has not even started yet, the communique we received from the organization committee of the Alfa Cartel National Trade Union Confederation says.
