Dressed in a white suit and looking very anxious, he did not congratulate the newly elected deputies on the start of their work -- a rare, even unique case in world practice of breaching the civilities of protocol. Instead, President Kravchuk conveyed a special message to the Supreme Council. The president demanded that they deal with him precisely in accordance with the law. Otherwise -- and Leonid Makarovich remains opposed to an early presidential election in June despite the lists of signatures of 100,000 supporters from various oblasts of Ukraine essential for his participation in the procedure -- as the message said, there could simply be "confrontation, with serious consequences putting peace in Ukraine at risk." Is it necessary to specify that the prepared documents demanded by Kravchuk -- a law on the status of the president and a new constitution -- do dot actually exist? This kind of crisis has a long history and indeed was one of the reasons for the premature relinquishment of deputies' seats. The kolkhoz chairmen, long-standing dissidents, party secretaries, and poets who declared Ukraine's independence on 1 December 1990 were able to do a lot, but they failed in the fundamental job of creating a rational legislative basis for the sovereign state. They hoped to be replaced by the professionals of the "state renaissance" stage, whose advent the president referred to several times -- liberal, market-oriented lawyers and jurists would arrive and parliament would at last be abuzz with the sound of intellectual labor. However, the election law, which again assigned the major role in nominating candidates to labor collectives rather than parties, led to a quite different work force in the Supreme Council -- a big contingent of pro-communist engineers and technical personnel. It was no wonder that Aleksandr Moroz, chairman of the Socialist Party of Ukraine Political Council (he is down to become speaker, but Moroz himself hopes to become president in June), should make clear promises at a May Day rally, as scarlet banners flapped in the breeze: "We must change the authorities in the state! We must adopt a law to ensure that the president is elected in the Supreme Council rather than by direct ballot!" Party discipline is a daunting thing, especially when one in five of the people's elected representatives is a Communist. Deputies were given a 1 July deadline to clarify their working relationship with the Supreme Council (the majority want to retain their posts and salaries at local level). If by 1 July the country sees the advent of socialism at working people' request, such job-sharing will become feasible. But for the time being everything is taking its own course. President Kravchuk has flown to Donetsk in the hope of winning round the miners. They once insisted on an early presidential election and consequently could do the same again. Many ministers, including the acting premier, have moved from the government benches in parliament to sit in the body of the hall as ordinary deputies. In a country where laws have an arbitrary interpretation, only one, unwritten, law is operating smoothly: The ladies and gentlemen are unfailingly turning themselves into comrades...
