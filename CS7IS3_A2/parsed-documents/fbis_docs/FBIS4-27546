A tight parliamentary schedule has made Hata's attendance at the two-day gathering from next Tuesday impossible, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) explained. Parliamentary Vice MITI Minister Tokunosuke Kaneko and Yoshihiro Sakamoto, director general of MITI's International Trade Policy Bureau, will fly to Paris instead, MITI said. This year's OECD meeting will address three major topics -- growth and employment, reinforcing multilateral trade systems and the OECD's role amid rapid international change, a MITI official said. Whether the chiefs of the Foreign Ministry and the Economic Planning Agency will attend the conference has yet to be decided, the official said.
