FR941121-0-00097 FR941121-0-00011 In this Order the Commission takes four steps to implement both the broad goal of the Budget Act and the more narrowly focused requirements generated by its August 9, 1994, transition deadline. First, the Order determines which reclassified services are ``substantially similar'' to existing common carrier services in order to implement the Budget Act requirement that such services be subject to ``comparable'' regulation. Second, the Order revises part 90 and part 22 technical and operational rules governing those services to ensure that the rules are, indeed, ``comparable.'' Third, to effectuate the broad congressional goal of ensuring that competition shapes the development of the CMRS market, the Order adopts rules that cap at 45 MHz the total amount of combined broadband personal communications services (PCS), cellular, and Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) spectrum in which an entity may have an attributable interest in any geographic area. Fourth, to carry out Budget Act requirements concerning the licensing of CMRS services, the Order adopts uniform rules for licensing CMRS services, including reclassified services. The Commission is also modifying its licensing rules for part 22 CMRS and part 90 commercial services, where appropriate, to adopt filing windows for the filing of competing initial applications and conclude that competitive bidding procedures should be used to select from among mutually exclusive applications. Moreover, as the Further Notice tentatively concluded the Commission is taking the additional step of adopting a single, uniform application form for use by all CMRS and PMRS applicants in all terrestrial mobile services. Summarized in the following section are the principal decisions the Commission is adopting in connection with each of the four actions taken in this Order. Before doing so, it is important to note that while all the rules adopted in this Order become effective on January 2, 1995, some of those rules do not apply immediately to the reclassified CMRS entities that will continue to be treated as private carriers under the grandfathering provisions of the Budget Act. Specifically, until the grandfathered period ends on August 9, 1996, with regard to existing licensees, such entities will not be subject to technical, operational, or licensing rule changes made in this Order that apply exclusively to CMRS. Instead, they will be subject to regulation as private carriers under part 90 of our rules. Grandfathered carriers should note, however, that they are governed by modifications to rules the Commission makes in this Order that are applicable to private carriers. 1. Substantially Similar Services This Order establishes the framework for implementing the mandate of the Budget Act that the Commission revise its rules to the extent necessary and practical to ensure that providers of reclassified CMRS services are subjected to technical and operational rules comparable to those that apply to providers of substantially similar common carrier services. To that end, the Commission's initial task was to identify reclassified CMRS services that are ``substantially similar'' to common carrier services.
