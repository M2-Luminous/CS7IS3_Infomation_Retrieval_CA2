In a press release issued by the Iraqi UN mission yesterday, Iraq hoped that the next review of the embargo will reflect the progress that has taken place thanks to the cooperation between Iraq and the Special Committee and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], rather than the political purposes of some UN Security Council member states. The Iraqi press release noted that everyone has come to realize that some UN Security Council member states, particularly the United States and Britain, are trying to impose their political views on the UN Security Council's decision during the next review of the embargo. The press release hopes again that the review scheduled for early next week will reflect the international community's real desire for lifting the blockade in light of the progress that has been made during recent months. The statement says that if the blockade is lifted, this will prove that the positive steps and success that have taken place have had a positive effect on the UN Security Council's decision, especially after the Special Commission and the IAEA have considered Iraq's acceptance of Resolution 715 on 26 November 1993 a major step which has resulted in removing the remaining obstacle before Iraq's compliance with its obligations in accordance with Part C of Resolution 687. The Iraqi mission's press release explained that the continued embargo will not serve the credibility of the United Nations, as the only result of continuing the embargo will be continued suffering by the Iraqi people. Recent statistics have shown that 400,000 Iraqi citizens, including 140,000 children under five, have died since the embargo was imposed, and which resulted in the scarcity of food and health supplies.
