For over four years, Germany has had special rules applicable to goods that can serve both a civilian and military purpose (dual use). "Now is the time to adopt a uniform Europewide control system," wrote Necker in a letter to Federal Industry Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) [Free Democratic Party]. The Federal Government should display a readiness to reach compromises on a European scale and abandon its "attitude of isolation" that even made the adoption of the special rules difficult. Necker called for uniform controls within the European Union [EU] and the abolition of internal EU controls that collide with the single-market principle. The practice of issuing permits must also be brought into line with this principle, he said. Necker was replying to a letter he received from Rexrodt at the beginning of March in which the FDP politician had suggested changes to German subsidiary regulations. Rexrodt had said that goods that do not appear on a control list and are destined for use in conventional armaments might be made exportable to only a small nucleus of countries. The same applies to services and the transfer of sensitive knowledge. Necker described these proposals as "merely the first step." On the other hand, Rexrodt's announcement that there should be greater clarity and faster decisions concerning the issue of export permits for military goods has been welcomed by industry. During the administrative removal of obstacles, regaining German competitiveness and abolition of one-sided disadvantages to competition must be the primary goal, Rexrodt wrote.
