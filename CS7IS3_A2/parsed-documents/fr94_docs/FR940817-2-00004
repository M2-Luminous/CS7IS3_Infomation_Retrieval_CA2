FR940817-2-00004 FR940817-2-00002 This Notice is being published as required by Section (e)(12) of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(12)), as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Act of 1988 (Public Law 100&hyph;503). The following information is provided as required by paragraph (b)(3) of Appendix I to Office of Management and Budget Circular A&hyph;130, dated July 2, 1993. 1. Participating agencies: The recipient agency is USPS. The source agency is USDA. 2. Beginning and ending dates: The matching program will begin in November 1994 and continue in effect no longer than 18 months (April 30, 1996). If within three months of that date, the Data Integrity Boards of both USDA and the USPS find that the matching program can be conducted without change and both USDA and the USPS certify that the matching program has been conducted in compliance with the matching agreement, the matching program may be extended for one additional year. 3. Purpose of the match: In addition to providing information to assist in collecting food stamp recipient delinquent debts, the names of USPS employees identified through this matching program will be removed from lists of delinquent debts being referred to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for collection from Federal income tax refunds. This action is required to conform to an IRS requirement for the tax offset program. (A description of the Federal income tax refund offset program for the Food Stamp Program is contained in a General Notice dated August 20, 1991 at 56 FR 41325&hyph;31.) 4. Description of the match: The subject matching program will involve several steps. USDA will provide USPS a magnetic computer tape of claims submitted by State agencies participating in the Federal tax offset program. By computer, USPS will compare that information with its payroll file, establishing matched individuals on the basis of Social Security Numbers (SSN's). For each matched individual, the USPS will provide to USDA the individual's name, SSN, home address, date of birth, work location, and employee type (permanent or temporary). USDA will prepare lists of matched individuals according to the State agencies which established the claim for the overissued benefits and will distribute the State lists accordingly. The respective State agencies will verify identity and debtor status of the matched individuals by manually comparing those list of matched individuals to their records on the debts, by conducting independent inquiries when necessary to resolve questionable identities, and by reviewing the records of payments to determine whether or not the debt is still delinquent. In addition to verifying debtor identity and the status of the debt, prior to USDA taking any steps to effect involuntary offset of USPS employee salaries, State agencies will provide debtors with a 30-day written notice stating the amount of the debt and that the debtor may repay it voluntarily by entering into a written agreement with the State agency. Debts not repaid voluntarily would be referred to USDA for involuntary salary offset. Prior to such action, debtors would be notified and offered an opportunity for a hearing on the debt, including the right to copy documentation relating to the debt. 5. Legal authorities: This matching program will be conducted under the following authorities: (a) The Debt Collection Act of 1982 (5 U.S.C. 5514), which gives authority to Federal agencies to offset the salaries of Federal and USPS employees who are delinquent on debts owed to the Federal government; (b) Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations, 5 CFR part 550, subpart K (Collection by Offset from Indebted Government Employees), §§550.1101&hyph;1108, which set the standards for Federal agency rules implementing the Debt Collection Act; (c) USDA regulations at 7 CFR part 3, subpart C, which implement 5 U.S.C. 5514 and OPM regulations, and which authorize USDA agencies to issue regulations governing debt collection by salary offset (7 CFR 3.68); and (d) Section 13941 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66), which amended sections 11(e) (8) and 13 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(8), 2022, to authorize the Federal salary offset program for the Food Stamp Program. 6. Categories of individuals involved: Two groups of individuals will be involved with this matching program. One group is USPS employees. The other is individuals who have participated in the Food Stamp Program but are no longer participating, and who owe delinquent debts for overissued food stamp benefits for which they are not making repayments. This group is further defined in that the individuals owe only delinquent debts resulting from inadvertent household errors and intentional Program violations. Individuals owing claims due to State agency administrative errors will be excluded (7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(8)(C)). 7. Record systems used: (a) USPS will use records from its Privacy Act system of records ``Finance Records_Payroll System, USPS 050.020,'' containing payroll records for approximately 700,000 current employees. Disclosure will be made pursuant to routine use Number 24 of USPS 050.020, (57 FR 57515, dated December 4, 1992). (b) USDA will use records from its Privacy Act system of records ``Claims Against Food Stamp Recipients_USDA/FNS_3,'' containing approximately 230,000 records. Disclosure will be made pursuant to routine use Number 4 of record system USDA/FNS_3, (58 FR 48633, dated September 17, 1993). 8. Agency contact: Inquiries about this matching program should be directed to James I. Porter, Supervisor, Issuance and Accountability Section, State Administration Branch, Program Accountability Division, Food Stamp Program, FNS, USDA, 3101 Park Center Drive, Room 905, Alexandria, Virginia 22302, telephone (703) 305&hyph;2385.
