During his stay, President Niyazov visited Esfahan, [name indistinct], Shiraz, and [name indistinct] island and became closely acquainted with Iran's economic opportunities and issues. Undoubtedly, the two countries' economic approach and resources can improve economic exchanges and cooperation between them. The signing of some 20 cooperation agreements between Iran and Turkmenistan is very important for their bilateral relations. With these agreements we will try to quickly remove the effects of the 70-year long separation. In view of this, the protocol the two countries signed on cooperation in the supply of oil and natural gas, the establishment of sea and air links, and exchanges of agricultural products, commodities, and visitors is an important document. The fact that Iran and Turkmenistan share a common border gives us an opportunity to intensify our economic and cultural interaction. The common historic and cultural ties between the two sides may further promote their relations. Meanwhile, Iran is a bridge between Turkmenistan and the other republics in Central Asia and with the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. Considering the efforts of several Western countries following the USSR's collapse to impose their economic policies on the republics of Central Asia, including Turkmenistan, the improvement of those republics' relations with the regional countries, particularly the Islamic Republic of Iran, will be in their interest, for it will result in closer economic relations in which expansionist objectives have no place. Turkmenistan has rich oil and natural gas resources. In view of that, it could have a special place among the republics in Central Asia. As for culture, Turkmenistan has been separated from its cultural roots as an Islamic country for more than 70 years but it has prepared the necessary conditions to return to its true nature and foundations. The establishment of a network of cultural relations and channels between Iran and Turkmenistan will be one of the first steps the two countries will take in the future. The protocol between the two countries also calls for exchanges of students and experts, the establishment of libraries, book fairs, and cultural contacts, all of which indicates that Tehran and Ashgabat are determined to strengthen their relations. It must be recalled that Turkmenistan became a member of the Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO] and other bodies established by the littoral countries in the Caspian Sea region after the USSR collapsed. As stressed by the members of those organizations, participation in their activities, particularly in economic activities, is very important. Turkmenistan's opportunity to export its natural gas to foreign countries through Iran will play an important role in its effort to improve its economy. Meanwhile, the linking of Turkmenistan's railway system with those of Iran will enable that republic to reach Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Turkey; and that will give it an opportunity to reach the regional and international markets. Undoubtedly, the establishment of links with the region and the other parts of the world will not only serve Turkmenistan's own interests but also promote cooperation for economic development among the regional countries.
