FR940928-1-00049 FR940928-1-00013 For the reasons set forth in the preamble, part 430 of chapter II of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, is proposed to be amended as set forth below. PART 430_ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS 1. The authority citation for Part 430 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 6291&hyph;6309. 2. Section 430.2 is proposed to be amended by adding definitions for ``Colored Fluorescent Lamp,'' ``Colored Incandescent Lamp,'' and Rough or Vibration Service Exemption'' in alphabetical order to read as follows: §430.2 Definitions. * * * * * Colored Fluorescent Lamp means a lamp designed and designated with a CRI less than 30, as determined according to the method given in CIE Publication 13.2 (as incorporated by reference in 10 CFR 430.22) or which has a lamp correlated color temperature either below 2500 ○K or above 7,000 ○K. Colored Incandescent Lamp means a lamp designed and designated with a CRI less than 50, as determined according to the method given in CIE Publication 13.2 (as incorporated by reference in 10 CFR 430.22) or which has a lamp correlated color temperature either below 2500 ○K or above 7,000 ○K. * * * * * Rough or Vibration Service Incandescent Reflector Lamp means either an incandescent lamp in which a C&hyph;17 or C&hyph;22 filament is mounted with no less than six supports not including the lead wires or an incandescent lamp which meets the requirements of the vibration test in Appendix R(4.3.4) to Subpart B of Part 430. The filament configurations are depicted in chapter six of the Illuminating Engineering Society Lighting Handbook, 8th Edition, New York, 1993. Additionally, these lamps must be designated and marketed specifically for rough or vibration service applications. * * * * * 3. Section 430.25, paragraph (b) is amended by revising the first sentence to read as follows: §430.25 Laboratory Accreditation Program. * * * * * (b) The test procedures for general service fluorescent lamps, general service incandescent lamps, incandescent reflector lamps, medium base compact fluorescent lamps, and rough or vibration service incandescent reflector lamps as specified in Appendix R to this subpart, shall be conducted by test laboratories accredited by NVLAP or an accrediting organization recognized by NVLAP. *␣*␣* 8. Appendix R to Subpart B of Part 430_Uniform Test Method for Measuring Average Lamp Efficacy (LE) and Color Rendering Index (CRI) of General Service Fluorescent and Incandescent Lamps, Incandescent Reflector Lamps, and Medium Base Compact Fluorescent Lamps is amended by adding paragraphs 4.3.4, 4.3.4.1, 4.3.4.2, 4.3.4.3, 4.3.4.4, and 4.3.4.5 to read as follows: Appendix R to Subpart B of Part 430_Uniform Test Method for Measuring Average Lamp Efficacy (LE) and Color Rendering Index (CRI) of Electric Lamps * * * * * 4. Test Methods and Measurements * * * * * 4.3 Incandescent Reflector Lamps * * * * * 4.3.4␣The following vibration test shall be used to determine whether an incandescent lamp qualifies for a rough or vibration service application.
