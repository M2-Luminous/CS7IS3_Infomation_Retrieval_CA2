Kakizawa and Christopher also agreed over the phone that Pyongyang's decision to leave the IAEA and reject further inspections of its nuclear facilities is an internationally unacceptable act, the Foreign Ministry officials said. They agreed to maintain close contact on the problem. Pyongyang's action runs counter to international demands to abide by the nuclear safeguards arrangements and its refusal of further inspections may make matters worse, the officials quoted Kakizawa as saying. Christopher also voiced serious concern and indicated that the United States may review its stance in the UN discussions on the North Korean situation, the officials said. Kakizawa, who visited South Korea and China over the weekend, told Christopher he held frank discussions with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu on the North Korean nuclear dispute. The Foreign Minister said he agreed with the South Korean leaders to maintain bilateral coordination on the issue and to seek gradual sanctions against Pyongyang. China is also seriously concerned about the situation, Kakizawa said. He told Christopher that he urged China to continue to try to persuade North Korea to change its stance. The minister said he also asked China to play a positive role in the UN Security Council regarding the problem. Kakizawa quoted Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen as saying Beijing wants to play a constructive role in solving the North Korean nuclear dispute, the officials said. Christopher said he will closely watch China's moves. Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai quoted Kakizawa as telling Christopher that Japan intends to cope calmly with the North Korean nuclear problem. The top government spokesman also told a press conference that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will talk to U.S. President Bill Clinton over the telephone, possibly later Tuesday. The premier will seek to have a "frank" talk with Clinton, Kumagai said. Earlier in the day, Hata expressed regret over North Korea's reported decision. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a statement Tuesday morning, calling on North Korea to reconsider its decision. In Washington, the White House said Clinton talked with Russian President Boris Yeltsin over the phone about an international conference on North Korea. Yeltsin told South Korean President Kim in Moscow on June 2 that Russia, the U.S., Japan, China, the United Nations and the IAEA should join North and South Korea in holding a conference to defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis. At the UN in New York, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright told reporters the U.S. will submit a sanctions resolution to the UN Security Council in the next couple of days.
