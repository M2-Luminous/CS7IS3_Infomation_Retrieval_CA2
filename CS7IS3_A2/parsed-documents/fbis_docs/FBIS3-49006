The programme is to be financed by the nuclear safety fund of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the tenders are to be opened on March 4 in the presence of bidders. The first stage of improvements to make safe the four obsolete units of Soviet design was completed last week when the the oldest unit, which had been in service since 1974, was put back into operation. This unit had been closed in September 1991 on the recommendation of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Apart from the four units of 440 megawatts, the plant comprises two more modern units, each of 1,000 megawatts. The power station provides between 30 percent and 40 percent of energy used in Bulgaria.
