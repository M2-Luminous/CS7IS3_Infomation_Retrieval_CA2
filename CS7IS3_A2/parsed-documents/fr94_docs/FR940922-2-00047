Questar Pipeline Company [Docket No. CP94&hyph;765&hyph;000] Take notice that on September 9, 1994, Questar Pipeline Company (Questar), 79 South State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;765&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act requesting authority to construct and operate certain replacement natural gas facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Questar proposes to replace a 26.4-mile segment of its 10-inch Main Line No. 68, located in Rio Blanco and Garfield Counties, Colorado, with 14-inch pipeline. Questar states that the deteriorated condition of the 26.4-mile segment requires that it be replaced. Questar asserts that, due to constraints in other portions of its transmission system, there will be no significant increase in transmission-system capacity as a result of replacing the existing 26.4 miles of 10-inch pipeline with 14-inch pipeline. The estimated cost of the proposed construction is $5,500,000 and the estimated cost to retire in place the 26.4 miles of 10-inch pipeline is $150,000.
