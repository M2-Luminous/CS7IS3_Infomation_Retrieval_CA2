Cheng Weigao said: In rural work, we have many tasks to perform. We must persist in giving overall consideration to building well-off rural areas. Most of Hebei's population is in the rural areas. Only by making peasants well-off on schedule can we have hopes and guarantee for making the people across the province become well-off. Building well-off rural areas is a complete system of targets and tasks. If we do a good job in grasping the building of well-off rural areas, we will be able to grasp the key point of the entire rural work and to fully boost the enthusiasm of the masses of peasants. Cheng Weigao said: The building of well-off rural areas is a huge project. We must give prominence to the key points and carry it out in an all-round manner. The key points are: First, we should actively develop the high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient farming; second, actively develop township enterprises; and third, do a good job in family planning work. Only by grasping these three tasks well can we have guarantee for realizing the objective of making the rural areas well-off. To accelerate the building of well-off rural areas across the province, we must strive to make places with favorable conditions to become well-off ahead of other places. This is an issue stressed in Cheng Weigao's speech. He said: Things usually develop unevenly. It is impossible to make all the rural areas well-off simultaneously. We should help those places with good conditions accelerate development so that they can take the lead in making breakthroughs in this aspect and use their experience to guide the work of the entire area in an effort to attain the final goal of common prosperity. Cheng Weigao stressed: To realize the goal of becoming well-off, we must establish incentive mechanism among county, township, and village cadres. County-level leading members must not be arbitrarily transferred in principle so as to keep them relatively stable. In the course of building well-off rural areas, those who make outstanding achievements should be awarded, those who basically fulfill the target should be retained for continued use, and those who fail to fulfill the target should be demoted. All localities may study and decide the incentive and restraint mechanisms of the township and village levels on their own. In short, through the establishment of incentive mechanism at all levels, we may form a strong motivation of making leading cadres work hard and enabling them to realistically concentrate their energy on making the rural areas well-off. Ye Liansong also offered ideas at the conference on regarding the work of making the rural areas well-off as the overall task of the rural work and on striving to create a new situation in making the rural areas well-off. He called on all localities to realize the objective of making the rural areas well-off as an overall task in building an economically strong province and to work out plans carefully. Ye Liansong said: Building well-off rural areas is very important in the course of effecting a sustained, rapid, and sound development in the national economy. Party committees and governments at all levels must fully understand this point. In making the rural areas well-off, we should consider increasing the income of peasants as the nucleus, accelerating the development of commodity economy in the rural areas, and in doing specific work, improving thinking, giving different guidance according to the merit of each case, carrying out the work in an all-round manner, acting in line with the outlines of the Hebei Provincial plan on building well-off rural areas, and formulating development strategy in line with local advantages. Places along Bohai Bay, railway lines, and Beijing and Tianjin Municipalities should expand opening up and the development strength in the rural areas and actively develop suburban town economy and export-oriented economy; flatlands should strengthen the development and use of agricultural resources and actively develop high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient farming; the mountainous areas and upland areas have comparatively poor natural conditions, therefore, they should place the emphasis on forestry, fruit industry, animal husbandry, mining industry, and processing industry. Ye Liansong stressed at the end of his speech: To strengthen leadership and to do a good job in building well-off rural areas, we must first attend to planning; second, progress; third, work evaluation; and fourth, consolidation of work achievements. If we grasp these four aspects of work well, we will have a guarantee for realizing the objective of becoming well-off throughout the province by 2000.
