Ciller also stated that there have been no hints or requests from the chief of the general staff regarding his term in office. Ciller's statement on the issue is as follows: During recent days, various interpretations and reports concerning General Dogan Gures' term in office have appeared in the media. The polemics concerning the issue continue in certain circles. The power to make a decision on the chief of the general staff's term in office falls under the jurisdiction of the political authority. Nothing can be as natural as my considering an alternative arrangement or discussing the issue with my close colleagues. It is very wrong to interpret my contacts regarding this issue and my request that the issue be kept within a close circle as an intention to keep the issue secret from the government and the public. The main aim of these meetings was to conduct preliminary work to determine whether the conditions for extending Mr. Gures' term in office can be implemented. We did not find it necessary to inform Gen. Gures or anybody else. During these days, when we have accomplished so much in the fight against terrorism, our government, determined to solve this issue, is serving effectively and successfully with a trustworthy cadre, together with other commanders. Of course, eradicating terrorism takes time. Meanwhile, political and military developments in the region and the world exacerbate the current ambiguity and the risks originating from it. Under these conditions, we may consider it favorable and necessary for the country's interests to retain the successful command team on duty in its present form. However, the possibility of this arrangement having a negative impact on the hierarchal structure of the Turkish Armed Forces is an important consideration. With this in mind, our government, while affirming its trust in the top echelons within the traditional structure of the Turkish Armed Forces, also fully trusts all levels of command, including those commanders who will have to assume the high-level positions when the time comes. The term democratization package I refer to in my contacts is an expression always used during my exchange of views on national security with Gen. Gures. Our great nation is fully aware of the respect Gen. Gures and the Turkish Armed Forces under his command have for democracy and its institutions. I would like to stress that absolutely no requests or hints have reached us from Gen. Gures regarding his term in office. Furthermore, we are aware that he is not predisposed in this regard; it is we who raised the issue. Gen. Gures' statements to the press are in the spirit of the Turkish Armed Forces' tradition of having no personal desires for office. In view of all these realities, nobody will benefit from statements and interpretations that give way to speculation or polemics.
