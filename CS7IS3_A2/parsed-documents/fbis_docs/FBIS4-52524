Three topics will be raised on the agenda of this 16 May session. The National Assembly will hear the announcement on the outgoing and incoming representatives, debate and adopt the 1994-95 socioeconomic restoration plan and the press system bill, and approve the appointment of Sin Sen and Kieng Vang as the state secretaries of Interior. Looking at the three topics, one can see that this is the third time that the announcement on the outgoing and incoming representatives has been raised on the agenda. It was this topic that caused a deadlock in the previous two sessions (held on 5 and 27 April). This matter has caused the National Assembly to be criticized by the public and those who have been observing the law enforcement and the implementation of the half-baked democracy in Cambodia. The replacement of these unqualified representatives has led to the conflict between personal opinions and legal aspects because a number of representatives from the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party have refused to accept two candidates from the Cambodian People's Party [CPP], namely Prince Kromkhun Chakkrapong and Mr. Sin Song. According to a report from the National Assembly's office, 11 members of the assembly's Standing Committee have approved the agenda on the new representatives, but one Standing Committee member has rejected it. Some optimists think that this session will be successful because they believe that the FUNCINPEC and CPP will reach a compromise so that the two representatives from the CPP can get their seats in the National Assembly. Howevere, there are also some pessimists on this matter. A high-ranking National Assembly member has revealed that Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the National Assembly, has strived to reach a compromise with the FUNCINPEC to draw its support for his men. He will also seek the support from other assembly members to get the approval for this agenda. [passage omitted]
