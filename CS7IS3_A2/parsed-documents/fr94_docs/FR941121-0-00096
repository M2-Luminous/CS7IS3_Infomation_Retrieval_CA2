FR941121-0-00096 FR941121-0-00011 Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. section 604, a final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared and is presented below. It is available for public viewing as part of the full text of the decision, which may be obtained from the Commission or its copy contractor. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. section 603, an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) was incorporated into the Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making in GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252. Written comments on the proposals in the Further Notice, including the IRFA, were requested. A. Need for and Purpose of Rules This rule making proceeding was initiated to implement Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. The policies adopted herein will carry out Congressional intent to establish a consistent regulatory framework for all commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers. Specifically, this Order ensures that CMRS providers who compete with one another will be subject to comparable technical, operational, and licensing rules. B. Issues Raised by the Public in Response to the Initial Analysis No comments were submitted specifically in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. C. Significant Alternatives Considered The Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making in this proceeding offered numerous proposals. The commenters supported the major tenets of the proposed changes, and some commenters suggested changes to some of the Commission's proposals. The regulatory burdens we have retained for all CMRS licenses, including small entities, are necessary to carry out our duties under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. For example, we have extended section 309 notice and comment procedures to all CMRS applicants. We also minimized regulatory burdens, where possible, for all CMRS licensees. For example, we adopt a unitary application form for all mobile services applicants and eliminate most end user eligibility requirements and restrictions on permissible uses of CMRS systems. In addition, our proposal to impose a cap on the amount of CMRS spectrum that licensees may aggregate in a given geographic area was discussed by many commenters. We conclude that the spectrum cap as proposed should not be adopted but, rather, that a more specific cap on aggregation of PCS, cellular and SMR spectrum should be adopted. A copy of the Report and Order shall be sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. Synopsis of the Third Report and Order Last year, in the Budget Act, Congress created the CMRS regulatory classification and mandated that similar commercial mobile radio services be accorded similar regulatory treatment under the Commission's Rules. The broad goal of this action is to ensure that economic forces_not disparate regulatory burdens_shape the development of the CMRS marketplace. The Budget Act directs the Commission to take certain steps toward that goal not later than August 9, 1994. These steps include revising our rules to ensure the services reclassified as CMRS by the Budget Act are ``subjected to technical [and operational] requirements that are comparable to the technical requirements that apply to licensees that are providers of substantially similar common carrier services.'' The Commission also must adopt rules for licensing CMRS, including reclassified services, pursuant to the radio common carrier licensing provisions of the Act. Finally, the Budget Act mandates that the Commission take appropriate steps to ensure an orderly transition to the new CMRS regulatory structure. On April 20, 1994, the Commission adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Further Notice) 59 FR 28042 (May 31, 1994) to address pending issues relating to the implementation of the statute. In particular, the Commission sought to address the impact of the amended statute on our technical, operational, and licensing rules for all mobile services, and particularly on the rules affecting those Part 90 services that were reclassified as CMRS by the CMRS Second Report and Order, 59 FR 18493 (April 19, 1994). As required by section 6002(d)(3) of the Budget Act, the Commission proposed to amend these rules to the extent necessary to ensure that competing mobile services would be subject to comparable regulatory requirements, and that inconsistencies in our regulation of substantially similar services would be eliminated to the extent practical. The Further Notice indicated that the Commission would act on its proposals not later than the August 9, 1994, deadline established by Congress for adoption of rules implementing the statute. On May 19, 1994, the Commission revised the Further Notice on its own motion to seek comment on the additional issue of whether the amount of spectrum that CMRS licensees may aggregate in a given geographic area should be limited. The Commission received 61 comments and 70 reply comments in response to the Further Notice.
