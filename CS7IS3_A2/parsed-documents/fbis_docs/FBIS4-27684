In the morning's plenary session, the National Assembly continued to discuss the revised draft law on the organization of the People's Councils and People's Committees under the direction of National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh. The National Assembly discussed new issues related to the law. Some deputies suggested that the law be called the Bill on Amending and Supplementing -- not the Law on Revision of -- Some Articles of the Law on Organization of the People's Councils and People's Committees. They also suggested that only a few articles required amendment. Other deputies urged that the National Assembly hold back the law for a while and wait for the upcoming party Central Committee Plenum where new measures will be set to resolve various pressing issues related to the activities of the People's Councils and People's Committees. Many deputies said a vertical-type administrative system should not be applied to the management of the People's Council. Rather, the National Assembly Standing Committee and the government should formulate concrete regulations on coordination between echelons of the People's Councils. Other deputies supported this idea, but asked who will take up the responsibility of approving the composition of the People's Council Standing Committee and who will be authorized to determine the wage and retirement systems of members of the People's Councils and so forth. Some deputies said the chairmen of People's Committees should also be members of the People's Councils, with the exemptions given in specific essential cases. Many deputies suggested that it is necessary to set up the People's Council Offices in provinces and cities and that many localities have already done so. Other deputies suggested that among other specialized teams a scientific-technological and environmental team be set up in the People's Council, and that the environmental protection task be added to the duties of the People's Councils. Many deputies suggested that a sanctions system be applied so that the People's Councils and the councillors may be able to settle letters of complaint and denunciations lodged by the voters. Some other deputies have asked whether we should consider the removal of councillors at the regular People's Councils meetings or to solicit the views of voters on this matter, especially when more than 50 percent and not two-thirds of People's Council members are decided on the removal of a people's councillor. Many deputies suggested that the People's Councils and councillors be charged with the additional task of opposing corruption and smuggling. The National Assembly will continue its work this afternoon at the conference hall.
