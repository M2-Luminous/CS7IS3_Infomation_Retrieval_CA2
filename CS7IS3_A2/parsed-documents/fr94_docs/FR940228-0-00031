FR940228-0-00031 FR940228-0-00004 9 CFR Part 95 [Docket No. 92&hyph;135&hyph;2] Importation of Hoofs AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: We are amending the animal byproduct importation regulations to allow hoofs that have been disinfected in their country of origin to be imported into the United States without further processing. Currently, certain hoofs imported into the United States must be consigned from the port of first arrival to an approved establishment having facilities for their disinfection. We have determined, however, that hoofs that have been adequately disinfected in their country of origin may be imported into the United States without risk of introducing disease. This change in the regulations will give importers of hoofs that require disinfection a choice between importing disinfected hoofs and importing unprocessed hoofs for disinfection in the United States. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 15, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. John H. Gray, Senior Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Products Staff, National Center for Import-Export, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 756, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;7885. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The regulations in 9 CFR part 95 (referred to below as ``the regulations'') contain restrictions on the importation into the United States of certain animal byproducts and hay and straw in order to prevent the introduction of certain animal diseases. Among the regulated animal byproducts are animal hoofs, which, along with bones and horns, may be imported subject to the restrictions contained in §§95.11 and 95.12. On July 13, 1993, we published in the Federal Register (58 FR 37669&hyph;37670, Docket No. 92&hyph;135&hyph;1) a proposal to amend the regulations to allow hoofs that have been disinfected in their country of origin, using one of five approved disinfection methods specified in the proposed rule, to be imported into the United States without additional treatment. We proposed to require that the hoofs be accompanied by a certificate issued by the national government of the country of origin and signed by an official veterinary inspector of that country stating that the hoofs have been disinfected and describing the manner in which the disinfection was accomplished. We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending September 13, 1993. We received one comment by that date, from a veterinary medical association. The comment fully supported our proposed rule.
