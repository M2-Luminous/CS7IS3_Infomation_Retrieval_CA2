(4)"] [Excerpts] In the summer of 1992, the German military offered four ships to Lithuania's national defense for half price. Shortly thereafter, on 30 October, a commission of Lithuanian experts arrived in Peenemunde at the invitation of the German Defense Ministry to examine those ships and report back with their conclusions to Commander E. Nazelskis, first deputy national defense minister. The experts found those three missile ships, as well as one torpedo detector, well preserved and in a good technical state. Germany was ready to transfer spare parts and equipment for the ships to our state. True, the Germans warned our fellow countrymen that they would do this only after the vessels' partial demilitarization, that is, after removing all outwardly visible armaments. Lithuania had to cover these expenses from its own pocket by paying 30,000 German marks [DM] for each ship, or slightly less if they sent a group of eight or 10 people for assistance. However, to acquire all of those ships, as experts J. Alsauskas and V. Mockus indicated, the Lithuanian Government had to send a document to its German counterpart whereby the transfer of those ships would be gratis and our government officials would pledge to use them only for coastal defense and not sell or transfer them to a third party. The Germans proposed that we take delivery of all the ships by the end of 1992. Back on 19 November, [former] Defense Minister A. Butkevicius sent a letter to Lithuanian leaders stating that the Lithuanian Government must assign DM90,000 for dismantling the three missile ships. Sending a letter to German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, former Prime Minister A. Abisala agreed with the terms of the transfer and asked the German Defense Ministry to act as a mediator in conducting the ships' demilitarization at a German shipyard. According to unconfirmed information received from officials, the government transferred DM90,000 to the National Defense Ministry [KAM]. However, neither last year, as the Germans had wished, nor as of this very day have the ships donated by the German Defense Ministry reached the coast of Lithuania, while military specialists in neighboring Latvia took delivery of six ships donated by Germany. Why did the leaders of Lithuania's national defense refuse the ships donated to them for half price? Why did they at the same time pay 417 million rubles in cash to V. Laurinavicius, president of the "Selma" association in Kaunas, for two ships received from the Russian Baltic Fleet? Some sources maintain that it was more important to the former KAM and government leaders to "launder" millions from the state's pocket to "Selma," because the Baltic Fleet command did not want the German ships to reach Lithuania. The interests of "Selma," headed by a three-time convicted person, and its supporters were more significant to the KAM leaders for some reason. [passage omitted] When the ships were sailed from Kaliningrad to the wharf in Klaipeda, V. Mockus, a senior officer of the Naval Department at the Armed Forces Staff, noted in his official report to the chief of staff that the Baltic Fleet frigates bought through "Selma" had arrived without any spare parts. Nor were there any secret technical documentation, inventory, fuel, lubricants, facilities for emergency rescue, missiles on one frigate, and so on. According to the preliminary agreement with the Baltic Fleet command, all this was to be nowhere else but on the ships sold to the Lithuanian National Defense Ministry. In the opinion of Senior Officer V. Mockus, it is practically impossible to use the ships without all these facilities and armaments. The pumps had disappeared from the ships back in Liepaja, and the water removal equipment had been taken away by the Russians. As the specialists have noted, some vital valves and fire faucets are rusted, they do not turn and are hopelessly outdated. Hundreds of such flaws have been found on the purchased ships. The KAM leadership of that time was repeatedly informed about all this disorder. They also knew what items had failed to reach Lithuania under the purchase agreement with the Russian Baltic Fleet. After RESPUBLIKA had published the first facts about the former KAM deals with the Kaunas association "Selma," the ministry began an official investigation. As Minister L. Linkevicius has told journalists, it should help establish the guilty parties and assess their actions. The new minister may not know, however, that some direct offenders in this criminal story -- former leaders of the ministry and its departments -- are acting behind the minister's back. They are forging documents and intimidating those ministry employees who refuse to claim that RESPUBLIKA is wrong. Undoubtedly, they will continue to prove that Minister A. Butkevicius, his deputy E. Nazelskis, his adviser I. Stankovicius, and C. Jezerskas are linked with the bosses of the Kaunas Mafia only by "business" relations. Prime Minister A. Slezevicius blessed the trip of all these officials abroad, where they will study and undergo training. After RESPUBLIKA had asked the prime minister whether such an approval of their studies abroad did not represent a "bonus," the premier replied: "Studying is a poor bonus." Prosecutor General A. Paulauskas holds a different opinion about the departure of these officers. He claims that they themselves should be interested in establishing the truth and untangling these complicated relations, rather than escaping to the West at this crucial moment. Yesterday afternoon, former Minister A. Butkevicius, who is back on leave from London, found my colleague R. Grineviciute and answered several questions. Mr. A. Butkevicius claimed that the Baltic Fleet leaders themselves had proposed "Selma" as a partner to them. The ex-minister maintained that he had not known anything about the former conviction of the firm's president, V. Laurinavicius, and had not been interested in his past. He said that the German ships had turned out to be not quite suitable because they did not have the necessary loading capacity, and so on. As is becoming clear today, the association "Selma" was exempt from taxes. Such a decision was adopted by the government headed by A. Abisala, who comes from Kaunas. Although A. Paulauskas had protested about such a government move, the decision was revoked neither by B. Lubys nor A. Slezevicius. Another thing is also surprising in this story. No one has actually unraveled it. Prosecutor General A. Paulauskas has agreed that a large group of investigators should work on this case, because the public must know the truth. However, as soon as a RESPUBLIKA reporter became curious about who had relieved "Selma" from taxes and whether the Prosecutor General's Office had issued a protest, R. Bimbiriene, deputy chief prosecutor of the Civilian Cases and General Authority Department, stated that she would not speak because she guarded state secrets carefully. It does not matter that the Prosecutor General himself did not see a big secret in the question of which of the former prime ministers had made illegal decisions. If it is convenient to them, officials may ignore the opinions and instructions of their chiefs. R. Bimbiriene has allegedly noticed that RESPUBLIKA is stepping up pressure on her. Well, this is how things are sometimes....
