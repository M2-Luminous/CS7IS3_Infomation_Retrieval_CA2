The substantial flow of direct foreign investment has injected new life into economic development in China. However, we must see that the pattern of the sources of direct foreign investment, which directly determines where investment goes in the Chinese economy, is not ideal, thereby adversely affecting Chinese economic development. This article offers a preliminary analysis of China's foreign investment incentives from a legal perspective. I. How the Pattern of Origins of Foreign Investment Affects Distribution The bulk of direct foreign investment in China comes from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. Little originates in Japan and United States and even less comes from developed nations in Western Europe. It should be noted that the imbalance in the origins of direct foreign investment undermines our effort to utilize foreign capital effectively and speed up economic development in a way that cannot be ignored. 1) Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are related to China's southeastern coastal provinces geographically and through consanguinity in myriad ways, which explains why investors in these places are so inclined to pour capital to China's southeastern coast, particularly the two provinces of Guangdong and Fujian, creating a striking geographical imbalance in the distribution of foreign investment. Furthermore, since there is a dire shortage of natural resources in China's southeastern coastal region, the restaurant, hotel, and other service industries naturally became the destinations of most of the investment dollars. According to statistics, the tertiary sector accounted for 54.96 percent of the total value of projects involving foreign capital that were approved in the period between 1979 and 1988. Within the tertiary sector itself, more foreign investment went into the building of hotels and recreational facilities and real estate than anything else, constituting 57.57 percent of all foreign investment in the tertiary sector. In other words, geographically foreign capital is over-concentrated in the southeast and industrially it is over-concentrated in nonproductive industries. It is only too obvious that this pattern of foreign investment hampers the full utilization of the abundant natural resources in the interior, the optimalization of the industrial structure, and the achievement of balanced economic development in China. 2) Most foreign investment projects are small projects. Take 1991 for instance. Projects with a price tag over $10 million each accounted for just 2 percent of the total value of foreign investment projects negotiated in that year; between $500,000 and $1 million, 24 percent; and under $500,000, 52 percent. The main cause of this phenomenon is the influx of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan capital financing small projects. With so many small projects, economies of scale do not come into play. 3) Most direct foreign investments come from Hong Kong and the bulk of them are destined for labor-intensive projects. Of all enterprises financed with foreign investment and approved in the past dozen years or so, an overwhelming majority of those in the primary and tertiary sectors were labor-intensive projects. In the secondary sector labor-intensive projects such as those in the light and textile industries also accounted for a substantial portion. These labor-intensive projects were technologically low-grade and few were at an internationally advanced level. According to statistics compiled by the departments concerned, only 660 projects were rated "technologically advanced" by late 1990, a mere 4.55 percent of all enterprises financed with foreign capital that opened for business in the period concerned. This militates against our drive to create an export-oriented economy and participate in international economic competition and cooperation. II. How Incentives in China's Foreign Investment Laws Impact Pattern of Origins of Such Investment The imbalance in the pattern of origins of foreign investment adversely affects the distribution of foreign investment by industry, thereby constraining the nation's economic development. While there are many factors behind such an imbalance, I think the law plays a major role in steering the flow of investment. The reason is that of the numerous factors shaping direct foreign investment, the legal factor is most critical. Direct foreign investment has been increasing steadily in recent years, which proves that incentives written into China's foreign investment legislation have been enormously effective. Yet they are precisely the reason why the pattern of origins of direct foreign investment in China has been so lopsided. 1) Tax incentives. Most tax incentives in China's foreign investment laws are contained in provisions regulating corporate income taxes. They include not only lower tax rates than those found in other developing nations or regions, but also longer tax abatement periods, something absent from other nations. Nevertheless, China's tax incentives do not tie in with the appropriate tax laws in the United States or Europe. All these countries take a compensation and exemption approach toward the issue of double taxation on foreign investment, which means that it is the government of the investment-originating nation, not the investor, which gets to enjoy foreign investment tax incentives. Therefore even though China has reached an agreement with some nations aimed at avoiding double taxation, China's tax incentives have only limited appeal to investors from the United States and Europe. In contrast, China's tax incentives, especially its array of liberally applicable tax exemptions and tax cuts, are tremendously appealing to capital in Macao, Taiwan, and, particularly, the free port of Hong Kong. Moreover, China's foreign investment legislation discriminates in favor of investors from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. Both Article 11 of the "State Council Regulations on Encouraging Investment by Taiwan Compatriots" and Article 11 of the "State Council Regulations on Encouraging Investment by Overseas Chinese and Compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao" stipulate explicitly that enterprises financed by compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are not required to pay import tariffs or the combined industrial and commercial tax on imported machinery, vehicles, and office equipment essential to the operations and production of their enterprises. Also exempt from import tariffs and the combined industrial and commercial tax are the articles of daily use and means of transportation imported for the personal consumption of compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan during the period of operations of their enterprises provided such imports are within a reasonable quantity. With the exception of products whose export is restricted, enterprises are allowed to export their output without paying export tariffs and the combined industrial and commercial tax. These incentives are not available to enterprises financed by other foreign investors. Not only are such practices inconsistent with international tax rules, but they also do nothing to improve the pattern of origins of direct foreign investment in China. 2) Non-tax incentives. China's foreign investment laws also confer more nontax incentives on Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan investors than their counterparts from elsewhere. About the methods of raising capital, for example, when an enterprise financed by a Hong Kong, Macao, or Taiwan investor applies for a loan from a financial institution on the mainland or overseas, it can "use its own assets and rights as collateral." In contrast, most Sino-foreign joint ventures are required to report to the State Administration of Exchange Control or one of its branches for the record when they want to borrow foreign exchange funds from a foreign bank. Furthermore, things are easier for Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan investors when it comes to entry/departure procedures. All of this facilitates the influx of investment from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. 3) China distinguishes among three kinds of enterprises involving foreign investment, namely Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures, and enterprises wholly owned by a foreign investor, and treats them differently, its incentives in such areas as taxation, methods of raising capital, and degree of market openness becoming progressively less generous as we go down the three kinds of enterprises. This arrangement is a magnet for Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan capital because as a form of investment, the joint venture is the right choice for most investors from those places who are small-time investors or who want to build small or medium-sized enterprises. In contrast, most investors from the United States and Europe are well-heeled multinational corporations which have a long investment history, which are technologically advanced, and which traditionally invest heavily overseas. For these corporations, setting up a wholly foreign-owned enterprise in China is better suited to their needs. The practice of favoring joint ventures helps attract capital from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan but works against the effort to woo investors in the United States and Europe. III. Measures To Improve the Pattern of Origins of Foreign Capital Laws adopted to encourage an inflow of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan capital into China are well-intentioned, but objectively the results have not been satisfactory. To improve the pattern of origins of direct foreign investment and hence eliminate their negative effects on the distribution of foreign investment, it is proposed that: 1) Enterprises financed by foreign investment should be regulated by a single set of rules. China distinguishes among three different kinds of enterprises financed by foreign investment and has adopted different legislation to regulate them separately. The idea is to encourage foreign investors to invest in China by setting up joint ventures. However, in recent years it is foreign-funded enterprises that have been growing the fastest. As enterprises financed by foreign investment mature and develop, the formulation of a single law for"enterprises financed by foreign investment" has become a top priority in foreign investment legislation in China. Moreover, no time should be wasted in preparing related legislation, such as an "Insurance Law," "Anti-Illegitimate Competition Law," and "Mortgage Law." 2) Considering the fact that Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan capital makes up an excessive share of all direct foreign investment and that most of it goes into small projects, China's investment incentives should bias in favor of large- and medium-sized projects. The larger an enterprise financed by foreign investment, the more extensive its area of related operations, the more advanced and scientific its methods of management, and the greater its overall social benefits. Thus, building more large- and medium-sized enterprises financed by foreign investment will accelerate the modernization of China's industry and is in line with the need for China to participate in global competition and cooperation. Accordingly, we must offer special incentives to large- and medium-sized enterprises financed by foreign capital, giving priority to their applications to ensure that production needs are met. Needless to say, to be effective, the policy of favoring large- and medium-sized enterprises must go hand in hand with the industrial incentive policy. 3) Open up the domestic market selectively, step by step. It is the large markets inside developing countries that mainly attract developed nations in Europe and the United States to invest in them. In this repect, China, with its vast territory and huge population has an overwhelming edge. In my opinion, we should target large- and medium-sized projects, technology-intensive projects, and projects in primary industries such as agriculture, energy, and transportation as we open up the domestic market. In view of the fact that China's price system has not been sorted out and the practice of underpricing certain primary products, including energy and raw materials, we should give enterprises financed by foreign capital more leeway in setting the prices of their products. In industries whose development the government is trying to promote, foreign enterprises should be allowed to charge higher prices than official prices.
