FBIS4-31232 "dreeu109_y_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-109 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Federal _O_Serbian, Montenegrin Press Notes _O_Serbian, Montenegrin Press Notes 94P20853A 94P20853A CSO [Editorial Report] The following items on developments in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were drawn from recent Serb and Montenegrin periodicals. Banks Having Liquidity Problems The 5 May issue of the Belgrade daily POLITIKA reported that 13 banks had negative balances in their "giro" (non-savings) accounts during the first few days of May. That banks are having problems with liquidity is nothing new, POLITIKA said, but up to now "only" five to seven banks operated in the red on any given day. Bankers are not concealing their lack of liquidity, the paper observed, adding that the National Bank of Yugoslavia [NBJ] had threatened to block Investbanka's giro account completely because of Investbanka's shortage of dinars if it did not sell the NBJ foreign currency. Investbanka settled its debt with the central bank and continued to work undisturbed, POLITIKA noted. The daily reported liquidity problems of the following banks: -- At Beobanka, the largest Serbian bank, deposits decreased by 20,000 dinars, and the bank did not have enough money on 4 May to conduct all of its transactions. A Beobanka official explained to POLITIKA that the money shortage is most likely due to the fact that salaries paid out by enterprises just before the l May holiday "had not yet returned to the money channels." -- Jugobanka also had problems with liquidity but covered its negative balance by selling foreign currency to the National Bank. -- The JIK bank had a negative balance for only one day. The bank's spokesperson said that the bank had enough cash to make all the payments to its customers but does not have enough money in the giro account for all its credit activities. -- "One of the most stable banks," the Vojvodjanska Bank, had a negative balance on 4 May. POLITIKA learned that this was due to the bank's payment of pensions. This resulted in the bank's halting the issuance of credits to businesses. -- The vice governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia maintained that the situation is not as bleak as it looks and that, of the 13 banks which had a negative balance on 4 May, three banks--Vojvodjanska, Panonska, and Novosadska--"accounted for 95 percent of the shortage." Belgrade Construction Firm Operating in Russia Miroslav Subotic, president of the Belgrade construction company Komgrap, said in an interview in the 20 April Belgrade daily VECERNJE NOVOSTI that his firm continues to work on building sites in Russia, where 600 of its engineers, technicians, and laborers are employed. He noted that one advantage of a construction company is that it can work under "someone else's name." Subotic revealed plans to sign such a contract under "someone else's name" for an additional 1,000 Yugoslav workers, pointing out that the firm enjoys a competitive advantage by already having construction sites and equipment worth "tens of thousands of dollars" in Russia. Subotic noted that as a result of the UN-imposed sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro more than $10 million due the firm for projects it had completed in England, Austria, Libya, Angola, and Russia have been frozen abroad. "We were able to recover some of the money with the help of Centrokop, which was given permission by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] to import foodstuffs." Irregularities in Podgorica Aluminum Combine A "Commission for Monitoring the Work Process," established by the workers' council of the Podgorica Aluminum Combine, has issued a report alleging "numerous irregularities" in one of the largest collectives in Montenegro. The 20 May issue of the Podgorica weekly MONITOR reported that the commission has established that about 10,000 metric tons of aluminum worth over $12 million are unaccounted for. The commission obtained this figure, MONITOR said, by comparing the total annual production of 38,000 tons claimed by the combine's management with data in the combine's annual balance sheet. The commission also determined that large quantitites of equipment and other inventory are missing. According to MONITOR "sources," the Aluminum Combine's general director, Danilo Vuksanovic, is awaiting appointment to another position, and "it is intended to conceal the entire issue from the public." The commission has turned over its findings to "relevant state authorities" for further investigation, MONITOR stated, adding that the commission had also found irregularities in the Podgorica firm's foreign currency business transactions and in the declared value of aluminum in the Zetatrans, Mosor, and Port of Bar warehouses. Based on the firm's business operations report, the warehoused aluminum is worth $1 per ton, while the world price of one ton of aluminum is about $1,100, MONITOR reported. Polemic Between Patriarch Pavle, Bishop Artemije The 21-22 May issue of the Belgrade daily BORBA reports that a polemic largely unnoticed by the popular media has broken out in the pages of SVETI LAZAR, the journal of the Raska-Prizren eparchy, between the bishop of that region, Artemije, and Patriarch Pavle. The polemic was started, said BORBA, by Bishop Artemije's criticism of a sermon by Patriarch Pavle, in which the patriarch reportedly declared that Serbs, Croats, and Muslims had been suffering equally in Bosnia-Herzegovina and all needed peace because "we are all God's children." Bishop Artemije categorized the patriarch's position as "untenable from the Orthodox point of view." In response, Patriarch Pavle declared that he would "leave to people of goodwill and to all-knowing and all-seeing God to judge whatever I do." According to the BORBA account, Bishop Artemije, "who is viewed as one of the most radical people in the Orthodox Church, answered without hesitation" in the next issue of SVETI LAZAR that similar statements could increasingly be heard from religious figures whose only intent was to give the impression of being "broadminded" and "democratic." In defense of his position, Artemije cited an 11 February 1950 letter written by Bishop Nikolaj Velimirovic "in response to similar positions which existed after World War II." In that letter, Bishop Nikolaj wrote that he often had to "correct my priests when they said to the people--God is the father of all the people. This is not so. God is the creator of all the people, but God is the father only of those people who believe in the Son of God and the concept of sonship.... This difference between Christians and non-Christians should especially be emphasized in the present era of vulgar propaganda that all religions are the same...." It was in this context, Bishop Artemije concluded, that Patriarch Pavle's statement that "we are all God's children" was untenable from the Orthodox perspective. Patriarch Pavle, answering Bishop Artemije in a subsequent issue of SVETI LAZAR, cited passages from the Old and New Testaments to support his view that all people are "sons of God and brothers." Stating that it would be up to the people and God to judge the reasons for his empathy with the suffering of the peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina--"especially those who are the most powerless and most innocent, not only among the Serbs, but also among the Croats and Muslims"--he added that he was trying to make his believers understand that in the end "God will judge us by how we behaved and acted toward our weaker brothers."
