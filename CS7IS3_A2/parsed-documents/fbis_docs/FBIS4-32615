This cold calculation is, from the standpoint of the the HZDS, actually understandable. Relations between the top people in the HZDS and Michal Kovac are already such that, after the early parliamentary elections, any kind of effective cooperation could hardly be expected. Because the HZDS is firmly convinced that it will win, it wants the president of the Republic to be someone with whom it can manage to cooperate. If we ostensibly digress from this topic, we find that the HZDS has similar relations with almost all political entities. The only exception is the Slovak National Party [SNS]. However, this party has only minimal prospects of gaining seats in the parliament. Then there is also part of the Greens, the small Farmers' Party, and maybe the KSU [Christian Social Union]. The HZDS has already had so many conflicts with the others that calculating on a possible coalition would at the same time require calculating on amnesia. If the HZDS is now publishing advertisements in PRAVDA, it does so only in an effort to turn the opinion of Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] adherents away from the opinion of the party leadership, which is unequivocally against a postelection coalition. The motivation of the current HZDS politics no longer is to create a new political reality, but only to adjust to existing reality, which is mostly its own doing. The HZDS, whether it wants to or not, must go against all, and, at the same time, its only chance is that those who want to go together against it will splinter. This game was joined by even the president of the Republic. He knows that the coming elections, even if they are not combined with a referendum on curtailing his term in office, will determine whether he stays or does not continue in office. For that reason, as well, it can be expected that Michal Kovac will become an active participant in the election campaign. For, whether he admits it to himself or whether somebody else says it, he cannot de jure dissolve the parliament in a time of crisis. However, his authority to give a report on the state of the Slovak Republic de facto was sufficient to call early elections. So that even in those moments when the president comports himself in an above-party manner, he can, by leaning toward certain values that should apply among decent people, influence in many ways the voters' decisions. Vladimir Meciar, by attacking the president, robs himself voluntarily of one psychological advantage--the Slovak voter intuitively leans toward those who are being wronged. Thus far, it was Meciar who acted that part; now he is beginning to share it to someone else's benefit. No matter how paradoxical it is, the HZDS finds itself in a worse situation than Michal Kovac. For the HZDS, this is a matter of going for broke. If it makes an attempt to call a referendum, there is still time, but this time it will not have at its disposal administrative offices; after all, signatures were being collected even there. It would be more difficult to collect a sufficient number of real signatures, and the only thing that could help would be to further stir up the political atmosphere. Besides that, among HZDS followers, there are still not a few of those, whom even after his conflicts with the movement still trust the president of the Republic. If in the elections they had to vote in favor of the HZDS and, at the same time, with their other vote make a decision on the curtailing of the president's term in office, they would be in an unenviable situation. And as a result, the HZDS could find itself in an unenviable situation as well. The effect created by the referendum on the president could have negative consequences on the number of votes gained. During the past week, we were able to read in PRAVDA that the HZDS is advertising for applications to "fill top government jobs in the administration of the Slovak Republic." Even though this is a remarkable head-start, signaling future changes (to speak about purges ahead of time is not proper), maybe the HZDS in its foresight should advertise for an appropriate president of the Republic and for politicians willing to work with the movement. It appears to be the last opportunity to "make" friends. So far, the HZDS has had more skill in "splintering" them.
