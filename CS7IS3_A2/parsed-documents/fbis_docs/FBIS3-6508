The primary goal of my trip was to consolidate and promote traditional and friendly relations with countries who are our long-time friends. The countries I visited are also in the process of developing their economies where cooperation and solidarity with other countries are essential, so the second goal of my trip was to study the possibility of cooperation between Vietnam and these countries in economic, trade, cultural, and social fields, and to exchange experiences in national construction." Nguyen Thi Binh also revealed that she and her delegation have made "a number of agreements on economic, trade, cultural, science, and technology cooperation. The leaders of the countries I visited wanted us to help them in agricultural development." She added that the leaders and people of these countries understood well the political and economic developments in Vietnam. They highly regarded achievements of the Vietnamese Government and people in renovating the economy and improving ties with the world community. As a representative of Vietnam, she was warmly and solemnly welcomed at all the countries she visited. The Algerian and Malian governments also conferred noble orders on her. Asked to assess the prospects of cooperation between Vietnam and these countries in particular and Africa in general, Nguyen Thi Binh said presently both Vietnam and the African "friends" have limited capital, thus making economic cooperation difficult. However, Africa is a "potentially large market for Vietnamese agricultural produce and consumer goods" thus "promising mutually beneficial cooperation in the future." Asked about her impression on meetings with the French President Francois Mitterrand and the ministers of foreign affairs and cultural and francophone affairs, Nguyen Thi Binh said that although these were only courtesy calls, she had a chance to exchange views with French leaders on issues of common concern. She said: "The most profound impression I got from these meetings was that the ties between Vietnam and the world community in general, and France in particular, are constantly improving. The French leaders as well as businessmen wish to promote cooperation with Vietnam in all fields, which we heartily welcome."
