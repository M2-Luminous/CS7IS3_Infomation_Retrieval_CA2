In an interview published at weekend, Andreatta, a Christian Democrat, warned Berlusconi of the risk presented by an electoral pact with the National Alliance. "I don't think Mr. Berlusconi wants to play the role of Italy's Zhirinovskiy" he said, adding how such an accord with the Right "would be interpreted by the press and foreign governments as a most dangerous sign of a 180-degree shift in Italy's foreign policy and its international position." In a reply to Andreatta's statements, Berlusconi today issued a statement in which he said "Instead of letting Italy's voice be heard on the massacre in Bosnia, Andreatta is concerned with letting the voice of his party be heard to attack, with an uncivil and electoral tone, political opponents, seeking to slander them in Italy and the world." "In regards to his statements that I could be compared to the Russian demagogue Zhirinovsky, an authoritarian post-Communist leader who has transformed himself into a liberal-democrat" the Forza Italia leader continued, "I can reply only in the most clear and obvious way: specialists in these kinds of transformations are the old and new friends of Minister Andreatta, the ex-communists who are wooed and cuddled by the Christian Democrat Left, not by me." Berlusconi went on to say how "My foreign policy, which will be amply illustrated during the presentation of the Forza Italia platform, is clearly European and firmly loyal to the historic roots of the Atlantic Alliance. Anything else is small and petty electoral propaganda, narrow-mindedness I would have expected from the editor of L'UNITA (the daily of the Democratic Party of the Left) and some of his zealous opinionists, not from the chief of the Foreign Ministry, the most delicate ministry in the government which should speak in the name of all citizens and not just some of them." Foreign Minister Andreatta was quick to reply to the Forza Italia leader and, in turn, issued a statement in which he argued "there is only one point in Mr. Berlusconi's rude reply which merits being underscored: the total lack of any reply to my question, as well as those by the foreign press, like THE TIMES and HERALD TRIBUNE, on whether he felt is was more or less compatible to have an alliance with those who support `historic rights' over Istria and other territories." "Mr. Berlusconi" Andreatta continued, "spoke instead about other things. It's time he began to say something a little more articulated than his television commercials, possibly without having to wait for a new show to present his electoral platform." The question of "historic rights" were those being championed by the MSI regarding the peninsula of Istria and the borders set between Italy and the then Yugoslavia after World War II. Andreatta had argued at the weekend how "the word `historic' is an explosive expression in the mouth of any nationalist and in Europe could provoke the same unease as that produced by the German neo-Nazis when they speak of German Sudetenland or Silesia." Vladimir Zhirinovsky is the head of Russia's so-called Liberal Democratic Party who put in a strong showing in the recent general elections and who has alarmed observers in the West with his visions for a Greater Russia, his threats to employ weapons of mass destruction and support for Serb extremists.
