They were speaking after the Cabinet approved a balanced budget of Baht [Thai currency] 715 billion for fiscal 1995, with strong emphasis on accelerating rural development, improving education and increasing the standard of living of lower socioeconomic groups. The Defense Ministry saw its proposed budget growing by 7.5 percent, a drop of 0.5 percent compared with the current fiscal year. Some military leaders complained that the new budget would adversely affect self-defense capability. Defense Minister Wichit Sukmak said after the Cabinet meeting that the slower growth in the proposed defense budget would definitely affect the Armed Forces arms acquisition programs. "The Defense Ministry will discuss it with the Budget Bureau," Gen Wichit said. ACM [Air Chief Marshal] Prachet Siridet, the Navy Commander-in-Chief, said the defense budget could not be cut without the national security being compromised. "However, it depends how much of a cut there will be." The Navy chief insisted that the Armed Forces had drawn up their budget proposals they deserved. Cabinet sources said the Defense Ministry had indicated it would register reservations about the 1995 budget, reasoning that the bulk would be spent on arms purchases and a shortfall in funds would affect its program of modernization. Baht 256 billion, a 22.4 percent increase over the current fiscal year, would be pumped into these projects which are considered by the government to be top priority. The Cabinet appointed Deputy Prime Ministers Banyat Banthatthan, Amnuai Wirawan, Bunchu Rotchanasathian, and Supachai Phanitchaphak to scrutinize and adjust the allocations earmarked for government agencies under their control, Budget Bureau Director Bodi Chunnanon said. The four would discuss proposed adjustments on May 17. The proposed budget for secret operations would be given to the Customs Department, the Office of the Counter Corruption Commission and the National Intelligence Agency, Bodi said. The total secret fund would represent only 0.1 percent of the total budget, he added. Bodi said adjustments could be made but total public sector expenditure would remain fixed at Baht 715 billion. The national budget for fiscal 1995 will be finalized by the Cabinet on May 31, he said. Bodi said that in fiscal 1995 each of the 360 members of the House of Representatives would be allocated about Baht 1O million to finance community development projects in their respective constituencies. Of the Baht 1O million, Baht 5 million would be funnelled through the Prime Minister's Office of the Secretary General. The other half would be made available through various government agencies involved in development work. MPs had been allocated Baht 20 million each for community development in the current financial year which ends September 30. Bodi said the figures would probably be adjusted upwards when the House of Representatives debates the Budget Bill. The Budget Bureau chief said the reason the defense budget was not being increased at the same percentage rate as in fiscal 1995 was because the Defense Ministry had been given more than enough in the current financial year and still had funds left to spend.
