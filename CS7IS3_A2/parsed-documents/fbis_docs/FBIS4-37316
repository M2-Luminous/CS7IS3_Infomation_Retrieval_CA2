During the meeting, Taha Yasin Ramadan reiterated Iraq's unchanging stand on the recent events in Yemen. He said Iraq supports Yemeni unity and legitimacy. He said the enemies are working to partition united countries into several parts to facilitate the achievement of their colonialist ambitions, to control them, and to interfere in their internal affairs. He said the unity of Yemeni territory and people is a source of strength for the Arab nation, and that the support extended to the separatists by some Arab rulers provides another piece of evidence that those agents' are conspiring against the Arab nation in a bid to dismember it, on orders from colonialist powers. The Yemeni parliamentary delegation leader expressed high appreciation and great pride in the heroic stand of President Saddam Husayn and the great Iraqi people. He said the Iraqi people have become an example and a model for steadfastness and sacrifices, through which they have scored great victories and thwarted conspiracies and aggressions. He indicated that the Yemeni people will fight in defense of the one homeland and the one people, and that they will thwart this chapter of conspiracy against Yemen and the Arab nation. Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan also received Pascal Jacquino [name as transliterated], head of the diplomatic and strategic institute in France and head of the higher school for the press, and his delegation. The vice president stressed that many states are suffering economic and security problems as a result of the 30-state aggression against Iraq and the continued blockade imposed on its people. He indicated that continued U.S. hegemony and efforts to implement U.S. ambitions and colonialist policies will jeopardize world peace and security. He said America's allies have lost their independent decisionmaking ability and their sovereignty. He indicated that the disagreement of most UN Security Council member states with the U.S. Administration is considered a defeat for America and a victory for Iraq, because Iraq has managed to thwart all America's conspiratorial, aggressive, and misleading tactics on the military, economic, political, and propagandist fronts. Taha Yasin Ramadan stressed that Iraq will remain as it has always been throughout history -- with a united land and people, Arabs and Kurds, rallying around their leader and symbol, Saddam Husayn and his wise and brave leadership, which has made the Iraqi people a model for emulation by countries that adhere to their principles, defend their objectives, and reject humiliation and subservience. Pascal Jacquino expressed confidence in Iraq's prosperous future in view of its rich human and material potential and the progress that it has achieved in the march of reconstruction. He stressed the importance of promoting Iraqi-French relations in the service of the two countries' common interests.
