The North means oil, coal, diamonds, gold, furs, timber and huge reserves of other raw material resources. But here is the paradox. The government wants to obtain increasingly more from the northerners, but shows increasingly less concern for them. In order for the people to live and work normally in the bleak, remote regions, almost everything has to be delivered there: grain, vegetables, matches, soap, clothing, medicines, production equipment.... It was always that way. The system of supply for the northerners has been in effect in the country for decades. First they accumulated cargo at specific river and sea ports, and as soon as spring came to those regions, ships loaded with everything needed hurried to these god-forsaken corners, hard to reach even by plane. All the same, in the short navigation period, the seamen and river workers delivered to the northerners almost everything that they needed for life in the long winter and Arctic night. The system that had been set up has been breaking down in the last few years. Take last winter. Even the government was forced to evaluate the supply situation for the North as catastrophic. As early as December, for example, the collective of the Tokhomo geological prospecting enterprise, which is in the Evenkia settlement of Baykhit, had no products, medicines, goods for production purposes, and this means wages as well. In the 1993 navigation period, less than half of what was proposed was delivered there. It is a wonder that the people survived last winter. It was the same over the entire expanse of the Russian "norths" -- from the Kola Peninsula to Chukotka and the Kuril Islands.... Just a few days remain until the opening of this navigation season on the northern rivers. What kind of situation faces it? It can't get any worse....

One can see that they are not hastening to do so. In confirmation of this, we will present one more table. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Financial Needs for Delivery in 1994 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Delivery (mln t) |Need for financing (trl rubles) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1994 |1993 |I |II |total incl. | | | | | | |per kw | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Foodstuffs |19 |22 |4 |0.4 |2 | |and goods f-| | | | | | |or people's | | | | | | |consumption | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Petroleum p-|13 |14 |4 |0.1 |2 | |roducts and | | | | | | |coal | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Goods for p-|12 |14 |1.3 |-- |0.5 | |roduction-t-| | | | | | |echnical pu-| | | | | | |rposes | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |TOTAL |43 |49 |9.5 |0.5 |4.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The problem of survival was mentioned with alarm at the recent 4th Conference of Trade Unions of Northern Territories. Quite a few bitter words were spoken about the financial-credit mechanism for cargo delivery. The trade union estimate of this situation was also supported by the Federation Council. The deputies, expressing their concern about the situation in the regions, passed the appropriate resolution. Deputy hearings on these problems began in the State Duma. Only in the government structures are they continuing to discuss the subject of a comprehensive solution to the northern problem. The matter goes no farther than talks, though. The most dangerous thing is that the necessary volume of financing is not fully coordinated with the State budget. Considering all this, as well as the economic problems becoming more exacerbated in the regions, the FNPR [FITUR--Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia] has repeatedly appealed to the RF President with a proposal to hold a meeting under his leadership with the participationg of all those involved in the important national economic problem. There is no time left for further shelving of this problem.
