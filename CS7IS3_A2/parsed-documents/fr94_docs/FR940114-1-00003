FR940114-1-00003 FR940114-1-00002 Farmers Home Administration 7 CFR Parts 1941, 1943, 1945, and 1951 RIN 0575&hyph;AB71 Revisions to the Direct Operating (OL), Farm Ownership (FO), Soil and Water (SW) and Emergency (EM) Loan Regulations to Modify Collateral Requirements Agency: Farmers Home Administration, USDA. Action: Proposed rule. Summary: The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its direct operating (OL), farm ownership (FO), soil and water (SW) and emergency (EM) loan making and servicing regulations to modify collateral requirements. These amendments concern the amount of collateral required when an FmHA loan is made. There will be no change in security requirements for loan restructuring. The intended effect is to reduce the burden on farmers and FmHA personnel in servicing FmHA loan collateral and to avoid encumbering all of a farmer's collateral, thereby making it less difficult for farmers who receive FmHA loans to subsequently obtain non-FmHA credit. DATES: Written comments must be submitted on or before January 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments, in duplicate, to the Office of the Chief, Regulations Analysis and Control Branch, Farmers Home Administration, USDA, room 6348, South Agriculture Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20250&hyph;0700. All written comments made pursuant to this notice will be available for public inspection during regular working hours at the above address. For Further Information Contact: David R.
