Commenting on Lithuanian Foreign Ministry notes on unsanctioned transit through Lithuanian territory of Russian armored troops and on Russia's exploitation of an oil field in the Baltic Sea near the Lithuanian resort Nida, Prikhodko said the Russian Foreign Ministry deals with them in the course of everyday work. "We shall go them over and a reply will be forthcoming," the Russian diplomat stated. "Naturally collisions may occur," Prikhodko said, "and we shall provide exhaustive explanations for the concrete complaints Lithuania has made." The Russian official maintained, however, that disagreements might not arise if Moscow received as soon as possible an answer to its proposals to conclude an agreement on military transit through Lithuania's territory to and from the Kaliningrad region that would "clearly and unambiguously fix the rights and obligations of both parties." In a comment on the oil field issue, Prikhodko said Lithuania received long ago Russian proposals on delimiting economic zone boundaries, but there has been no reply. Prikhodko noted that Russia has submitted a total of 24 draft agreements for consideration by Lithuania.
