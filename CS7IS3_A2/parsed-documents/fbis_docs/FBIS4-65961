The meeting is for countries taking part in the Partnership for Peace program that Sweden joined earlier this month. The other countries had a long list of hopes on the Swedish contributions, Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck says. [Bjoerck] Sweden is unique, among other things because we have taken part in the UN peacekeeping tasks in such an active way. As a matter of fact, more than 60,000 Swedes have served as UN soldiers since the 1950s. We have had a unique experience in this for which we have received a lot of praise. There are many countries that have had no experience in this and want to find out how we have managed: They want to have training, information, and different sorts of assistance. We have of course offered this to them; this is our niche, our speciality. [Nylander] Most of the other members in this Partnership for Peace cooperation agreement see this as a gateway to NATO--I am thinking of the countries of Central and East Europe. How is it going to be possible to try to convince the gathering here in Brussels that Sweden does not view this matter in a similar way? [Bjoerck] Well, it is a matter of information and more information. In the plenary debate here today I made it absolutely clear that we intend to maintain our foreign policy, which is free from alliances. Our membership in NATO is not topical. We differ in this from many of the East European countries, which for different reasons are not being considered for NATO membership. But this must be stressed over and over and over again. [Nylander] Russia has now announced that it will join the Partnership for Peace program. Do you see this as a beginning of a completely new security order in Europe? [Bjoerck] In any case this is a good starting point for that. We were all terribly glad here today when Pavel Grachev made it clear that they intend to sign the Partnership for Peace agreement without conditions or rewards. Many had not dared to hope for this. If everything goes well, we will maybe be able to experience what I have always dreamed of, that the big and mighty Russia--that is what it is at least potentially--will start taking part in European security structures, and in the cooperation organizations in Europe in a considerably more active way than before. As a matter of fact, I think that this is a precondition for lasting peace and stability in Europe, that we have the Russians with us.
