Although no specfic information is available, experts suppose that the Baltic states have become a new transit point for drugs smuggled to the West. Ona Grimalauskiene, consultant at the Lithuanian Ministry of Health Care, said the step will make the struggle against drug abuse and drug transit through Lithuanian territory more efficient. The above conventions not only oblige Lithuania to observe international drug control standards, but also offer technical assistance to Lithuanian customs, police and doctors, she said. Lithuania can expect help in this field from both international organizations and European countries. The Lithuanian Government intends to create a National Drug Control Committee that will coordinate the country's drug control policy. Drug abuse prophylaxis will be one of the committee's principal fields of activity. According to a Jan. 27 government resolution, antidrug laws will be drafted in accordance with the two conventions by next fall.
