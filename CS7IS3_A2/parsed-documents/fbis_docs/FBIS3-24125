Zotov, general director of the Executive Council of the Energy Association of Independent Commercial Banks, under the rubric "Competent View": "On Perfecting the System of Banks and Banking"] [Text] In two and a half years the Russian banking system has undergone great changes, drawing considerably closer to a market economy. About 2,000 commercial banks with more than 3,500 branches are already in operation (the branches of the Savings Bank are not included). Banking structures such as mortgage banks and trading houses have already appeared. Banking associations are being created in the interests of concentrating the capital of banks to achieve investment objectives. Undoubtedly, the associations will play a great role in the stabilization of the economy, the reproductive process, and the development of the priority sectors of the fuel and energy complex, enterprises of the metallurgical complex, and others. Some banks have reached world standards or come considerably closer to them. Mosbiznesbank, Promstroybank, Elektrobank, Promstroybank (St. Petersburg), Kuzbassprombank, Kredobank, and others (a total of 30-40 banks) may be considered such. However, this is extremely insufficient. The process of perfecting banking establishments should be stepped up. Despite the successes noted, we are still far from accomplishing all the tasks in the area of perfecting credit extension, monetary regulation, and settlements. Major miscalculations and omissions have occurred during the period of restructuring of the banking system and of upgrading its technologies. At the first stage, many banks were created under ministries and enterprises and were used by them as a channel to procure funds. Many legal and other important issues have not been fine-tuned. In view of this, urgent measures are needed to enhance the role of the Central Bank of Russia and of commercial banks in regulating the economy. The priority of national rather than commercial objectives should be the fundamental platform of the Central Bank. For this reason the Central Bank and its organization should not directly engage in the extension of credit to enterprises. Otherwise they will acquire their own commercial objectives which may run counter to national ones. Proceeding from this fundamental premise, the Energy Association of Independent Commercial Banks considers it necessary to revise the structure of the main directorates and divisions of the Central Bank. There is no need to have Central Bank subdivisions in each oblast and rayon. Nine to 10 main territorial directorates would be quite sufficient. On 9 November 1993 the Energy Association submitted proposals to the Government of the Russian Federation concerning the above issue, as well as the issue of the establishment of an independent credit committee which should not report to the government or the Central Bank. This act was caused by the need to establish order and discipline in compliance with financial and other legislation, as well as with the rules for credit, monetary, and settlement operations. Systematic control by the credit committee and the Central Bank over the operation of commercial banks will become the most important guarantee of liquidity in the banking system, smoothness of payments, and stability of the financial status of companies and associations. It is necessary to create a council in the Central Bank of Russia which would develop policy in the area of monetary circulation, credit extension, settlements, and stabilization of the ruble and its convertibility. The entire range of these issues should be coordinated with the socioeconomic policy of the state. We should be guided by strategic tasks in the area of the economy and the tax policy developed by the government. In essence, at issue is the policy council defining major economic problems to which it is necessary to apply credit, thus facilitating the accomplishment of socioeconomic tasks and the stabilization of monetary circulation. The council would include four or five representatives of commercial banks, three or four representatives of industry and agriculture, and two or three representatives of the economic sciences. All of them would be confirmed by the government. It is feasible to include in the council specialists from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Economy in a consultative capacity. The council should be headed by the chairman of the Central Bank of Russia. The council would submit its analytical studies and proposals to the Board of the Central Bank and the Government of the Russian Federation. The decision to create the council would be adopted by a special edict of the president. We should not wait for the adoption of the Law on Banks and Banking to do this. Funds allocated by the government from the budget or received in the form of credit from other states under intergovernment agreements for investment in special-purpose programs in priority sectors and other key undertakings (conversion, new development, major scientific discoveries, and so on) would be financed through the State Investment Bank which, in the interests of a general state investment policy, should be subordinated to the Ministry of Finance. It should not be directly involved in raising funds; however, the bank may finance individual facilities and programs while attracting the capital and resources of commercial banks. Such financing should be provided on a competitive basis. In this situation, the state would act through the Investment Bank as a catalyst, influencing investment and attracting private capital in the national interest. This will considerably enhance the role of credit in the reproduction of fixed assets. Now about the system of commercial banks. Many of them are unable to fully support the interests of companies and associations because of insignificant joint stock and ownership capital. At present, credit support is mainly provided for brokerage operations and the generation of high rates of profits by banks, whereas the stabilization of the economy, its development, and the generation of a high rate of profit by economic entities should be the main goals of operation of the banks. Perfecting the structure of commercial banks is the most acute issue. The creed of a bank is to be a reliable partner to its clients. The interpretations of goals and tasks in line with this would indeed facilitate the strengthening of the economy and the stabilization of the monetary system. This is why measures are necessary to perfect the system of commercial banks, to reinforce discipline, and to enhance their responsibility. For example, it would be feasible for the Central Bank, jointly with auditors, to audit the operations of some commercial banks. The operation of the banks and their final results cannot be separated from production, which has declined catastrophically. Many plants are shutting down, while the assets and profits of banks are growing. Some banks allow debit balances to occur. This is the most egregious violation of financial discipline which exacerbates inflationary processes. Licenses to engage in banking operations should be revoked on account of this, as well as for deviations from the principles of extending credit to material production, and such banks should be transferred to the class of subsidiary banks or branches. The actions of the Central Bank should be resolute in this instance. The interests of economic stabilization, the reproductive process, and technical progress require that the capital of banks be concentrated. In conjunction with this, new banking structures should be formed--banking associations, banking finance companies, and other banking structures. Banking associations should be created on a joint-stock basis. Banks, insurance companies, financial companies, and financial industrial groups should be their founders. Taking into account the size of the territory of Russia, it is feasible to create territorial commercial and local banks that will service regions of the country. There may be nine or 10 such territorial banks. Their task would be to ensure the raising of funds and to marshal them for the development of the economies of their regions. It appears to us that issues such as price equalization and a switch to operations without subsidies from the budget will be resolved faster in the regions. The regional banks may become the nerve centers for ensuring the economic information necessary to evaluate the general economic development of the regions, as well as that of individual clients. This is also very important for the bank itself in devising a strategy and action plan for both the long term and shorter periods of time. In view of the great significance of the task of stabilizing monetary circulation, reining in inflation, and reducing prices for consumer goods, it is necessary to sustain this area in every way possible with credit, and tax and interest-rate incentives. Banks that allocate 10-15 percent of internal resources to set up shops producing consumer goods should have the right to have this proportion of the resources exempted from the payment of taxes. Since the Savings Bank has the most extensive chain of branches, it is necessary to assign to it the task of facilitating the development of small businesses through credit. This solution will make it possible to make considerable progress on this issue and to saturate the market with the necessary goods. Of course, the interests of depositors should be taken into account in the process. In conjunction with this, a norm should be set in keeping with which resources should be allocated for credit. Credit and the interest rate policy should be used as instruments to implement economic development, taking into account the specifics of its individual stages in devising concrete approaches and measures to carry them out. Instruments should be developed which make it possible to pursue a credit and monetary policy by way of controlling the emission of money. We should ensure that the operation of the entire banking system, in cooperation with the state organs of government, be directed toward accomplishing the strategic tasks of economic development of Russia. In conjunction with this, it is important to continuously analyze the economic situation in the country and factors that influence changes in it. Based on this, the necessary measures should be taken within the limits of one's jurisdiction, and issues that require government decisions should be referred to the government for consideration. To this end, the Central Bank and commercial banks should have highly skilled specialists-analysts on their staff. For the purposes of objective assessment and substantiated measures to regulate monetary circulation (cash and noncash) it appears feasible to poll, on a quarterly basis, large and medium-size corporations and associations on issues of trend projection. To the same end, the banks should review existing indexes of prices for certain commodity groups for corresponding periods, with a considerable number of enterprises being covered. The Central Bank should vigorously influence the restructuring of the economy of the country in keeping with the requirements of the market and the strategic tasks of the state by way of regulating credit resources and establishing substantiated, differentiated norms and interest rates. It is important to invigorate the extension of credit that would promote the intensification of production and the development of market relations, stabilization of monetary circulation, and prevention of illegitimate credit expansion. It is necessary for the Central Bank to establish a firm limit on the increment of credit. Limitations should be based on realistic calculations which take into account increments in the volume of production, sales, and the number of economic entities served. The role of credit in investment should be enhanced sharply; the proportion of credit should be brought to 20-30 percent of the total amount of capital investment (at present, it stands at 3.5 percent). It is feasible for commercial banks to allocate up to 30 percent of resources to the long-term credit fund (FDK), and to use these resources first of all for the retooling and upgrading of the production sphere. In cases in which economic entities do not have sufficient internal funds for capital investment, they should be granted the right to effect accumulation in the FDK account. Once 70 percent of the amount necessary to make capital investment in the envisioned facility is attained, the bank should open credit for the remainder of the amount. In this instance, the bank would set the interest rate 30 percent below the average market rate. If accumulation in the FDK account was effected over two or three years, the interest rate may be lowered by 40-50 percent. Limitations on credit for banks (and their branches) should be introduced in the interests of reinforcing monetary circulation and stabilizing the economy. At issue are limits on special-purpose allocations to carry out the programs of priority enterprises; limits on regular credit to be extended to medium-size enterprises and for uses with the short recovery of funds; limits of consumer credit (including that for the development of small businesses and housing construction); and regular limits for brokerage and other purposes. Along with the setting of norms for the excess of credit indebtedness over the capital of the bank (20-fold at present), certain norms for the issuance of large loans should be established (for example, five to seven large loans should not be greater than three to four times the excess, and all large loans--greater than six to eight times the size of ownership capital). The practice of the last three years indicates that 95-97 percent of credit resources are issued for periods of one to three months for brokerage and current uses by enterprises, which causes economic and financial complications in the operation of enterprises and associations. The introduction of limits is a temporary measure devised for a period of transition. However, it will provide an opportunity to orient the bank toward production which is absolutely necessary in the existing economic situation. As a rule, credit resources would be provided to commercial banks against the pledge of enterprise securities. This would be one of the measures of real backing which is necessary to stabilize monetary circulation. It appears to us that the Central Bank of Russia should have a clear-cut program for stabilizing monetary circulation and reinforcing the convertibility of the ruble. This program should call for a phased approach to the attainment of the goals set, as well as measures that commercial banks should take. It is necessary to envision in the program the gradual abandonment of centralized resources. All budget support should be provided directly through the financial organs. Of course, the above does not exhaust the entire multitude of issues of perfecting the banking industry. However, we are convinced that it is necessary to solve the problems that have been touched upon in this article. We believe that we will meet with understanding from the broad banking community, and that bankers will contribute considerably to accomplishing the task of stabilizing the economy, which is vital for our country.
