Nevertheless, Kazannik told a meeting of the Council of the Federation here today that he had received a written instruction from the president not to carry out the amnesty. Considering that Kazannik, as he said, did not have any constitutional guarantees in the form of a decision of the Council of the Federation, appointing him to the post of procurator-general, he decided to resign and announced his decision during a press conference at the procurator- general's office on February 26. Kazannik also said that he was asking nothing from the Council of the Federation and that he was "satisfied with the fact that the Council of the Federation was discussing this issue." Kazannik told journalists during a break in the deliberations of the Council of the Federation, which is to pass a decision on the appointment of a procurator-general, that he was hatching plans to set up his own party, made up of law-abiding people. "If such a party is set up, I would prefer to call it a party of concord and national progress," Kazannik said. He told journalists also that he was receiving offers from Omsk, Yekaterinburg, and Novosibirsk to head various associations. Most of them came from intellectuals.
