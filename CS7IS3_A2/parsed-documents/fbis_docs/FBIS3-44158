General Aidid's chief financier Osman Hassan Ali `Ato' arrived in Nairobi aboard a charter plane from Mogadishu with his former co-detainees Mohamed Hassan Awale, the warlord's advisor on international affairs, and Omar Salad Elmi, his former representative in Addis Ababa. Aidid, who has been in Nairobi since UN-sponsored peace talks collapsed in December, met President Daniel arap Moi in the western Kenyan town of Nakuru on Tuesday morning, Kenyan officials said. "We're preparing for further consultations with other factions since Addis was a failure," Aidid's spokesman in Kenya, Abdullatif Afdub, told AFP. A key Aidid ally, warlord Omar Jays, was also expected to arrive here on Tuesday from Addis Ababa later Tuesday, Somali sources said. Abdullatif was unable to confirm reports from Somali sources that Aidid's enemy, self-styled interim President Ali Mahdi Mohamed, was also coming to Nairobi, possibly for Kenyan-mediated peace talks.
