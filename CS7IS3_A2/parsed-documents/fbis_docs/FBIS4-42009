The leaders of 19 components of the Russian Federation -- from the Urals to the Transbaykal -- met at the lake to coordinate the activity of republics, krays, and oblasts on socioeconomic problems. State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, and Federal Assembly upper chamber chairman Vladimir Shumeyko took part in the latest session. The principles of regional policy, charges for electricity and rail transport, measures to overcome adverse phenomena on the labor market were the range of questions discussed. Without going into details I shall note the main thing: The Siberians have a reasoned and persistent desire to play a leading role in the country's state development. No one likes the role of pawns. Their only "diversion and delusion of youth" was that a year ago they spoke of their own Siberian republic. And until the October rebellion everyone repeated that Russia would be saved by the regions. Irkutsk Governor Yuriy Nozhikov believes that "these phrases were current while the authorities sought allies in the provinces but when they no longer needed allies they could not see the role of the regions...." "But now they have developed a unified position so that the attitude toward the regions is not seen as the attitude of the metropolitan state toward a colony?" the reporters asked the "fathers" from "Siberian accord." The latter replied "perhaps," "it must be supposed...." Now there are real constitutional powers but.... They cannot sense any unity. The components are waging a quiet but very noticeable permanent struggle. Both among themselves and with Moscow. Perhaps this does not apply only to Irkutsk Oblast and Krasnoyarsk Kray. They have much in common in their economies and raw material resources and they are linked by the same Angara-Yenisey waterway.... Of course, they also defend their own interests -- and win. Here they recalled how some time ago by an edict of the president instructed that the local very powerful hydroelectric power stations -- the Bratsk, Ust-Ilimsk, Ust-Khantayskaya, Kureyskaya, and others -- be transferred to the ownership of the "Unified Power Grid of Russia" Russian state joint-stock company which has been created. Their turbines generate an enormous quantity of energy, which is the cheapest in the country. This is the most profitable item of the local budget. If a joint-stock company were formed they would have to buy their own electricity, but at high prices. That is why there was powerful resistance from the regions. It was settled by the Constitutional Court in favor of the two components. The victory on this principled dispute was a lesson to others. We must talk with the regions in a civilized language, observing mutual interests. The Baykal meeting showed that the activity of the "Siberian Accord" is nonetheless characterized by a further attraction toward the integration of the regions and toward the improvement of people's economic standard and consequently their living standard. Incidentally, it was noted that life expectancy here is five to 10 years less than in the central part of the country and that Siberian health today is a myth. In elaborating the new concept of economic collaboration all factors of the reform were considered. They are reflected in the documents which were adopted. A new regional ideology is taking shape, albeit slowly -- the further decentralization of power and, as they said here, their "decolonization." Indeed, Russia will grow through Siberia if Siberia itself acquires the right it needs to independent economic initiative. All participants in the meeting liked the great lake, its deep water, and wide, free expanses. The guests tasted the famous Baykal fish, the omul. And their courteous hosts -- the leaders of the Irkutsk and Chita Oblast administrations and the Buryatia Government -- reminded the country's eminent officials that the "law on Baykal" has been languishing in their files for a long time now. Two years ago they prepared this document but were unable to achieve its adoption in the former parliament, and the State Duma is still only studying the draft.
