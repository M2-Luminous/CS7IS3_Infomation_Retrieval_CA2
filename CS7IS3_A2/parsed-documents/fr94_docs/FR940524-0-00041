ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule changes the final compliance date for installing improved (11-parameter digital) flight data recorders from May 26, 1994, to the next heavy maintenance check, but no later than May 26, 1995, in Stage 2 airplanes subject to the rules requiring a transition to an all Stage 3 fleet. This change allows carriers more time to take actions necessary to retrofit Stage 2 airplanes and makes the flight data recorder replacement rule more compatible with the noise transition requirements without having a significant impact on safety. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 24, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary E. Davis, Project Development Branch, AFS&hyph;240, Air Transportation Division, Flight Standards Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591, telephone (202) 267&hyph;8096. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On March 25, 1987, the FAA promulgated a final rule that requires operators, by May 26, 1994, to install improved (11-parameter digital) flight data recorders on all airplanes type certificated on or before September 30, 1969, and operated under part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (52 FR 9622). The final rule, §121.343(c), was issued in response to a recommendation from the National Transportation Safety Board that was based on accident/incident files for January 1983 to February 1986 that revealed a high failure rate for metal foil flight recorders. The data revealed that 37 recorders (48 percent) had one or more malfunctioning parameters preceding the accident or incident, preventing the recording or readout of pertinent data. Air Transport Association's Petition for Exemption In August 1991, the Air Transport Association (ATA) petitioned the FAA for an exemption from §121.343(c). The ATA stated that the compliance date for the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) retrofit was inappropriate when considering the schedule for either retrofitting airplanes with noise abatement equipment or retiring airplanes in order to comply with the Stage 3 transition mandated in September 1991 (56 FR 48628, September 25, 1991). The FAA denied the ATA exemption request, stating that the Stage 3 transition rule did not mandate the retirement of any Stage 2 airplanes. The FAA pointed out that noise abatement equipment was expected to be available for virtually the entire active fleet. In June 1992, the ATA again requested that the FAA extend the May 26, 1994, DFDR compliance date for its members and similarly situated operators. In the alternative, the ATA requested that the FAA establish a delayed DFDR retrofit schedule that coincided with the Stage 3 transition interim compliance dates to avoid having to install new DFDR's on airplanes that were scheduled to be retired. The ATA asserted that the compliance deadline would require its members to install DFDR's on Stage 2 airplanes that would be retired within 51/2 years of the May 1994 compliance date to remain in compliance with the part 91 noise operating rule. The ATA also asserted that this DFDR retrofit requirement for Stage 2 airplanes would impose substantial costs on them with little perceived benefit. On January 29, 1993, after considering all the data presented by the ATA and the commenters, the FAA determined that a grant of exemption was justified and in the public interest. Exemption No. 5593 permits ATA members to operate certain Stage 2 airplanes equipped with DFDR's that have 6 rather than 11 operational parameters. Operation is allowed subject to certain conditions and limitations, including the requirement that air carriers submit a list of their Stage 2 aircraft that will be retired by December 31, 1998. On June 30, 1993, the FAA amended Exemption No. 5593 to clarify certain conditions that were being misinterpreted.
