They said that the focus is shifting from the Sayyidat al-Najat Church file to other files, that this crime has been removed from official attention, and that it has been used as a means for political rather than criminal trial. The Maronite bishops denounced what they called the pursuit of many youths, which may harm Lebanon's reputation. They stressed that media freedom is the basis of freedoms. They noted that the issuing of the prospective media law will be a healthy sign if it guarantees freedom of expression. They called on officials to show serious attention to the people's economic difficulties.
