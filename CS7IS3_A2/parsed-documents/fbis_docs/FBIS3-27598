In the sphere of utilizing foreign capital, it covers the practice of exchanging markets for technology, a change from providing preferential treatment to certain regions to guiding them with industrial policies, amendments made to relevant policies according to GATT requirements, the provision of "citizen treatment" for foreign-invested enterprises, and so on.

As pointed out in the "strategic concept," China's foreign trade increased by 16 percent each year between 1978 and 1992, which was seven percentage points higher than the national economic growth rate. Foreign trade in the 1990's should continue growing at a rate three to five percentage points higher than that of economic development. Taken as a whole, this "overall strategy on economy and trade" formulated by senior economic and trade specialists includes the following aspects: -- The formation of a domestic and international open pattern of multiple directions, channels, and areas; the development of a diversified markets with stress on the Asia-Pacific region; and the accelerated unification of the domestic and international economies. -- An extensive merger of foreign economic and trade undertakings, including the merger of foreign trade, foreign capital, foreign investment, and other foreign economic and trade businesses; "integrated" and coordinated development of commodities, technology, services, and trade; the close integration of multilateral, regional, and bilateral economic and trade cooperation; the close integration of trade, industry, agriculture, technology, banking, and commerce; and the integration of macroeconomic regulation and control at home and abroad, thus forming a concerted force for China to participate in international competition. -- Great changes in function, such as the expansion of the scope of foreign economic and trade, increasing contributions made to the economy as a whole, the promotion of industrial structural readjustment, and exercising a comprehensive, guiding role in economic and technological advances and industrial development.

In importing technology, it is necessary to strive to increase the proportion of advanced technological equipment from 30.8 percent in 1990 to 40 percent by the end of this century, and greater emphasis should be laid on importing strategic industries. In overseas investment, the proportion of investment abroad and the importation of foreign capital should be around 1:0.15, and work should be focused on giving export guidance, developing natural resources, and importing technical know how. The concept put forth the necessity of establishing a number of large, comprehensive and internationalized foreign trade enterprises operating as enterprise groups, Chinese-style business firms with the nature of industrialized and internationalized foreign trade enterprise groups, and 10 extra-large economic and trade enterprises capable of competing with big multinational corporations within five to eight years.
