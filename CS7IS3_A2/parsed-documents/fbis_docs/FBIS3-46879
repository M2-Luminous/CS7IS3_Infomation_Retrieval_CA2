FBIS3-46879 "dreas004_d_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-004 Document Type:Daily Report 6 Jan 1994 South Korea President Kim Yong-sam Holds News Conference Question-Answer Session SK0601053294 Seoul KBS-1 Television Network in Korean 0028 GMT 6 Jan 94 SK0601053294 Seoul KBS-1 Television Network Language: Korean Article Type:BFN ["News Conference" held by President Kim Yong-sam with foreign and domestic reporters at the Chongwadae presidential offices in Seoul -- live] [Text] [President Kim] Now I am pleased to receive questions from you reporters. [Choe Kyu-sik, HANGUK ILBO reporter] I have learned that during recent negotiations with the United States, North Korea said that it would only accept one inspection of its seven nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Can you clearly explain what actual progress has been made in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and whether we conceded to the North on our side's earlier demands for North-South mutual nuclear inspections? [President Kim] Concerning the North Korean nuclear issue at this point, I would like to clearly state that the issue of the ROK's security and North Korea's nuclear issue were discussed intensively last July with U.S. President Clinton. In particular, they were discussed in depth during last November's summit, and the two nations have reached complete agreement on these issues. Since that time, 24-hour-long contacts, including telephone calls with President Clinton to discuss problems, have been constantly maintained throughout ongoing negotiations between North Korea and the United States. Even before the United States began dialogue with North Korea, it exchanged views with the ROK, and it has kept us informed of results since the dialogue began. I especially want to clarify at this point the fact that the United States is completely respecting ROK will. You mentioned a one-time nuclear inspection. The issue of nuclear inspections is not an issue between the United States and North Korea but a matter of discussion between the IAEA and North Korea. Because of the delicacy of this issue, I will refrain from providing further details such as what issues were discussed between the two sides. The only thing I can tell you is that discussions will be held in Vienna between a North Korean ambassador and the IAEA. Negotiations have yet to begin, however, as the North Korean side claims that it has yet to receive precise directives. In conclusion, the ROK and the United States are in agreement that ultimately, mutual inspections between the North and the South should be conducted. I believe that these inspections will be realized without fail. You reporters talk as though North-South dialogue has been ignored. This is not true. I want you, reporters, to know that the United States and the ROK agree that inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, and the North-South dialogue must take place simultaneously, without fail. [Kim Hong, KBS reporter] In recent contacts between the United States and North Korea, the North Korean side put forward a package deal proposal. People are under the impression that the United States was dragged into the North Korean side's plan to settle the nuclear problem, establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea, and the issue of the Team Spirit exercise in a package deal. Could you explain the government's position on the issue of the establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States and between North Korea and Japan? [President Kim] The package deal solution phrase was not used by the United States, but by the North Korean side. As for the issue of Team Spirit, it is very sensitive, so I will refrain from talking on this issue at this time. While I will not elaborate on this issue as negotiations are ongoing, I would like to clearly state that by all means, this is an issue that the ROK will decide. North Korea's establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan was agreed upon between the ROK and the United States in discussions with President Clinton last November. Since there is plenty of time, and establishment of diplomatic relations is not an issue that should be hastily discussed, I think we had better not discuss this issue in detail here. [Cho Chong-min, MBC reporter] Let me continue the question. My question is about North-South relations. I remember it was on 27 December last year. During lunch with reporters that day, you said that North-South relations would improve considerably this year [1994]. However, North Korea's President Kim Il-song did not mention North-South relations in his New Year's address. Moreover, North Korea's denunciation of our government and president has increased recently. What are your prospects for North-South relations, including North-South summit talks? Do you see any likelihood for actual progress in North-South relations this year? [President Kim] You should know that North Korea is not always consistent in what it says. North Korea said previously that it would never contact the United States and called for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea. Nevertheless, North Korea is now holding dialogue with the United States. North Korea tends never to announce anything that may be detrimental to it. For instance, as you know, when announcing the results of U.S.-North Korean negotiations, North Korea deleted many portions and did not mention North-South relations. If you knew these facts, you would know not to accept everything North Korea says at face value. Regarding North-South summit talks, however, I think it is necessary for us to abort our past way of thinking. In other words, I want to stress that we should not hold summit talks with North Korea only for the sake of holding summit talks. I have held summit talks on numerous occasions with foreign heads of state. Last year alone, I held summit talks with leaders of foreign countries on 20 occasions. So there is no reason for me not to be able to hold summit talks with North Korea's President Kim Il-song. In order to hold summit talks, however, some problems should be solved. Let me repeat again that I will not hold summit talks only to hold summit talks. In the past, people thought that summit talks would solve everything. You are aware of the problems that we have pointed out. I will not make concessions on these issues for summit talks with North Korea. [Yun Chang-chun, SEGYE ILBO reporter] When you reshuffled the cabinet and major positions in the ruling party last year, some people criticized your choice of so many of your close confidants. Former Minister of Political Affairs Kim Tok-yong, one of your close confidants, has stepped down and has no official post now. What is your opinion on the assessment of former Minister for Political Affairs Kim Tok-yong by political circles? Also, what do you say to criticism that you have chosen many close confidants? [President Kim] That's a tough question. [laughs] The criteria I used in the reshuffle of personnel were the person's will to achieve reforms, clean and honest character, and ability. No matter how able one may be, one should be clean and honest and diligent. Ability is not everything. When one has the firm will to serve the country and the nation, one can demonstrate one's ability. Of course, some of the appointees to cabinet and party posts shared arduous and protracted political lives with me as part of the opposition. However, I am well aware of their character and ability. I have chosen them because I believe that they are exceedingly able to work hard, have the firm will for reforms, and have a clean and honest character. Regarding your question about Assemblyman Kim Tok-yong, I have been in contact with and known him for over 25 years. We were together in extremely arduous times. There is no change in my affection for him. Lawmaker Kim Tok-yong held the position of minister of state for political affairs. However, I believe that it will be good for him to rest for a while. Also, I believe that from various aspects, he will be able to sufficiently carry out the role of executive member of our Democratic Liberal Party [DLP]. I believe this will be of help to him. There is no change in my affection for him. [Song Yong-on, TONG-A ILBO reporter] Mr. President, you have stated that Seoul will not be divided for the upcoming election of heads of regional administrative offices. However, I believe that problems remain in relegating the central government's direct control over special cities to provinces, dividing Kyonggi Province, and integrating cities and counties. What is your position on this? [President Kim] I asked that since an election will be held one and a half years from now, we avoid talking about this issue if possible. I would like to point out that I don't feel any need to talk about this matter now. As I said in response to your questions on many previous occasions, I will walk the right path. We do not have to think that elections will be carried out by dividing regions. Elections will be carried out in a fair way. [Kim Song-su, YONHAP reporter] There is still time before the DLP's national convention which is slated for May. Following the reorganization of the party's administration, the leadership system now centers around Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil. Will there be any change in this leadership system before May? Can you give us your view on this matter? [President Kim] Contrary to newpaper reports, I have not commented on this matter to date. Ten months have passed since the inauguration of the civilian-led government. Of my five years in office, this year will be the only one without elections. Thus, this is the year when various work must be conducted to resolve difficult issues. We must revive the economy, structurally improve and save the farms, and win in world competition. As you all know, I have been a politician for a long time. A lot of money and manpower must be spent in order to hold a national party convention or meeting to reorganize district party chapters. The United States, one of the advanced countries and the world's most powerful country, holds a national party convention every four years when it designates a presidential candidate. Slated for May, our DLP national convention is convened by the party president. So, if necessary, the president has the right to ask the standing committee to change the timing of the national party convention. If the standing committee adopts this request, the national party convention may not be held. If the national party convention is to be held in May, the district party chapter must be reorganized in February, the provincial party convention must be held in March, and the national party convention must be held in May. Tens of thousands of people have to be gathered together. Is there a real need to hold such a political event this year? I believe that we should consider this matter deeply for our nation's future. If we hold a national party convention, we will have to once again reshuffle the executive members of the party who were appointed just a few days ago. Do you think it is appropriate to reorganize important party positions in under four months? I do not think this is possible. I think that Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil, in assuming actual power, has managed the party well so far. I hope Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil will assume strong leadership to responsibly lead the party. I have told all the ministers of the cabinet to unite around the prime minister. I have told each ministry of the cabinet to stop pursuing only its own interests. I have also told the prime minister that he must responsibly supervise each ministry. I have entrusted Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil with every right and responsibility. [CHOSON ILBO reporter Kim Chang-ki] Many people have pointed out that you, Mr. President, rely too heavily on private channels, instead of official channels, in deciding on major policies, selecting government officials, and tapping public opinion. Would you comment on this? [President Kim] I listen to the opinion of various people. I listen to people's opinions through both private and official channels. I also receive reports from various government offices. When selecting people for government offices, I fully examine candidates. I do not expect to get a perfect score each time. Not everybody is satisfied with what I have done. I don't think that you should be too concernced about this matter, though. The presidency is a lonely and painful job. A president must make resolute decisions on numerous issues. Many people even tell me that while I smiled frequently and appeared bright before becoming president, I now appear grim. I may have overexerted myself worrying about the hazards of cold weather this summer and floods from heavy rainfall. Everyday, I worry about numerous things. I hope you understand that I appear grim for this reason. I also hope you understand that I do not make hasty decisions. My decisions are made after extensive deliberation. [Unidentified foreign reporter, in English] At the last press conference, you said that the DPRK's nuclear development was the biggest obstacle to inter-Korean confidence. So if the nuclear problem is solved, do you think that trust can be built between the North and South? And, what concrete measures will your government take to improve bilateral relations? Thank you. [President Kim] I have various plans in mind. We are mapping out plans now. Since negotiations are now being held on this matter, however, I think not elaborating on this issue now will benefit negotiations. I hope you understand. [Kim Hyon-il, CHUNGANG ILBO reporter] There are many people, except those from the so-called Democratic Faction, who say that you, the president, are a tough person [musopta]. What do you think about this? In addition, I hear that there are indications that the party congress may not be held in May. Will you please explain your idea of intraparty harmony in relation to the continuation of Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil's system? [President Kim] It seems that people are inclined to describe me as a tough man because I carried out many tough things during the era of confrontation between democratic and antidemocratic forces. I am not a tough but a soft man. Since very capable officials, including Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil, were elected recently to key party positions, I am confident of the satisfactory and harmonious operation of the party in future, as well. [Kim Chung-il, KYONGHYANG SINMUN reporter] Mr. President, you said that you would go anywhere in the world for the nation. Yet, you have not visited the three neighboring countries. Will you elaborate on plans to visit foreign countries like these three countries and what work will you conduct during your visits? [President Kim] As I stated in my opening remarks, when Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa visited our country some time ago, he extended an official invitation for me to visit. At the time, I pledged that I would visit Japan within this year without fail. Were the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] summit not held last year, I would not have gone overseas. However, since an important APEC summit was held, and considering the great significance of such a summit, I went overseas and also held a ROK-U.S. summit during the visit. I will fulfill the pledge I made to Prime Minister Hosokawa. After discussing an appropriate time through diplomatic channels, I will decide on a time for the visit. I think it would be better not to elaborate on visits to other countries at this time. [Edward Paisley, FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW reporter] Mr. President, high wages in South Korea are one of the problems facing Korea's international competitiveness. The Korean Trade Union congress, which represents hundreds of thousands of workers but it is still illegal in Korea, has offered to lower its wages and benefit demands in exchange for recognition and non-wage concessions from management. Your government has rejected this approach in 1993. Will you reconsider this in 1994 in light of wage growth of 13 percent in 1993? [President Kim] As I stated earlier, the most important goal this year is to enhance international competitiveness. Facing an era of internationalization, we should win in the economic war without fail. The most important factor to winning is cooperation between management and workers. I want to emphasize this point. Of course, as mentioned earlier, there are various organizations under labor unions. Also, there are many people who give priority to the interest of the nation, which must be highly considered even at this moment. I attended the New Year's ceremony held by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry on 5 January and had dialogues with businessmen. There I met many businessmen from the thirty large enterprises since the financial real-name transaction system was adopted last year and said to them: Changes have taken place in our business circles' past habits. For example, frankly speaking, the businessmen gave money to rulers in the past, but I, during my tenure, will never accept money, not even a penny, from anyone. Therefore, the businessmen must use the money they want to give me to promote investment in enterprises, to improve technology, and to enhance workers' welfare. In the second half of last year, our enterprises made all-out efforts to gain a trade surplus. The correct statistics regarding this issue can be announced around next month, but, as of today, this surplus amount is estimated to be approximately $2.0 billion, and the current account surplus approximately $200 million. For the first time in four years, we could gain this surplus. Regarding the wage issue, as mentioned earlier, I believe that this issue can be satisfactorily resolved between consultations between workers and owners this year as well. In raising international competitiveness this year, most important is to improve technology, to achieve harmony between workers and owners, and to expand social indirect capital. It is also important to boldly lift various restrictions that block the development of the country. By doing so, we are going to seek the revitalization of the economy. The issue of harmony between workers and owners is very important in revitalizing the economy. Because of this, I told businessmen to hold dialogues with workers from now on regarding the labor issue in stead of holding dialogues with them when the issue becomes serious as was done in last year. As a result, dialogues between workers and owners are now very active. There are some people who worry over the labor dispute this year, but I believe that this issue can be resolved through dialogues. I believe, therefore, that it is possible to resolve the issue when we concentrate all efforts and wisdom on its settlement. [Unidentified Japanese reporter] I have a question for you regarding the nuclear issue. I feel that you seem to avoid giving concrete answers regarding the nuclear issue by saying that it is now under discussion or it is a delicate issue. I believe that many countries are interested in and keep an eye on the nuclear issue. Your Excellency President Kim said that a sign of changes have been shown in North Korea even now while you are delivering your speech. We wonder, however, if changes are really taking place in North Korea. You also said that you can not accept President Kim Il-song's speech as it is, and that one should see things behind the contents. I would appreciate it if you could specifically explain what kinds of changes are taking place in North Korea and where the source came from. [President Kim] Thank you. I repeat to you once again. As of this moment, for example, as of this morning, various negotiations between the United States and North Korea are underway. As I stated before, I would like to stress, however, that this does not mean that the ROK is excluded from negotiations, and that its intentions are respected. After consulting with the ROK, the United States is holding dialogues with North Korea. Even North Korea knows it. North Korea does not think that the United States holds dialogue with it, ignoring the ROK's intentions. North Korea knows that the United States holds dialogue with it after consulting with the ROK. I believe that the contents of negotiations, which were held as of this morning, must not be disclosed. Therefore, I hope for your understanding. I will say, however, progress is being made in negotiations. [Kim Song-pok, KOREA TIMES reporter] Recently, in connection with easing regulations in the economic field, the economic circle is saying that regulations must be completely abolished. What is your view on this matter? [President Kim] Our government's policy is to ease regulations to the utmost so that the people can freely carry out business activities. We will work to ease regulations to the utmost. [Adrian Edwards, BBC News reporter] About the North Korean nuclear situation again. It appears we are moving toward a stage of some limited nuclear inspections being accepted by North Korea. Would you view limited inspection as a resolution of the issue or would it have to go much further? [President Kim] As I have said before, the nuclear inspection issue is an issue to be resolved between North Korea and the IAEA. IAEA's position on this matter is very strong. I as well as the IAEA think that holding inspection superficially has little significance. Therefore, I believe that we cannot reach a conclusion on this matter at this stage. [Chon Yong-hak, Seoul Broadcasting Service reporter] A price hike centered on public utility charges is notable from the beginning of this year. Amid this kind of price instability, do you think that the economy can be activated and that there will be no labor-management dispute? [President Kim] Our public utility charge is the most inexpensive in the world. There are many problems because we did not raise the public utility charge for a long time. One of the most important goals in our policy for this year is to achieve price stability. If there is no price stability, nothing can be achieved. I have already ordered that work be carried out to stabilize prices. Each matter regarding price stability will be worked out in detail. I believe that achieving price stability is an important yardstick in reviving the economy this year. [Kim Se-hyong, MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN reporter] Recently, there are moves to reduce the organization at some ministries. Is this related with the plan to form a small government which you talked about during the presidential election? Also, to what degree will this be extended? Can you give us your view on this matter? [President Kim] What is most important for us is to adapt to change. If we follow work that was carried out 20-30 years ago, this will be a great problem. As the world changes, we must also change. We will never be able to win in an era of unlimited competition if we remain unchanged. Therefore, we must prudently examine this matter and decide on how we will deal with it after viewing what is truly good for the people and what is efficient. [Ko To-won, CHUNGANG KYONGJE SINMUN reporter] Whenever you had the opportunity you said that if North Korea's nuclear issue is resolved you will promote South-North economic cooperation. In your speech today, you said that if the nuclear issue is resolved, practical South-North relations will be promoted rapidly. Can you give us your concrete plan? [President Kim] I believe that it is correct to talk about this matter after the nuclear issue is resolved. Frankly speaking, North Korea is currently listening to everything we are saying. I don't think talking about this matter at this time will be helpful with the ongoing negotiations. I hope that you will understand the situation and be patient. [Ko To-won, CHUNGANG KYONGJE SINMUN reporter] Mr. President, you have powerfully carried out changes and reform in many fields of our society since the new government came to office. As a result, you have won great applause from the people. However, people say that while this was of much concern to people in the past, no noteworthy changes and reforms have been undertaken in the educational domain. The education minister is present here. People expressed both interest and concern upon her appointment. Can you explain your ideas for future educational reform in more detail? [President Kim] I think that of all reforms, education reform is most important. All work in our society is conducted by people. And people are formed by education. Thus, education is, at the same time, the most difficult work. All successive governments in the past carried out various educational policies, from a system of school entrance examinations to educational reform drives, in an excessively improvisational manner, thus causing great confusion among the people. As the result of this, our education system has failed to advance and has instead regressed. Taking the example of foreign educational systems, I think early education of people is desirable. With early education, people will be able to learn many things promptly. Our examination system is too complicated. Our people are greatly confused over this aspect of our educational system. We must carefully review this issue. I have already discussed it with the education minister. I plan to form an Education Reform Committee so as to fully discuss these problems in this committee. I believe that the new education minister has a number of ideas on educational reform and will excel in implementing them. [Yi Kum-hyon, reporter for THE ECONOMIST] I would like to ask questions about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the decision of the South Korean government to give up nuclear development. Mr. President, in your speech this morning, you said that each nation will make maximum efforts to protect its own interests. I wonder if you, Mr. President, believe that the ROK Government's decision to abandon nuclear development will benefit the national interests of South Korea today and of a reunified ROK nation? Second, will you explain whether the decision to abandon nuclear development may change according to changes in the surrounding conditions and to each nation's situation? [President Kim] Thank you. The ROK people truly love peace. We were always attacked by other people. Never have we attacked others. This will not change in the future. Our defense of the Armistice Line and the Team Spirit exercise is aimed at defending ourselves, not at attacking others. South Korea will never develop nuclear weapons in the future. I make it clear South Korea will never develop fearful nuclear weapons because this will absolutely threaten peace on the Korean peninsula, bring dire misfortunes to the lives of the 70 million fellow countrymen, result in building a big powder magazine in Northeast Asia, and is not beneficial to peace in the world. Now, I wish to conclude the news conference now. Thank you.
