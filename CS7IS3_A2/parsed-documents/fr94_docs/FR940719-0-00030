ACTION: Interim rule. SUMMARY: The National Security Education Act provided for the establishment of the National Security Education Program, the National Security Education Board, and a Trust Fund in the U.S. Treasury to provide all resources for the program. Under the Act the Secretary is directed to carry out a program to award undergraduate scholarships, graduate fellowships, and grants to institutions of higher education. This rule is to inform those concerned with institutional grants to be offered under the 1994&hyph;1995 pilot grants program of the preliminary guidelines. DATES: This rule is effective on May 5, 1994. Written comments on this rule must be received not later than July 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Forward comments to the office of: Director, National Security Education Program, P.O. Box 47103, Washington, DC 20050&hyph;7103. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Edmond J. Collier, (703) 696&hyph;5673. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Certification statement regarding the interim rule re: Executive Order 12866, Public Law 96&hyph;354 and Public Law 96&hyph;511. Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' It has been determined that this Interim Rule will, if issued, be a significant regulatory action. This rule has been reviewed by OMB prior to Federal Register publication. Public Law 96&hyph;354, ``Regulatory Flexibility Act'' It has been certified that this rule is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because, if issued as a final rule, it would have no adverse effect on small entities. It would provide guidance to colleges, universities, or consortia interested in applying for an institutional grant under the National Security Education Program. The primary effect of this rule on potential grantees will be to reduce the administrative costs and other burdens resulting from the simplification and clarification of the application process. Public Law 96&hyph;511, ``Paperwork Reduction Act'' It has been certified that this rule would, if issued as a final rule, impose a reporting requirement under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520), and is being forwarded for review by OMB.
