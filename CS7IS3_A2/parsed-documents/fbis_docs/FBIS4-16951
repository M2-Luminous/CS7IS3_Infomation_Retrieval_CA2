[Signed] V.F. Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council [Dated]Moscow, 8 April 1994 No. 97-I SF In recent years the crime problem in the Russian Federation has sharply deteriorated. The scale of crime and its tendency to increase are dangerously deforming the course of reform and are posing a threat to the basic foundations of Russian statehood, constitutional legality, and citizens' security. The level of crime has more than doubled compared with 1988. In 1993 there were 2.8 million recorded crimes, of which more than 500,000 were serious. These included almost 30,000 murders, 67,000 cases of grievous bodily harm, more than 200,000 robberies and muggings, and 22,500 crimes involving the use of firearms. Young people have been actively drawn into criminal activity. In 1993 224,000 crimes were committed by juveniles. Of particular concern is the growth in organized crime, which employs methods of criminal terror such as hostage-taking, blackmail, and others. Criminal formations are engaged in large-scale racketeering and drug trafficking, are striving to establish control over the banks, spheres of enterprise, and the distribution of material resources, and are linking up with corrupt elements in the state apparatus. Illegal exports of oil, raw materials, and metals have become unprecedentedly widespread. Violence and threats are increasingly employed against militia officers, investigators, prosecutors, judges, workers in financial, tax, and customs services, crime victims, witnesses, and citizens who help the law-enforcement organs. The main reasons for the spread of crime lie in the critical state and instability of society, in the legal nihilism that grips power structures at all levels, in the lack of a crime-prevention system, and in the inadequate legal base, serious shortcomings in law-enforcement practice, and the low clear-up rate for serious crimes. To a considerable extent the crime situation has gotten out of control. Statistics on crime and the reduction in its growth rate do not reflect the real state of affairs. The level of latent crime remains high. Many organs of power and administration at the center and at local level have opted out of the fight against crime and its prevention, deal with crime on a case-to-case basis, and fail to monitor the implementation of decisions that are reached. Internal affairs organs, prosecutor's offices, the tax police, and the customs services are failing to put a resolute stop to criminal activities or to ensure that punishment is inescapable. Irresponsibility and complacency are shown by officials to the victims of crime, while the criminals are shown leniency. There is no proper reaction to a considerable number of reports of crimes and other breaches of the law. Unfounded refusals to institute criminal proceedings have become widespread, along with cases being halted or ended. Many dangerous crimes remain unsolved. As a result, citizens' faith in the authorities' ability to protect them is being undermined. The crime situation and its demoralizing effect on all spheres of social life require the adoption of effective measures to change the situation and to ensure constant and unremitting attention to the crime problem by all organs of power and administration, the public, and the mass media. The curbing of aggressive and violent crime, the fundamental enhancement of the standard of all work to prevent and curtail manifestations of crime, and the strengthening of public order are urgent tasks. The strengthening of statehood, the striving for stabilization in political, economic, social, and spiritual spheres of society's life, and consideration of crime factors when implementing reform should be the abiding conditions for achieving real results. At the same time, all the measures that are being taken should be based on strict observance of legality and the norms of international law. Particular attention should be focused on improving the legal base and law-enforcement practice, on upgrading the level of law-enforcement organs' activity, and on involving all of society's healthy forces in the fight against crime. It is necessary to learn lessons and draw conclusions from the shortcomings and mistakes in crime policy and lawmaking activity. The participants in the parliamentary hearings believe that the process of adopting laws suffers from serious drawbacks and is not in line with practical requirements. Draft laws are often elaborated without the participation of or without consideration of the opinion of those departments which will have to implement the law, and there is a lack of expert criminological appraisal of draft laws. Legislators, the Russian Federation president's apparatus, and the Russian Federation Government in many instances operate in an uncoordinated way and duplicate the same draft laws. Russian Federation presidential edicts and Russian Federation Government normative acts do not always meet the requirements of legislation and the principle of the separation of powers. Many obsolete legal norms are still in existence, and issues that are very necessary for stepping up the fight against crime in its most important areas do not receive legislative solutions. The existing Criminal Code does not envisage criminal law measures for a whole number of dangerous activities that have become widespread. Legislation has not reinforced responsibility for the different types of organized crime, terrorism, and the creation of illegal armed formations. The lack of legal norms envisaging responsibility for dummy companies, sham bankruptcies, the "laundering" of criminal income, and other abuses is creating considerable difficulties in countering the black economy. Stepping up the fight against corruption will require the speediest legislative resolution of questions of responsibility for crimes committed by civil servants and officials at economic entities. Law-enforcement and control organs have limited access to the documents and materials they require. There is no reliable legal protection for victims, witnesses, and citizens who help the investigation and the courts, or for law-enforcement workers against criminal violence and threats. Certain norms relating to the execution of criminal legislation do not conform with the provisions of the Russian Federation Constitution, international acts on human rights, and the tasks and goals of criminal punishment. Prisons are in a very serious condition, particularly in material terms. Unless the necessary measures are urgently taken these institutions will be unable to fulfill their role at all. The Convention on Legal Aid and Legal Relations in Civil, Family, and Criminal Cases, which was signed by the CIS heads of state, has not been ratified for more than a year. Owing to the sluggishness of the Russian Justice and Foreign Ministries, the question of elaborating and concluding bilateral treaties on these issues with other states has not been resolved. The Russian Federation has still not acceded to European conventions on reciprocal legal aid, extradition, the "laundering" of criminal income, and a number of others. The questions of ensuring legality and public order, of preventing lawbreaking, and of protecting citizens' property, rights, and freedoms are not properly reflected in the activity of the Russian Federation Government and executive organs in Russian Federation components. The federal and other executive organs' lack of a centralized system for collecting and analyzing information on the crime situation and the observance of legality prevents a proper assessment of the situation from being made and the necessary measures from being taken in good time. The help provided to organs of local self-government and public associations is patently inadequate. The state of legal services at enterprises, institutions, and organizations, the auditing apparatus, and expert institutions prevents cases of violations of the law and abuses from being revealed in good time and often negates all the efforts made to expose criminals. Cadre, financial, material, and technical provision for law-enforcement and state control organs lags behind practical requirements. Social guarantees for workers directly involved in the fight against crime are inadequate. Many of them do not have the necessary housing and everyday conditions. Unjustified reorganizations and the lack of a careful approach to cadres have led to their lacking any confidence in the future, and have considerably weakened the operational investigation apparatus. A considerable number of skilled staffers have left over the past few years. Many militia workers and one in four investigative apparatus staffers at internal affairs organs do not have any legal education. The situation with cadres in the Prosecutor's Office remains serious. Higher and secondary legal educational establishments are failing to train enough specialists for law-enforcement organs. The neglect of this problem is making it harder to create highly professional apparatuses and is having a negative impact on activity to strengthen law and order and to fight crime. Attempts are being made to reform the Russian Federation Prosecutor's Office in the absence of an integrated concept for prosecutorial oversight. The desire to politicize Prosecutor's Office organs is doing a great deal of damage. The Russian Federation Prosecutor's Office has amassed the necessary experience of cooperation and collaboration with all branches of state power and other law-enforcement and control organs -- consequently, the proposals to make the Prosecutor's Office responsible for coordinating the activities of law-enforcement organs should be supported. At the same time, the attention of the Russian Federation Prosecutor's Office should be drawn to its inadequate organizational role in leading the organs under its jurisdiction. The fight against crime is being affected by shortcomings in the implementation of judicial reform. Certain provisions of the concept for judicial reform do not correspond to the realities of life. Citizens are justifiably angry about red tape, repeated instances of dangerous criminals being released from custody, and other serious mistakes in judicial activity. On the basis of Article 82 of the Standing Orders of the Federation Council, First Convocation, the participants in the parliamentary hearings consider it necessary: to recognize that the crime situation in the Russian Federation threatens the main foundations of Russian statehood, constitutional legality, and citizens' safety; to speedily adopt a federal program to step up the fight against crime in 1994-1995, and to prepare regional programs on that basis; to examine as a priority draft laws aimed at protecting citizens' constitutional rights against criminal infringement, and at opposing organized and violent crime. The priority draft laws should be the following: on amendments and additions to the RSFSR Criminal Code, the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure, and the RSFSR Code on Administrative Violations; on the fight against organized crime; on the fight against corruption; on the protection of witnesses, victims, and other persons assisting criminal proceedings; on state protection for judges and workers in law-enforcement and control organs; on the military militia (police) in the Russian Federation Armed Forces; and on the holding in custody of people suspected of and charged with crimes; to take measures to step up the role of executive organs and officials in crime prevention, the creation of effective mechanisms for monitoring their implementation of Russian Federation presidential edicts and their own decisions, and the strengthening of legal and auditing services and expert institutions; to set up at federal and regional level a system for coordinating the fight against crime, and to define within it the role and functions of executive organs in Russian Federation components and organs of local self-government; to examine the financing of crime-fighting programs as priority issues when drawing up and ratifying the federal budget, the budgets of Russian Federation components, and local budgets; to draw the attention of the leaders of law-enforcement and control organs to existing serious shortcomings in the fight against crime -- particularly in curtailing organized, armed crime and corruption, to the state of economic security and the protection of the consumer market, and to the activity of institutions from the criminal-law implementation system; to the need to improve the demands made on subordinate subunits in safeguarding citizens' constitutional rights and freedoms, and to adopt emergency measures to enhance the effective functioning of the entire law-enforcement system. The participants in the parliamentary hearings call on the mass media and their editorial colleagues and journalists to comprehensively and objectively cover the problems of the fight against crime, to actively reveal the causes of negative phenomena, to promote the formation in the population of respect for the law, and to enhance the prestige of staffers at law-enforcement organs.
