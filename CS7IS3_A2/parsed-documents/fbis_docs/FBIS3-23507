Makeyev General Designer Igor Ivanovich Velichko under the rubric "Conversion of the Sector": "Swords Into Plowshares"] [Text] An enormous quantity of weapons has been accumulated around the world. But detente has come, and a considerable portion of them have become unnecessary and subject to cutbacks; this includes ballistic missiles of various classes. Many types of them use highly toxic fuel components that we are not able to turn into harmless substances in large quantities. They could destroyed through burning in rocket engines attached to special installations, for example. But the harmful emissions and impurities would remain in the lower Earth atmosphere thereby. They could also be launched without warheads. It is difficult to monitor this process, it is true, and the problem of the falling stages also arises--consequently, with the same harmfulness. But one could also use these terrible weapons for peaceful purposes. Igor Ivanovich Velichko, general designer of the Machine Building KB [Design Bureau] imeni Academician V.P. Makeyev, talks about that. Our KB is the lead developer of ballistic missiles for submarines. The collective has created all of the SLBMs [submarine-launched ballistic missiles] that are in service with the Navy today. But the times are changing, and we have begun the creation of research and commercial rocket and space systems for the conversion of our activity. The wealth of scientific, technological and production potential of the developers and manufacturers of the SLBMs, as well as the program of utilizing the missiles after their retrofitting into research and commercial launch vehicles for spacecraft, serves as the basis for that. We are proceeding in several directions in cooperation with Russian enterprises and organizations, first and foremost on the path of the immediate utilization of all existing missiles for peaceful purposes--launches of the retrofitted missiles from the silos of operational submarines in conjunction with the Russian Navy. This is entirely realistic, because in accordance with the Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive Weapons and the agreement to develop it that was signed in 1992 by the presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States in Washington, a considerable quantity of missiles will be freed up. The modified RSM-25 (SS-N-6) in particular, which has received the name Zyb, launches recoverable craft on close to a vertical ballistic trajectory with a microgravitation level of 10[.sup]-4[/] g and a duration of weightlessness of 17 minutes. Zyb missiles are launched from submarines on the battlefields of the Northern (area of the city of Arkhangelsk) and Eastern (area of Kamchatka) test ranges, equipped with measuring instruments, search systems and for the prompt delivery of the descent craft that have landed. It is namely the microgravitation that makes it possible to realize new technologies. Our KB, in conjunction with the Kompozit NPO [Scientific-Production Association] and the Center for Space Biotechnology, has developed two types of craft: --a technological module weighing 450 kg, with an installation accommodated in it for trying out processes to obtain semiconductor materials with improved crystalline structures, superconducting alloys and other materials; --a biotechnological module weighing 650 kg, to try out technologies for cleaning biological compounds and the commercial manufacture of especially pure biological and medicinal compounds using the method of electrophoresis. We conducted the first experimental launch of the Zyb missile at the end of 1991 at the Northern Test Range of the Navy, with a technological module fitted with 15 ovens containing quartz ampules with various sets of initial materials. The chain of preparation, launch and recovery of the module was checked out, with the necessary functional conditions for the special technological equipment ensured. We now have the first materials that were manufactured under the conditions of the flight of a submarine-launched ballistic missile. One of the samples is a silicon crystal with a high level of germanium doping, grown at a speed of 10 mm/minute--that is, an order of magnitude greater than under Earth conditions. Quick analysis showed that these are defect-free monocrystals, 10--30 mm in length and on the order of 12 mm in diameter, with a homogeneous distribution of impurities. Samples of metals and alloys with new properties were also obtained. The regular operations of the Zyb missiles in the interests of space technologies should begin in the middle of this year. Retrofitted RSM-40 Vysota (SS-N-8) and RSM-50 Volna (SS-N-18) missiles could be used for their launch from submarines, where necessary, to increase the time the modules are under weightless conditions to 30 minutes and the amount of technological equipment. The Bumerang and Chizh orbital recoverable craft created at our KB will be used in the future. They will be placed into orbit by more powerful missile systems, and will have a period of active existence of up to several dozen days. The Russian Space Agency (RKA) is financing and supporting the work on the space technologies. The thrust of the work is the creation of the refitted Shtil-1 missile based on the RSM-54 (SS-N-23) series-produced missile, a commercial system for the launch of "small" satellites from our ground launch complex near the city of Arkhangelsk, which used to be used for testing combat missiles. The mass of a payload placed into orbit by this missile, with an inclination of 70ï¿½ and an altitude of 500--700 km, is 250--300 kg, with a volume of 1.5 m[.sup]3[/]. The deployment of a system of personal satellite communications, intended for the transmission of text, digital and facsimile messages using the principle of "subscriber--spacecraft--subscriber" or the method of "electronic mail," is being placed using the Shtil launch vehicle in 1994-95. The Uralkosmos joint-stock company, formed by a group of industrial enterprises in the defense complex, banks and organizations of potential customers, is engaged in the realization of this project. Launches of the Shtil-3N launch vehicle, which is a variation of a more profound modification of the series-produced RSM-54 (the warhead compartment and engine for the separation of the warheads have been replaced with a more spacious payload compartment and new orbital-insertion engines), could be made from the ground launch complex starting in 1995. Figure We consider the key element to be the development of a rocket system--the Aerokosmos project--that is accommodated on the An-124 and Il-76 aircraft. This system will make possible the efficient launch of satellites from any point in the airspace. The RSM-54 submarine-launched ballistic missile has been refitted as a commercial launch vehicle for air launching. A great deal of scientific research and experimental work has been done so far, and this project is moving into the stage of development of the working documentation. We feel that our KB is very ready for the implementation of this plan. The Aerokosmos joint-stock company has been formed for its realization (in 1995 and the start of commercial operation in 1996), and agreement has been reached for its support on the part of the RKA. The technical essence of the project is as follows. The missile is accommodated inside a transport aircraft on a launch platform in a horizontal position, and is ejected using a parachute system, after which it separates from the platform with the simultaneous ignition of the engines. The missile can hold a satellite up to 1,000 kg in mass in a volume of 3.5 m[.sup]3[/] (dimensions of 1.6 meters in diameter and 2.3 meters in length). The mass of a satellite is 500 kg when placed in a polar orbit of 700 km in altitude. The retrofitting of the RSM-52 (SS-N-20) missiles will be completed in 1997, and will make it possible to put payloads of 1,000 kg into polar orbits 800 km in altitude in a compartment volume of 4 m[.sup]3[/] with launch from an An-124 aircraft. All of the modified SLBMs described are in the class of light launch vehicles, and serve for the launch of light payloads (up to one tonne) into space or the upper layers of the atmosphere. Research into the market for payloads has indeed shown substantial growth in the need for small spacecraft, including low-orbit communications satellites and spacecraft for the system of global ecological safety, among others. There could be a need for about 300 such satellites before the year 2000. It would hardly be expedient for them to be launched several at a time by one heavier rocket or shuttle craft, due to their lower efficiency, higher cost and lesser accessibility to many countries that do not have their own missile and space technology. Our program, which envisages the attraction of funds from domestic commercial structures and foreign investors, has been approved by the government of the Russian Federation. A decree on this question was signed by President B. Yeltsin in June of 1992. It must be said that we have a vested interest in attracting foreign partners, on a mutually advantageous basis, due to the difficulties in financing large-scale elements of the program using Russian domestic sources. The restrictions on the launch of foreign satellites in which American high technology is used by Russian launch vehicles must be removed as soon as possible for successful international collaboration in the realm of space research. Moreover, even though the fundamental opportunities for the use of strategic launch vehicles are inherent in the START Treaty, they must be expanded. Third countries in particular must be granted the right to conclude agreements for the use of such retrofitted Russian or American missiles. The Russian Federation and United States must be permitted to launch satellites for civilian purposes from mothballed military launch positions--submarines, ships, aircraft and from land. The restrictions on the quantity of retrofitted missiles and their launches would best be removed. Things should be done to see that the strategic defensive potential being freed up begins to work in the interests of the world community. COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.
