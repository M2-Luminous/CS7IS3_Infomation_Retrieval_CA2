In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT he added that "Jordan was aware early on of the dangers of an armed conflict in Yemen. It made great efforts with the two parties to the Yemeni crisis until we held a conference to sign the Pledge and Accord Document, which was tantamount to a defusing of the fighting and a step toward dialogue and a peaceful understanding. It was in response to a written request from President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid."
