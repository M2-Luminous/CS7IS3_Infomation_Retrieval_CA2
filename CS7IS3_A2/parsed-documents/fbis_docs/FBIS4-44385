Projections by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) showed that "recorded GDP" could be expected to show positive growth by 1995 in most transition countries outside the Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former USSR. Poland was likely to grow by 4.0 percent this year for the second year running and should achieve at least a 3.0 percent rate in 1995, when the Czech Republic could be growing by 5.0 percent after a positive 1994 rate of 2.0 percent. Hungary was expected to grow by a modest 1.0 percent this year, rising to 2.0 percent in 1995, while "zero growth" rather than continued contraction was expected for 1994 in the Slovak Republic, Bulgaria and Romania. In the latter two countries, however, stagnation could continue in 1995, the OECD said in its semi-annual Economic Outlook. However, it said, in addition to Poland, with 1993 GDP growth of 4.0 percent, Hungary and the Czech Republic could in reality have reached the "turning point" last year, when output also rose in Estonia and Latvia. This assessment was based on the view that private sector activity, "likely to be growing fast" in most countries, was "under-recorded" throughout the area, it said. A "probably substantial portion of this activity is not recorded in the national accounts," it said. According to some studies, private sector activity may now generate over 50 percent of GDP in the region. If this had been fully reflected in the accounts, the Czech Republic and Hungary would "probably" have shown positive growth last year, it said. "Unrecorded activity creates more serious problems than statistical quirks" because "it cannot easily be taxed," the OECD said, adding that tax avoidance or evasion was "a principal reason for its growth." In its review of developments in the region, the OECD said inflation was now generally declining in East and Central European countries, alhough it remained high by Western standards. The Czech Republic had the lowest inflation level, projected at around 11 percent this year and 10 percent in 1995, while Romania, at the upper end, was expected to record rates of 170 and 80 percent respectively. The Czech Republic also had the healthiest public finances, with its budget in balance, while most of the countries were still struggling with the budgetary consequences of the transition from direct state control. Their budget deficits remain high, ranging from 8.0 percent of GDP in Bulgaria and Hungary to 4.0 percent in Poland and Romania, and are likely to remain undder "pressure" for several years. These problems are also reflected in the financial sector, marked almost everywhere by "under-capitalized banks, bad debts, inter-enterprise arrears and difficulties in providing finance for new private enterprise," the report said. The OECD said exports were expected to remain "an important engine of growth" in the transition countries despite non-tariff obstacles in Western markets. Their combined current account deficit is likely to widen this year to 9.2 billion dollars from 8.4 bn in 1993, and might improve slightly to last year's level in 1995.
