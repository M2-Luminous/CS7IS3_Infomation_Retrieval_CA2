The central issue was Bosnia and Russia's new position regarding the drama in the Balkans. Here is a report from Giuseppe De Carli: [De Carli] This was a strictly private meeting without speeches or official communiques, but the arrival at the Vatican of the rising star of the Yeltsin government, Viktor Chernomyrdin, was far from routine. John Paul II wanted to find out about the new Russian prime minister's intentions and, above all, to jointly evaluate the position to be taken with regard to the drama in Bosnia. Here, we must say, the Vatican and Russia have positions that are far apart and, in some respects, irreconcilable. In the last few weeks, the governments of the West have learned that Russia is against any use of force. Yeltsin has asked for the Security Council to be convened and has insisted on a political solution to the crisis in the Balkans. The chief cause for concern is Russia's pro-Serbian line. It is no longer West against East, but the Christian world against the Muslim world. This is not the Pope's position. He is desperately trying to build bridges between Christians and Muslims in order to find common grounds for tolerance. The Vatican is particularly concerned about the mood of Islamic nations angrily watching Europe's indifference towards the massacre of Bosnian Moslems. John Paul II once again told Chernomyrdin that after the collapse of the walls, it is absurd to be building new ones using the spur of nationalism and conflicting religious beliefs. According to official sources, the Russian prime minister listened attentively and was receptive to this line of reasoning.
