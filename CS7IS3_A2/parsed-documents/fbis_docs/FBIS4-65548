If the land cuts its share of HWWA's basic funding, the Federal Government may follow suit. Kantzenbach's worries are well-founded. In Hamburg's Office for Science and Research, which has jurisdiction over HWWA, it is said that the Institute "is included in the austerity considerations." Nothing is final yet, and Kantzenbach hopes for something definite from the HWWA advisory board meeting in June. Its chairman, Hamburg's science senator, goes in for large-scale savings: The university's personnel costs alone are to drop by 7 or 8 million German marks [DM], which amounts to 10 or 15 percent per sector. If the land cuts the subsidy to HWWA, the Federal Government will probably also lower its contribution so that the 50:50 financing is preserved. It could even get worse. It is being pointed out by the Federal Economics Ministry (BMWi) that even today, one-fourth of HWWA researchers do not work in science, but rather for the information center. If the importance of research in the plan is receding, one "must examine" whether the general agreement between the Federal Government and laender on joint research funding, according to Article 91b of the Basic Law, still applies to HWWA. Spelled out: Bonn might withdraw completely and leave the fate of the renowned HWWA to the Hanseatic city. The Hamburg Institute Holds Second Place in Basic Funding This year, the institute receives DM9.96 million each from the Federal Government and the land. Only the IfW in Kiel receives more; all other large economic research institutes must make do with fewer funds. Kantzenbach, who has been heading the HWWA since 1989, is known to any economics student who has even scratched the surface on the theory of competition. In his dissertation the Hannoverian, born 1931, proclaimed the thesis that competition is fiercest among a given group of competitors who manufacture similar products and have an overview of the market. Economists call that: "broad oligopoly with limited product homogeneity and market transparency." In 1967, Kantzenbach became a professor at the University of Frankfurt. There the SPD [Social Democratic Party] member--elected as representative of the liberal wing of professors and teaching assistants--held the office of president from 1971 to 1975. Subsequently he moved to the University of Hamburg. Following tradition, he remained a professor there even after assuming office at the HWWA. As a member of the Commission on Monopoly (1974 to 1986) and its chairman (as of 1979), Kantzenbach criticized the megafusion of Daimler and AEG, as well as the merger of Daimler and MBB. For over a year now, the HWWA has had a scientific advisory board composed of five professors, thus fulfilling an old demand by the Scientific Council. Presidents of other institutes long opposed the additional tutelage; now all six economic research institutes have an advisory council. Kantzenbach makes the best of it: The advisory board meetings "are interesting for me personally," and the research departments are forced "to think about themselves." One of the first pieces of advice by the external scientists was to establish a new research group for "regulation, industrial economics, and competition." It was occasioned by the reports on the situation of competition in the new laender prepared for the economics ministry. Competition specialist Kantzenbach summarizes tersely the essence of the observations: With the exception of local markets, such as for newspapers and sugar, competition in Germany "in no way was intensified" by unification. In early May, the institute will devote a conference to Germany as a business location, because this "political slogan" now stands for a number of economic problems, says Kantzenbach. In addition to short-term foreign exchange rate problems, it concerns investment incentives, profitability, research and development, and employment. The moderate wage agreements, "economically tenable," must be differentiated more according to quality, sectors and regions. But tax policy must then balance social hardships. Political "crash programs" cannot achieve the link-up with high technology. Instead of conducting "industrial policy par excellence" as in the case of Transrapid, the state should put more funds into the basic research of institutes and universities. The "miserable" training conditions of students also need urgent improvement. The HWWA research departments, "Economy, Money, and Public Finances" as well as "Economic Structure and Economic Order," are nationally oriented. Four of a total of six departments deal with international issues: "World Economy," "Economic and Financial Relations Between Industrial Countries," "Development Policy and Integration of Developing Countries," as well as "Economic Systems and Relations of East European Countries." Banks above all work with the HWWA index for raw material prices. On a daily basis, researchers update the index to the latest stock market quotations and use it to compute prior work [costs] and the terms of trade. The Hamburg institute reports regularly to the BMWi on the economic situation in the Baltic states as well as St. Petersburg and Koenigsberg [Kaliningrad]. Information on these regions encountered lively interest, especially in enterprises. The HWWA earns annually DM325,000 by this commission--a small contribution to the total budget which amounted to DM20.3 million in 1993. Personnel costs alone were DM16.2 million. In addition to the basic funding, the HWWA had additional revenues of DM2.1 million through commissioned work. Three-fourths of the reports were ordered by public authorities, among them the BMWi alone for DM1.47 million. If one measures the outside funds ratio against the overall budget, it amounts to only 10.3 percent. But according to Kantzenbach's figures, the research budget plus proportionate costs for administration amounts to only DM9.5 million. Computed on this basis, the share earned by 53 scientists through expert opinions increases to 22 percent. Of 221 Staff Members 130 Work for the Info Center The remainder of the budget funds, about DM9 million, goes to the HWWA Information Center which employs 130 of a total of 221 HWWA staff members. The library houses over a million volumes. Last year 72,300 people utilized this scientific resource. In addition, there is the press documentation which stores 17.3 million articles. One of the Info center's tasks is also advising enterprises. For that, fees of about DM400,000 were collected in 1993. The collection of press clippings and books was the institute's original task when it was founded in 1908 as the central department of the Colonial Institute in Hamburg. In the Weimar Republic, it was given the name of "Hamburg's World Economy Archive" (HWWA). After 1945 it also turned to more practical research; as of 1970 this was expressed in the new name, "HWWA Institute for Economic Research-Hamburg." The institute publishes research results regularly in the periodicals WIRTSCHAFTSDIENST (monthly), INTERECONOMICS (bimonthly), and FINANZIERUNG UND ENTWICKLUNG (quarterly). KONJUNKTUR VON MORGEN appears every two weeks. To provide the institute with more flexibility, the Hamburg senate and the BMWi in 1991 wanted to turn the HWWA agency into a [registered] association. All other economic research institutes are organized under this private legal form, with the exception of the university institute, IfW. The staff violently opposed the plans. They feared deterioration of their working conditions; furthermore, the institute even as "e.V." [registered association] would not be granted additional rights. The protest was successful, and the HWWA remained an agency.
