Money is tight and the JAS [multirole combat aircraft] project, with the high rate of exchange of the dollar and the low rate of exchange for the krona, threatens to explode the defense forces' overall budget. How will you sort all this out? [Wiktorin] After the 1992 Defense Bill came the crisis package, which reduced our scope for action. Then there was the Navy's strained budget and the uncertainties of the price compensation system that could possibly affect the Jas project. These are uncertainty factors affecting how we are to deal with things. We should not be raising problems at the present time, for when I look around in the defense forces I see optimism for the future, drive, professional colleagues, and a strong sense of loyalty. I think that we will be able to comply with the Defense Bill if we are not hit by further cuts. Within the framework of an almost unchanged budget, we have cut the organization by almost one-third, with the concomitant stresses for personnel. Now we need peace and quiet in which to work, order and stability to put into practice the decisions already made. [Olofson] Do you really believe that the defense forces will be able to afford to modernize 16 Army brigades? [Wiktorin] The Defense Bill says that 16 brigades are to be modernized up to the end of the century. I am assuming that the decision reached by the Riksdag remains in force. There is no other thrust I know of. [Olofson] Since 1987 the number of Army brigades has fallen from 29 to 16. The Social Democrats, with a majority of voters behind them, are proposing 8 to 10 brigades. Sweden's land area is large, its coast long. Are you prepared to administer just any old watered-down military organization? [Wiktorin] Regardless of the color of the government it has the responsibility for the security of the country. It is impossible to water down the Army's wartime organization just any way. If the amount of money is cut considerably we will not be able to modernize and sharpen the defense forces that remain. We would then be in a very bad position. It is my view that we are very close to the point of no return. [Olofson] But is it not the case, Owe Wiktorin, that if the modernization of the Armed Forces is to continue their concrete organization must become even smaller? [Wiktorin] I do not rule out the possibility that more such steps could come; this depends to some extent on technical developments and on what solutions we can find together. Sixteen brigades, 16 Air Force divisions are not fixed figures for me. Regardless of whether we have an increased, unchanged, or reduced budget it is possible that we might want to reduce the number of units so that they are sufficiently sharp. It is the overall defense strength and potential in a new security situation that is decisive. Increases in quality must continue. [Olofson] You have proposed a new sort of doctrine, the three-dimensional war, which requires quicker and more mobile units with different sorts of defense missions. Does this mean that you advocate attack helicopters? [Wiktorin] If we have fewer units we will have to compensate for that weakness with increased mobility. Otherwise things do not fit together. We would not be able to defend the whole country. An orientation involving increased mobility was laid down in part in the 1992 Defense Bill. That was when the decision for 120 mobile tanks was taken and we hope to receive an additional 80 in a later option. Attack helicopters are a very desirable complement, but given the budget we have today reflection is needed. It is doubtful whether we can afford these expensive systems at the present time, but studies are being carried out. For the time being at least we can make do with more powerful engines in the lightweight SK-60 attack aircraft. It is true that they cannot do everything that helicopters can, but they can do quite a lot. [Olofson] We taxpayers pay out 40 billion a year to the defense forces. But what do we actually get to know about the defense forces' capacity and what we in the end get for our money? [Wiktorin] After the far-reaching changes in Central Europe and Russia we can probably sleep pretty soundly at night. The problem is that the situation could change rapidly, and as the next supreme commander I would like us to be in an even better position. But we are strong in several areas. There is much of which we can be proud in the defense forces, but it is so un-Swedish to give oneself a pat on the back. International experts shower words of praise on Swedish UN soldiers. Our defense industry has never been at such a high technical level as it is now. We must defend it. [Olofson] In your years as chief of the defense staff in Stockholm and military commander in southern Sweden did you know about the defense forces' secret cooperation with NATO countries? [Wiktorin] During my career as an officer I have never had any impression or indication that we officers had overstepped the limits of the security policy decided on by the government and Riksdag. [Olofson] The whole of the Swedish people has been thought to have been duped; there has never been any real neutrality to speak of, has there? [Wiktorin] I have read the report of the commission on neutrality policy with great interest and note that an overwhelming amount of information exists at the political level, in defense committees and elsewhere, but no one debated the matter. On a broad front there was a "lid-on" approach that we can be surprised by and criticize. After all we do want an open society. [Olofson] Will you, like your predecessor, Bengt Gustafsson, be taking the step in the direction of a Nordic defense alliance? [Wiktorin] In the current situation I see no base for such an alliance; if such an alliance does come about, it is a process that will have to be thrashed out in a political debate. On the other hand I want a continuation and deepening of the positive defense cooperation we already have in the Nordic area, in the materiel field, for example. [Olofson] Have you ever had any doubts about the submarine violations? [Wiktorin] Yes, about one or two individual events, but not the overall picture. I have consciously adopted a doubting and critical approach in order to be as unbiased as possible when looking at analyses and reports. [Olofson] What orientation does the Swedish military intelligence service have after the fall of the Warsaw Pact? [Wiktorin] In the past few years it has to a large extent followed the withdrawal of troops from the Baltic region. The new world that is now emerging has unfortunately led to a number of new sources of conflict that we should also study. [Olofson] MUST [Military Intelligence and Security Service], the military intelligence service, claims that it will take Russia at least 10 years to build up a new military force with invasion capability. Is this not to underestimate the Russians' potential? [Wiktorin] It will probably take 10 years to build up the military capacity that the former Soviet Union had. But the resources for a directed military attack -- nuclear arms, aircraft, tanks, and conventional arms -- are still there on a frightening scale. Russia's problems are probably more to do with low morale and a lack of discipline that lead to a deterioration in the capacity to develop military effectiveness on a large scale. It is not easy today to put forward long-term prognoses for developments in Russia. Things could move off in any direction at all and we should probably accept this uncertainty . [Olofson] Have you ever noted that the defense industry, the intelligence service, and the whole of the military establishment have an interest in upholding a threat scenario? [Wiktorin] Personally I have no need of this. If the world moves in a peaceful direction and the surrounding world disarms, we should do so too. There is no reason to maintain expensive defense forces as a goal in itself. I am no preserver of organizations. [Olofson] Today the defense forces are too little in favor of conscription. Many people want to do their national service, but are not allowed to, others do not, but are forced to. How do you want to solve this problem? [Wiktorin] I am an advocate of universal conscription, not a professional army. But combat units have to have quality and training. Already today it is impossible within the defense budget we have to go back to full universal conscription. This would be too expensive and would lead to excessive numbers and the quality side of training would be lost. Nevertheless, if we choose to retain universal conscription, a solution which could help to solve the problems is short-term training for conscripts lasting two to three months for guard duties in the framework of the Home Guard, for example. But I will not be heavy-handed in pushing the call for short-term training. The operational need militarily for guards with short-term training is not particularly great. Political talks about conscription, about how we should solve the problems, should be given greater depth. A new system of conscription will not be on the agenda until after 1997.
