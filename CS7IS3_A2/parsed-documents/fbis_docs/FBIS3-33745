The election is the first test of the government's popularity since presidential elections in 1992. The opposition has cried foul, alleging that voters had been bused into the towns from the countryside and that the ink used to mark the (?sums) of voters wasn't indelible. For their part, the government says the opposition forged identity cards. Now as Shayk Bekaye reports in this telex from Nouakchott, the first results are out: [Begin studio announcer recording] The ruling party in Mauritania has taken the lead in local elections. Provisional results give President Ould Taya's Democratic and Social Republican Party, PRDS, 90 percent of seats in rural districts, except in the south where there are a majority of black Mauritanians who voted for the Union of Democratic Forces, the main opposition grouping. The opposition did much better in the cities. In Noaukchott and Nouadhibou, there will be a second round of voting on Friday [4 February] as no party managed to win an outright majority. The opposition also forced a second round in urban areas of the east, a surprise for observers, who had expected the ruling party to do well. The PRDS did all it could to win in urban centers, mobilizing massive financial and material resources and the result is seen as setback for the popularity of Ould Taya. Officials of his party were keen to point out that conditions have changed since 1992, when the government was accused of malpractice in presidential elections. Yesterday's voting brought accusations of cheating on all sides. Independent observers said some people were voting more than once but said both government and opposition supporters were involved.
