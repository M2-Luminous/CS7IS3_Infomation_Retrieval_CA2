The heads of the republics participating in the meeting adopted the following statement: "We participants in the meeting with the Russian Federation president, representing the leadership of republics within the Russian Federation, aspiring to stability and the affirmation of the traditions of dialogue, compromise, and partnership in politics, declare our support for the idea of ensuring civil peace and accord in our multiethnic country at a crucial stage in its history. "Together with the Russian Federation president, we believe that the signing of the Agreement on Achieving Civil Accord in Russia should demonstrate to Russians that politicians, state institutions, and Russian Federation components are capable of finding common positions for the effective settlement of urgent and socially important tasks within the framework of economic and social transformations. Political ambitions, hostility, and extremism in federal relations may hinder the quest for a joint way out of the crisis, and undermine trust in organs of power at all levels. "We appeal to state, political, and social circles in Russia to assume responsibility for the stable and consistent development of our country, and to become involved in the concluding process of the preparation and signing of the agreement." dated] Moscow, The Kremlin, 21 April 1994
