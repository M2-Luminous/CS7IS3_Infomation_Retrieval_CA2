The minister said: "It might be legal but it is not moral." He made these comments during the ceremony held to say farewell to the ensigns who left on a trip by the "Brasil" school-vessel. He included the military among a large number of people who "do not accept a society in which a group of people is always favored." He added, however, that there will be no rebellion in the barracks. In Serpa's opinion, the government should not give in to pressure exerted by Congress and the Federal Supreme Court (STF). "If we believe that the Executive Branch must meet all requests, there will be no more independence among the powers and the Executive Branch will be subdued by the other powers." He refused, however, to suggest a solution to the crisis. "I do not want to increase the number of rumors," he said. "I want to be the fireman and not the arsonist." Minister Serpa made a point of emphasizing that the note released by Planalto Palace on 18 March should be interpreted "only as criticism" of Congress and the STF. He admitted that the military is dissatisfied with low salaries, but asserted that the atmosphere in the barracks is "entirely normal." He also said he does not agree with the position of the Guararapes Group, which comprises retired officers who, in addition to requesting that Congress be closed, spoke in favor of holding elections before the scheduled date. "I do not agree with them," he asserted. "This is not the moment to close anything." He supported the group's right to publicly express its members' opinions, but asserted that their opinion does not reflect the ideas of all retired officers.
