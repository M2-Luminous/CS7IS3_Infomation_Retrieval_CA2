FR940627-0-00164 FR940627-0-00019 This discussion assumes that relevant, high-quality statistical analyses have been done to permit the negative test results to be properly evaluated and interpreted. The statistical analyses recommended for Tier 2, including determination of Type I and II error (as discussed in Section IX.B.1), should enable reasonable conclusions to be drawn as to the significance of negative findings. Factors to be taken into account include the toxicological nature of the findings and the exposure levels used in the test. For example, if the statistical analyses are applied to a ``severe'' endpoint (e.g., major fetal abnormalities, major lung pathology, etc.) and the exposure in question is moderate, then a relatively low Type II error level may be appropriate. In contrast, if a high concentration limit test causes a relatively minor effect (e.g., a small change in estrous cyclicity), a higher Type II error may be allowed, effectively increasing the chance of false negative conclusions. 4. Evaluation of Tier 2 Results The specific outcomes which will be considered positive and negative results for each Tier 2 test were mentioned briefly in the previous descriptions of Tier 2 requirements (see Section VIII.B) and are defined and interpreted more precisely in the regulatory text of this final rule. For example, three primary assays (i.e., Salmonella, MN, and SCE) are included in Tier 2 for the screening of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity. As compared with appropriate controls, a statistically significant concentration-related positive response in any one of these assays could be cause for concern, as will be positive outcomes for at least one concentration in two or more of these tests. Such outcomes will be indicative of mutagenic and/or carcinogenic risk. Positive results will also indicate that the emissions could initiate some of the mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis. However, these results will generally not in themselves be sufficient to determine whether the emissions were in fact carcinogenic because the development of cancer is a multi-step process. Depending on the internal and historical consistency of the results and their relationship to projected exposures, further testing might be required to determine the significance of the mutagenic and/or carcinogenic activity/risks in human populations exposed by inhalation. In contrast, if no statistically significant results are obtained in the three assays and no conflicting results are found in the literature or in any other Tier 2 tests, then Tier 3 follow-up of potential carcinogenic/mutagenic effects is not likely to be required. To take another example, determination of the need to investigate further reproductive or teratogenic risks will take into account the outcome of the results of the estrous cyclicity measurements, the histopathological evaluation of reproductive organs, the outcome of the fertility screen, and the outcome of the teratogenicity evaluation. If negative results are obtained in the above evaluations (according to statistically sound principles), and if these results are not refuted by the existing literature, then additional testing is not likely to be required at the Tier 3 level for reproductive or teratogenic effects. Positive results for the teratogenicity study will include a decrease in neonatal viability relative to that in control studies, a significant change in the proportion of viable male versus female fetuses or offspring, the presence of soft tissue or skeletal abnormalities, and an increased rate of embryonic or fetal resorption. Other positive outcomes related to reproductive effects, such as decreased fertility, decreased litter size, abnormal changes in vaginal cytology or reproductive organ histopathology, will be indicative of hazards to the adult reproductive systems. The need for additional evaluation under Tier 3 will depend on the specificity, severity, and consistency of results, the presence or absence of a concentration-effect relationship, and the significance of these outcomes in view of projected exposures. The greater the remaining uncertainty regarding the risk of reproductive or teratogenic effects after analysis of such factors, the higher will be the likelihood that Tier 3 will be required. Similarly, consistent negative results (according to statistically sound principles) obtained in other Tier 2 tests, in the absence of significant related concerns raised in the literature, will (in all likelihood) make Tier 3 unnecessary. If adverse effects are found at Tier 2 and/or reported in the literature, EPA will determine if Tier 3 follow-up is required by attempting to evaluate the nature, severity, and significance of the findings in light of the likely exposures. If EPA determines that Tier 3 testing is required to resolve the remaining uncertainties, the Tier 3 requirements will reflect both positive and negative results. For example, if the results of Tier 2 were positive for pulmonary effects but negative for neurotoxicity (according to criteria discussed earlier), and if these results were consistent with the literature, only pulmonary toxicity would be a likely candidate for Tier 3 follow-up testing. C. Potential Tier 3 Tests To be most cost-effective, Tier 3 testing will be designed to address specific data gaps regarding health effects endpoints of concern or health and environment-related issues requiring further analysis. For instance, Tier 3 requirements could potentially include further emission characterization procedures, perhaps involving additional vehicles and/or more rigorous pre-conditioning methods, to identify and quantify harmful emission products with greater precision. Higher-order modeling calculations or exposure field studies could be required to resolve uncertainties in the Tier 1 emissions exposure information. Health or welfare effects testing requirements will be aimed at providing sufficient information to make sound conclusions about the degree of health or welfare risk. If more than one endpoint is of concern, EPA will attempt to reduce testing costs by permitting combined protocols insofar as possible.
