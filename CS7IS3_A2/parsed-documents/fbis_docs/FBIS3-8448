Pavol Kanis, from the Party of the Democratic Left, asked the prime minister to address parliament. [Begin Meciar recording] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, esteemed Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to take the opportunity given to me by parliament to speak. This did not use to be the habit in these rooms in the past. I have, however, been unable to acquaint myself with the speech by the president. I was receiving the World Jewish Congress's delegation during his address. There is no written record (?of his speech). The government members were acquainted with the speech. I was, unfortunately, present at the discussion (?here in the back of this hall), and, hence, I missed the government session. I do not even have the papers that the government has. I would consider it an honor to speak about these matters tomorrow. But do not ask me to speak today. I am not familiar with the issue on which I am to express an opinion. [end recording] [Announcer] We are ready to broadcast the prime minister's speech in a live relay on ST2 tomorrow. [passage omitted]
