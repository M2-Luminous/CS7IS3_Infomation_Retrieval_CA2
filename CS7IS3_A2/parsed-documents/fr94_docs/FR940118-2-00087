FR940118-2-00087 FR940118-2-00054 Entergy Operations, Inc.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing [Docket No. 50&hyph;458] The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;47 issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee) for operation of the River Bend Station located in St. Francisville, LA. The proposed amendment would grant one-time extensions for certain technical specification (TS) surveillances which are currently required to be performed beginning February 16, 1994. The licensee is requesting extension of the surveillance intervals because the current operating cycle has been extended, impacting the required completion dates for these surveillances. Performance of these surveillances within the required intervals would require that the plant be placed in an undesirable operating configuration, or would necessitate a plant shutdown. The surveillances for which extensions have been requested will be performed during the fifth refueling outage, scheduled to begin on April 16, 1994. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The licensee's amendment request dated December 8, 1993, contains a detailed list of the specific surveillances for which it is requesting extensions. For the purposes of addressing the no significant hazards consideration determination, the staff has categorized the surveillances by groups in the following discussion. The licensee's determination of no significant hazards is summarized below: 1. The proposed change would not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The first group of surveillances includes calibration, logic system functional testing (LSFT), and response time testing of reactor protection system (RPS), isolation actuation system, and emergency core cooling system (ECCS) instrumentation; and calibration of control rod block, remote shutdown and accident monitoring, and feedwater system/main turbine trip system instrumentation. The licensee identified vendor and topical reports which support longer surveillance intervals for certain instruments and elimination of surveillance tests from TS for other instruments. The licensee also stated that observed drift characteristics, as well as the presence of redundant and diverse channels for most of the affected instrumentation, support extension of these surveillance intervals. The affected surveillances are associated with equipment that is also subject to channel checks and/or functional tests which will continue to be performed during the extension period and should ensure that these systems will perform as designed. Based on the above, no significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident would occur as a result of extending the surveillance intervals by the relatively short time periods requested. The next group of surveillances concern demonstration of automatic isolation of reactor water cleanup (RWCU) system containment isolation valves on receipt of an isolation test signal. Due to redundancy provided in the design of the penetrations, periodic testing of the containment isolation system performed during power operation, and the short period of time for which the interval extension is requested, no significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident would occur as a result of extending this surveillance interval. The third group of surveillances concern inspection, service tests, and performance tests of dc batteries; and load tests of the battery chargers. Due to the fact that the testing history for the batteries and chargers has been good, the (nominally) weekly pilot cell data has indicated no degradation, and the short period of time the interval is being extended, no significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident would occur as a result of extending these surveillance intervals.
