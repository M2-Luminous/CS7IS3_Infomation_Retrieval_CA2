Its industrial structure and regional distribution of industries will be readjusted. Enterprises in the urban areas that cause environmental pollution and bother local residents will be relocated to the south-east of the city. New development zones and new industrial projects can not be started unless approved in accordance to the environmental appraisal system. The 15-year blueprint also rules that new and advanced technology and equipment should be used to avoid air pollution. Industrial sectors with high economic returns and lower pollution will be granted priority. A group of infrastructure facilities to treat existing pollution in water, air, refuse and noise will be constructed, according to the plan, which was recently adopted by the municipal government. Some 12 large ventures that bring severe water pollution will be renovated and a series of sewage water treatment plants will be constructed. Smog and other forms of air pollution will be put under control. Solid garbage treatment plants and garbage-burning electric power plants will be built. By 2005, air and water pollution will be effectively curbed and the recycling rate of solid waste will reach 80 percent. Green-coverage will top 45 percent by then. Noise pollution in urban areas will be reduced, according to the plan. A major city in the Pearl River Delta, with urban population topping 3.73 million, Guangzhou has witnessed a rapid growth in its economy in the past few years. Last year, the city achieved a total industrial output value of 92.679 billion yuan, up 30.44 percent compared with the previous year. However, environmental problems have also become increasingly serious. Air pollution due to the burning of coal and exhaust emissions worsened. River water is widely contaminated with organic substances, and solid waste has increased rapidly, local officials said.
