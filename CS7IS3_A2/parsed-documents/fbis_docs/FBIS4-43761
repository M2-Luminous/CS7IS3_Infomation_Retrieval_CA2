However, those who are convinced that "nothing can happen" should also be considered.... Understanding their approach is impossible. Are they truly convinced that nothing can happen? That the profundamentalist forces, which are led by the Prosperity Party, cannot come to power in the future and that those forces will not remove the democratic system if they do? If that is the way they look at things, then are they unable to see the situation in the countries that have adopted the "Islamic way of life?" Unfortunately, the situation cannot be explained to them. No matter what you say, they will respond: "Do not worry, nothing can happen." That will make you feel frantic. At least, that is how I feel because I do not believe that a threat can be described as "small" or "unimportant." If a problem poses a "threat," then a solution must be found to it. However, the view Speaker of the Grand National Assembly Husamettin Cindoruk has expressed on the matter is as follows: "The anxiety on the secular system's future is baseless. Our people will defend secularism. The people will support us to defend secularism if we effectively explain what it means to them. The secular system is guaranteed not only by the Constitution but also by the people." That is a baseless view that conflicts with reality. It has made me feel that I am among officials who are deaf and dumb. Yes, that view conflicts with reality. Was Husamettin Cindoruk not in Turkey when the elections were held on 27 March? If not, was he not informed of the outcome of those elections? Is he among those who defend the view that "Turkey and Algeria are two different countries?" It is true that Algeria is not similar to Turkey.... A comparison between the two countries will show many things in favor of Turkey, which will raise the people's morale. However, I wish to recall the following: All the other Islamic countries said "we are different from Iran" when Ayatollah Khomeyni ousted the Iranian shah's regime and established a fundamentalist order. Several correspondents arrived in Turkey and asked who our "khomeyni" was at the time. We laughed at them because we were convinced that the "khomeyni" in Turkey commanded only 7 or 9 percent of the votes and that the Turkish people had adopted the secular system as a way of life. However, we were unaware that the United States was trying to establish a green belt of fundamentalist countries against the former Soviet Union to check Communism at the time. Consequently, it supported the religious trends and organizations, regardless of its dispute with the Khomeyni regime in Iran. Let us consider the changes that have taken place since that time: An Islamic order has been established in Sudan, which said in the past that "Iran is a different country." Very little time is left before the fundamentalists take over Algeria. The terrorists in Egypt, who wish to establish a fundamentalist order, have frustrated the people to such an extent that they are almost ready to embrace the "Islamic Brotherhood Organization," which has been a problem in that country since 1928. The secular system in Tunisia is maintaining its existence with great difficulty. Meanwhile, King Hassan has had the largest mosque in the world constructed in Morocco to secure the support of the fundamentalists in his country. The reports from Bangladesh and Pakistan are demoralizing. The Islamic way of life, which Prosperity Party Leader Necmettin Erbakan has described as "just order," is supposed to bring peace to the people. However, it has created a fratricide in Afghanistan. All that is an indication of the present situation in many of the countries that said "Iran is a different country" 15 years ago. Meanwhile, the United States has moved to consider "how to improve Washington's relations with the countries that have adopted the Islamic order." That indicates that no one will support the prosecular forces in a country when their secular system is removed. In view of this, we must abandon the view that "the secular system will not collapse" and adopt the approach that "the secular system will collapse if we do not support it." We must be skeptical and not heed the views of apathetic and imprudent people like Husamettin Cindoruk and former Social Democratic People's Party Leader Erdal Inonu. We must be aware that we shall never again be able to see the light of contemporary civilization if our secular system collapses.
