FR940104-0-00018 FR940104-0-00003 Ozark argues that the ability to withhold a vote or ``veto'' any particular transaction does not exist as far as open access transportation arrangements are concerned. Ozark states that open access pipelines, including Ozark, are required by §§284.8(b) and 284.9(b) to transport natural gas on an open and non-discriminatory basis. Ozark asserts that it is clearly prohibited from taking actions that would unduly prefer the marketing affiliates of Ozark's partners and Ozark's partners have an obligation to the partnership to operate the pipeline within legal parameters. Ozark submits that its Commission-approved firm and interruptible rate schedules establish the criteria which control who receives transportation service from Ozark. Ozark contends that decisions as to who will be permitted to ship on Ozark may not be made at the whim of a particular Ozark partner. Ozark asserts that if the tariff criteria are met, the request must be granted. Ozark states that, in fact, at a Management Committee meeting held on June 26, 1991, Ozark's Management Committee, consisting of representatives of each of the partners, voted unanimously to approve a resolution authorizing the President of Ozark or his designee to execute interruptible transportation agreements on behalf of Ozark. Thus, Ozark contends, each of the partners ceded to the Operator the authority to enter into interruptible transportation agreements. Ozark argues that no partnership vote is required and the Operator is bound by the tariff. Ozark asserts that it should be obvious that not only are Tennessee Ozark and Ozark Pipeline Corporation not free to veto transportation transactions but each has relinquished any right it might otherwise have to vote on such transactions. Ozark submits that the record before the Commission shows an absence of control. Ozark asserts that the record before the Commission shows a complete absence of any vetoing of any transportation transaction by any Ozark partner, consistent with the delegation of authority to enter into such transportation agreements. Ozark argues that the Operator is required to act in accordance with its fiduciary responsibilities to the partnership, not inconsistent with those responsibilities. Ozark contends that the Commission's finding here that one partner could prefer its marketing affiliate by vetoing transportation for others is directly contrary to the Commission's prior findings in this case that ``[t]here are no facts before us in this proceeding which indicate that Ozark has discriminated in offering transportation services to any party.'' 24 24 Citing, Ozark Gas Transmission System, 43 FERC ¶61,443 at 62,108 (1988). Ozark submits that previously the Commission assumed that the Ozark partners would act together to provide preferences to marketing affiliates of one of the partners or that one of the Ozark partners would be willing to grant preferences to their Ozark partners in the hopes of obtaining reciprocal preferences. Ozark states that here the Commission assumes that one of the partners will simply veto transactions that would benefit the partnership because the transaction might compete with a transaction of one of its affiliates. Ozark asserts that there is no evidence to support any such assumption. Ozark contends that to make such a finding the Commission would have to assume that Ozark would violate its tariff, the Commission's regulations, and Texas partnership law. Ozark argues that the Commission would also have to assume that its prior finding that there are no facts showing discrimination in Ozark's offering of transportation is wrong. Ozark submits that not one of these assumptions is logical, consistent with any information relating to Ozark, or supported by evidence in the record. Ozark asserts that all of the evidence shows that such control does not exist including the fact that numerous transportation transactions have been conducted by Ozark for independent marketers which compete with the marketing affiliates of Ozark partners. Ozark states that its decisions as to who it will ship for are subject to review by this Commission and this Commission's complaint procedures. Ozark contends that if the Commission were to find that Ozark had engaged in such conduct, enforcement proceedings would commence and Ozark would either be ordered to provide the service required or its blanket certificate would be revoked. Finally, Ozark argues that it does not control any of its individual partners, is not controlled by any of its individual partners, and is not under common control with any of its individual partners. It asserts that nothing in the record before the Commission suggests the contrary. Ozark also contends that the Commission erred to the extent that it relied on the modified definition of ``control.'' Ozark states that in Order No. 497&hyph;A the Commission modified the definition of ``control'' in §161.2. Ozark states that on January 16, 1990, it sought rehearing of Order No. 497&hyph;A. Ozark states that the Commission issued an order granting rehearing for purpose of further consideration but the Commission has never, to the best of Ozark's knowledge, issued an order on the merits of Ozark's rehearing request. Ozark states that three years have passed and numerous orders utilizing the definition have issued, including the order in this proceeding, and it considers its request for rehearing as having been denied. However, to the extent that the Commission is applying the revised definition to support the result here, Ozark seeks rehearing.
