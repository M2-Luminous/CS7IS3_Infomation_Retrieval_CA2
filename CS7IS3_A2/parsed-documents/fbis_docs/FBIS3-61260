Your VEK correspondent, who had been in Turkmenistan for several days prior to the Ashgabat Meeting, had a conversation with Turkmenistan's minister of foreign affairs, Khalykberdi Atayev. "Our republic does indeed take a special position among the CIS countries," the minister said. "We regard the Commonwealth as a consultative instrument, lacking in any rigid administrative organs. We consider that the CIS should facilitate the development of bilateral relations between the members of this organization. During the initial period many people did not understand us, seeing in our position a desire to isolate ourselves, to depart from the principles of uniting the states involved. However, Turkmenistan's president, Saparmurad Niyazov, maintains a different opinion. He advocates the uniting of states on the basis of full sovereignty and the development of bilateral relations. Therefore, our state did not sign the CIS Charter in Minsk, nor did it join the economic union. We assume that Turkmenistan will be able to join this organization in the capacity of an associate member." "Practical experience has shown that decisions adopted at the CIS level are not carried out in the necessary manner. Moreover, these decisions do not facilitate businesslike cooperation among the states involved. But bilateral decisions--in contrast--clearly presuppose mutual obligations which must be carried out. Such a position taken by Turkmenistan has found understanding and support from a number of CIS states." Khalykberdi Atayev went on to explain his state's position with regard to the conflict in Tajikistan: "When the matter arose of the need to create a joint troop force in order to safeguard the Tajik border and to maintain order in Tajikistan itself, Kazakhstan and Russia appealed to us on this matter. Our president declared that he would not send a single Turkmen soldier into Tajikistan and would not intervene in this conflict. He posed the question as follows: Who would the Turkmen soldiers fight against in Tajikistan? The Tajik oppositionists had possibly crossed the border from Afghanistan and were receiving support from certain Afghan groups. However, the Kabul government immediately declared that it had nothing at all to do with this. But within Tajikistan itself complications and confrontations have taken place resulting from clashes between various factions struggling for power. In such a situation--just whom would the Turkmen troops be fighting against? We have stated that Tajikistan must solve its own internal problems by itself by means of talks among the conflicting parties and by means of strengthening the power structures within that country. Our participation in this matter could consist of providing humanitarian assistance to the suffering population." Turning to economic problems, the foreign minister noted that at the present time some 11 billion cubic meters of gas annually pass through Russian territory on their way to the West. However, by way of seeking its own, independent egress to foreign markets, Turkmenistan is actively carrying on preliminary talks with regard to constructing a gas pipeline through the northern part of Iran and Turkey--to Europe. As the minister noted, his country could export 10-15 billion cubic meters of gas to Turkey, whereas it it could send 30 billion to Europe. The explored gas reserves in Turkmenistan amount to 13 trillion cubic meters. Proposals are now under study for laying gas pipelines to China's eastern shore and to Pakistan. Other large-scale projects are also being studied, in particular, in the field of international railroad transportation.
