In the words of the prime minister, Russia "is conducting an aggressive economic policy in relation to the Baltic states." The regulation of export and import introduced in the Russian Federation on March 15 is "bluntly discriminating", Slezevicius said. The Lithuanian premier also said that he had a meeting with the head of the Kaliningrad regional administration Yuriy Matochkin who in the near future is scheduled to meet with Chernomyrdin. Slezevicius asked him to inform the Russian premier about Lithuania's position. Its essence is that "if Russia has no intention of changing its decision and continues the policy aimed at reducing imports, Lithuania will have nothing to do but to resort to adequate measures in relation to the Kaliningrad region." The Lithuanian premier also noted that Russia is not repaying its debt for the transit of electricity. "We would not like to resort to limiting this transit," Slezevicius said. According to the premier, Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas sent a letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin about the problems in relations between the two states.
