It provides a convenient bridge linking Russia's Far East with China's north-eastern and northern regions. "We are interested in the development of trade, economic, scientific and technical ties with our Russian partners. Prospects are particularly good in the sphere of shipping and ship repairs," Qingquandao Mayor Cheng Lailee said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS. The mayor is taking part in the work of the first Sino-Russian seminar-cum-fair in the resort Beidaihe on the coast of the Yellow Sea, three hundred kilometres from Beijing. The seminar discusses everything that is of interest to Russia and Chinese merchants, aviation and metallurgy, car-building and mining, grain and vegetable oil, processing of raw materials, the chemical, light and textile industries. The seminar-cum-fair was organised by the Russian-Chinese joint company Liangfa and the Russian LML Ltd. The venue for the event was chosen to contribute to the success of the gathering. In the past Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and other Chinese leaders used this retreat to hold conferences on home and foreign policy and escape the heatwave in Beijing. Patriarch of Chinese economic reforms Deng Xiaoping, chairman Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng also favour the place. Incidentally, it was here that the great helmsman said after a regular swim in the sea that "one should never forget about the class struggle," the phrase which provided the theoretical basis for the subsequent cultural revolution. Times have changed and there is nothing to remind people of the class struggle or its proponent Mao Zedong apart from his full- colour portraits displayed behind the windscreens of trucks, just as Stalin's portraits used to be displayed in Soviet Union. China now values those who can make money. "Actual links between Qingquandao, which is pursuing a favourable trade, economic and investment policy, with Russia are just taking shape," Cheng Lailee said. The first Chinese-Russian joint venture has already been set up in the city. Qingquandao is a link between the outside world and China's Bohai economic region, which has long since maintained a favourable base for the development of mutually beneficial business links between China and Russia, which were discussed during the recent talks between the heads of the two governments Viktor Chernomyrdin and Li Peng. The main objective of the seminar-cum-fair is to combine the efforts of businessmen from the two countries. The next such meeting "Beijing-Moscow: New Horizons" will be held in Hotel Cosmos in the Russian capital in August. "The idea of regular practice-oriented seminars and fairs for representatives of the business communities of Russia and China originated when everybody understood that the immense potential of trade and economic relations of the Russian Federation and China remains largely untapped," said general director of the Lianfa Company Petr Gvaskov. "it could not be fully used for lack of sufficient information about new forms of cooperation, benefits available in China, forms of payment and their organisation in yuan," Gvaskov said. For the first time in bilateral trade and economic practice the Chinese and Russian participants are provided with information on taxation procedures in China and Russia, visas and customs rules. In addition, Lianfa has published a collection of relevant official regulatory enactments of the Russian Federation. The event has proved its commercial worth: on the first day of its work a contract worth 29 million dollars was signed for the lease of five Russian Tu-154M's for use by airlines in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. Beidaihe attracts Chinese and foreign tourists and business people not only by its wonderful beaches, cottages, greenery and Chinese cuisine but also by its medical facilities, including the centre of Xiguno-therapy, whose specialists cure diseases without medicines. The first villas were built here a hundred years ago under the Qin dynasty. By 1949 twenty foreign countries had built their summer houses in Beidaihe. Beidaihe offers a wonderful chance of combining recreation and business to residents of the Urals, Siberia and the Far East, fishermen, gold miners and oilmen. The opening of a new airline linking Russia to the city of Shanghaiguan, which is located next to Beidaihe, will make such trips quite feasible very soon.
