Governor Chris Patten last week came closer than ever to hinting that China was potentially in breach of the Sino-British accord, although he stopped short of saying so directly. But in contrast to Mr Patten, the recent report from the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee pulls no punches. "We conclude that Articles 18 and 158 of the Basic Law are grave potential threats to the autonomy of the Hong Kong SAR [special administrative region] after 1997 and to the implementation of the Joint Declaration," it says. Both clauses drew fire during the drafting of the Basic Law. Article 18 effectively gives Beijing, through the rubber-stamp Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the power to do what it wants in Hong Kong after 1997 by declaring a "state of emergency". Article 158 undermines the Joint Declaration's promise that the proposed Court of Final Appeal will have the power "of final adjudication", by giving the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress the right to interpret the Basic Law, and even issue rulings that the [sentence incomplete as published] Despite quiet lobbying during the drafting process, Britain failed to have both provisions scrapped, and subsequently tried to paper over the shortcomings of the Basic Law. "The Government of the United Kingdom had satisfied itself that the Basic Law was, on the whole, consistent with the basic principles enshrined in the Joint Declaration," a British spokesman told a United Nations Human Rights Commission hearing in 1991. The most the Foreign Office would admit was that there were a few articles in the Basic Law it "would have preferred to see drafted differently". But that was before Mr Patten's arrival, when a U-turn in British policy towards political reform in the territory prompted a torrent of accusations from Beijing that London was breaching the Joint Declaration. Now there are signs Britain is prepared to respond in kind. Whitehall officials claimed in evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee that any significant foot-dragging by Beijing in the Joint Liaison Group amounted to a failure to "fulfil the terms of the (Joint) Declaration". Foreign Office Deputy Legal Adviser Kevin Chamberlain went one step further suggesting China's record of abiding by international agreements was "very mixed" -- although he later retracted the remark in a clear attempt to avoid angering Beijing. Mr Patten also chose his words with care, when answering questions on the issue in the Legislative Council last week. But he did concede what no governor had made so plain before: that Articles 18 and 158 were potentially in breach of the Sino-British accord. "If Articles 18 or 158 of the Basic Law were used to undermine the autonomy of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, that would be in contravention of the Joint Declaration," he said. Resorting to diplomatic doublespeak, Mr Patten then insisted there was no danger of that, adding somewhat tenuously that since Beijing had promised to stick to the terms of the Sino-British accord, the offending articles would never be used in the wrong way. But, even accepting such a circular argument, the Governor's remarks were the first clear statement that China had put in place powers which could be used to break the Joint Declaration. Now that Britain has overcome this psychological hurdle, perhaps it is time to study China's record on other Hong Kong-related accords. The Memorandum of Understanding over the new airport is a case in point. In 1992, then Secretary for Economic Services Anson Chan Fang On-sang warned Beijing that it had only 30 days to respond to Britain's airport funding proposals under the terms of that accord. Beijing told her to shut up, claiming, implausibly, that the month-long consultation timetable, unequivocally laid down in the memorandum, applied to specific airport contracts only, rather than the overall funding package. Two years on, despite the lack of agreement on the airport, no one has dared repeat that charge. But, in the light of Britain's latest shift of policy, now may be the right time. Mrs Chan, now Chief Secretary, will be in Washington this week. It will be interesting to hear her response to any questions on China's record of abiding by international agreements about Hong Kong.
