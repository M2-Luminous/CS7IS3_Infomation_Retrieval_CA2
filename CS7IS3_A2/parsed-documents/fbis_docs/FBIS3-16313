Cor.: You have told the Georgian press that the aims of your visit to the United States have been achieved. To what extent does that apply to the Abkhazian conflict, and what part is Russia expected to play in the settlement of that conflict? Eduard Shevardnadze: President Bill Clinton and I have reached mutual understanding on all principal issues, above all that of deploying an international peace-keeping force in Abkhazia. This is a difficult matter in practical terms. It poses two problems: First of all, the U.N. Security Council has to take a special decision to that effect, and, secondly, funds have to be raised for it. The latter problem has practically been solved in the course of my visit to America. I have support in that matter both from the president himself and from appropriate quarters in the U.S. Congress. This was followed by a meeting of the U.N. Security Council, but before that I had a meeting with U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, at which we gave detailed consideration to all the problems the Abkhazian conflict involves. At the Security Council meeting, I spoke about what had happened in Abkhazia, about the causes and consequences of those events and about the present-day situation there. I gave all things their proper names. The representatives of Russia, the United States, Britain, China, France and other Security Council member states expressed full support for Georgia's policy to settle the conflict. They stressed the need to preserve the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia. The proposal to urgently send an international peace-keeping force to Abkhazia was supported by practically all members of the Security Council. There's something I'd like to make a special mention of here. Abkhazian separatist leader Vladislav Ardzinba tried to get to the rostrum of the Security Council in those days. They banned him from it, because he is not the head of a sovereign state. Then he gave a news conference at which, some journalists said, he was giving unintelligible answers and sounded fairly unconvincing altogether. He said there, for example, that bringing a peace-keeping force into Abkhazia would mean its occupation. I said in the United States that if that is occupation all of us should move to another planet. As for the degree of Russia's participation in that really important process, it is certainly vast. What in fact is happening is coordinated joint action. May I just remind that, before I went to the United States, President Boris Yeltsin came to Tbilisi and we signed the Treaty on Friendship, Good-Neighborly Relations and Cooperation. After that, the Georgian parliament ratified the documents formalizing our country's membership in the CIS. So after much effort we came round to seeing the need for consecutive cooperation within the Commonwealth to establish lasting peace in Georgia, and consequently in the entire Caucasus, which is in the vital interest of Russia as well. It is the principle of Georgia that it is wrong today to divide the planet into "our own" and "somebody else's" regions. It is the duty of humankind to take to heart any problem that can become a source of a great tragedy no matter where such a problem arises. The democratic forces in all countries which value democracy and constructive cooperation should come together. As we get rid of the consequences of the Cold War and internal conflicts, it must be one of our priorities to unite in fighting reactionary and conservative forces, wherever they rear their heads. It seems to me that a U.N. Security Council decision to deploy a peace-keeping force in Abkhazia would be an essential, and possibly the principal contribution to the breaking of the "Abkhazian deadlock," and hence to the elimination of one of the sources of danger. The voting on a resolution to that effect will be preceded by a speech that Butrus- Ghali is due to make at the meeting of March 21. The main point is that such a step should be taken under the aegis of the United Nations. This is today the most fair solution possible. Corr.: What do you think of the Georgian parliament's decision declaring the Abkhazian parliament an illegal body? E.S.: I think that was a rather rash step to take, and possibly not very justified in tactical terms. But essentially it does not contradict the political situation in general. Corr.: What decisions do you expect to be made by the forthcoming congress of the Union of Citizens of Georgia of which you are the head? E.S.: In brief terms, the aim of that organization is to help stabilize the situation in the country, make the democratic reforms irreversible, increase the influence in society of those forces which are absolutely consistent in their determination to lead Georgia out of its economic crisis, and put an end to all forms of crime. The decisions of the congress will help solve our most serious problems.
