Section 230.7 would be amended by redesignating paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1) and by adding a new paragraph (b)(2) to read as follows: §230.7 Payment of interest. * * * * * (b)␣*␣*␣*␣ (2) Equivalent compounding and crediting frequencies. Institutions offering accounts that permit consumers to receive interest by check or transfer to another account and that permit consumers to leave interest in the account, must compound interest on funds left in the account at a frequency no less often than interest is offered to be credited to any consumer holding such an account. * * * * * 4. Appendix A of part 230 would be amended by revising the first sentence in the introductory paragraph, the introductory text to Part I, and amending paragraph A, and by removing footnote 3 in Part I of Appendix A to read as follows: Appendix A to Part 230_Annual Percentage Yield Calculation The annual percentage yield measures the total amount of interest [paid] earned on an account based on the interest rate, and the frequency of compounding[,] or crediting . 1 *␣*␣* 1 The annual percentage yield reflects only interest and does not include the value of any bonus (or other consideration worth $10 or less) that may be provided to the consumer to open, maintain, increase or renew an account. Interest or other earnings are not to be included in the annual percentage yield if such amounts are determined by circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Part I. Annual Percentage Yield for Account Disclosures and Advertising Purposes In general, the annual percentage yield for account disclosures under §§230.4 and 230.5 of this part and for advertising under §230.8 of this part is an annualized rate that reflects the relationship between the amount of interest that would be earned by the consumer for the term of the account (and taking into account the frequency of crediting) and the amount of principal used to calculate that interest. Special rules apply to accounts with tiered and stepped interest rates. A. General Rules *␣*␣* In determining the total interest figure to be used in the formula, institutions shall assume that all principal and interest remain on deposit for the entire term and that no other transactions (deposits or withdrawals) occur during the term.[ 3 ] *␣*␣* 3 [This assumption shall not be used if an institution requires, as a condition of the account, that consumers withdraw interest during the term. In such a case, the interest (and annual percentage yield calculation) shall reflect that requirement.] The annual percentage yield is calculated by use of the following general formula (``APY'' is used for convenience in the formulas): APY=100 [(1+(Interest/Principal)) (365/Days in term) ^1] ``Principal'' is the amount of funds assumed to have been deposited at the beginning of the account. ``Interest'' is the total dollar amount of interest earned on the Principal for the term of the account in which credited interest remains in the account. If interest is required to be credited solely by check or transfer, the total dollar amount of interest earned on the Principal for the term of the account is the amount of interest that would result if it were compounded at the same frequency interest is credited. ``Days in term'' is the actual number of days in the term of the account. * * * * * Examples: * * * * * (3) If an institution offers a $1,000 two-year certificate of deposit that credits interest semi-annually solely by check or transfer, and there is no compounding at a 6.00% interest rate, using the general formula above, the annual percentage yield is 6.09%: APY=100 [(1+(125.51/1,000)) (365/730) ^1] APY=6.09% * * * * * Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 4, 1994.
