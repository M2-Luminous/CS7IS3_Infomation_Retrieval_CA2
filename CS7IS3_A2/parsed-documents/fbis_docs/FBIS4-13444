In an interview with a Chinese media delegation that represented Chinese media organs, President Mubarak said that recent international developments in the Middle East and in east Asia stress the importance of consultations between Egypt and China to have an objective assessment of these developments and of searching for fair solutions acceptable to all parties in order to enhance world peace and security. President Mubarak stressed that Egyptian-Chinese relations are so unique as to distinguish them from bilateral relations with a number of other friendly countries, explaining that the two countries' cooperation covers many fields of joint activity in the economic, cultural, scientific, and other spheres. He expressed hope that economic cooperation and trade exchange will rise to a still better level. He said that the great leap made by the Chinese economy and the important achievement of the Egyptian economy will open broad scope and horizons for expanding trade between the two countries and for increasing their share in world trade to the benefit of the two fraternal peoples. President Mubarak went on to say in the interview that the achievement of stability in Egypt and the Middle East creates the right climate for giving impetus to the economic growth cycle and the attraction of investments. He stressed that Egypt has succeeded, through a gradual process, in restoring a large part of the Egyptian economy's activities, vitality, and ability to produce, export, and create job opportunities for thousands of young people. He added: The problems are not over yet but the diagnosis was accurate and the treatment was not sudden. Signs of health and strength have started to reappear in Egypt's economy in the fields of industry, agriculture, and reconstruction, and in the improvement in the level of services. President Mubarak explained that Egypt's policy follows an active diplomacy with the majority of African countries at the political, economic and cultural levels and the exchange of visits and delegations. He added that he is following the development of this policy with great interest. He said: We are contributing, with other countries and international organizations, to the search for solutions to problems that might appear from time to time in order to achieve security and stability in the continent where most peoples are living. President Mubarak stressed that Egypt has firmly abided by the strategy of peace based on justice in order to fulfill the hopes of the region's peoples after a 50-year-long conflict. He said that this strategy began with the historic peace initiative of 1977 that aimed to put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict and open the door to peaceful coexistence between the Palestinians and Israelis. He added that Egypt's policy has pursued this course that advocates negotiations and dialogue within the framework of legitimacy and the principles of justice and international law until it saw its persistent efforts crowned with success at the end of 1991, when the peace conference was held in Madrid to implement Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of land in return for peace. He said that he regards the Madrid conference as a historic turning point in the peace process and in starting direct negotiations between all the Israeli, Arab, and Palestinian parties. He stressed that the Palestinian-Israeli agreement in the form of the Declaration of Principles last September was another important landmark that brought everybody to the verge of reaching a peaceful and acceptable settlement that places the Palestinian issue at the threshold of a new era where self-rule will be achieved and of transitional measures in preparation for the negotiations on the final status of the occupied territories. He said that equally important and serious negotiations have been held on the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian tracks with Israel and that this shows that everyone is convinced that dialogue and mutual consent and acceptance are the best way to reach an agreement. He added: Another important process also began in parallel with these negotiations, namely the multilateral negotiations on regional cooperation that involves the parties to the conflict and other countries, including China. These talks cover issues of economic development, environment, water, disarmament, and refugees. He noted that all these are important fields to which the parties and other world countries concerned with the region's stability are paying attention in the hope of attaining security and stability and thus bringing about benefits to all the peoples of the Middle East and the world. President Mubarak went on to say that Egypt's role, which the political leadership plans and the diplomatic branch implements, has not stopped since the start of the Madrid conference. It even started a long time before then because of Egypt's ties with all regional and international parties to the conflict. He added that Egypt has open channels of communication with all these leaders and constantly receives their leaders and representatives in order to narrow the gap of differences and bring views closer. He said: Within this context, Egypt has received most of the leaders concerned with the conflict who are participating in the peace process. Talks have also been held in Cairo between the Israeli and Palestinian sides, and the Egyptian capital has been visited by U.S., European, and other delegations to give impetus to the peace process and to reach tangible results as early as possible that will put an end to the cycle of violence and counter violence, expand the circle of support for peace and coexistence in the Middle East, and achieve a dignified and secure life for everyone. He stressed that the achievement of peace in the Middle East will ultimately be a great historic contribution to the establishment of peace and stability in the whole world.
