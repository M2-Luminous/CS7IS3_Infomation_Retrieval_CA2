The government, which has prioritised railways, will give 29 billion yuan ($3.3 billion) for construction this year. The original investment target for this year was 41.7 billion ($4.8 billion). But the planned funding will out-strip last year's input by 6.5 billion yuan ($747 million), said a Railways Ministry source. The ministry will build 2,100 kilometres of new lines, double- track 1,335 kiloemtres of existing single-track capacity, and electrify another 194 kilometres of railway. The government agenda is topped by seven key railway projects, which are underway. And quality engineering and labour safety will be prioritised. The Beijing-Kowloon Railway will get 1,386 kilometres of new line by the end of this year. Roadbeds, bridges and tunnels along its projected 2,538-kilometre length will also be completed. The north-south thoroughfare project kicked off in early 1993. Over 1,700 kilometres of track will have been completed on it by the end of 1994. The Lanzhou-Urumqi Railway, will be double-tracked along its entire 1,620 kilometres by the year's end. But only half of the new second track will be up and running by then. Workers will finish construction and electrification of the new 498-kilometre Baoji-Zhongwei line in the northern Shaanxi Province and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. And the new 252-kilometre Houma-Yueshan line will be laid and electrified within the year. A 154-kilometre section of the Hangzhou-Zhuzhou Railway will be double-tracked and another 166 kilometres of dual-track line will be opened to traffic. Construction on the 898-kilometre Nanning-Kunming Railway, which is the toughest building project, will press ahead. And work will continue on a huge new passenger station in west Beijing. The national rail network this year plans to move 1.56 billion tons of freight, which includes 640 million tons of coal. A project 1.04 billion people will catch trains this year. The cargo and passenger targets are close to last year's figures, said the ministry.
