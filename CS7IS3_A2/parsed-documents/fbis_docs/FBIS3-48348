Mun Ik-hwan, a South Korean reputed patriotic champion of reunification, today released a statement denouncing the South Korean authorities for blocking a working-level contact at Panmunjom and not allowing the group to go to Seoul. Their act is an insult to the deceased who devotedly struggled for national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation, and a violation of the beautiful manners and customs, etiquette and morality handed down through generations, the statement said, and continued: Not allowing no more than five people to go to Seoul to mourn the death of Rev. Mun, the South Korean authorities clearly showed once again that the "civilian" regime and the "civilian administration" on their lips are a downright lie. By preventing their call of condolence over the death of a fellow countryman, the Kim Yong-sam group has left an indelible stain in the history of the nation as the most despicable traitor of the successive South Korean rulers. The Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique charged the North side with the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon) and the "nuclear issue." [sentence as received] It is a poor excuse for preventing a call of condolence from the North side. Its slander on Pomminnyon, a national umbrella organization of the reunification movement, indicates that the Kim Yong-sam regime is a group of anti-reunification elements and that to charge the North over the fictitious "nuclear issue" proves that they themselves are traitors subservient to foreign forces. The behavior of blocking under an absurd pretext the call of condolence prompted by compatriotic feelings and etiquette showed that the Kim Yong-sam regime is in a very difficult position in which it cannot receive even five mourners and has but a few days left before it. The people in the North, together with the fellow countrymen in the South, will certainly settle accounts with the South Korean rulers. People of all walks of life in South Korea are now lifting up louder voices criticizing the Kim Yong-sam regime for blocking the Seoul visit of our mourners' group. This is a serious warning to the hooligans who know neither etiquette nor morality. The Kim Yong-sam group hell bent on maintaining its power while desperately pursuing the policy of depending on outside forces, opposed to the national reconciliation and unity and the reunification of the country, the cherished desire of the entire fellow countrymen, will have to pay a high price before the nation.
