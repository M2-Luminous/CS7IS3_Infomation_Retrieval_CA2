Following is the text of the statement: We, along with our people, were surprised by the declaration of secession made by the secessionist elements in the YSP leadership. We, along with our people, realize that the YSP's elements, cadres, and many of its leaders reject, absolutely and in principle, this declaration, which does not express our party's spirit, principles, and lengthy struggle designed to effect both the September and October Yemeni revolutions and the Yemeni unity on great 22 May 1990. The declaration of secession is a retreat from our people's greatest and most important options of unity, democracy, and party and political pluralism. We, as leading elements in the YSP and its Central Committee, condemn the declaration of secession. We also believe that abidance by the constitution and a return to dialogue are the only possible means to end the impasse facing our people as a result of the declaration of secession. As leading elements in the YSP, we will hold further consultations with our party colleagues in order to take a final and decisive position on our relationship with the YSP. This statement was signed by brothers 'Abd-al-Bari Tahir, 'Abdallah Hamid al-'Ulufi, and 'Abdallah Baydar, members of the YSP Central Committee.
