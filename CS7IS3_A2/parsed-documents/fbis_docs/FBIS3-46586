In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE before his departure on Saturday [1 January] to the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia, Akashi said Japan should not pretend that it is indifferent to a proposal to upgrade Japan's standing in the world body to that of a permanent member of the U.N. Security council. "If Japan were given the status of a Security Council permanent member, it needs to act in accordance with its new responsibility because the Security Council is responsible for ensuring world peace and security," he said. Akashi, who previously headed the U.N. peacekeeping force in Cambodia, asked the Japanese to meditate upon the issue of why Japan cannot assume a military role in U.N. peacekeeping when other countries' peacekeepers are engaged in high-risk fields of peacekeeping. "There is a question why Japan failed to send a contingent of foot soldiers as peacekeepers despite the fact that it could dispatch a contingent of engineering troops to Cambodia," he said. "If Japanese people can hammer out a national agreement on this matter, I want Japan to send a contingent of foot soldiers as peacekeepers," said the U.N. undersecretary general. It is the Japanese people who should make a decision whether the dispatch of foot soldiers is constitutional or not, he added. Akashi said both the United States and the U.N. became more cautious toward peacekeeping following U.N. peacekeepers' failure to establish peace in Somalia. The U.S. decided to pull its troops out of the African nation following their failure to arrest Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid. "There occurred tough problems (in Somalia) in such fields as peacekeepers' command structure, the scope of weapons they are allowed to use, as well as the issue of training of peacekeepers that participated" from various countries, he said. Akashi referred to the Cambodian experience, where the use of heavy weapons in dealing with the threat from the "deep-rooted" Khmer Rouge would have run the risk of drawing the U.N. peacekeepers into a "quagmire." In December, Akashi urged the Japanese Government to send peacekeepers to the Balkans region, where civil war has already killed an estimated 200,000 people, and has strong potential to spread. Then Akashi said he believed Japanese laws "allow" Japanese peacekeepers to join the U.N. protection forces (UNPROFOR) in the region "in such logistics fields as medical service, transportation and communications."
