The development and construction of these "three zones" are a major strategic policy decision for deepening reform and expanding the scale of opening up, a key way for realizing the overall urban and rural plan and accelerating the readjustment of the overall urban and rural arrangement, and a key way for coordinating urban areas with rural ones and reducing the differences between urban and rural areas; and will play an extremely important role in readjusting the industrial structure and the product mix. At present, the municipality has had a state-level new-tech industrial development experimental zone, a municipal-level economic and technological development zone, and 22 district- and county-level small industrial zones; and an open-typed economic development pattern characterized by urban areas and rural areas' combination, rational distribution, mutual reliance, and coordinate development has preliminarily taken shape. Last year, the total industrial output value of the "three zones" surpassed 4.5 billion yuan. Thus, the "three zones" play an increasingly more noticeable role in the municipality's economic construction. [passage omitted] At the time of firmly grasping the construction of infrastructural facilities, the "three zones," being popular areas with investment by internationally trans-national companies, have positively opened for business and introduced capital. So far, more than 5,000 enterprises have entered the zones. Of this, there are about 1,100 foreign-funded enterprises of three types, and nearly $1 billion foreign capital have been introduced according to agreements. Some 6.9 square kilometers of land, valued at 2 billion yuan, have been transferred to the enterprises that have entered the "three zones." More than 20 internationally famous trans-national companies built plants in these "three zones." More than 10 large trans-national companies are holding talks with the zones. [passage omitted]
