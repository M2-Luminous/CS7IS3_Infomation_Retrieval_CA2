This was declared by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev at a meeting with the commanders and senior officers of the Volga Region's Military District. The meeting took place in Samara. In Grachev's words, it is "the final figure," after which the reduction of the Russian army is to be stopped. The army currently has 2.34 Mn men. Grachev described the last army draft as "more or less successful." In his words, the units are manned only at 60 percent today. The figure is to be raised to 70-75 percent by the spring, and to 85-90 percent by the autumn. He disclosed that Russia had withdrawn more than 270,000 troops, 3,100 tanks, 6,000 armored vehicles, and 1,500 aircraft from CIS and other countries since 1992. He also revealed that Russia planned to set up 28 military bases in CIS states. The minister spoke in favor of a territorial command scheme, under which the headquarters of a district be responsible for all the armed services on their territory. In his words, this process will get under way next year, and until then, legal and theoretical prerequisites should be created. In his opinion, the new scheme will bolster defenses and improve troop management.
