The draft amendment does not change the basic principles of the existing legislation governing elections to the National Council of the Slovak Republic--the electoral system and the size and number of constituencies remain unchanged. The proposed amendment mainly clarifies provisions pertaining to the organization of elections. According to the draft, voters will receive the ballots at the polling stations--that is, the ballots will not be delivered to their homes. A citizen of the Slovak Republic who is not a permanent resident of the Slovak Republic will be entered in the voters' register on entering the polling station by the district electoral commission, and the commission will record this entry in the voter's travel document. When casting the ballot, the voter must have his citizenship recorded in his identity papers. [passage omitted]
