Their aim is to bolster earnings taking advantage of areas nearby in the Asian economic bloc that are developing. It seems that such moves are inviting a deindustrialization of the Kansai economy where there are many subcontractor firms and accelerating a change of the industrial structure. "It seems that quality is not a problem." Director Tsunemichi Imanishi of Hamada Printing Machinery heaved a sigh of relief while inspecting Chinese castings for a rotary press which arrived at their Ueno plant (Mie Prefecture). Because of the sales slump in printing machinery, the March 1994 quarter became the second consecutive quarter with an ordinary deficit, and they were driven to solicit voluntary retirement. Therefore, they have decided to reduce by 30 percent variable expenses (expenses that increase or decrease along with sales) centering on raw material expenses. In the case of this company, the percentage for castings in raw material expenses is high, accounting for 8 percent of variable expenses. It has taken exactly one year to begin importing from China since establishing their plan in the spring of 1993 when a high yen was rapidly advancing. It took time to develop suppliers and realization was greatly delayed, but "costs have been reduced 20 percent over domestic procurement" (Imanishi). Domestic sales of sheet printers increased during the time of the high yen situation in 1985, and they covered the blow from the high yen. This time, however, domestic demand has cooled, and the price of printing machines has dropped 40 percent from the peak. They will not catch up by previous rationalization methods. In the future, they plan to procure parts other than castings from Europe, etc. Daikin Industries plans to boost the overseas procurement ratio in raw materials expenses which account for half of the sales cost from the current 5 percent to a goal of 10 percent in one to two years and additionally, to 20 percent in the future. Domestic sales of air conditioners have fallen, and the March 1994 quarter turned to a ordinary deficit for the first time in 17 years. "If we do not undertake countermeasures for the high yen which has become rather entrenched, we cannot expect an improvement in earnings" (Shiro Tsukasa, manager, General Air Conditioner Purchasing Department). They already established a project team specializing in overseas procurement in 1985, and are importing copper tubing and aluminum sheets, etc., from Europe. In the future, they will make procurement parts those with a higher degree of processing. Beginning in May, they are scheduled to switch to procurement from Indonesia for some of the fan motors, which are the heart of room air conditioners. They foresee "at least a 20-percent decrease in costs." Matsushita Electric Works will more than double overseas procurement from the previous quarter in the November 1994 quarter to 60 billion yen. The overseas procurement ratio for raw materials and products accounts for 13 percent of the purchase amount, and has been upped about 7 points. There is a policy to increase the import of highly processed products such as wood panels for system kitchens, and they say that "a cost reduction of about 12 billion yen can be expected." The ordinary profit for this quarter has increased 16 percent from the previous quarter and is estimated to be 41 billion yen. Director Shigetaka Ito emphasizes that "it is inevitably a period when you divide what is necessary to make domestically and what should be made abroad." In the future, they will make increases centering on the lighting and building products and materials divisions which are behind in undertaking overseas procurement among the eight divisions, and plan to increase the ratio occupied in the purchase amount to 25 percent in 2001. Up until now, the Japanese manufacturing industry has been supported by domestic subcontractor firms that handle with great care the standards and specifications of the orderer. However, "decreases in costs will not proceed if we adhere to the previous method of doing things" (Tsukasa). It is necessary to turn to concepts such as overseas procurement of parts that are low in cost even if somewhat off-standard, and to compensate by changes in assembly methods. The move to overseas procurement is not just for raw materials and parts, but is spreading to highly processed products including finished goods. The deindustrialization of industry is gradually proceeding along with this. The officer of one machinery manufacturer discloses, "We want to proceed with overseas procurement, but have not embarked upon it out of consideration for the situation of those we do business with at home." The percentage of medium to small businesses in Kansai is close to seven points higher than the national average at 59.1 percent (Ministry of International Trade and Industry investigation, 1991) based on volume of manufacturing industry shipments, and the effect is great insofar as it is "a subcontractor-concentrated area." The structural high yen is changing radically the creation of things by firms who have been supported by subcontractor manufacturers. Director Yoshimitsu Arakawa of the Daiwa Bank Research Institute says, "If we look back 10 years from now, we will probably think that this high yen was the demarcation point for a change in the economic structure" (Atsushi Tamura, Securities Department).
