FBIS4-37362 "drnes119dd_94012" FBIS-NES-94-119 Daily Report 19 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Palestinian Affairs Demonstration Held Near Gaza Jewish Settlement Demonstration Held Near Gaza Jewish Settlement TA1906181694 Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew 1700 GMT 19 Jun 94 TA1906181694 Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew 1700 GMT 19 Jun 94 Hebrew BFN [Text] Palestinians today demonstrated near the settlement of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip. Sami Abu-Samahdanah and a Fatah Hawks group, including the Abu-Sittah brothers who are suspected of having murdered settler Uri Megidish at the time, today blocked off the Netzarim junction and did not allow settlers' vehicles to cross through. Our correspondent Shlomi Eldar reports that Abu-Samahdanah organized the demonstration in protest against fire which he claimed was directed at him from Netzarim last night. He asked for the Palestinian police's intervention and filed a complaint with the Israeli-Palestinian liaison office. The demonstrators reopened the junction only after a senior Palestinian police officer promised he would take action to safeguard Palestinians moving near Jewish settlements. The Netzarim settlers and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] spokesman deny that shots were fired from Netzarim yesterday.
