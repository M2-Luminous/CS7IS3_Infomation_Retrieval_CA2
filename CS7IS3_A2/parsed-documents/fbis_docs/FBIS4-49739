With participation in this matter by the broad masses of Hong Kong people, it is absolutely possible to achieve a smooth transition. Lu Ping made this remark yesterday morning when attending a forum for people from Hong Kong's grass-roots organizations and communities to meet the mainland members of the political and economic subgroups of the PWC. Lu Ping said that China has a saying that goes: "Roots are deep and firm"; when roots are deep, a plant blossoms and bears fruit. The masses at the grass-roots level in Hong Kong are Hong Kong's foundation and roots. So-called "Hong Kong people running Hong Kong" cannot be understood narrowly, as Hong Kong being run by a small number of those in the government departments. The meaning of "Hong Kong people running Hong Kong" is broad, and it first means that the broad masses of residents and those at the grass-roots level should run Hong Kong themselves, and realize Hong Kong's stability and prosperity in the future through "Hong Kong people running Hong Kong." Lu Ping said: We hope that you, and through you we can fully mobilize the strength of Hong Kong residents, so that everyone takes part in realizing "Hong Kong people running Hong Kong." In particular, from now to 1997 is only a little more than three years, and there are a lot of preparations to be made, so it is not enough simply to rely on the PWC. There must be participation by Hong Kong people so we really can achieve a smooth transition. Lu Ping said: I have said that Hong Kong is an economic city and that I do not want to see it become a political city. I was getting at something when I said this. Someone has tried to turn Hong Kong into a base, in order to change the socialist system on the mainland. They also said openly that Hong Kong already has become a political city, and the days when it could get along well with the mainland have gone for good. The report by the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee confessed -- without being pressed -- openly admitting that Britain's policy toward China, including Hong Kong, has changed already, that is, from cooperation to confrontation, so we must see clearly the face of the British Government. Lu Ping continued: It is not true that we do not want you to take part in politics; we do hope you care about the work during Hong Kong's transitional period, that you care about politics, and about Hong Kong's future. Lu Ping reiterated that the Chinese side is willing to cooperate with the British side in other areas, but cooperation involves both sides. Whether cooperation can succeed depends on whether the British side has the sincerity, but no sign of sincerity can be seen at this moment. Lu Ping stressed: Hong Kong is the Hong Kong people's Hong Kong, even without cooperation from the British side, we are very confident that relying on the broad masses of Hong Kong residents, we definitely can achieve a smooth transition. Among those attending the forum were 200 people from the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, the Association of Teachers, the Reform Club, the Public Housing Federation, the Federation of Social Groups in the New Territories, and many district and grass-roots organizations. After the meeting, Cheng Yao-tang, Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress and head of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, cited Lu Ping as saying that someone recently deliberately distorted the speech he made at a luncheon with the five main chambers of commerce. In his speech, he mentioned that Hong Kong is an economic city and cannot become a political city. When he said it could not become a "political city," he meant that Hong Kong must not be used as a base to change the socialist system in China, and must not become an arena for competition in the international community. Cheng Yao-tang said that participants in the forum mainly expressed opinions on the general problems of the people's livelihood, including soaring housing prices, the youth problem, education, retirement security, and the people's well-being in the New Territories. Lu Ping also responded to the problem of housing prices when he gave a summation, and said that the high housing prices already have put houses out of reach for ordinary residents, and if things go on like this, the law of the market will mete out the punishment, and this will directly affect the people's livelihood and the smooth transition. He does not want to see such a punishment to take place on 1 July 1997. At present, the PWC is actively deliberating a relevant housing policy. In addition, forum participant Yang Yao-chung, chairman of the Association of Teachers, briefed Lu Ping on Hong Kong's educational problem, including the proposal on strengthening promotion of the Basic Law, and increasing educational exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland.
