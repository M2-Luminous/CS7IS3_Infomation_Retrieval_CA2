Lambeck: "Consternation in the CDU/CSU Following Schaeuble's Speech"] [Text] Bonn -- Wolfgang Schaeuble, leader of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]/CSU [Christian Social Union] Bundestag Group, has called on the the CDU and CSU to urgently display unity. At a meeting of the CDU/CSU Bundestag Group yesterday, he said: "There is nothing that we need less than for public opinion to perceive the CDU/CSU as lacking unity and being in disagreement." Regarding the latest dispute between the CDU and CSU over the early announcement of the future CDU/CSU presidential candidate, Roman Herzog, Schaeuble said that he did not want to raise the issue once again. However, at a meeting of the group's executive board the previous evening, he clearly set out his position on the dispute. CDU General Secretary Peter Hintze said that he would also have preferred a more orderly procedure for presenting Herzog as the presidential candidate. Some of the party is now annoyed with Hintze for having made CSU Chairman Theo Waigel's mistake of speaking about Herzog too soon a public issue. Michael Glos, chairman of the CSU Land Group, was also present but did not take part in the debate. A former CDU minister said: "It was not a professional political job. We have a difficult election year ahead of us. Every dispute is unnecessary." Schaeuble issued an appeal to deputies in the same vein. He said that the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] has created an "impression of unity" since its party congress in Wiesbaden. For the first time in a long time, it now stood a chance of winning power. There is "dissatisfaction" in the population with those "who bear responsibility for the government." The population now believes that a change of government following the Bundestag election is "possible or likely." The group chairman said: "The combination of red and green no longer frightens people." If public opinion continues to perceive the CDU/CSU and the coalition as disunited that will have "serious consequences." Schaeuble warned: "Citizens rightly want action instead of disputes. Every disagreement harms the coalition partners." Some deputies reacted to Schaeuble's warnings with consternation. Deputy Herbert Werner openly criticized Schaeuble's, saying that it provided little motivation. Other members of the Bundestag said that it was not a speech to mark the beginning of election year. In addition, Schaeuble did not even mention the chancellor once. Schaeuble, who wants to shake up the CDU/CSU, did, however, set out his program at the meeting of the group's executive board. He said that the CDU/CSU has to be particularly active in four areas: economic and employment policy; foreign, defense, and EU [European Union] policy; domestic security policy, and the strengthening of the family. Schaeuble said: "There are very few areas in which the CDU/CSU has to make it clear that it is more competent."
