FBIS4-59524 "drnes094_j_94016" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 16 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Roundup of 13-16 May Clashes in North, South Roundup of 13-16 May Clashes in North, South Sanaa Official Details Operations JN1605071094 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0430 GMT 16 May 94 JN1605071094 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Statement by Defense Ministry "responsible military source"; date not given] [Text] With God's support and out of a firm belief in the victory of the people's will, the entrenching of justice, and the defeat of wrong in the battles of confrontation of the forces of rebellion, apostasy, and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]; and to continue wiping out their dens and their collapsing fortifications, the brave heroes of our Armed Forces are completing their valiant tasks on the various axes and sectors. On the Shabwah axis, our brave forces succeeded in destroying the advanced positions of the (?Madram) Brigade in Najd, Marqad, Jabal Bulayq, Jabal Shaqir, 'Ayn Hajar, and al-Saq. Our forces continue their advance to complete their tasks in the Bayhan District. Our forces captured several tanks, equipment, and military hardware while a large number of officers, NCO's, and soldiers from the (?Madram) Brigade joined the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. In the southwestern axis, the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah and al-Dali'-al- 'Anad sectors, the forces defending unity and legitimacy are waging fierce battles with all field guns. Our forces continue their intensive pounding of the al-'Anad Base fortifications after having purged the defensive pockets around it and forcing the defenders of the base to flee. Our forces continue to complete their missions in these two sectors. In the same axis, our forces continued their advance to complete their set missions. They pursued the remnants of apostasy and secession in al-'Awadhil and al-Sha'ibi. The citizens turned out to meet the forces of unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy, chanting God is great, and cheering the victory over the remnants of secession and apostasy. In the Abyan-Aden axis, the forces of apostasy and secession carried out an air raid on the Ja'ar area that sought to destroy the 7 October Factory and a number of the homes of citizens whom they had tried to terrify and annihilate in the past days with missiles. Their aggressive actions met with failure. That hysterical obsession led to the commission of criminal acts by targeting defenseless citizens and populated areas, firing a rocket the day before yesterday [14 May] at Sanaa. But God disappointed their bitter grudge and the rocket did not cause any damage. Our Armed Forces are still receiving groups of officers, NCO's, and soldiers who are progressively joining the Armed Forces -- the forces of unity and democracy and the defense of constitutional legality. They thus declared their rejection of the separatist plot of the sinful gang within the Socialist Party, joining the side of the Armed Forces and Security Forces in defending unity and democracy and standing up to all the enemies of the people and the homeland. We applaud the high morale of the dignified Yemeni people who are rallying around their Armed Forces and Security Forces and their national role to destroy rebellion and the plot of secession. We applaud all our people in the Lahij Governorate for their cooperation and support for their Armed Forces. We urge them and all the citizens in the Aden Governorate to feel reassured about this great national role of the lofty Armed Forces -- the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, which protect them and their security and property, the forces protecting their stability, their present, and future. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If ye will aid the cause of God, He will aid you, and plant your feet firmly. [Koranic verses]
