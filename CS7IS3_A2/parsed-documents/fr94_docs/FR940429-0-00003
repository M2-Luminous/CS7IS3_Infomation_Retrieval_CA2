FR940429-0-00003 FR940429-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;33&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8900; AD 94&hyph;09&hyph;11] Airworthiness Directives; Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A and Hawker 1000 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A and Hawker 1000 series airplanes. This action requires inspections of the thrust reverser system for integrity, and correction of any discrepancy found. This amendment is prompted by a report that there is a possibility of failure of the drive links (or attachments) on the thrust reversers of these airplanes due to the single link design concept of the thrust reverser link and lock system. This condition, if not corrected, could result in inadvertent deployment of a thrust reverser during flight. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent a significant reduction in the controllability of the airplane due to an in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser. DATES: Effective May 16, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of May 16, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before June 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;33&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Raytheon Corporate Jets, Inc., 3 Bishops Square, St. Albans Road West, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL109NE, United Kingdom. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A and Hawker 1000 series airplanes. The CAA advises that the manufacturer of the thrust reversers on these airplanes has conducted a reassessment of the failure modes and effects analysis for the thrust reverser system, and has provided to the airplane manufacturer additional recommendations for repetitive inspection intervals of the system. Results of that reassessment revealed that failure of the drive links (or attachments) on the thrust reversers can occur due to the single link design concept of the thrust reverser link and lock system. This condition, if not corrected, can result in inadvertent deployment of a thrust reverser during flight, which could result in a significant reduction in the controllability of the airplane Raytheon Corporate Jets, Inc., has issued Service Bulletin SB 78&hyph;12, dated January 24, 1994, that describes procedures for a detailed visual inspection of the thrust reverser drive mechanism to detect wear and abrasion and to ensure the security of the attachment of the actuator to its drive links, of the drive links to the thrust reverser structure, and of the ends of the drive link and link hinges. The service bulletin also describes procedures for repetitive inspections of the thrust reverser system for structural integrity. Accomplishment of these inspections will ensure the continued structural integrity of the thrust reverser system. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent deployment of a thrust reverser in flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane. This AD requires repetitive inspections of the thrust reverser system for integrity, and correction of any discrepancy found. The inspections are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. Correction of any discrepancy found is required to be accomplished in accordance with procedures described in the airplane maintenance manual. This is considered interim action. The airplane manufacturer currently is developing a secondary locking feature on the thrust reverser doors. Once this modification is developed, approved, and available, the FAA may consider further rulemaking to require its installation. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. Comments Invited Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ADDRESSES. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;33&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.
