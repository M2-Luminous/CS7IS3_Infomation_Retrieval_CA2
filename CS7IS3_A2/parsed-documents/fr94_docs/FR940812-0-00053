Section 52.2308 is added to read as follows: ยง52.2308 Area-wide nitrogen oxides exemptions. The Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission submitted to the EPA on May 4, 1994, a petition requesting that the Victoria County incomplete data ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the requirement to meet the NO X provisions of the Federal transportation conformity rule (40 CFR part 51, subpart T, and part 93, subpart A). The exemption request was based on monitoring data which demonstrated that the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone had been attained in this area for the 35 months prior to the petition, with the understanding that approval of the State's request would be contingent upon the collection of one additional month of data. The required additional month of verified data was submitted later and, together with the data submitted with the State's petition, demonstrated attainment of the NAAQS for 36 consecutive months. The EPA approved this exemption request on October 11, 1994. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19343 Filed 8&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
