Neboysa Radmanovic, press chief of Banja Luka, a city 232 km north of Sarajevo, told the journalists that no Serbian military planes took off today. The press office of the Bosnian (Muslim) Third Army Corps confirmed that Croatian planes today bombed the Brastvo factory in Travnik, central Bosnia, and observers do not rule out the possibility that these were the planes that were later downed. Most observers seem to agree that the downed planes belonged to the Bosnian Serbs, but they do not rule out the possibility that they may be part of the small number of Croatian planes. Serbian and Croatian pilots have been trained at the same schools and use the same type of planes in the now extinct Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The U.S. fighter planes carried out their operation against the Yugoslav-made Galeb (swallows) training planes, in keeping with Resolution 816 of the UN Security Council dated 1 March 1993. This resolution, which received 14 votes in favor while only the PRC abstained, allows the Security Council to begin the so-called "Closed Sky" operation against Bosnian-Serb planes. Since the Croats and the Muslims virtually have no planes, the some 45 Serb planes and helicopters which usually use the Banja Luka airport in northern Sarajevo, own the sky. The United Nations has thus authorized NATO to continuously overfly Bosnian territory with permission from President Alia Izetbegovic, the only person the United Nations recognizes as a representative of divided Bosnia.
