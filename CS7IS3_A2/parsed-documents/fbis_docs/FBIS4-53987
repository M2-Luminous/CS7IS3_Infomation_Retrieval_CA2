If Malaysia, with its plural society, could succeed in forging [word indistinct] situations among its people, there was hope that the Asia Pacific region, with its diverse states and communities, would also be able to succeed, he added. Countries in the Asia Pacific region should never allow Western nations to use the issue of human rights, democracy and economic development as a cudgel to ensure conformity with the new world order in the Western image, he said when opening a conference here Sunday. The five-day conference on Conflict Resolution in the Asian Pacific region: Culture, Problem-Solving and Peacemaking, organised by the Malaysian Science University, is being attended by about 120 scholars, policy-makers and practitioners from 278 countries in the Asia Pacific region. It is time that countries in the Asia Pacific region let no one doubt that our future would be shaped by us and not others, as sovereign nations, we must construct our own agenda for our future and not allow it to be dictated by others, Abdullah said. The Asia Pacific region was in a comfortable position to pursue its own strategic goals that would neatly fit its distinctive cultures, histories, circumstances and national requirements, he said. In this context, he added, the least Asian countries were [word indistinct] positioned to work out and solve their problems relating to nuclear proliferation. As an example, he said North and South Korea, together with China and Japan, could negotiate [words indistinct] in efforts to resolve the current issue between North and South Korea. Abdullah said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries were already on their way towards framing their own security agenda under the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). ASEAN could set not only the manner but also the pace with which it would deal with peacemaking mechanisms and the avoidance of conflict situations by relying on its own experience and cultural tradition. The first ARF meeting in (?Bangkok) in July would test its relevance and usefulness, he said. He also hoped for greater openness and readiness by the West to understand and appreciate Eastern perspectives as the East had done on many international issues. Differences between Western and Eastern perspectives are in fact reconciliable for as long as their ultimate objective remains one of mutual respect and justice. Where there is neither respect nor justice, there could be no peace and violence would ensue, he said.
