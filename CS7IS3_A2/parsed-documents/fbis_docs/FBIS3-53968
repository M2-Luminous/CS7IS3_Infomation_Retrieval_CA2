It appears that no harm was done to investments on the Golan Heights this year as well. Treasury officials this evening confirmed, albeit off the record, that investments will continue at the same level as before, although they will not include new projects. Our correspondent in the north, Moti 'Eden, reports on this issue: [Begin 'Eden recording] The amount of funds to be invested on the Golan Heights this year will not fall from that invested last year. This includes tourism infrastructure, new factories, and the expansion of existing factories. Last year the state invested 100 million shekels for development purposes on the Golan. This included expanding the Qatzrin industrial zone and kibbutzim factories. The industrial output on the Golan in the same period was six times higher than the investment, namely $200 million. [passage omitted] The government plans to invest the same sum of money which was invested last year on the Golan Heights, mainly in industry and tourism projects. [passage omitted] Another special budgetary allocation which was not included in the 100 million shekels allocated to the Golan last year is 40 million shekels used by the Construction and Housing Ministry for renovating Golan Heights roads.
