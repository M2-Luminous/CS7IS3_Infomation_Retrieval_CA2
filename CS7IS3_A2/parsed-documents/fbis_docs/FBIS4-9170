Speaking on Belgrade Radio, Jovanovic described Clinton's statement as "unfortunate and unwelcome in the extreme." Clinton on Wednesday announced a new U.S. plan for Bosnia- Herzegovina, which envisages for massive NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions, command points, supply lines and warehouses, and a tightening of international sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro). Jovanovic expressed special concern at the emergence of outdated thinking about sanctions as profitable in dealing with the crisis in former Yugoslavia, although so far they have been counterproductive. The U.N. Security Council has clamped comprehensive and mandatory sanctions on Yugoslavia for its alleged involvement in the war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina among the local Moslems, Serbs and Croats. "We can only guess at the reasons for the punitive policy being pursued blindly and obstinately when it neither benefits America nor brings a prospect of ending the Bosnian war and establishing peace," Jovanovic said. "We wish to believe that this is the last gasp of a policy which has failed, and that the latest tough stance towards us will be followed by a more rational period in the U.S. policy, which will signal its joining the rational forces on which the world can rely in the efforts to put the final stop to the Bosnian war," Jovanovic said.
