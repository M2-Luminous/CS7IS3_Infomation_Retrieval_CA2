On this occasion, the governor of Yala congratulated the two persons for having admitted their faults and for deciding to become good citizens so that they can live with their families and earn an honest living. He also said that the government authorities are willing to give fair treatment to those who surrender and will try to find ways to enable them to lead peaceful lives in society. The two who surrendered had lived in the jungle for two years and all the time had had to escape government officials. Due to heavy suppression by government authorities in every locality, they therefore contacted officials concerned for their submission. Moreover, the two men disclosed that at present terrorists are scattered in different places after fleeing attacks by government officials. The Yala provincial governor gave some money to the two national developers as a morale-boosting gesture.
