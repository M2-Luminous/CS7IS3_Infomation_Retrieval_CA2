FBIS4-6409 "dreas075_a_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Hata Declines To Express Intentions 17 Apr Hata Declines To Express Intentions 17 Apr OW1704103294 Tokyo KYODO in English 1007 GMT 17 Apr 94 OW1704103294 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 17 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, a front-runner to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, said Sunday [17 April] that he will formally express his decision after ruling coalition partners fine-tune their policies and pick him to run in the race for premier. Hata, head of the coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), made the remarks to reporters on a plane while returning to Japan from Marrakech, Morocco. Hata was in Morocco to attend a four-day ministerial meeting of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) member nations to sign the final agreement of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks. Regarding prospects that the coalition parties will endorse him as a replacement to Hosokawa, Hata, who is also deputy premier, declined to directly express any intention to be a candidate, only saying, "I will hear the views of other (coalition) partners...I'm not in a position to speak about specific matters." On changing the framework of the current coalition, Hata said, "There are many moves within the (primary opposition) Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). A big move has not yet emerged. It will get clearer from tomorrow on what kind of framework (we) will establish." The remark was apparently in reference to former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, an LDP veteran, who is eyeing forming ties with coalition parties, possibly Shinseito and Komeito, the alliance's other key party, to achieve his ambition of succeeding Hosokawa, political sources said. The present seven-party coalition is made up of parties ranging from socialists to conservatives. "In order to employ politics with responsibility, it is desirable that a force or a framework be formed capable of rivaling the LDP," Hata said. Hata hinted at a possible tie-up with Watanabe, who has expressed his readiness to run for the upcoming Diet vote for the premiership to replace Hosokawa. Hosokawa announced his resignation on April 8 over questions regarding his personal finances. Watanabe said Sunday he will leave the party to run in the prime ministerial election. Hata told reporters at Tokyo's Haneda airport, "I would like to respect his determination. He is fit to be leader." Five ruling coalition parties Monday are expected to fine-tune agreement on such key policies as tax reform and their stance on North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program. The meeting will precede coalition leaders' talks on cementing the accords and then picking a successor to Hosokawa.
