At the inauguration of the Spring Peace Fair, Lopez Moreno said: "There is a collective need for the second phase of the dialogue to start soon." This is why he reported that within the next 48 hours he will meet with Peace Commissioner Camacho Solis. Meanwhile, Felipe Aguirre Franco, bishop of the Tuxtla Gutierrez Dioceses, urged the federal government to speed up the release of 21 "alleged Zapatists" who have been staging a hunger strike at Cerro Hueco Penitentiary since last Friday. The bishop indicated that no matter what the circumstances are, justice must be applied within the framework of the Constitution, "freely, swiftly, and expeditiously." In Tapachula, Felipe Arizmedi Esquivel used his Easter message to urge the faithful not to give up hope. He said: "Although the rock at the Holy Sepulcher was heavy, Jesus rose from the dead. Courage, do not give up!" He said: Since 1 January, we have lived in a state of anxiety, doubt, and fear. All of us have asked ourselves: What is going to happen? What violence is going to continue to be unleash? When will we enjoy an honest and true peace? Arizmendi said that what is being felt at the state level has been felt nationwide since the murder in Tijuana. It seems that a very heavy object fell on us, like the enormous rock that covered the Holy Sepulcher. He added: There is a feeling of uncertainty, defeat, and pessimism, as if a solution to the problem cannot be found -- as if we are buried in an abyss without hope. Nevertheless, he said, this bleak outlook will be transformed because "the one crucified has risen from the dead.... Do not fear... He will lead you." Indeed, Christ could not be defeated. He is the Lord of life and the Lord of history, Arizmendi added in his Easter message. This is why we want a new, just, fraternal, united, and pacified Chiapas and Mexico. We must all bury injustice, discrimination, verbal and physical violence, corruption, lies, and arrogance. He insisted: It is necessary to crucify egoism, arrogance, envy, hatred, and the desire for vengeance, and we must open our arms for pardon and reconciliation! Arizmendi noted: Chiapas can rise! Mexico can rise! For the first time in three months, hundreds of people met at the main plaza. More than to mark the initiation of the traditional fair, the meeting was highlighted by the hope of creating a fitting climate to enable peace to dwell forever in San Cristobal. The collective effort carried out during Easter week was designed to ease the tense climate, and it had a tranquilizing effect that caused faith to return. The smile of the fair's queen, "Maria de la Luz," was enough to raise the spirit of those who believe that it will be difficult to smile again in San Cristobal de las Casas. Shortly after placing the crown on and delivering the scepter to the queen of the fair, Governor Javier Lopez Moreno pleaded for San Cristobal to become "to a greater extent a center of civilized coexistence among ethnic groups, religions, and ideologies." He said the city is not simply a common meeting ground for the outlying communities. He said he hoped that "this fair will be an sign, an announcement of what is to come. A peace that is tolled by the bells and nurtured enthusiastically by us is an active peace for all."
