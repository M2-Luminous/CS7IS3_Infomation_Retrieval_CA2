The Faeroese will cast their ballots in early July to vote 32 candidates to the Lagting. On Thursday [19 May] a majority in the Lagting voted to order Lagmand [prime minister] Marita Petersen to call an election on the crisis-ridden islands as soon as possible. The resolution in the Lagting means that election day will come between 4 and 7 July. Petersen thought it unfortunate that an election is being called now, since she would have preferred action to have been taken first on the the approximately 40 important bills recently sent to the Lagting. The Faeroese ruling coalition recently lost its majority, which gave the opportunity for the large opposition Sambands Party to submit a motion that an election be held as soon as possible.
