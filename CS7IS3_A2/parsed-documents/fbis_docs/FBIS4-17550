The newspaper carries a map of the European part of the former Soviet Union showing areas of radiological contamination after the breakdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. "Radiation affected 70 percent of Belarusian territory. Two million and three hundred thousand Belarusians, among them half a million children, are the direct victims of the Chernobyl disaster. These figure are comparable only with the number of victims of Nazi genocide: every fourth out of ten million Belarusians was killed." The newspaper also reports the lack of funds for the elimination of the aftermath of the disaster, a shortage of hospital accommodation, and scarcity of medicines in clinics. PRAVDA on the same subject: "In 1986 the misfortune united people, nations and countries. Now we live wide apart. Chernobyl-affected people regret the break-up of the Soviet Union. They see how the programme for the elimination of the aftermath of the disaster has virtually disintegrated. Meanwhile, the Chernobyl disaster aftermath continues to impair people's health and claim their lives. In 1993 alone, 7,000 more Chernobyl troubleshooters became incapacitated." KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on Cherbobyl disaster aftermath: "Out of 300,000 people in Russia who were affected by the Chernobyl disaster, 30,000 became invalids, more than 5,000 died, and death rate among them grows with every passing year. More than 30,000 of them have no housing accomodation or are in need of improved housing". The newspaper gives opinions of experts who believe that there are no guarantees against other nuclear breakdowns so far. "One may ask how many people would be ready to display heroism and self-sacrifice shown by the Chernobyl troubleshooters, if the country, in the name of which they sacrificed themselves, has sought to forget about them and their needs?" ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI quotes Professor Viktor Mikhailov, Russian Federation minister for nuclear power, as saying that "technically, a breakdonw similar to the Chernobyl one is ruled out. However, this does not mean that no incidents could happen again". TRUD carries an article dedicated to the memory of academician Valeriy Legasov. In 1986, he was a member of the governmental commission for inquiry into the Chernobyl disaster and directly participated in putting out the fire there. In 1988 he committed suicide. The writer of the article makes an attempt to unravel the mystery why Legasov took his own life. TRUD interviewed federation council speaker Vladimir Shumeyko who made an evaluation of a draft treaty on civic accord in Russia. He agreed with the document in principle. "I have some observations to make on individual clauses of the document. But I believe that if we set about refining it, it will never be adopted. Therefore I regard as extremely important and correct the proposal to set up a standing constitutional commission. Such a commission is essential for the entire duration of the treaty and moratorium on political wars", Shumeyko said. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA runs an inteview with constitutional court member Valeriy Zorkin. Asked about his attitude to the draft treaty on civic accord, Zorkin said that "while sharing on the whole the idea of the treaty and supporting it, I think its initiators has seriously miscalculated, failing to arrange for a countrywide discussion of the draft treaty, as is provided for in an appropriate presidential instruction. "The treaty will be really effective when it becomes agreement of the people, not just of elites or individual citizens even if they are worthy of respect". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reprints Boris Yeltsin's interview with DER SPIEGEL magazine. Touching upon the question of Russia's involvement in NATO's Partnership-for-Peace programme, the Russian president said: "We are prepared to sign the partnership agrement but at the same time we would like to sign with NATO an additional protocol to settle a number of principled matters". NEZAVISIAMAYA GAZETA runs a list of 50 most powerful and influential figures of Russian business. The list includes the names of the chiefs of major commercial organisations -- banks. Exchanges, foundations, joint-stock companies, trading houses, insurance companies, joint ventures, etc. SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA runs a report delivered by Gennadiy Zyuganov, chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Russian Communist Party, at an all-Russia party conference in April.
