These included, among others, the confrontational manner of political communication, lack of concept in economic policy, the politicizing of the economy, the delaying of transformation, and the deterioration of economic and social indicators. In the present, difficult situation, the government wants to seek optimal and pragmatic solutions to unpostponable problems. It intends to continue all the positive steps taken by the previous government. It regards as the most important tasks stabilizing the political, economic, social, and security situation, warding off the collapse in health care, education, culture, and the judiciary, and completing the drafting of conceptual documents and legislative norms. With regard to foreign relations, it wants to effectively defend the interests of Slovakia and tackle existing problems in a professional way. Risks of the Starting Position of the Economy In 1993, the first year of the existence of the independent Slovak Republic, the development of the economy deteriorated once again, particularly in the first half of the year. This was caused by the previous government's lack of concept in preparing the independent existence of the Slovak economy, gross shortcomings in its economic policy, and the slowing down of the transformation process and privatization, in particular. This found expression in another decline of real GDP by 4.1 percent, in a decline of industrial production by 13.5 percent, and in a drop of construction output by almost one-fourth. The conditions of internal and external balance substantially deteriorated compared with 1992. The deficit of the state budget, which increased to 23 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] (6.8 percent of GDP), not only contributed to further price growth but, by siphoning off credit resources, also had an extremely adverse influence on the development of the entrepreneurial sphere. The increase in the budget deficit was accounted for, apart from the decline in GDP, also by shortcomings in preparing the introduction of the new system of taxation and insurance. In spite of the Sk's devaluation, exports declined sharply (11.5 percent compared with 1992), while imports grew at a relatively rapid pace (15.4 percent), which resulted in a Sk26.7 billion deficit in the foreign trade balance. At the same time, the clearing account registering trade with the Czech Republic showed a deficit of Sk5.8 billion, which, while representing an extraordinary boost to budget revenues in 1993, aggravated, on the other hand, the starting position for budget management in 1994. The starting position of the state budget for 1994 is also made worse by the unresolved liabilities of public sector branches -- health care, transportation, education, and others -- which were not included in the 1993 state budget deficit. These represent an additional burden of more than Sk6 billion for the 1994 budget. As a result of deficit financing, which assumed unrestrained dimensions toward the end of 1993, the net debt indebtedness of the government sector rose to Sk60.0 billion. This substantially increased the debt servicing burden for the state budget in 1994 and the subsequent years. The price level went up 23.2 percent in 1993, more than double the 1992 price growth. The unfavorable development of the Slovak economy in the years 1992 and 1993 also found expression in growing unemployment and in the social situation of the population. By the end of 1993 the rate of unemployment increased to 14.4 percent. The preceding government did not take resolute steps to stabilize the conditions for the development of the entrepreneurial sphere and in support of its development. This was reflected in another increase in the number of companies operating at a loss, the proportion of which reached 57.5 percent by the end of 1993, with their aggregate loss amounting to Sk42.5 billion. This further aggravated companies' inability to pay their bills and acted as a brake on monetary flows. Our predecessors are accountable for the -- by international standards -- low inflow of foreign investments, primarily because they failed to ensure essential political and economic stability and because the government's low credibility deterred foreign investors. This is reflected in the fact that the overall volume of foreign investments reached only Sk10.8 billion by the end of 1993, which was Sk4.2 billion more than at the end of 1992, but, when Czech investors' capital is subtracted, the increase represented only Sk3 billion. The inflow of foreign capital had a declining tendency in the course of 1993. Economic Intentions and Targets In contrast to the preceding government's program, our program proceeds from the longer-term aims of the Slovak economy's development. On this basis, during our term of office we want to lay the foundations for new dynamizing [dynamizujici] elements, regardless of the fact that their effects will make themselves felt only later. The government's unequivocal intention is to speed up the embarked-upon process of transforming the economy and ownership relations, in particular. We will set the process of privatization in motion again, with respect to which we will return to the tried-and-tested method of coupon privatization, which had in the past won citizens' trust. We regard successful transformation as the prerequisite for the development of a modern and efficient economy that will enable the Slovak Republic to join the league of economically advanced countries and to raise the living standards of the population. We pledge to retain the social tolerability of transformation. We will conduct social dialogue to achieve generally acceptable solutions in the interest of maintaining social peace. We will devote particular attention to the socially weakest strata of the population. The government realizes that at the root of the development of society lie the initiative and responsibility of every individual and every economic and non-economic organization. The government's task is to act as the catalyst of this initiative. Points of Departure of Macroeconomic Policy The government considers macroeconomic stability to be one of the basic features determining the development of the Slovak Republic's economy. The attainment of this stability is conditional on the implementation of prudent budget, tax, wage, price, subsidies, and customs policies. This means drawing as close as possible in 1994 to zero-growth of GDP, maintaining price growth in the range of 10 to 13 percent, keeping unemployment under the 17 percent limit, and meeting the commitment [not further specified, referring possibly to the commitment to keep budget deficit under 4 percent of GDP as recommended by the IMF]) in budget management. In budget policy, the government will focus on closing the unfavorable budget management for 1993 and the preceding years. It will have to resolve the high deficit of the state budget for 1993 bequeathed to it by the previous government. To prevent the situation of 1993 from recurring, the government will focus in 1994 on securing revenues for the state budget. It will implement measures to mobilize budget resources and, in strictly defined cases, reduce budget expenditures and will strive, in general, to bring about order in finances. It will adopt measures to prevent tax evasion, reduce outstanding tax arrears, unblock claims abroad, and address the issue of debts stemming from the pre-1993 period. We will establish conditions for a more extensive utilization of the financing of development targets from foreign resources. At the same time we want to make transparent the existing system of obtaining foreign credits and assessing their effectiveness. We will therefore tighten the criteria governing the assumption of liabilities vis-a-vis foreign partners. We consider it essential that every credit taken abroad should establish prerequisites for its repayment and strengthen the economic position of the Slovak Republic. Macroeconomic Policy The government will adjust macroeconomic policy with a view to attaining its macroeconomic targets. Without bringing about a fundamental turnabout in the company sphere, we will not only fail to achieve the set macroeconomic targets but the unfavorable tendencies will continue to intensify. The government's attention will center on speeding up the commercialization [komercionalizacia] and transformation of state enterprises in terms of ownership in order to finally resolve the institutional vacuum, in which companies have found themselves in the last four years and to shorten the intolerably long pre-privatization agony of companies. With respect to commercialized state enterprises, the government will make use of the motivating function of managerial contracts and will limit its interference to rigid financial control. By its economic policy the government will establish prerequisites for eliminating the causes of the intolerable growth of company indebtedness and will take specific steps in the legislative sphere, and to secure the course of court proceedings in commercial matters and bankruptcy proceedings, which will help speed up the financial restructuring of companies. It will speed up negotiations on obtaining a loan for restructuring the company and banking sphere (EFSAL) [expanison unknown]. We will orient our efforts also toward improving the competitive environment and finalizing the system, and intensifying the activity, of institutions charged with promoting the development of businesses, such as the National Agency for the Support and Development of Small and Medium-Sized Businesses, consultancy centers, Slovenska Zarucna Banka [Slovak Guarantee Bank], and the like. In this process we will cooperate with entrepreneurs's associations and with the Slovak Chamber of Commerce and Industry. We regard a strong private sector, operating on the basis of market principles and private ownership, as the source of Slovak economic prosperity. Therefore, we want to expeditiously eliminate obstacles and restrictions to the development of the private sector in the legislative and administrative spheres and help tackle the financial prerequisites for the further development of private entrepreneurial activities. We will support private activities even in those sectors of public services that have until now been the exclusive domain of the state. Foreign investment, which should help eliminate the acute shortage of capital, will represent one of the dynamizing elements of the economy. We want to create a stable and favorable entrepreneurial environment that will be attractive also for foreign investors and take specific steps to facilitate their becoming involved in the economy of the Slovak Republic. We will establish conditions to substantially improve and increase the flow of information to foreign investors and will give support to those, whose entry will accelerate the development of the economy. Privatization One of the most serious causes of the intensification of negative tendencies in the development of the economy was the slowing down, and virtual halting, of privatization. Lack of concept compounded by lack of transparency and exceptionally hasty privatization in the closing days of the previous government's term of office have brought about loss of confidence [in privatization] among citizens. We consider it our priority to restore the confidence of citizens and foreign investors alike in the process of privatization in Slovakia. In this spirit we are taking measures to speed up the privatization process in such a way that, by the time the second wave of coupon privatization is concluded, more than one-half of all property in state ownership should get into private hands. At the same time we will establish conditions for effective control of privatization by the public. The government will secure the equality of privatization methods and the equality of participants in privatization. It will consistently attend to making privatization transparent and will prevent political deformations of this process. In contrast to the preceding government, which considered coupon privatization a residual method and was deferring its preparation, this government will approach it as an equal method and, within the framework of its mandate, will also secure the commencement of the second wave of coupon privatization. We will speed up the realization of already prepared and undisputed privatization projects by means of standard methods. We will offer certain enterprises, or their parts, to domestic and foreign interested parties who will demonstrate their credibility and will submit the most interesting projects, interesting not only in financial terms but also from the viewpoint of entrepreneurial plans. Sectoral Policy Industry, Construction, Trade, and Tourism The government's priority in industry will be, above all, raising the ability of Slovak products to compete. We consider support for the restructuring and revitalization of industrial companies to be the foundation of sectoral policy. We will speed up the privatization of arms companies, which was kept being delayed thus far, while at the same time securing the state's adequate participation so as to be able to preserve the strategic interests of defense and security. In the sphere of energy, the government will draw up a proposal for the organization, restructuring, and gradual privatization of enterprises that are now in state ownership, providing for well-considered participation by foreign capital. Based on foreign experience, the government will proceed particularly circumspectly in the process of transforming and privatizing the energy sector in order to preserve the state's energy sufficiency. It will prepare regulatory measures to prevent unwarranted price increases in this sector. Our main target in the construction industry, apart from giving support to small entrepreneurs, will be to establish conditions for the utilization of our large-scale capacities to build transport infrastructure and complete unfinished apartments and energy projects. We will take the necessary steps to make possible the export of construction capacities. We will speed up negotiations on the completion of the Mochovce nuclear power plant. The preceding government did not make use of the dynamizing potentials of tourism for the development of the Slovak economy. In contrast to the preceding government, we will focus on the development of tourism with a view of increasing its share in the generation of new jobs, revitalizing individual regions, and increasing foreign exchange earnings. We will speed up the privatization of companies engaged in tourism, will prepare the institutional framework for tourism promotion and a law on tourism, will intensify the promotion of Slovakia, and the like. Transport, Communications, and Public Works In the sector of transport and communications, we will replace by pragmatic solutions the previous practice of unsuitable interventions and statements, which brought about stagnation in those areas and met with unfavorable response abroad. The government will draw up and submit to parliament for discussion, still during its term of office, a draft amendment to the Law on Railroads, a Bill on the Health Insurance of Railroad Employees and the Railroad Employees' Health Insurance Company, a Bill on Road Transportation, as well as a Bill on Telecommunications. It will follow up on all legislative and preparatory work and all studies and blueprints aimed at the development of infrastructure in transportation, postal services and communications, and the institution of public works and will secure a more distinct progress of all those projects. The need to take care of the citizens' housing situation was not fully appreciated in the preceding period. We will draw up, and will begin to implement, our own concept of housing policy, including the completion of unfinished apartments and infrastructure and amenities. We will initiate and speed up the launching of privatization of the housing stock and an increase of investments in the housing economy. We will clarify the legal framework regarding expropriation for projects in public interest. Agriculture In agriculture, the government will orient its activities toward meeting the basic strategic targets adopted by the National Council of the Slovak Republic. We consider agriculture to be one of our priorities. Establishing prerequisites for stabilizing agriculture, halting a further production decline, securing continuity of agricultural production, and ensuring conditions for its qualitative growth remain the primary tasks. We want to clarify the arrangement of property relations and claims in agricultural cooperatives, speed up the transformation of proprietary relations with regard to soil, particularly the privatization of state farms, and establish conditions for agricultural enterprises' faster adaptation to the new conditions. Following up on the transformation of proprietary relations, we are planning a new organizational arrangement of the forest economy. The implementation of the program of remedial measures in forests damaged by pollutants will continue by drawing on domestic as well as foreign financial resources. Development of the Financial Sector The government is interested in the formation of a competitive commercial banking sector. In the endeavor to contribute to this process, we will support measures designed to continue the privatization of banks, improve the banks' portfolio, and reinforce the banks' capital stock, including reinforcement from outside capital resources. One of the aims of this support is to significantly raise the level of Slovak banks' international acceptance and to integrate them into the international banking system as fully fledged members. We will also devote attention to the expansion of insurance services mitigating entrepreneurial risks, particularly to insuring export credits. We will also give consideration to a system of insuring citizens' bank deposits and to the formation of credit cooperatives. Foreign Economic Policy Some areas of foreign economic policy remained unresolved in the preceding period. Essential measures designed to protect the market in the transitional period, as well as exceptionally needed export-promoting measures, kept being delayed, which caused a further intensification of external disequilibrium and economic decline. We will therefore strive, above all, to give finishing touches to export-promoting policy and to implement it across-the-board in order support the export potentials of Slovak companies. In justified cases we will also secure an adequate protection of the internal market. Ecology and Economic Policy In this chapter the government expresses its intentions to separate the protection of natural resources from their utilization, to distribute resources from the State Environmental Fund not only from the viewpoint of the priorities of individual districts but Slovakia as a whole, to consolidate the Slovak Environmental Agency, and to complete legislation related to the environment. Social Sphere The rate of unemployment reached almost 14.8 percent in February 1994, which represents almost 380,000 unemployed registered with labor offices. In February 1994 the rate of unemployment exceeded 20 percent in 14 districts, with the district of Rimavska Sobota reporting a rate of unemployment of 26.7 percent. The growth of long-term unemployment (the average period of registration represented 229 days at the end of 1993), as well as the fact that, by the end of 1993, the category of young people under 25 represented almost one-third of all unemployed, must be regarded as a particularly negative phenomenon. Apart from the growth of unemployment, the deterioration of the social situation and the living conditions of the population in 1993 was also caused by another increase in the cost of living, which went up 22.8 percent compared with the preceding year, and by a 2.6 percent decline of real earnings. Single-parent families, families with several children, and pensioners are the worst off. The proportion of households with children whose income in 1993 was lower than 1.5 times the subsistence minimum reached 61.9 percent, with 15.2 percent of households with children finding themselves below the subsistence level. The unfavorable social situation of citizens was tackled by means of the provision of welfare payments. A total of 239,000 recipients of these payments were registered in 1993, more than 140,000 of whom were long-term unemployed. Welfare payments were collected by 8.6 percent of households with dependent children. From the viewpoint of the situation in the sphere of employment, the government will reassess, on the basis of a thorough analysis of the labor market, the instruments of active employment policy, while respecting the demand that financial resources be spent rationally and effectively and while respecting the situation on regional labor markets. It will place particular emphasis on active employment policy, on reassessing the provision of material benefits also from the viewpoint of the gradual transfer of this care to the insurance system, as well as on expanding the possibilities for our citizens to assert themselves in the work process, and protecting the labor market, by means of bilateral contracts with other states. The transformation of the existing systems of pension schemes, health insurance, state social payments, and welfare payments into systems of social insurance, state social support, and social assistance remains the government's basic conceptual intention in the sphere of social security. From the viewpoint of topical tasks in the sphere of social security, we consider it necessary: -- to tackle the issue of child allowances as the key form of state transfer payments for families with children, -- to analyze the functionality of the National Insurance Company, -- to create legislative foundations for a system of supplementary pension insurance, -- to continue to gradually create conditions for humanizing the care of physically and mentally severely disabled persons and elderly citizens, with particular emphasis on the actual guarantee of their rights, -- and to gradually establish conditions for the activity of non- state entities in the social sphere. Health Care The present unfavorable situation in health care results from the disrupted continuity of the 1992 health care reform and from the introduction of some incorrect systemic steps, compounded by a drastic cut in financial resources. As of 31 December 1993 health care establishments reported unpaid bills of Sk1.8 billion, of which bills for medical drugs account for Sk1.2 billion. The remainder is made up of bills for energy, fuel, and food supplies and reconstruction and modernization projects. Health care has found itself in a critical financial situation, as a consequence of which one can also speak about a high level of hidden indebtedness (which is estimated at Sk50 billion). In 1992, 17.1 billion Czechoslovak korunas were spent on the operation of health care facilities, in 1993 Sk16.2 billion, and, disregarding inflation and the introduction of systemic measures, the use of only Sk14.2 billion was projected for 1994. The government's main aim in the sphere of health care will be to deal with the financial crisis, which directly threatens the provision of health care and slows down the transformation process. The following measures are inevitable to ward off an imminent collapse: -- to quantify and specify the justified demands of health care on the state budget for 1993 and determine the method of settling the liabilities of health care facilities, -- to find ways of alleviating the budget deficit in health care for 1994, -- to carry out changes in the existing system of payments for health services. In the sphere of financing health care and health insurance, the government will strive to establish conditions to financially secure the provision of basic health care, support the development of the Health Insurance Fund, and secure its independent operation. The system of assessing the value of health services introduced as of 1 October 1993 will have to be replaced by a new solution that will be more effective, simpler, less demanding administratively, and less costly. The new system will have to be prepared in a differentiated way, separately for individual types of health care providers. We will continue to privatize health care facilities, using publicly controllable criteria. In the course of April we will ensure the drafting and publication of conditions for the privatization of pharmacies and health spas. Changes in ownership must not jeopardize the therapeutic functions of natural springs spas. A majority participation by the state in the privatization of key spa facilities is foreseen. By the end of June 1994 we will prepare documents for the privatization of primary health care establishments. In connection with the implementation of essential changes to the existing system of payments for health services, the government will establish conditions for a solution to the wage conditions of health care employees. School System, Education, and Science High educational and cultural standards of the population represent the basic source of a state's wealth. Advanced countries pursue the strategy of growth of investments into the sphere of education and science. In defiance of this worldwide trend, both the conceptual and the everyday issues concerning the development of education, science, and research have been neglected in our country of late. The budget of the department of education and science has been cut by Sk2.795 billion over the last two years. The already low budget for 1994 is further reduced by a debt of Sk298 million stemming from the year 1993. The situation is so grave that, if education retained all its functions at the level of 1993, the budget resources allocated for education and science would be exhausted in the 9th month of 1994, even if the price level remained constant. The situation is compounded by the fact that no legal norms have been drawn up and introduced into practice that would make it possible to introduce progressive forms of management into schools and educational establishments. As a result of the grim situation in the sphere of education and science, which is documented, for example, by the breakup of kindergartens, school catering, and school accommodation, the government will pay particular heed to ensuring a calm completion of the 1993/94 school year and preparation of the new 1994/95 school year. For this reason we consider it unavoidable to write off the 1993 debts of schools and educational establishments, to adequately amend the state budget for education and science for 1994, and to reassess the existing structure of revenues and expenditures in the department of education. We will explore additional sources of revenue at home and abroad. The government regards as one of the decisive tasks the formulation of the republic's strategic interests in the sphere of education and training and the commencement of work on drafting the National Program of Education and Training. The government will ensure the drafting of the Concept of Developing University Education in the Slovak Republic Until the Year 2010 and the transformation of the existing system into a system that will flexibly react to the needs of the labor market and will be compatible with the system of education in the countries of the European Union. Based on experience from the implementation of the law on higher educational establishments, the government will establish prerequisite for the drafting of a new law or for amending the existing law. We want to consistently support the development of science and technology in the directions designated as priorities as an important prerequisite of economic, social, and cultural growth under the conditions of an unfolding market economy. We will submit to the National Council of the Slovak Republic for adoption a law on state support for science and technology. We will propose the establishment of the Slovak Republic State Fund for Science and Technology as well as an independent Slovak Republic Grant Agency for Science and Technology, which should help preserve and develop the intellectual base of the state and prevent academics and researchers from leaving universities and research institutes. The government will also ensure a regular and consistent process of mutual recognition [akreditacia] of universities and the research and development base. Based on a realistic assessment of the present situation in, and standard of, physical education and sports, we want to establish the necessary institutional, legislative, and economic conditions for the development of physical education and sports, with emphasis on financing them from central sources through the medium of the State Physical Education Fund. By giving support to top-performance sports, we will contribute to the successful representation of the Slovak Republic in sports. For the needs of public administration and division of powers between state administration and self-administrative bodies, the government will draft an optimal variant of management and administration of primary and secondary schools, providing for the gradual transfer of some of the powers of central bodies of state administration to local state administration and self-administrative bodies. Culture The government will draft a basic concept of long-term strategy for developing culture under the conditions of the transformation of the economic and social system. It will also prepare a basic model of the organizational arrangement and financing of culture, a model that will ensure functional ties in the emerging market environment. The government's basic aim is to establish legislative prerequisites for the transition from the central financing of culture toward providing incentives, and introducing preferences, for investments in this sphere. At the same time, it is necessary to retain the possibility of supporting directly, by means of the state-run PRO SLOVAKIA [capitalization as published] fund, those areas of culture, in which the market instruments do not assert themselves. We will support the drafting of an analysis of the functioning of this fund, with emphasis on the attainment of the expected targets and its position. [sentence as published] We will continue our efforts to finalize the legislative, political, and social scope for the functioning of media at the level of the European standard. The law on the mass media, now in preparation, and the law on economic support for the periodical press will lay the groundwork for this. Complicated problems arise from the failure to approve the license for the second channel of Slovak Television. This issue will have to be resolved as soon as possible. Ethnic Policy We would like to achieve social consensus that will guarantee the stability and peaceful coexistence of all citizens of the Slovak Republic, regardless of nationality and the color of their skin. A prerequisite for this necessary consensus is the mutuality of rights and duties, combined with the civic principle. The government is prepared to provide all necessary guarantees of rights to persons belonging to ethnic minorities. On the other hand, it expects the fulfillment of constitutional civic duties, which is an important prerequisite for ruling out instances of ultra-nationalism, irredentism, and separatism. Instead of confrontation, we will introduce the mechanism of permanent dialogue as a method that promotes cooperation and seeks consensus in generating and exercising rights of citizens belonging to ethnic minorities. State, Democracy, Law, and Public Order In this extensive chapter the government pledges to continue to devolve powers to the community self-administration bodies. It will explore the possibilities of introducing the institution of the ombudsman. It will strive to eliminate shortcomings in state administration resulting from procrastination, incompetence, and the like. It will continue to implement the concept of stabilizing the judiciary and the long-term program of combating crime, particularly organized crime and the legalization of income originating from organized crime. Aims and Tasks in Legislation In this chapter the government undertakes to speed up the adoption of legislative norms compatible with laws of the European Union. It is determined to pass in the National Council of the Slovak Republic a law on the conflict of interests in the performance of duties, pertaining to constitutional officials and higher-level state administration officials. It will prepare a law on the obligation to prove the origin of financial resources used in privatization. The government wants to improve the legislative conditions for the functioning of the entrepreneurial and non-profit spheres. Security and Defense of the State In this chapter the government undertakes to finalize conceptual documents pertaining to the Slovak Republic's security and defense policy and to submit to the National Council of the Slovak Republic a document specifying cooperation with NATO. It wants to get ahead with the transformation of the army and make a more efficient use of resources. Foreign Policy The basic principles of foreign policy, approved by the National Council of the Slovak Republic when the Slovak Republic was founded, do not change with a change in government. The present government wants to build on the results achieved heretofore, even though it has its own ideas about non-confrontational methods and about creating a more positive image of Slovakia abroad.
