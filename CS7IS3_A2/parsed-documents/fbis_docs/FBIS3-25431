After UNITA and the WFP had reached an agreement concerning a suspension of hostilities to allow people to receive food aid, Jonas Savimbi's men proceeded to shoot at a WFP aircraft yesterday, shortly after it had taken off from Malange Airport, where it left food aid for the local people. Today Malange was again the target for shelling, preventing the arrival of more food aid for the people. The decision to suspend humanitarian aid naturally rests with the government. Norberto dos Santos, minister for assistance and social reintegration, is here to comment on that. Good evening, Mr. Minister. [Dos Santos] Good evening. [Lemos] To begin with, thank you very much for saying yes to our invitation. We would like to know what the situation is now concerning humanitarian aid? [Dos Santos] Yes, we were in touch recently with the director for the unit responsible for coordinating humanitarian aid. He is just back from Huambo. He has informed us that he has received guarantees from UNITA that flights to Malange could resume tomorrow in safety. I would like to let you know here that we tried a flight to Malange at about 1400 today. Though we had received a report from Huambo that UNITA had already given the aforesaid guarantees, unfortunately the aircraft had to return to Luanda because it was shot at as it prepared to land at Malange Airport. It did not land. Coincidentally, WFP Coordinator Aranda da Silva was still in Huambo at the time and he proceeded to get in touch with UNITA officials yet again. Mr. Aranda da Silva arrived this evening and I was in contact with him less than 10 minutes ago. He came back with the guarantee that flights to Malange can resume tomorrow. We said we were in agreement that flights should resume at 0700 and the government will decide on this matter depending on what happens to that flight tomorrow. So, let us see what will happen, so we can test the truth of the promises UNITA has made to Mr. Aranda da Silva. [Lemos] That means, then, that aid will continue normally? [Dos Santos] Tomorrow, we will conduct our first test flight to Malange and, depending on what happens with that flight, all other flights may or may not take place. [Lemos] How many flights have been scheduled for tomorrow? [Dos Santos] There were flights to Saurimo, Dundo, Luena, Cazombo, (Lumbalanguimbo), Mavinga, Uige, Negage, Huambo, Malange, Menongue, Cuito, and M'banza Congo scheduled for tomorrow. Flights are also supposed to be leaving Catumbela tomorrow for Huambo, Cuito, Malange, and Luena. [Lemos] Mr. Minister: Are there no forecasts concerning increased flights to areas in need? For instance, the people of Cuito complain about the number of flights to that city. [Dos Santos] Yes, I would like to say that 17 flights have been planned for Cuito this week, meaning that 102 tonnes of food will be leaving from Luanda for that city. Another 17 such flights are also planned for Catumbela, making up a total of 153 tonnes of food. Added to the aid to be flown from Luanda, a total of 255 tonnes are scheduled for Cuito. We are concerned about Malange because there have been no flights to that city for the last four days and, as everybody knows, the situation there is dramatic. That means that some 500 tonnes of food aid have not been flown to that city, so we are concerned and we hope that things will turn out well tomorrow. [Lemos] May it be so. Once again, thank you for granting us this interview. [Dos Santos] Thank you and good night.
