In a statement, the National Union of Petroleum and Gas Workers (Nupeng) said it would call a strike from July 4 if the military did not meet its demand. The statement said that the military should "quit the political stage now, and permanently." "The military should restore all the dismantled democratic/political structures that were in place in 1993, and call on the acclaimed winner of June 12, 1993 presidential election to negotiate a peaceful hand-over of the reins of government to satisfy the yearnings of the teeming millions of Nigerians who voluntarily gave him that historic mandate." Abiola has been imprisoned since last Thursday after he declared he was forming a government to coincide with the anniversary of the June 12, 1993 elections which were annulled by the military government. He is widely believed to have won last year's poll. Nupeng said that if the government failed to meet these demands, the union would call a strike "pending the resolution of the national crisis in order to avoid a situation which may lead to a bloody revolt." The strike threat came as military leader General Sani Abacha said that a constitutional conference, which opened here Monday, would determine the date when the ruling military junta will turn over power to civilians. "This administration will not `perpetuate' itself in power as insinuated by some people," he added. "We are committed to a steady process of democratisation. We are ready to surrender power through a peaceful and orderly process." But the conference, a cornerstone of the administration's blueprint for a return to democratic rule, is viewed by the opposition as "a ruse" for the military to perpetuate its hold on power.
