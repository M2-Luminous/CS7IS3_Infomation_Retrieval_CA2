But 1994 also threatens to be a terrible year. Here is why. In mid-November, Sister Maria Lucia Soncini gave in to the Internal Revenue Service. "We were gathered together for our spiritual exercises when I decided to take a bold step," said this mother superior of 22 cloistered Dominican sisters of the San Giuseppe nunnery in the town of Fontanellato (population 6,000, with one parish), 20 km from Parma. "There would be no more Eucharist wafers for the local parishioners." She said the taxes were to blame. "They wanted to make us open a VAT [value-added tax] account, and they ordered us to have a cash register. We would also be required to produce receipts and invoices.... All because of 200,000 lire in sales per month. I sought advice, and was told that this was more trouble than it was worth. Then a fellow nun from a convent in Macerata told me that for their wafers they had been fined 6 million lire, and I thought: Where would I get such a sum? I made up my mind on the spot. Enough is enough. No more holy wafers." Sister Maria Lucia and the other nuns will henceforth prepare the Host only for their own convent. "Now I want to see if they will also impose a tax on homemade bread," she added. Well, it would not be surprising if they did. An internal revenue service--the only one in the world that dares to make its citizens pay a tax of 100,000 lire (for opening a VAT account) in order to collect other taxes--might well entertain such an idea. Especially in these times. The year 1993 was the annus horribilis [terrible year] of taxes, in which the burden on individual citizens and firms underwent an exceptionally sharp rise following a decade of sustained and constant growth--the sharpest rise recorded in any of the industrialized countries. In the meantime, however, the services provided by the state neither increased nor improved, and neither did the fight against tax evasion make any progress. According to some economists--for example, Paolo Leon and his colleagues of the CLES [expansion not given] research institute--the tax burden as a percentage of GDP grew by more than 1.5 percent in 1993. Inasmuch as GDP has risen to more than 1.5 quadrillion lire, the computation is easily made. Individual citizens and firms in 1993 paid over 20 trillion lire more in taxes than they did the previous year. It is an enormous sum. Until a few weeks ago, however, Finance Minister Franco Gallo was declaring with pride that the tax burden had actually been lighter in 1993 than during the 12 previous months: specifically, 1 percent lighter. Not even he is making that claim any longer, however. On the afternoon of Monday, 3 January, Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi reached Gallo by telephone in Venice--where the finance minister was vacationing--to agree on a statement concerning the progress made with respect to taxes, in response to the thousand controversies that had broken out the previous day. Gallo suggested that it would be better to talk about the expectations for 1994, the year when--the government promises--the tax burden should decrease by 1.2 percent. This stated objective is at variance, however, with rumors concerning an umpteenth fiscal maneuver to be carried out next spring, and also with the plethora of taxes large and small that were actually enacted late last year and that the taxpayers will have to pay in 1994. The government--and some newspapers--have called this maneuver "the minimaneuver." Perhaps because it will impact a populace that has already been hard hit--and perhaps also because spirits are already overheated in anticipation of the spring elections--it has caused an uproar. At the very beginning of the year, Mario Segni lit the fuse by floating the idea of a fiscal pact between the state and its citizens that would be based on the imposition of "a strict freeze on the tax burden." Segni is convinced that "a limit on the tax burden and on public spending as a percentage of GDP must be established as a constitutional norm, so that it cannot be circumvented." It is an idea--welcomed by the moderate elements--that has suddenly appeared to be the ideal adhesive to bind together a center-right program for governing: an idea for which Silvio Berlusconi--the publisher of PANORAMA (among other things) who has now been projected onto the political stage--offered an explanation. "It is not possible to improve public accounts by increasing revenues without controlling spending." We should abandon the old method and put a ceiling on taxes--a ceiling written into law. "What we need," he explained, "is constitutional norms to regulate the decisions made concerning taxation and spending. We can no longer allow ourselves to sign promissory notes." Lega leader Umberto Bossi quickly gave his approval, hastening to point out that he himself has been reiterating these ideas for a long time. But the opposite front--the left front--has been firing point-blank broadsides at the Segni-Berlusconi proposal. The harshest criticism has come from PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] leader Achille Occhetto. "It is a demagogic idea," he said, "that resembles those propounded by petty South American dictators. It is as if I--to win votes--were to promise that if I won, I would hand out champagne and brioches to all Italians." Writing in L'UNITA, Vincenzo Visco--who was finance minister for a few hours in the Ciampi administration and is currently the PDS expert on taxation--branded the concept of a ceiling on taxes with similarly harsh words. "It is mere propaganda," he said. Giorgio La Malfa, Ottaviano Del Turco, and a number of economists are also on the same wavelength. "One of the old evils of the financial left is surfacing," says Giulio Tremonti, one of Italy's best known tax experts, "namely, the belief that reform of the public debt is possible within the old framework represented by the current system of taxation, whereas it is necessary to get rid of the entire system." Bocconi University Rector Mario Monti and other economists, while keeping their distance from the strident tones of the controversy, have nonetheless welcomed the fact that the political confrontation is finally moving toward concrete issues. And it is hard to find anything more concrete than taxes. To find new revenues in 1993, the government was compelled to resort to three different economic maneuvers in only seven months: in May; in September, on the occasion of the introduction of the budget bill; and now, at year's end. Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa has himself acknowledged that "taxes in 1993 reached levels that are truly unbearable." "For example," he pointed out, "we paid taxes on our homes two or three times." In the year just ended, the measures enacted by the previous government--that of Giuliano Amato--began to take effect, starting with the drastic revision of the IRPEF [personal income tax] rates that suddenly raised the tax burden on individuals to the very high levels that prevailed before 1988. The increase in the rates was by no means compensated by the tax reduction on ownership of the first home or even the reduction in the advance payment of the IRPEF to 95 percent from 98 percent, among other things because the Amato administration had taken steps to thin out the deductions allowed. For example, the ILOR (local income tax) is no longer deductible, and medical expenses, insurance expenses, and interest paid on loans are deductible to a lesser extent than in the past. Even the VAT underwent repeated upward revisions during 1993, the last of which came at year's end. The tax was raised to 13 percent from 12 percent on 17 classes of products ranging from disks to corn flakes [preceding two words in English], from ornamental plants to lobsters, and from certain articles of clothing to shoes. It was reduced on five-star hotels to 13 percent from 19 percent, but compared to the other revisions these are clearly of little significance, among other things because in the financial maneuver of last May the government provided that the advance VAT payments would be made even earlier and would be raised to 90 percent from 60 percent. The experts have calculated that the average rate of VAT increased half a percentage point in one year--to 12 percent from 11.5 percent. In absolute terms, this represents an additional 2 trillion lire for the state coffers. In the group of the five major taxes--i.e., those that yield the most substantial percentages of the total of taxes collected--only the IRPEG [corporate income tax] and ILOR were not revised upward. There is talk of reducing the tax withheld on bank interest, but for the time being it remains at 30 percent. In the meantime, those taxes that are technically defined as "excise taxes" and that constitute the third source of revenue--i.e., the taxes on gasoline, methane, and alcoholic beverages--were also raised. In 1993, the minimum tax [preceding two words in English] began to yield revenue: According to some estimates, it produced approximately 4 trillion lire for the state coffers, while the ICI--the municipal real estate tax--yielded 14 trillion. But it was not just the major taxes. It was also a year to forget as far as minor taxes were concerned. For example, the EC directive "on the subject of the exemption of dividends from the income tax levied on mother-daughter companies" was received in March. Whereas in all the European countries minimum thresholds of participation were established to determine when a company may be regarded as a "daughter" company--with the aim of facilitating the exemption to the maximum possible extent--in Italy the very high threshold of 25 percent was chosen. "It is a self-destructive measure," comments Enrico Nuzzo, professor of tax law at the University of Naples. "You not only do not attract foreign capital and foreign companies in this manner, but you also do not halt the exodus of Italian capital and Italian enterprises." If 1993 made the taxpayers cry, 1994 is making them tremble. No sooner had the end-of-the-year maneuver been executed than rumors began to circulate to the effect that another maneuver would be necessary immediately after the elections, obviously accompanied by the usual tax increases. Even Undersecretary of Finance Stefano De Luca and Raffaello Lupi, tax expert and adviser to Finance Minister Gallo, do not deny this. "One cannot rule out the possibility of an adjustment in the spring designed to plug other holes in the tax structure; to thwart tax evasion strategies; and at the same time to grant tax relief, as for example with respect to taxes on company profits that are reinvested." Hypotheses are already being advanced as to the measures that might be taken: for example, more stringent laws relating to transactions conducted entirely abroad by Italian companies and relating to mergers among companies. This does not mean that the category of unearned income has been overlooked. At the very end of the year, the government decided to introduce a bill that would delegate to the executive branch the power to tax profits from the sale of stock. The subject is an extremely delicate one, and there is danger that the Internal Revenue Service will for the umpteenth time score a goal against its own team. The tax experts are urging caution. "Targeting income from financial sources at this time," they say, "would amount to opening the doors to a massive flight of capital." And that is precisely what is not needed. [Box, p 148] Famous Next to the Last Words "I believe that legal mechanisms should be introduced that would automatically reduce the deficit to zero and keep it there." Who is speaking? Is it Silvio Berlusconi, Mario Segni, or Umberto Bossi? Or some new standard bearer of the center-right alliance that is now being formed? Not at all; these words were spoken in 1988 by Antonio Maccanico, who today is under secretary of the office of prime minister in an administration that has been firing incendiary shells at the proposal that would put a ceiling on the tax burden--by means of a constitutional amendment, if necessary--with the aim of holding down spending and continuing the efforts to balance the national budget. In an interview he granted to L'EUROPEO six years ago, Maccanico was explicit on the subject of ceilings. "Governmental reform," he said, "must also extend to the sector of the public finances by amending not only the laws and regulations now in effect but--if necessary--the Constitution as well." And he added: "The time has come to regard controlling the national budget as an institutional emergency." Are these ideas extemporaneous, thought out in solitude? Not at all. During the interview, Maccanico declared that his convictions were also shared by the Bank of Italy, which was at that time headed by the very same Carlo Azeglio Ciampi who is the current prime minister. In Maccanico's opinion, the guiding principle for initiating the reform process should have been a measure modeled on the Gramm-Rudman Act, a law introduced in 1985 by the Reagan administration to balance the budget. "The basic principle of that mechanism," Maccanico declared, "should be imitated, which is to make the Parliament and the government legally obligated to pursue the goal of balancing the government's books."
