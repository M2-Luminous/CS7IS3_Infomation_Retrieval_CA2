A spokesman from the North Korean mission to the United Nations said in a statement that North Korea wants to resolve the nuclear issue by dialogue, not by armed forces. In particular, it expects the issue to be settled within the framework of proposals made by President Clinton in his news conference on 24 March. In his news conference held last week, President Clinton said that the United States wants to maintain normal relations with North Korea and that if North Korea abides by the international Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, its future will be brighter. Quoting remarks by a North Korean diplomat, THE NEW YORK TIMES also reported today that unofficial working-level contacts between the United States and North Korea are presently being held at the United Nations, and that an official channel has also been opened between the United States and North Korea. The paper reported, however, that a U.S. envoy to the United Nations and a spokesman for the U.S. State Department had strongly denied the rumors regarding the U.S.-North Korean contacts.
