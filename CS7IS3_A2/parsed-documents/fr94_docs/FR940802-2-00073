SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) has made final findings of scientific misconduct in the following case: Anand Tewari, M.D., Stanford University. The Division of Research Investigations (DRI) of the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) conducted an investigation into possible scientific misconduct on the part of Dr. Tewari while a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine. ORI concluded that Dr. Tewari committed scientific misconduct in clinical research supported by an NIH grant by fabricating ophthalmologic examination results; fabricating and falsifying blood gas data; fabricating and falsifying values for glycerol determinations; falsifying standard errors and including fabricated data on platelet counts in a published article, ``Effects of interleukin-1 on platlet counts'' ( The Lancet 336:712&hyph;714 (1990)), and related abstracts; and providing to his supervisors summaries of data that included falsified and fabricated data which were used in a PHS grant application. The published article containing the falsified and fabricated data was retracted on August 22, 1992. The Lancet 340:496. Dr. Tewari accepted the ORI findings and agreed to a Voluntary Exclusion and Settlement Agreement under which he may not apply for Federal grant or contract funds except for the non-research training or practice of clinical medicine, and may not serve on PHS advisory committees, boards, or peer review groups for a five-year period beginning March 1, 1994.
