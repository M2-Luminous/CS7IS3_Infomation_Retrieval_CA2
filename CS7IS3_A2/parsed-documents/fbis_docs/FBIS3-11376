The minister read the note where the Treasury said it would not issue a special zero-coupon bond series to sell to Brazil, but he did not believe it. He told a reporter: "This must be the wrong note." Pedro Borio, Brazilian Embassy press attache, who was already at home, was then mobilized to find the "real" note. But the real note ended up being the one the minister considered "wrong." Two hours before, after his meeting with IMF officials, the minister had met with Summers and said he was optimistic that the IMF's delay in signing the stand-by agreement would not prevent the Treasury from selling the zero-coupon bonds to Brazil. The major concern among government officials is that the Treasury note could be interpreted by the creditor banks committee as a signal to suspend the agreement to renegotiate the debt. The operation to purchase the zero-coupon bonds on the secondary market, which Brazil now will have to do, does not create excessive concerns. The Central Bank already has been making discreet purchases of these bonds through brokers.
