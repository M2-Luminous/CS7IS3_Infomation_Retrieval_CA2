Jerry Rawlings made a one-hour technical stopover in our country after attending the official handing over of Walvis Bay to Namibia. Presidents Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jerry Rawlings took the opportunity to review the situation in Angola and Ghana. Shortly before his departure, Jerry Rawlings told the press that the Angolan Government has been taking a generous stand in the Angolan conflict. [Begin Rawlings recording, in English fading into Portuguese translation] After listening to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, I think the Angolan Government has taken a very generous stand in the Angolan conflict, which has already killed thousands of people. Because of the unjust war carried out by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], the Angolan people continue to suffer. It is imperative that UNITA negotiates seriously to find a solution that would bring lasting peace to Angola. [end recording]
