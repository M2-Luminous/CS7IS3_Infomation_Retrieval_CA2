FR941006-0-00036 FR941006-0-00011 (e) Preliminary awards, in the following amounts, calculated from estimates in the Urban Institute Study using the method described previously in this regulation, will be made to the following States no later than January 27, 1995: ␣ 1State 1Award amount 1Aliens in custody Arizona $991,900 950 California 33,460,700 15,109 Florida 1,073,800 758 Illinois 564,200 348 New Jersey 600,600 285 New York 4,085,900 2,158 Texas 2,120,300 1,607 (f) These awards total $42,897,400, or one-third of the available appropriation. The Urban Institute estimates of costs incurred by the seven States is $471.4 million, which when divided into one-third of the available appropriation gives a distribution percentage of 27.3%. The preliminary awards are based solely on the Urban Institute estimates for the seven States and do not take into account the possible distributions to other States, which may together constitute 10&hyph;15% of all incarcerated criminal aliens eventually identified for which reimbursement will be made. Accordingly, this preliminary calculation is not predictive of the percentage of total costs which will be reflected in final award for these States. (g) At the end of the reimbursement period, recipients of the initial round of awards will be expected to file all information described within this regulation, based on actual full year counts and averaged costs. The final award amount for these seven States will be adjusted to subtract their preliminary award amounts from remaining funds. §82.7 Full application and final award process. (a) A final application cut-off date of September 30, 1995, will be used for applications seeking full year reimbursement for FY 1995 funds. All interested States, including the seven receiving the preliminary distribution, must make application by this date to receive an award. An original and three copies of the application are required. However, only one hard copy report of the inmate identification measures described herein need be submitted. If possible, the inmate identification data should also be submitted in machine readable form, with necessary documentation to assist BJA and INS in using this electronic data.
