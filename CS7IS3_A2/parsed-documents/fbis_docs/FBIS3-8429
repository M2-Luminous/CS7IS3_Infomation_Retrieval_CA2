The first shipment of export goods from Macedonia has arrived. A Russian cargo ship is expected to arrive with 14,000 metric tons of rice, which has to be transported to Macedonia by road. The trend is for mainly food products to be shipped to Macedonia, in return for exports of chemical industry products and raw materials. According to a preliminary arrangement, a Macedonian delegation is expected to visit Burgas Port at the beginning of next week, with a view to signing a final agreement on handling goods shipped to and from Macedonia.
