FR940406-2-00157 FR940406-2-00090 Appendix B: Activity Level and State Allocation The allocation of funds by State will be determined according to the level of activity in that State as of the closing date for intermediaries to submit applications to become intermediaries. If additional grant funds are made available, the State allocations will be revised according to the activity levels at the time the new funding is made available. The total funding under this NOFA has been divided by the number of active Notices of Intent submitted by owners for properties in the State. Regional and national intermediaries may utilize funds for their entire geographical areas on a first come first serve basis, rather than maintaining the State allocations in funding grants. Sub-State intermediaries will be considered in the States of California, Texas, and Washington. The following is a breakdown of dollar amounts by state based on activity level by State as of November 30, 1993. This will be updated prior to actual release of funds based on activity levels at the time of intermediary selection, but provides a good estimate of expected funds available by State. In addition, the Department will periodically assess activity levels and, if necessary, reallocate funds among intermediaries.
