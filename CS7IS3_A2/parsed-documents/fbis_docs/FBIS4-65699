Raising the issue of alterations to the Osimo treaty, which in 1975 put an end to border haggling between Italy and Yugoslavia, would be "impractical" according to 65.7 percent of Trieste citizens polled by SWG. Italians from other areas were not so sure, however, with just 44.6 percent of those questioned agreeing with Trieste. Over 56 percent of ethnic Italians living across the Slovene border were against any changes. Asked whether discussing changes to the treaty was "desirable", negative answers came from 55.4 percent of Trieste citizens, 42 percent of Italians, and 34.1 percent of Italians in the Istrian peninsula. Should the treaty come up for debate, as some areas in the National Alliance, part of the governing coalition, have suggested, 34.1 percent of Italians across the border would like to see greater safeguards for the Italian minority there introduced, while just 7.6 percent said that the border itself should be changed. Of those questioned in the former Yugoslavia, 39.8 percent said that the best solution for the Italian minority there would be "full administrative autonomy within Slovenia and Croatia". Seven hundred Italians and 250 people in Istria were questioned for the poll.
