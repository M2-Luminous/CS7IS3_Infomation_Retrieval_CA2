They include one first-phase work project, four foreign- aid projects, and five projects funded by our own region. -- The Daliushu key water conservancy and hydro-electric project in the Huang He Valley. Last August, the State Council entered this project on the list of key water conservancy projects to be started in the 1990s. In 1994, our region will speed up the first-phase preparatory work for the Daliushu Project and draft plans for the resettlement of people and for rights and interests distribution so as to start constructing the project as soon as possible. -- The Yanhuanding Water Raising Project in the Shaanxi-Gansu- Ningxia region. It is composed of two parts, a project used jointly by Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, and projects for their respective use. This year is crucial for the construction of the project for common use. The total investment is set at 49 million yuan, of which 22 million will be provided by our region. -- The Ningxia Hetao project to divert water from the Huang He to enlarge the irrigated area south of Yinchuan. This project, which is funded by a loan from the World Bank, is at the final assessment stage prior to approval. -- The Ningxia Hetao agricultural comprehensive development project. The establishment of this project and its implementation were approved by the State Leading Group for Comprehensive Agricultural Development. It is an important project for developing the Ningxia Hetao area and tackling the irrigation problem there, for speeding up agricultural development in the area irrigated with water from the Huang He, and for achieving a greater capacity for further agricultural development. This year is the final year for implementing the second stage of the undertaking, and over 60 million yuan will be injected into the project. It will primarily be used to complete the transformation of 170,000 mu of medium- and low-yield land and open up 85,000 mu of land. -- The construction of high-yield, good quality, and highly efficient agricultural demonstrative areas. Beginning this year, our region will build 16 different types of demonstrative areas characterized by high yields, good quality, and high efficiency. They include demonstrative areas for quality rice, licorice root, barley for beer, hops, quality fruit, and breeding. -- The Ningxia land transformation project. This project, a technological project being undertaken with aid from the European Community, began last year and will enter the stage of full implementation this year. -- The project to assist the poor and improve the environment of three counties in the Ningxia Plateau (Project 4071). This is a comprehensive agricultural project made possible by aid from the World Food Program to harness the little valleys in three counties in our region, Guyuan, Pengyang and Longde. The 35th Policy and Planning Commission of the World Food Program officially approved the establishment of the project in June last year and has informed China that an agreement will be signed on February 16. This project is expected to begin on 1 April. The implementation will take five years and will involve a total investment of 112.6 million yuan. -- The Ningxia forest protection research project. This project is a Sino-Japanese cooperation project focusing on special technological products. It will be completed through joint research and experiments conducted by the Japan International Joint Undertaking Group and our region. An official agreement was signed on January 24 this year and implementation will begin in April this year. Japan will provide our area with 500 million Japanese yuan (40 million yuan) in aid. -- The second generation farmland-forest network project. -- The construction of a conifer timber area in the Liupan Mountain Area. Based on what has been achieved in the past, a conifer timber area of 270,000 mu will be developed between this year and 1998.
