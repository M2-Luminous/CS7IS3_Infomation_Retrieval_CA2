The program features platforms by the Ukrainian Party of Solidarity and Social Justice [Ukrayinska Partiya Solidarnosti I Sotsiyalnoyi Spravedlyvosti] and the Party of Free Peasants of Ukraine [Partiya Vilnykh Selyan Ukrayiny]. The announcer says each party has been given a 10-minute slot on this evening's program during which each party can present its views. The first slot is taken up by a video recording made by the Ukrainian Party of Solidarity and Social Justice, featuring party leader Eduard (Lashutin) and Oleksandr (Bulavin). They speak in Russian. They see Ukraine as a community of peoples who live in harmony with each other, mutually enriching each other's cultures. Their party stands for Ukraine going along the path of civilized countries, where all have equal rights and where there is no antagonism between social classes. They propose a society where civic responsibility comes before class or ethnic interests -- a society of social partnership without crises or risk. They assure viewers that the situation with inflation and fuel shortages can be stabilized within one year at the most. They cite the experience of other countries without natural fuel resources. Next, they link the activity of the state sector with private initiative. They propose that the form of managing the state sector and conditions under which it operates be changed, but at the same time not destroying it and creating a climate for the development of initiative in the private sector. Only initiative can fill the market with goods. The state cannot do this alone. The speakers go on to say that the state sector should be partially denationalized and the role of the state decreased, but such reforms should not be conducted in ways that decrease the rates of production and productivity. All reforms should be expedient ones. If the role of the state sector is changed, then a sector serving the interests of the people will be created. The speakers add that everyone should be provided for, including children, pensioners, students, workers, servicemen, and that the country has erroneously rejected the welfare state of the Soviet Union, which was admired the world over. They want to make life easier for women. New young forces and more professionals should enter the new parliament. They finish by saying that a society with social protection can be created in a short period of time. The second slot features (Vasyl Hordiyenko), head of the Party of Free Peasants of Ukraine. He starts speaking in Ukrainian and goes on to apologize because he is going to speak in Russian as his Russian is better than his Ukrainian and this will save time. His party was set up on the basis of the association of private farmers of Ukraine and has both private farmers and entrepreneurs among its members. The main aim of the party is to revive free peasants and entrepreneurs as a middle class in Ukraine. All who wish to work on the land should have land, freedom, and state support. If each takes the amount of land he wants and is able to cultivate, the only limit needed is a land tax. Then the allocation of land is not decided by corrupt bureaucrats. He says that the party's program is published in the party newspaper and offers to send a copy of the party's charter and program to whoever asks for them, and gives the party's address and phone numbers for this. He gives the main reason for the current crisis as the Supreme Council's "group of 239" and the president as the leader of that group, who have blocked reforms and privatization. (Hordiyenko) was present at an extended Cabinet session on 13 January 1992 and asked the president to cancel the decree on liberalizing prices. He says that the West was for price liberalization in Russia, but only saw it as as a market for its own goods, and it is price liberalization that has brought about the current situation. There is a way out of the crisis. Political reforms should precede economic reforms. (Hordiyenko) advocates creating a parliamentary republic and renouncing presidential government and the nomenclature presidential structures of government. The election of a new parliament on a multi-party basis is needed, which would form a government of reformers. As far as economic reforms are concerned, the basis of them should be the right to own land. He mentions the disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, head of the Rukh secretariat, and accuses the "party of power." He appeals to President Kravchuk to ensure the safety of all party leaders, and to Levko Lukyanenko to gather representatives from all parties the following day to discuss the issue. He finishes by saying that one should conduct an honest political campaign.
