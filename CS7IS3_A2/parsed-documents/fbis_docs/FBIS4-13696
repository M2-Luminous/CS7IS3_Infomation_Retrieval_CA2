Members of Iraq-based terrorist Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO) have frequently used the bases and facilities put at their disposal by the Iraqi regime for carrying out terrorist acts inside Iran. "Some clues have been obtained in connection with the bomb explosion at the corner of Sa'di and Enqelab streets (in central Tehran)," the source said. Some 13 people were injured and five cars destroyed when a percussion bomb went off in rush hours Tuesday. A few hours after the bomb blast, the terrorist grouplet in a hasty reaction contacted the Italian news agency (ANSA), AFP and ASSOCIATED PRESS to deny its involvement in the terrorist act. Over the past month, MKO in 23 radio contacts monitored by an IRNA office near Iran-Iraq border instructed its members to carry out sabotage and arson attacks on Iranian soil.
