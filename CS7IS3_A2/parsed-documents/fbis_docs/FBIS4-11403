The happiness results from more than 2 million votes (nearly four times as many as in the previous election) for this alliance nationwide, victory with a 13 point lead in the Federal Capital, nearly 1 million votes in Buenos Aires Province, 29.2 percent in Neuquen Province (in October 1993 it only obtained 1.9 percent), and progress in Entre Rios Province (up from 2.4 to 12.4 percent), Chaco Province (up from 0.4 to 5.4 percent), Tierra del Fuego Province (up from 1.6 to 5.1 percent), Santa Fe Province (up from 1.3 to 10.2 percent), and Cordoba Province (up from 0.3 to 5.7 percent). There are also reasons for concern because within the next few months the center-left alliance must become institutionalized, make itself felt throughout the country, resolve its policy regarding alliances, and devise an alternative to the government's program. The Grand Front was born a year ago from the Union of the South, headed by Fernando "Pino" Solanas, (which obtained 8 percent of the vote in the election for senator for the Federal Capital in 1992), and the Fredejuso [Front for Democracy and Social Justice], headed by Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez. Following the good results obtained on 3 October, the Front began a regrouping process, seeking to become something more than a group of "parties in disuse," according to Alvarez' definition. [Christian Democrat Deputy] Carlos Auyero's preaching convinced several parties (Democratic and Popular Left, Popular Intransigence, and 29 May Movement) to create a new party called The New Progressive Opening [Nuevo Espacio Progresista]. Alvarez' influence convinced the Fredejuso (where dissident Peronists, two factions of the Intransigent Party, Popular Protagonism, and a communist splinter group coexist) to function as a political party. The Front also includes another Peronist splinter group, the Southern Proposal that is headed by Pino Solanas, the Popular Encounter (principally made up of Peronist dissidents headed by Luis Brunatti), the Communist Party, and the so-called "social opening" which operates through unions and other intermediate organizations. For the 10 April elections, this alliance was able to speak about the Front and not the parties that make it up. The national board on 14 April decided to expedite the institutionalization process and support "a new and prevailing identity" because they know "they cannot continue the way they are." The leaders want the Front to become a political party with legal status, a program, and a system for electing candidates, which could well be through open internal elections. Different aspects must be considered when implementing the reorganization: Chaco Alvarez and those who support him believe the new identity must be obtained when the program and the tactics for 1995 are discussed. They do not like the thought of institutionalizing factions because they say it would be like "fencing in dissidence." Auyero and Graciela Fernandez Meijide prefer to function as a single party with the people of Alvarez and Solanas in order to form the leadership of the alliance. Brunatti is also betting on consolidating the Front as a party, but he views the strong internal currents coexisting within it. The Communist Party is projecting its transformation into a "new political force" in order to use "everything" to favor the Front. The institutional space required by social organizations must also be resolved. Unionists Mary Sanchez (CTERA [Confederation of Education Workers of the Argentine Republic]-Buenos Aires) and Alberto Piccinini (UOM [Metalworkers Union]-Santa Fe Province) were elected on 10 April as members of the Constituent Assembly. The Front's national board resolved to postpone the debate regarding candidacies until the institutionalization facet is over, although Chacho Alvarez and Pino Solanas are tipped to head the presidential slate.
