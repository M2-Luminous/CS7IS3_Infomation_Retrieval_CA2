The fax states: SEMANA magazine published a report that illustrates the persecution to which the Santo Domingo Group has been subjected for a long time and which has increased since we received the contract to operate cellular telephones in the northwestern and coastal regions, where the communications [words indistinct]. SEMANA magazine reports that this scandal, which involves Mario Santo Domingo himself, started when Beatriz Davila, Mario Santo Domingo's wife, explained the dismissal of her brother-in-law, Carlos Perez Norsa Garay, from the Avianca board of directors. Maria del Pilar Ortiz filed a report. [Begin Ortiz recording] The latest issue of SEMANA magazine published a front-page report that went on for five pages detailing an alleged espionage case. According to the magazine, businessman Julio Mario Santo Domingo listened to the conversations of Felipe Lopez, the magazine's president. This is telephone espionage. According to the report, Carlos Perez Norsa Garay was dismissed from the board of directors of Avianca, which belongs to the Santo Domingo Group, after 10 years as a member. Augusto Lopez dismissed him unexpectedly. When Perez requested an explanation, he talked to his sister-in-law, Beatriz Davila, wife of Julio Mario Santo Domingo. The magazine reports that she told him: I have some tapes containing a telephone conversation where you told Felipe Lopez bad things about the group. She also gave other details that she was not supposed to know. According to Santo Domingo's wife, Felipe Lopez himself taped the conversation, and Bavaria Brewery Company President Augusto Lopez gave the tape to her husband. Augusto Lopez, in turn, told the prosecutor general that Felipe Lopez had given him nothing and that the recording did not exist; therefore, he had never been able to take it to New York. SEMANA magazine told Prosecutor General Gustavo De Greiff about the case a week ago. Carlos Perez himself told the president. The SEMANA article hints that someone is lying because it seems that the recordings indeed exist. It is not known who made them or how they were made. The article also implies that if this telephone line was tapped, something similar could be done with the telephone line of a minister or a competitor in a bidding process. It is known that the Santo Domingo Group will operate a large share of cellular phones in the country. When the communications minister was asked about the case, he said the one thing had nothing to do with the other. Should it be proved the telephone taps did occur, there would be a legal punishment that would not affect the contracting process. [end recording]
