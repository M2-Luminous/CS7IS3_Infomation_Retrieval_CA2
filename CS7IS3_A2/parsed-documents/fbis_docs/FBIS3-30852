FBIS3-30852 "dreeu027__a94013" FBIS-EEU-94-027-A Document Type:Daily Report 9 February 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic More Parties Express Positions AU0902144194 Prague CTK in English 1943 GMT 8 Feb 94 AU0902144194 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, Feb 8 (CTK) -- While the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) considers military intervention by the international community in Bosnia only one of the possible reactions to Saturday's [5 February] massacre in Sarajevo, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) continues to support resolute military intervention, according to the two parties' spokespeople, Jana Petrova and Jan Rejzek. Petrova said that the ODS unambiguously condemned the side who caused the massacre. "This event shattered us. However, it would be neither suitable nor responsible to use overly strong words regarding military intervention, which the Czech Republic would not participate in nor bear its consequences," Petrova told CTK. It is necessary to consider other measures and solutions to the situation as well, she added. Rejzek said that the word "to condemn", only poorly expressed ODA's reaction to the massacre. The ODA has been supporting resolute military intervention in Bosnia for some time, and has been criticized for this. "The Black Saturday of Sarajevo definitively opened everybody's eyes and proved that mere words mean nothing in solving the situation in the former Yugoslavia," Rejzek added. Pavel Hirs, chairman of the Liberal Social National Party (LSNS), told CTK today that the massacre must be condemned as sharply as possible, and if the offender will be found, he should be tried and exemplarily punished. Hirs said that neither the United States nor NATO want to take a risk, since any military intervention in the region would mean extended operation of armies, including air forces, and considerable losses would have to be expected. That is why it is necessary to seek a political solution acceptable for all three parties involved in the conflict, as only their political compromise can lead to reinstalling peace, Hirs said. Jiri Dienstbier, chairman of the Free Democrats (SD) and the former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister, said that humanitarian aid to the wounded and crippled people in Bosnia was necessary, but it would be more humane to create conditions to prevent people from being crippled. Dienstbier, currently visiting Houston, United States, told CTK through his secretary Vera Uhrova that bombing as well as any other isolated act or effort toward a partial solution to the situation would be fruitless. If the international society wants to take any serious step, it has to set a clear political goal, no matter if it is installing peace in multinational Bosnia or the country's division, Dienstbier said. However, the community must gather all means and forces necessary to support its political conclusions, including its willingness to intervene on the ground to install peace. "Bombing would make sense only as part of a consistent strategy," Dienstbier said.
