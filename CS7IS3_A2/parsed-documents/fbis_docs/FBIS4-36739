We would like to illustrate clearly the position of the Democratic Republic of Yemen in the following manner: First, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his forces were those who started the aggression on the Democratic Republic of Yemen's forces and territories. Second, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his regime have rejected all Arab and international initiatives. Third, the Security Council has issued its resolution No. 924 and we had sincerely announced our adherence to it immediately after it was announced, but 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his regime clearly refused to abide by this resolution until yesterday when he announced his adherence to its text and spirit and specified 3 o'clock in the evening for the start of implementing the ceasefire, though the resolution has stipulated for adherence to it and though 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has previously announced two cease-fires which he violated. Fourth, for the third time 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his forces violated the ceasefire last night. The whole world knows that it was he who violated the cease-fire half-an-hour after the time he committed himself to cease the firing. Fifth, we shall continue to adhere to the rulings of the Security Council's Resolution No. 924 without preconditions, and will only defend ourselves against any violation or aggression by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his forces. Sixth, the Joint Military Committee or a Yemeni military committee, which 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih claims to have set up perviously, do not exist any more. International observers, not imaginary committees formed by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, should monitor the cease-fire. This the position of the Democratic Republic of Yemen which it adheres to and announces to the international community.
