Randers: "The Impact of Unemployment on Internal Politics and Crime"] [Text] State Labor Minister A. Berzins submitted a report to Prime Minister V. Birkavs on the impact of unemployment on the stability of internal politics in the state and the necessity of initiatives to reduce unemployment. The report states that in many areas of Latvia, especially in the Latgale rayons, the unemployment rate is two to three times higher than the national average, and that such areas are becoming increasingly more numerous. The problem primarily affects the small cities and rural districts of Latvia, which contain a large majority of Latvians (according to the 1989 census data -- 74%). These are areas where enterprises based in major industrial centers had established branches at one time, but have now ceased their activities, for the most part. Under these conditions, the situation cannot be improved through unemployment compensation nor by extending the period for receipt of such (the Cabinet of Ministers has compiled a list of such cities and rural districts in the rayons of Aluksne, Balvi, Dobele, Jekabpils, Kraslava, Madona, Preili, and Rezekne, where unemployed workers have the right to extend their unemployment compensation for up to 12 months -- I.R.). The increase in the number of those unemployed has created economic problems (nonpayment of rent and communal services, an increase in the number of those requesting and receiving social assistance, etc.), promotes a polarization of the political views of the inhabitants and, overall, promotes crime in the state. In Western nations, there is an assumption that each percentage increase in unemployment, on the average, increases the rates of crime by 4% and suicide by 5.6%. While not attributing this assumption to Latvia, in its entirety, the State Labor Minister mentions these facts: the start of unemployment was recorded at the end of 1991, and the crime rate per 1,000 inhabitants rose from 129 in 1990 to 235 in 1992 (an increase of 82%). The suicide rate (759 cases in 1991) in 1993 has increased to 1,088 cases (43%). In order to stabilize the internal political, economic and crime situation in rural Latvia and its small cities, the following is proposed: first, create a state commission which would develop a special program for rayons with a high rate of unemployment, in order to promote commercial activities, secure existing enterprises or reorganize former branches, and also attract the interest of businessmen to start, continue or expand their businesses; second, in the Privatization Agency, create a division which would examine enterprise privatization projects from the standpoint of saving jobs, and only after this has been accomplished, propose a selling off price for these projects.
