The conservative CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 800-word editorial entitled "Patriot Is for Defensive Use." The editorial notes that "the Patriot missile is a defensive weapon," and that the use of such a weapon is "by no means to attack North Korea," but to prepare for a possible attack by offensive weapons, such as the Nodong-1 and Nodong-2 missiles, which North Korea is currently developing. The editorial views that "if the South side does not take any defensive measures at a time when North Korea is developing offensive weapons, it would be relinquishing our security." The editorial reports China expressed opposition to the plan of deploying the Patriot missiles by noting: "This is an act threatening security and peace on the Korean peninsula." The editorial goes on to note that our opposition party [Democratic Party of South Korea] said that the plan to deploy the Patriot missiles may provoke North Korea. The editorial criticizes the opposition party's remark, noting that the opposition party does not know which side is committing acts that threaten peace on the Korean peninsula. The editorial concludes: "If North Korea changes its position and gives up the development of offensive weapons, then the plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK will lose its justification." The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 1 a 500-word article by Washington correspondent Chong Chin-sok on the plan to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters to the U.S. Forces stationed in the ROK and to send an aircraft carrier to the waters near the Korean peninsula. The article reports this is to "prepare for a possible threat by North Korea if the UN Security Council decides to apply economic sanctions against North Korea." The article quotes a Washington diplomatic source as stating that "this is part of a comprehensive operational plan to prepare for a possible state of emergency that may occur on the Korean peninsula." The article reports that a U.S. Defense Department spokesman confirmed that "the deployment of the Patriot missiles to the ROK is being promoted" and that "when a final decision is made, the U.S. Forces in the ROK will possess an improved model of the Patriot missile." The article notes it has been confirmed there are plans to deploy Apache helicopters to the ROK as part of the U.S. plan to modernize its weapons. The article concludes that the Patriot missiles will be deployed to Air Force bases in Pusan, Taegu, and Kunsan to serve as a strategic defensive base, rather than for the defense of the metropolitan area. HANGUK ILBO in Korean on page 2 publishes a 1,000-word article by Washington correspondent Chong Chin-sok on the true nature of the new moves by the United States regarding the security situation of the Korean peninsula. The article notes that diplomatic circles in Washington are showing interest in U.S. moves regarding the Korean peninsula. The article explains that the United States is a "super power" militarily, but it needs the approval of the people to use its power. adding that "the situation on the Korean peninsula is no exception." The article notes "what the United States truly wants is not to be prepared for a war, but to strengthen deterrent power to prevent the outbreak of a war." The article notes that such moves by the United States are a means to put the finishing touches on the negotiations regarding North Korea's nuclear issue. The article notes that we cannot overlook the fact that the ROK may be used as a major weapons market by the U.S. defense industry. The article reports: "There are rumors that core figures of the U.S. defense industry in Washington secretly visited the ROK and met with high-ranking officials to discuss the sale of the Patriots." The article notes that the recent moves of the U.S. military are an ultimatum to North Korea regarding the settlement of its nuclear issue and to confirm to Northeast Asian countries, including Japan and China, U.S. presence in this region. The article concludes: "Moves for the increase of U.S. capability in the ROK cannot by any means be limited to the Korean peninsula issue." HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 800-word editorial entitled: "Unusual Atmosphere on the Korean Peninsula." The editorial notes "the ROK Government is remaining silent" about U.S. plans to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters and to send an aircraft carrier to the waters around the Korean peninsula in case of a possible military provocation on the South by North Korea. The editorial notes that the people are worried about this matter because "the United States and North Korea reached an agreement in principle regarding the nuclear issue late last year and that negotiations are under way between the International Atomic Energy Agency and North Korea on the method for inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities." The editorial elaborates on the pros and cons of the United States increasing its capability. The editorial notes that the people are curious about "the concrete content of the proposal for the settlement of the nuclear issue as agreed upon between the United States and North Korea, its progress, the real reason for the United States to increase its capability in the ROK, and the nature of U.S.-ROK consultations at this time." The editorial urges the government to be clear about these matters and explain everything to the people. The editorial concludes: "How the situation develops and how rapidly changes are made on the Korean peninsula are directly related to our security, right to live, and interest." The liberal TONG-A ILBO in Korean publishes on page 1 a 900-word article on the issue of "deployment of ultramodern weapons for U.S. forces in the ROK." Noting this issue was revealed by the U.S. side first, the article emphasizes the ROK Government's "politico-military measures" regarding the issue. The article then reports the remark by a high-ranking security-related official on the report on the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters to the ROK that "this plan has been included in the equipment modernization program of the U.S. Forces in the ROK for three to five years." Asked if the weapons buildup was an indication of a "military provocation" by North Korea, the official stated: "There is no abnormal situation we should cope with at present," adding, "the necessity of such pressing measures for nuclear negotiations with North Korea should be reviewed from a political and military standpoint." Referring to remarks of military officials, the article notes that "the question of deploying weapons at this time may cause a lot of controversy." The article quotes a statement by government authorities that "the recent U.S. report on projected Patriot missiles deployment, on dispatch of a state intelligence support team to the ROK, and on introduction of Apache helicopters, has led to the impression of heightened `tensions' on the Korean peninsula. Thus, the government expressed its hope to the United States that the U.S. military authorities will refrain from leaking intelligence." The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 1 a 300-word article by Washington-based correspondent Kim Hak-sun. The article reports: "It was learned on 27 January that the U.S. Government is strongly hoping that the ROK Government will purchase Patriot missiles, which it is considering deploying on the Korean peninsula to counter Scud missile attacks by North Korea." The article noted that a diplomatic source in Washington observed that "the U.S. Government's plan to increase military power, including deployment of Apache helicopters in the ROK and dispatch of aircraft carriers to the coast of the Korean peninsula, is related to the weapons sale strategy of U.S. military industries toward the ROK." The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word editorial entitled "Is the Korean Peninsula Uneasy?" Noting that the report on the U.S. arms buildup plan on the Korean peninsula is arousing "a sense of vague uneasiness" instead of "a feeling of relief" regarding security, the editorial points out that the report on deployment of Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters and on the dispatch of aircraft carriers will "evoke a sense of military tension," and refers to the "general observation" that such measures are "means of diplomatic pressure" on North Korea to accept nuclear inspections. The editorial reports that while negotiations are under way, such measures may possibly "irritate North Korea" and cause a "negative influence" on the negotiations. Stressing that "military issues should be advanced in secret," the editorial expresses misgivings that the disclosure of such plans might have "diplomatic and military purposes." Referring to an explanation by government authorities of the U.S. plan to deploy weapons, the editorial reports that the ROK Government has failed to "consult sufficiently" with the U.S. Government on reinforcement of U.S. forces in the ROK and that our government has been "dragged" into U.S. policy on "the military situation" on the Korean peninsula, rather than "positively coping with this situation." The editorial calls on the government to give "a clear explanation on the true aspects" to the people and stresses that "concentration of ultramodern weapons on the Korean peninsula during an atmosphere of detente is not desirable."
