The conference approved a mechanism for using television and radio in the election campaign. It was agreed that, during the period left until the election, parties can use 21 hours of air time on television and 10 hours on the radio. The first stage, at which parties presented their election programs, is over. At the second stage, electors will be informed in detail about the goals of political parties and movements. It was agreed that these broadcasts will take the format of a debate, involving only those party representatives who are not registered as candidates for people's deputy of Ukraine. A proposal on panel composition put forward by State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company president Mykola Okhmakevych's was strongly disputed. In the party leaders' opinion, they are capable of choosing their opponents themselves without waiting for journalists to do so. It was decided that topics for the debates will be suggested by sociological surveys. Chairman of the Socialist Party of Ukraine Oleksandr Moroz suggested that conference participants refrain from commenting on the election results in Crimea for the sake of national concord.
