[Netanyahu] Good morning. [Baum] What is your reaction to last night's operation? [Netanyahu] Well, you know I make no secret of my criticism of the government but in this case they, as well as the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] commanders and soldiers, all deserve hearty praise for apparently carrying out what the late Hayim Bar-Lev [former chief of staff and minister who died last week] used to call a strong, swift, and elegant operation. I take my hat off to them. [Baum] Some opposition members have claimed that the government is not doing enough to bring back the POW's and the MIA's. Perhaps the correct way to go about this is to really take direct action against Hizballah and not demand information from the PLO which apparently does not have any. [Netanyahu] The steps taken should be comprehensive. The PLO definitely has information because 'Arafat gave the prime minister half of Ron Arad's dog tag. Therefore, we can demand valuable information from 'Arafat such as who handed him the dog tag and who holds its second half. However, I still think that we can exert certain pressure -- from which the government is refraining -- with regard to the mass release of prisoners, an issue I regard as problematic in the first place. If we are already going ahead with such a step then we definitely could at least extract more information and clues to help us locate our people. With regard to last night's operation, which may arouse international criticism, it is important to explain that Israel has the full right not only to follow the supreme Jewish doctrine of ransoming prisoners thus reassuring every IDF soldier that he will never be abandoned if taken prisoner by the enemy, but also to act against the kidnappers and to capture them whether for bargaining purposes or to extract information. This is something the IDF has done in the past not only in the case of Shaykh 'Ubayd [kidnapped from Lebanon in 1989]. This policy was also reflected in the kidnapping, or, more rightly, the capture of the five senior Syrian general staff officers while Syria was holding our pilots and POW's and refused to release them as part of a prisoner exchange as mandated by the Geneva Conventions. We have carried out such operations. I myself participated in two unsuccessful missions. My brother, Yoni, directly commanded the operation in which the Syrian officers were captured and four or five months later our prisoners were returned as part of a prisoner exchange. Therefore, Israel has all the right to act whether for information or bargaining purposes as part of its efforts to bring back our POW's and MIA's. [Baum] Shaykh 'Ubayd was kidnapped when the unity government was in power with Yitzhaq Shamir as prime minister and Yitzhaq Rabin as defense minister. So far, however, his kidnapping has not helped especially. The POW's and MIA's have not been returned. The question is whether or not the risks entailed in such an operation outweigh the possible benefits? Are these operations justified? [Netanyahu] First of all, there are no guarantees. I do not deny the fact that there is no way of knowing. When we kidnapped those Syrian officers no one could state with certainty that the outcome would be positive or that there would be no negative ramifications. This danger always exists, in this case as well. However, I definitely have full confidence in the government's decision on this matter because every country has the right to act against an organization of murderers and kidnappers which has information, and perhaps even more, in order to achieve the basic, humanitarian goal of bringing its prisoners back home. That is acceptable within all international frameworks and we must insist on this matter, not only on the international but also on the domestic level. Whatever the price, it is more important that every IDF soldier sent to the battlefield knows with full certainty that Israel will do the maximum to bring him back home. [Baum] Thank you, opposition leader Binyamin Netanyahu.
