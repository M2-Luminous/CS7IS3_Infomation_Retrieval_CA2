FR940805-1-00029 FR940805-1-00004 H. Statement H_Other Factors In Statement H, the oil pipeline would describe any other factors that bear on the issue of whether it lacks significant market power in the relevant markets. The oil pipeline would have to explain why those other factors are pertinent. The NOI listed the following possible other factors: Exchanges, Excess Capacity, Competition with vertically integrated companies, buyer power, and profitability. 27 The Commission is not excluding any factor. The Commission is not limiting the factors to those listed in the NOI. For example, an oil pipeline might want to show that it has been losing markets over a period of years or that the relevant market is expanding. However, the burden is on the oil pipeline to show the relevance of any factor to its lack of significant market power. 27 Market share and potential entry included in the list are referred to supra . I. Statement I_Proposed Testimony In Statement I, the oil pipeline would present the proposed testimony in support of its application. This would serve as its case-in-chief, if the Commission sets the application for hearing. VII. Procedural Requirements The Commission is proposing in section 348.2 several procedural requirements in connection with applications for a market power determination. These new procedural requirements are necessary because the applications are not rate filings. Under Order No. 561, an oil pipeline must show that ``it lacks significant market power in the relevant market in which it proposes to charge market-based rates.'' 28 Only after the Commission concludes that the oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets may the pipeline charge market-based rates. Until that time, the pipeline's rates are determined by the Commission's indexing or cost-of-service provisions. 28 18 CFR 342.4(b), to be effective January 1, 1995. The first proposal is that the oil pipeline would not have to initially provide its entire application to its shippers and subscribers. Rather, it would only have to provide its letter of transmittal to its shippers and subscribers. The letter of transmittal would describe the application for a market power determination and identify each rate that would be market-based, if the oil pipeline shows that it lacks significant market power in the relevant market. This will enable persons to determine if they want to examine the complete application. Under the proposed regulations, a person must make a written request to the pipeline for a copy of the complete application within 15 days after the filing of the application with the Commission. The oil pipeline would have to provide that person with a copy of its complete application within seven days after receipt of the written request. This will enable a person to determine if it wants to protest the oil pipeline's application for a market power determination. A protestant must file its protest to the application within 60 days after the filing of the application. At that time, the protestant must set forth in detail its grounds for opposing the oil pipeline's application, including responding to its statement of position and information, and, if the protestants desires, presenting information of its own pursuant to Statements A&hyph;I. The Commission, after examination of the oil pipeline's application and any protests, would issue an order in which it would rule summarily on the application or, if appropriate, establish future procedures and the scope of the investigation. Future procedures may or may not involve a hearing before an administrative law judge. The Commission is not proposing any regulations with respect to complaints against market-based rates under Section 13(1) of the ICA. However, the Commission would expect a complainant to allege and to present evidence that the pipeline has developed significant market power. In particular, the Commission would expect a complainant to describe any circumstances that have changed since the Commission made the determination that the oil pipeline lacks significant market power and could charge market-based rates.
