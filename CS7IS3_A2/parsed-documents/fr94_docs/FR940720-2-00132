FR940720-2-00132 FR940720-2-00073 VI. Conclusion The Commission finds that proposed Amendment No. 1 to the Plan to extend the financial negotiation period for an additional six months is appropriate and in furtherance of Section 11A of the Act. The Commission also finds that one-year extensions of the exemptive relief requested, and described above, also is consistent with the Act and the Rules thereunder. Specifically, the Commission believes that these extensions should serve to provide the Participants with more time to conclude their financial negotiations and to evaluate the effects of the pilot program and report their findings to the Commission. This, in turn, should further the objects of the Act in general, and specifically those set forth in Section 11A of the Act and in Rules 11Aa3&hyph;1 and 11Aa3&hyph;2 thereunder. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 11A of the Act and (c)(2) of Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2 thereunder, that Amendment No. 1 to the Joint Transaction Reporting Plan for Nasdaq/National Market securities traded on an exchange on an unlisted or listed basis is hereby approved, and trading pursuant to the Plan is hereby approved on a temporary basis through January 12, 1995. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(29). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
