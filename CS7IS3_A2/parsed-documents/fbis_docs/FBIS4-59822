Over to Aicha Degha for more details: The Transitional National Council is a legislative body that will reinforce the constitutional apparatus stipulated in the document of consensus, which in turn constitutes a point of reference for the transitional period. This transitional period will last three years before a return to the electoral process. According to the APS dispatch, the seats of some political parties that did not take in the national dialogue conference will remain vacant. The distribution of seats according to age shows that 52 members are 40 years old at the most and that the youngest member of the transitional national council was born in 1969, while the oldest was born in 1918. These figures indicate that the council takes into account all age groups. Moreover, many members of this body are highly educated university graduates.
