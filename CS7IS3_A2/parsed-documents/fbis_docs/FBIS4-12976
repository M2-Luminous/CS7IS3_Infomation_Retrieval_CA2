The statement said that the government delegation had signed the draft agreement put forward by Operation Lifeline [Sudan] on opening peace corridors to transport relief materials and humanitarian aid, which confirmed the agreement of 23 March specifying that aid should be transported in a practical and secure manner as cheaply as possible. It also laid down that the relief aid should be sent to new destinations by air, road, river and rail, to ensure that those in need were fed regardless of what party controlled the areas in which they were present. The statement said that Operation Lifeline officials and the IGADD committee on humanitarian affairs had succeeded in arriving at an agreement which would guarantee that those in need would receive relief materials and humanitarian aid in the combat zones. The statement went on to say that the Sudanese Government, by signing the agreement, was merely upholding its firm stance of not permitting food to be used as a weapon. The government reiterated its determination to arrive at a peaceful solution to relieve the suffering of war victims in southern Sudan, sufferings which were imposed by the rebellion. The statement expressed the Sudanese Government's hope that the other parties also sign the agreement, stressing that the government was totally confident that the heads of state of the IGADD committee would do everything in their power as mediators to persuade the rebel movement to do its duty by signing the agreement, because political extremism and obstinacy would result in innocent civilians having to bear the consequences.
