FR940106-0-00084 FR940106-0-00021 2. DOL Authority To Review Attestations An attorney commenting on the interim final rule questioned whether DOL has the authority to review any H&hyph;1A attestations, and an employer and an attorney association commented that the DOL role in reviewing attestations should be reduced. However, two of the labor organizations submitting comments voiced concern that the interim final rule weakened DOL's role in reviewing attestations. The proposed rule prescribed a substantial review function by DOL. As indicated in the preamble to the interim final rule, ETA found the comments of Representative Morrison and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, highly persuasive. Both Representative Morrison and Senator Kennedy expressed the view that the proposed DOL review function was greater than that intended by the legislation. This was also the view expressed by many health care facility commenters. See 55 FR at 50502. In response to these comments, the interim final rule substantially restricted the DOL review function. As indicated above, DOL reviews elements of attestations in only four instances. For all other attestations, the DOL function is limited to checking that the attestation Form ETA 9029 is properly completed, the required explanatory statements are included, and the facility is attesting to compliance with the regulatory standards. The Department has concluded that the provisions governing DOL's review function, set forth in the interim final rule should be retained. After a careful review of the comments received both on the proposed rule and on the interim final rule, considering that only minimal documentation is submitted, and, in view of the fact that the H&hyph;1A program relies on a ``complaint driven process'' for investigating and resolving complaints, DOL has determined that no further change in this provision is warranted. 3. Indicators of Substantial Disruption The Department received 10 comments concerning the indicators of substantial disruption under Attestation Element One. One attorney commented that the rule should not be more specific than the legislation in addressing ``substantial disruption''; and an employer commented that a simple description of the steps taken to fill vacant nursing positions should suffice as evidence that there would be a substantial disruption without the services of nonimmigrant alien nurses. In contrast, one employer commented that the requirement that a facility document its recruiting efforts does not belong in the section of the regulations dealing with substantial disruption. The employer also commented that the documentation requirements under ยง XX .310(d)(3) should be limited to the total number of nursing vacancies and the total number of H&hyph;1A nurses employed at the time the attestation is submitted. Other commenters recommended adding more specific requirements to ยง XX .310(d)(2) and allowing facilities to count as vacant all positions encumbered by H&hyph;1A nurses. INRA was enacted to allow facilities to use nonimmigrant alien nurses temporarily to help alleviate substantial disruptions in health care services, while requiring that facilities take steps designed to develop, recruit and retain a trained U.S. workforce as the long-term solution to the current nursing shortage. One of the legislatively-mandated elements that a facility must attest to in order to have its attestation accepted by DOL is a substantial disruption in health care services due to a shortage of nurses (absent the services of the nonimmigrant alien nurses on whose behalf they are petitioning). The interim final rule listed four possible indicators of substantial disruption. These indicators were identified by organizations representing both employers and nurses as being those most commonly experienced throughout the health care industry. However, this provision was not intended to be an exhaustive list. When a facility finds that the indicators of substantial disruption listed in the regulations cannot be demonstrated or that such indicators are inappropriate to that facility, the facility may propose an alternative indicator of substantial disruption under the ``other'' category. A facility attesting to an ``other'' indicator of substantial disruption is required to provide an explanation which clearly shows a substantial disruption in the delivery of specific health care services due to a shortage of nurses. For example, a facility that has a large number of H&hyph;1A nurses with visas that will be expiring within the next 12 months may be able to demonstrate that it will experience a substantial disruption if it cannot petition INS for extensions of stay and/or new H&hyph;1A nurses. Such a facility may choose to attest to an ``other'' indicator substantial disruption. The facility would then be required to demonstrate that it has made conscientious efforts to recruit and retain U.S. nurses but has a history of being able to fill only a small percentage of its vacancies with U.S. nurses, and that it projects a vacancy rate of at least 7 percent, if it cannot continue to petition INS for H&hyph;1A nurses.
