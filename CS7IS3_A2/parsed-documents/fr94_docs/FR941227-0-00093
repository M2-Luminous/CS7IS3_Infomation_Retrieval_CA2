Summary of Order 1. Section 409(e) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Act), 47 U.S.C. §409(e), grants the Commission express authority to require by subpoena information relating to any matter under investigation. This authority may be delegated in accordance with Section 5(c)(1) of the Act. 47 U.S.C. §155(c)(1). The agency's power of subpoena is not confined to those over whom it exercises regulatory jurisdiction, but extends to private individuals and entities over whom it does not. 2. We find that the delegation of authority to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, to issue administrative subpoenas in the investigation of matters involving any alleged violation or violations of Title II of the Act will facilitate investigations of unlawful activity by common carriers and is, therefore, in the public interest.

Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, that, pursuant to Section 5(c)(1) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §155(c)(1), authority is delegated to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, to require by administrative subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, schedules of charges, contracts, agreements, and any other records deemed relevant to the investigation of common carriers for any alleged violation or violations of Title II of the Act. 4. It is further ordered that §0.291 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR 0.291, be amended to add a paragraph (j) to reflect this delegation of authority. This amendment of the Commission's rules is contained below.
