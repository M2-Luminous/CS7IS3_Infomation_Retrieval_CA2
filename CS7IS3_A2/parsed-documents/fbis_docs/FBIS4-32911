There were problems in 86 voting tables, but these were subsequently solved. The most common problem were those related to delegates not arriving on time. The voting process was halted while the delegate in charge was being replaced. In other cases, problems were mostly related to cases of vandalism -- very few cases -- mostly destruction of election material. We were able to observe problems [words indistinct] in the partial results we now have. These results will mostly be modified later on in practically 47 tables. I would like to state that there are more than 45,000 voting tables [words indistinct], and we only have had problems with less than 47 tables. [Monsalve] Which departments presented problems? [Pardo] In Veredas [words indistinct] less than two tables, in 31 different communities. This did not undermine municipal elections, however, or those places where there were more than two tables. We were able to solve these problems. [Monsalve] Mr. Minister, can you tell those Colombians who were able to vote in the departments where there were the most problems? [Pardo] I repeat, the departments with the most problems were Bolivar, Norte de Santander, Santander, and Casanare. I repeat, however, these were mostly problems that appeared in those places where there were only one or two voting tables. [Words indistinct] places where the voter turnout is quite low. I expect to compare the information we now have on the 47 tables where there were problems, with those of the 47,000 tables distributed throughout the country. [Monsalve] With respect to the 13 March voting process, would you say that security increased [words indistinct]? [Pardo] Security, in comparison to 13 March, has increased greatly and is much tighter. In this case, there were fewer places affected. There were fewer incidents of voters being prevented from voting and fewer incidents of vandalism than on 13 March.
