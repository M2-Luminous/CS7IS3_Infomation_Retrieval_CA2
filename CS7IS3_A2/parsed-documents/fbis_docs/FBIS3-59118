Prince Charles touched down in Sydney on Monday [24 January] with a royal entourage and 40 journalists. Later this week, a trade delegation, led by Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, flies into Melbourne, accompanied by two other UK trade missions. The British parties are being given a high-level reception. Mr Keating, with his beaming but non-curtseying wife, turned out to greet Prince Charles, and the Australian prime minister will deliver a keynote speech to a conference on UK-Australian trade. This raises the question of whether such attention is just residual politeness, or whether -- from a commercial viewpoint, at least --the countries still have something to offer each other. On the trade front, the relationship has undergone some fundamental changes in the past 30 years. Britain has thrown its lot in with Europe while Australia has cultivated its Asian neighbours. Between 1960 and 1990, the latter's merchandise exports to West Europe shrank from 46 per cent of the total to just 16 per cent. Today, about 60 per cent of Australia's trade is conducted in the Asian region. That said, the two countries' trade ties are not just history. Australia sold 2.39 billion Australian dollars worth of goods to the UK in 1992/93, a figure which has been increasing at a double-digit rate over the past five years, thanks partly to the growing popularity of Australian wine. Britain also remains the third most important source of imports into Australia and the trade balance tilts well in the UK's favour. However, the five-year trend in UK merchandise imports is flat. The investment relationship is more interesting. According to a report by the Allen Consulting Group, the UK is the second-largest investor in Australia after the U.S. and accounts for just less than a quarter of total foreign direct investment there. As Australian trade officials point out, the nature of that investment makes it particularly valuable. About 44 per cent of it is in manufacturing. This means that UK companies actually outstrip their US counterparts as players in the core industrial sector. It is tempting to think of this as an historical relic; after all, companies such as Pilkington have had Australian subsidiaries for a century or more. In reality, a smattering of recent deals -- such as Tate & Lyle's 325 million Australian dollar purchase of Bundaberg Sugar, or United Biscuits' acquisition of Smiths Snackfood -- have sustained the UK's relative position, while the U.S. share of foreign investment in Australia has slipped and Japan's has grown. The steady deregulation and privatisation of Australian industry has also thrown up new opportunities which UK companies -- in some cases recently privatised themselves -- have been prone to seize. BT's telecommunications contract with the New South Wales government or British Airways' minority stake in Qantas are cases in point. From an Australian point-of-view, then, the British interest holds out the possibility of new capital and, to some extent new jobs. At a time when the unemployment rate is in double-digits, Japanese investment is at low ebb and the smaller Southeast Asian countries have yet to show much interest in placing their funds in Australia, this is welcome. Arguments put forward by British trade officials for the continuing interest in Australia are more subtle. They like to stress the possibility of using the country as a route into the Asian markets, a thought which the Australian trade lobby eagerly encourages. "There's a comfort level," says David Richard, senior trade commissioner at Austrade. He cites the nations' similar legal systems, the availability of professional services in Australia, the pleasant climate, and so on. For British companies with existing operations in Australia, there is some merit in this argument. The Allen report, for example, cites the experience of P&O (Australia), whose container handling, distribution, catering, maritime and port management arms all have expanding interests in Southeast Asia. But for companies seeking to set out a stall in Asia for the first time, the merits of the Australian route are more debatable, and even British trade officials admit it is a matter of "horses for courses." The downside is that, while Sydney or Melbourne are within the "Asian time zone," they still face a three-hour time difference with most Southeast Asian countries. A flight between Sydney and Bangkok, say, takes eight hours. Moreover, while Australia has been moving to reduce its tariff barriers, restructure labour market practices, and shed its bureaucratic image, this process is not complete. Then there is investment by Australian companies in Britain. This has increased sharply over the past decade, after the removal of exchange controls, and amounted to about 15.9 billion Australian dollars by the end of 1992. A large tranche arrived in the late 1980s, when Australian "entrepreneurs" were riding high. Nevertheless, Australia's direct investment in Britain has risen by a further 6.5 billion Australian dollars over the past five years. Few Australian companies have ventured into Europe without first securing a British base -- with the result that more than 70 per cent of Australian investment in Europe is concentrated in the UK. There are some signs that this is changing: for example, Amcor, the paper group, began its European strategy by building a plant in Cambridgeshire, and has subsequently expanded into France and Germany. But familiarity, it seems, tends to work both ways.
