G. Grishchenko; UDC 537.847.4] [Abstract] Geometric optics is used to resolve electromagnetic wave scattering on an optically dense revolving body with a multilayered absorbing coating. The unknown scattering field is found by adding the rays re-reflected in the coating at the point of observation. A recurrent algorithm is developed for constructing a ray pattern of the field for a multilayered body, whose boundary is depicted by arbitrary smooth functions. In order to determine the accuracy of the solution, it is compared with the results of rigorous calculations and with experimental data for a sphere, round cylinder and oval body.
