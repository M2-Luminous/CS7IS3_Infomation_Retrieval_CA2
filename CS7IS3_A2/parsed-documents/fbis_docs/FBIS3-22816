The body came to this conclusion after an inspection of the safety of all nuclear and radiation-emanating installations in the country carried out last year in accordance with Boris Yeltsin's decision. According to Gosatomnadzor, issues related to use of nuclear power, materials and substances in both peaceful and defense purposes are solved very slowly as they lack a legislative basis. As a result, re-cycling or dumping spent nuclear fuel alone will require considerable financial and material costs. At present, as many as 29 nuclear reactors with total capacity of 21242 Megawatt function in Russia, including 13 VVER, 11 RBMK-1000, 4 low-capacity EGP-6 and one fast neutron BN-600. All these reactors were launched between 1971 and 1990, except for the fourth reactor of the Balakovskaya nuclear power station which was launched in 1993. There were no serious accidents at nuclear power stations in 1993 which would lead to releasing significant amounts of nuclear materials into the atmosphere or hazardous fires, except for several instances of overheating. About half of the accidents were caused by reckless maintenance of the equipment by personnel. Commenting on the state of the equipment, the committee pointed out that the reactors were maintained according to the safety requirements which were valid when the reactors were launched. At the moment, the reactors fail to comply with the modern safety requirements. The committee said the first-generation reactors installed at such stations as Novovoronezhskaya, Kolskaya, Leningradskaya, Kurskaya and Bilibinskaya were designed before the basic documents on atomic safety were released in Russia. Now they need drastic reconstruction, and such work is being carried out. The first and second reactors of the Novovoronezhskaya and Beloyarskaya stations have been closed down to be subsequently dumped. An analysis of the accidents which occurred in 1991-1993 showed a sharp aggravation of the situation at the Kolskaya nuclear power station caused by poor maintenance and repair of its equipment. Gosatomnadzor also pointed out that spent nuclear fuel is practically not taken out of the stations equipped with RBMK and EGP reactors, while its removal from other stations is not fast enough. The accumulation of spent nuclear fuel may cause a situation when there is no free space to dispose of the reactor's entire active area in an emergency as safety requirements demand. At present, none of Russia's nuclear power stations is equipped with the entire complex of installations for dumping liquid and solid nuclear waste. The nuclear storage facilities are filled to an average of 702000070040f capacity. The committee believes that the storage capacities may be exhausted in 2-3 years, given the current speed of piling up nuclear waste.
