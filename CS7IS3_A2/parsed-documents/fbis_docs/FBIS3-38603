In an interview with the regional daily OUEST-FRANCE, Lamassoure defended his idea for coordination on policy among Germany, France and Spain, which will successively succeed Greece in the six-month rotating presidency of the EC from June. "The chances of the calendar mean that the presidency, after being held by small and medium countries (Denmark, Belgium and Greece), will be taken by three large ones," he said. For that reason "it is necessary to organise ourselves to use these 18 months in the best way." [passage omitted] Lamassoure said the current system of a rotating presidency had the advantage of giving every member an equal share of responsibility, but it also did not clearly identify the power which should represent Europe out of the Commission of permanent officials, the Council of Ministers and the presidency. The French minister said there would be a proposal to remedy this in 1996 when EC governments will review the community's institutions.
