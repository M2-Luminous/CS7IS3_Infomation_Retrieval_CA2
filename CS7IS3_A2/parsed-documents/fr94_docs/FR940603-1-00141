The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Contractor if in the judgement of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner shall have the right to require the Contractor to increase the number of his employees and to increase or change the amount or kind of tools and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner; but the failure of the Owner to give any such directions shall not relieve the Contractor of his obligations to complete the work within the time and in the manner specified in this Proposal. c. The manner of construction of the Project and all materials and equipment used therein, shall be subject to the inspection, tests, and approval of the Owner. The Owner shall have the right to inspect all payrolls and other data and records of the Contractor relevant to the work. The Contractor will provide all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection and tests. The Contractor shall have an authorized agent accompany the inspector when final inspection is made and, if requested by the Owner, when any other inspection is made. d. In the event that the Owner shall determine that the construction contains or may contain numerous defects, it shall be the duty of the Contractor, if requested by the Owner, to have an inspection made by an engineer approved by the Owner for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent, and location of such defects. Section 4_Defective Materials and Workmanship. a. The acceptance of any materials, equipment (except owner-furnished materials) or any workmanship by the Owner shall not preclude the subsequent rejection thereof if such materials, equipment, or workmanship shall be found to be defective after delivery or installation, and any such materials, equipment or workmanship found defective before final acceptance of the construction shall be replaced or remedied, as the case may be, by and at the expense of the Contractor. Any such condemned material or equipment shall be immediately removed from the site of the Project by the Contractor at the Contractor's expense. The Contractor shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder so long as any defective materials, equipment or workmanship in respect to the Project, of which the Contractor shall have had notice, shall not have been replaced or remedied, as the case may be. b. Notwithstanding any certificate which may have been given by the Owner, if any materials, equipment (except owner-furnished materials) or any workmanship which does not comply with the requirements of this Contract shall be discovered within one (1) year after Completion of Construction of the Project, the Contractor shall replace such defective materials or equipment or remedy any such defective workmanship within thirty (30) days after notice in writing of the existence thereof shall have been given by the Owner. If the Contractor shall be called upon to replace any defective materials or equipment or to remedy defective workmanship as herein provided, the Owner, if so requested by the Contractor shall deenergize that section of the Project involved in such work. In the event of failure by the Contractor to do so, the Owner may replace such defective materials or equipment or remedy such defective workmanship, as the case may be, and in such event the Contractor shall pay to the Owner the cost and expense thereof. Section 5_Materials Removed. The Contractor will return to the Owner or reuse in the construction of other assembly units all materials removed from the lines under Section H_Conversion Assembly Units and Section I_Removal Assembly Units. Upon completion of each Section of the Project the Contractor will return to the Owner all materials, including usable materials as well as scrap, furnished by the Owner in excess of those required for the construction of the Section as determined from the Final Inventory approved by the Owner. The Contractor will reimburse the Owner at the current invoice cost to the Owner for loss and for breakage through Contractor's negligence of materials furnished by the Owner to the Contractor and for materials removed from the lines by the Contractor. Section 6_Term of Contract. It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Contract, the Contractor will not be required to commence any construction after the expiration of one year following acceptance of this Proposal by the Owner.
