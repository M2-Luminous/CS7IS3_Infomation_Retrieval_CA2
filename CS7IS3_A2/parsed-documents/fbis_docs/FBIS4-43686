Hammad said Vatican and Palestinian officials are now "discussing the test of an agreement for mutual recognition" in a statement given to the Italian news agency ANSA. The opening of a Palestinian office for relations with the Holy See would appear to sanction the start-up of official relations between the two sides. On this score, Palestinian sources here have recently referred to the prospect for imminent "diplomatic relations." The feasibility of this step, however, is clouded by what the Vatican itself describes as "the beginning of Palestinian autonomous government responsibility in the Gaza region and the city of Jerico," in relation to full diplomatic recognition, with an exchange of ambassadors, with an entity which is not yet a full-blow state. In any case, noted Vatican watchers, a Palestinian "presence" in the Vatican would certainly come as a step in this direction and help confirm the desire of the Holy See to play a role in the Middle East peace process.
