FBIS4-27741 "dreas108_l_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-108 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 Philippines Foreign Investment Grows in First Quarter Foreign Investment Grows in First Quarter BK0606035794 Manila BUSINESS WORLD in English 2 Jun 94 pp 1, 5 BK0606035794 Manila BUSINESS WORLD English BFN [Text] Riding on recent positive developments in the economy, the country's net foreign investments posted a triple-digit growth of 289 percent to $677 million during the first quarter from the previous quarter's $174 million, preliminary figures obtained by Business World from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas [Central Bank of the Philippines] show. This represents a 164.4 percent upsurge from the level in the comparative period last year, which was $256 million. This development, in effect, reverses the negative trend established last year when net foreign investments dipped by 17 percent when capital outflows outpaced inflows. For the first time after a series of dumps, inflows during the first quarter this year grew by 205.2 percent to $1.63 billion, compared with $534 million during the same period in 1993. Against the previous quarter's level of $1.019 billion, inflows posted a 59.96 percent increase. The tremendous boost in inflows mainly came from portfolio investments or investments in the stock market were registered at $736 million, and new foreign investments were worth $556 million for the quarter. Remittances, which combine personal income ($598 million) and withdrawals from 247/543 accounts ($589 million) also accounted for the bulk of non-merchandise transactions. On the other hand, outflows which are in the form of capital withdrawals, capital for investments abroad, outward remittances from bank inter-branch operations, and proceeds from portfolio investments, amounted to $953 million. This represents a 243 percent increase from $278 million the same period last year, and 12.78 percent hike from the fourth quarter's $108-million level. Total capital taken out of the country amounted to $534 million, while investments in foreign countries' stock markets reached $369 million. These two factors comprised the bulk of foreign investment outflows. Bangko Sentral Gov. Gabriel C. Singson explained that the continuous surge in foreign currency deposit unit (FCDU) accounts could have been tapped by investors as a way of returning to the country the substantial amount of capital flown out during the Marcos years. The surge in FCDU accounts persists even as there are heavy withdrawals noted from such accounts which are, in turn, being sold in the foreign exchange market in exchange for local currency. This helps buoy up the exchange value of the peso against the dollar. Total outstanding FCDU balance as of April, he said, amounts to $5.8 billion, including the $300 million worth of non-resident accounts. Total FCDU accounts in end 1993 amounted to around $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion in spite of the $2.962 billion in withdrawals from such accounts. Mr. Singson believes the FCDU accounts are being used as a vehicle to bring back capital that investors had scurried out during the crisis years in the eighties, which resulted in massive capital flights. Mr. Singson has recently been under fire from exporters for allowing the peso value to further strengthen.
