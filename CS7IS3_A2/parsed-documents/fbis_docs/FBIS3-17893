Nuclear Missiles Were in Criminal's Control"] [Text] Barnaul -- An incident on a world scale occurred at a troop unit stationed in the vicinity of Barnaul. Private P., a native of Dagestan, shot a guard and seized a combat vehicle guarding missiles carrying nuclear warheads. You can imagine what the terrorist might have done had he reached the positions where the intercontinental ballistic missiles are held. The regiment commander had difficulty persuading the soldier to surrender. Criminal proceedings have been instigated. But the conclusion is self-evident. Evidently, our valiant missilemen are having problems in obtaining fresh troops since unsuitable people are being admitted to secret installations.
