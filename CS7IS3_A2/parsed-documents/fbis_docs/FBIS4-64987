It demands respect. Russia is extremely sensitive to what it calls its dignity. Moscow's new tone does not go very well with Yeltsin's wish to expand the partnership with the West. Since signing the Two-Plus-Four Treaty in 1990, no other country has given more economic aid to Gorbachev's Soviet Union and Yeltsin's Russia than Germany. By refusing to support the Honecker regime, Soviet policy in the Gorbachev era admittedly contributed to Germany's peaceful reunification. But with Russian diplomats talking like that, one must not forget that Soviet policy alone forced the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] regime upon East Germans, established the division, and maintained it for four decades, not to mention Stalin's pact with Hitler, which opened the door to war for the German dictator. Thus, the two days of Hitler's surrender are also two-sided: 8 May was the end of a totalitarian dictatorship for the Germans in the West, and 9 May was the beginning of another one for the Germans in the East. But how should the withdrawal of the Russian troops be celebrated? The Western allies are only withdrawing from Berlin; they will stay in the country as friends. The Russian Army will withdraw, and this enables voluntary cooperation. The Russian soldiers have a right to a polite farewell with all the usual military ceremonies. To demand more, such as a joint ceremony in Berlin together with the Americans, British, and French would invite a comparison of their roles in Germany, an exercise in which Russia cannot win. To insist on something special would turn out to be a self-made trap, from which the Russian leadership could hardly withdraw without hurting its sensitive need for dignity. This way it risks losing the very thing it wants to have: a polite farewell, formal, respectful, addressed in a formal manner.
