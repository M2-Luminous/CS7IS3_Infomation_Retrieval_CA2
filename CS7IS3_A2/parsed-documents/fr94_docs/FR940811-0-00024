FR940811-0-00024 FR940811-0-00010 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;27&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8991; AD 94&hyph;16&hyph;02] Airworthiness Directives: Luscombe Model 8 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes AD 79&hyph;25&hyph;05, which currently requires repetitively inspecting the existing aluminum vertical stabilizer forward attach fitting for cracks on Luscombe Model 8 series airplanes, and replacing any cracked parts. Steel fittings are now available that, when installed, will eliminate the need for repeated removal and inspection of the aluminum fitting, which could result in damage to the fastener holes. This action requires replacing the existing aluminum fitting with a steel vertical stabilizer forward attach fitting on Luscombe Model 8 series airplanes that have round-tipped vertical stabilizer installations. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the vertical stabilizer as a result of a cracked fitting, which could result in loss of control of the airplane. DATES: Effective September 19, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations as approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Service information that applies to this AD may be obtained from the Don Luscombe Aviation History Foundation, P.O. Box 63581, Phoenix, Arizona 85082; telephone (602) 693&hyph;4312. This information may also be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Lirio Liu, Aerospace Engineer, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, 3229 E. Spring Street, Long Beach, California 90806; telephone (310) 988&hyph;5229; facsimile (310) 988&hyph;5210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to Luscombe Model 8 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on January 12, 1994 (59 FR 1676). The action proposed to supersede AD 79&hyph;25&hyph;05 with a new AD that would require replacing the existing aluminum vertical stabilizer forward attach fitting, P/N 28444 or P/N 28453, with a steel fitting manufactured by the Univair Aircraft Corporation (P/N U28444) or FAA-approved equivalent part. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the four comments received from three different commenters. Two commenters propose including Luscombe part number (P/N) 28415 in the list of vertical stabilizer attach fittings that should be replaced as specified in paragraph (a) of the proposal. The FAA concurs and has changed paragraph (a) of the AD to include this P/N as well as P/N 28444 and P/N 28453. These same two commenters request including Luscombe P/N 28455 as a replacement part for the vertical stabilizer attach fittings. This part has type design approval from the FAA, and the Don Luscombe Aviation History Foundation (DLAHF) holds a Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA). The FAA concurs that this part should be referenced in the AD and has changed paragraph (a) of the AD to include the following: Replace the aluminum vertical stabilizer forward attach fitting, *␣*␣* with either Luscombe P/N 28455 manufactured by the DLAHF; a welded steel fitting manufactured by the Univair Aircraft Corporation, P/N U28444; or an FAA-approved equivalent part. Both of these commenters request replacing the installation instructions referenced as Figure 1 in the proposal with DLAHF Service Recommendation # 1, dated November 28, 1993. The commenters state that this publication is basically identical to Figure 1. The FAA concurs that this action should be accomplished in accordance with DLAHF Service Recommendation # 1, dated November 28, 1993, and has changed the AD accordingly. The third commenter recommends that the FAA more clearly state the Applicability of the proposal by only incorporating those Luscombe Model 8 series airplanes with round tip vertical stabilizers. This commenter states that all the applicable service difficulty history is based upon those stabilizers with round tips and there is no service difficulty history for those with square tips. The FAA concurs and has changed the Applicability statement of the AD to include: ``Model 8 Series airplanes (all serial numbers) that have round-tipped vertical stabilizer installations, certificated in any category.''
