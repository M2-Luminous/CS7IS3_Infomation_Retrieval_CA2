This was said in a DSU statement to Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch. "Despite our critical attitude to the composition of the Supreme Council and some of its decisions, we cannot fail to see that today it is a lesser evil compared to the presidential structures," the statement stresses. The DSU sees Ukraine's Supreme Council as an obstacle to the defeatist policy of Ukraine's president and believes that after the current Supreme Council is dissolved, Leonid Kravchuk will use the temporary period of one-man rule to bring Ukraine to its knees with the help of Clinton and Yeltsin. The DSU reminds Plyushch that the decision to hold early elections on 27 March was adopted in violation of the Constitution, under the president's pressure. It calls on the chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council to initiate a proposal at the next Supreme Council session to postpone the Supreme Council elections to a later date. The date of the parliamentary elections can be set to coincide with the next presidential election or with the expiry of the current Supreme Council's five-year term, the DSU believes. During this time, according to the DSU, the Supreme Council must approve a law on impeachment of the president of Ukraine and apply it before the next elections.
