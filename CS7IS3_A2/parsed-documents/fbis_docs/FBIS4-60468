In a bid to acquit Saudi Arabia of any charges of negligence towards providing security for pilgrims, a government official at the Health Ministry announced Monday that 829 pilgrims had died in accidents or from old age and heat since May 12. Eye-witnesses blame yesterday's tragic event on the inefficiency of Saudi officials and their permission to [allow] small and large motor cars to move in the region. There are contradictory reports of casualties released by representative offices of various countries in Mecca but none of them can be confirmed because of the lack of official statistics and Riyadh's silence on the issue.
