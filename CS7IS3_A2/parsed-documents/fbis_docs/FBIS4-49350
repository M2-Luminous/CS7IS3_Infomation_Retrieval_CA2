He pointed out that as the anticorruption struggle is a long-term and arduous task, leaders at various levels of party committees and governments must take the overall situation into consideration; correctly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability; be fully aware that economic construction is the central task; persist in carrying out the policy of promoting the reform and opening up drive with one hand and cracking down on severe crimes with the other, equally stressing both; integrate well the anticorruption struggle with the efforts to deepen reform measures, to open the province wider to the outside world, to promote development, and to maintain stability, so that the anticorruption struggle will be carried out in an in-depth, lasting, and more effective manner. At the beginning of the speech, Lu Rongjing gave a positive appraisal to the results which Anhui has achieved in the earlier stage of the anticorruption drive. He said last year was a year in which the province witnessed a rapid progress in reform, opening up, and in economic construction as well as a year in which the province achieved great progress in the anticorruption drive. Particularly since the convening of the plenary session of the second meeting of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, various levels of discipline inspection committees in the province, following the unified arrangement made by the CPC Central Committee and the provincial CPC committee, further enhanced anticorruption measures; applied greater energy on anticorruption work with special efforts concentrating on leading comrades' checking on their own honest performing of their official duties, on investigating and handling major and important cases, and on rectifying unhealthy tendencies among various trades and professions. The drive had been unprecedented in terms of propaganda drive, scale, and effect. The province's anticorruption momentum is excellent as a whole and its development is healthy. The province has scored results, though in varying degrees, in the three anticorruption tasks proposed by the CPC Central Committee; blunted the momentum of the spread of negative and corrupt phenomena; reduced the number of corruption cases that has long incurred the wrath of the masses; and further enhanced the enthusiasm and increased the confidence of the broad mass of cadres and the masses to take part in the anticorruption struggle. Lu Rongjing pointed out the need for affirming the results scored in the earlier stage of the anticorruption drive from a spirit of seeking truth from facts. However, he cautioned against making an overestimation of the results. He said all must be aware of the fact that the province has only achieved initial anticorruption results and that the province might have solved some superficial corruption issues in the earlier stage of the anticorruption drive. However, some hidden and deep-seated problems have yet to be solved or even left untouched. Seen from the entire province's situation, the anticorruption work has also been uneven. Therefore, the anticorruption struggle's situation is still grim and the task ahead is still arduous. Leading comrades at various levels of party committees and governments and comrades at various levels of discipline inspection and supervision organs must remain sober- headed; must never become complacent and overly optimistic because of the initial results in the anticorruption drive; must not dismiss the existing problems as insignificant; and must not lower our guard. Lu Rongjing added: To a great extend, whether the anticorruption struggle can proceed smoothly and successfully depends on the awareness of the people, especially the awareness of leading cadres at all levels. Only when we have a consensus of view can we have the initiative, the willingness, and the determination to fight corruption, otherwise we will approach the problem negatively and passively. The vast number of party member cadres, especially those in leading positions, must study the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on fighting corruption and promoting work ethics, as well as the guidelines laid down by the second and third plenary sessions of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and Comrade Jiang Zemin's talks so that we can achieve greater consensus of view, clear up misunderstandings, do away with misgivings, and act even more positively, consciously, and earnestly while launching the anticorruption struggle -- and not do so negatively, positively, or perfunctorily -- so that we can seize victories at every stage, promote political and social stability throughout Anhui, and expedite the healthy development of reform, opening up, and economic construction. On what will be done next in fighting corruption, Lu Rongjing said: In real life, many phenomena of corruption have generated from going against the objective of serving the people wholeheartedly, or from failing to take the interests of the masses into account. Thus, the guideline for our fight against corruption is quite clear, namely we must take the masses' interests into account and consider forging stronger ties with the masses as an important job in fighting corruption. Leading cadres at all levels must start by dealing with problems to which the masses have responded strongly; earnestly deal with problems in their respective regions, departments, and units; and deal with major problems themselves. We must set examples in fighting corruption and promoting work ethics by taking the lead in carrying out the Central Committee's requirements for fighting corruption. We must be more aware of the need to take the masses interests into account, be concerned with the masses plight, and always bear in mind the masses' problems. Only by doing so can we have the trust of the people, enable the masses to see our determination to fight corruption and solve our own problems, mobilize the masses' initiative, and forge closer ties between the party and the people. Lu Rongjing stressed: Whether or not the fight against corruption can proceed successfully rests primarily with leadership. Party committees and governments at all levels must consider the fight against corruption as one of their most important tasks, one that should be placed high on their agenda. We must earnestly assume leadership, act personally to deal with major issues, and mobilize all social quarters to fight corruption. Each and every party member must take part in the endeavor, and all party and government organizations must exert efforts together. Organizations of one level, after dealing with their own problems, must make sure that the work of organizations of the next level is properly accomplished. In addition to following through with the regulations set by the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission for fighting corruption and promoting work ethics, all regions, departments, and units must proceed from their actual situations and come up with their own priorities; and then they must take stronger measures, set more effective rules, and establish more effective operating mechanisms to make sure that the fight against corruption can proceed with clear objectives and that there are requirements to fulfill and measures to take for attaining these objectives. Leading bodies of party and government organizations must regard improvement of party conduct and work ethics as well as fight against corruption as responsibilities to fulfill during their terms of office. Responsibilities governing leading party members' conduct and work ethics must be established and improved, and rules should be set to divide the responsibilities to make sure that all measures are implemented and all objectives attained. Lu Rongjing continued: Under the new situation, the fight against corruption faces many new situations and new problems. This being the case, leading cadres at all levels must intensify their investigation and study so as to find ways to deal with problems and accumulate the needed experiences for expediting the fight against corruption. Owing to our imperfect laws and nonstandardized rules for government conduct and enterprises' market conduct at a time when the planned economy is being replaced by a market economy, our enterprises now face many formidable problems of various descriptions. In particular, leaders at all levels must intensify their investigation and study of enterprises, attach importance to resolving their existing problems, and firmly and strictly punish those who have seriously violated laws and discipline. If the mistakes made by persons in charge of enterprises have nothing to do with abusing authority for personal gains and have not violated the law, we need not demand them to be perfect, but should protect them and encourage them to explore and proceed with their reforms bravely after sincerely pointing out and criticizing their mistakes as well as helping and educating them so that they can make new contributions to the development of their enterprises. Lu Rongjing pointed out: Because of the protracted nature and formidability of the fight against corruption, we must, during the fight against corruption, deal with the root causes and the symptoms and outstanding and routine problems at the same time. On the one hand, we must firmly punish all corrupt elements who have abused their authority for personal gains, bent the law, and accepted and given bribes. By no means should we be lenient to these elements and by no means should we let these corrupt elements do whatever they want and remain at large. On the other hand, while we fight against corruption, we should make corrections and proceed to build or improve mechanisms that can effectively restrain the generation and spreading of the corruption phenomena. To make sure that all measures for fighting corruption and promoting work ethics are followed through, we must continue to intensify our efforts in supervising the performance of leading cadres in examining themselves, in correcting their own mistakes, and in dealing with cases about irregularities. We must attach importance to supporting the operations of specialized organs so that discipline inspection, procuratorial, and supervisory organs can give full scope to their important roles in fighting corruption. Lu Rongjing concluded: Ever since the party Central Committee issued the order to fight corruption and promote work ethics, the new outlook in many areas as well as the vivid facts about censuring corruption have increased the masses' confidence and enabled them to see a hopeful future. The macroclimate for fighting corruption and promoting work ethics has now appeared, specific assignments have been set, and measures have been drawn up. As long as we make genuine efforts to fight corruption and follow through with all measures, we certainly can succeed at various stages in deepening the fight against corruption. Attending the meeting on the afternoon of 21 March were leading comrades of the provincial party committee standing committee, the provincial people's congress standing committee, and the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as various provincial departments, committees, and bureaus.
