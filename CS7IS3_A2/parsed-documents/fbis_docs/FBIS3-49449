Pointing out that in several hours' time he will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Prague, with whom he will discuss, among other things, the results of the NATO Brussels summit, the president said: We should have one position on this issue -- where Poland is and where it is going. After the meeting, which lasted almost an hour, Speaker Oleksy told journalists that the Partnership for Peace initiative is not regarded by him or the president as sufficient, although it is a step in the right direction, and a step which makes it possible for Poland to continue to aspire to NATO membership. The speaker said that he will discuss the decisions taken by the Brussels summit with German politicians during his visit to the Federal Republic as early as Wednesday.
