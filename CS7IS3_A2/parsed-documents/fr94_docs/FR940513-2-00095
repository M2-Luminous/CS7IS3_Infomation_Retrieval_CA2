FR940513-2-00095 FR940513-2-00039 Checklist I have checked my application package to ensure that it includes or is in accord with the following: XX One original application plus two copies, each stapled securely (no folders or binders) with the SF 424 as the first page of each copy of the application; XX SF 424; SF 424A_Budget Information (and accompanying Budget Justification); SF 424B_Assurances; and Certifications; XX SF 424 has been completed according to the instructions, signed and dated by an authorized official (item 18); XX The number of the priority area under which the application is submitted has been identified in the box provided at the top left of the SF 424; XX As necessary, a copy of the current indirect cost rate agreement approved by the Department of Health and Human Services or another federal agency; XX Proof of nonprofit status, as necessary; XX Summary description; XX Program narrative; XX Organizational capability statement and vitae for key personnel; XX Letters of commitment and cooperation, as appropriate. L. Points to Remember 1. There is a forty (40) double-spaced page limitation for the substantive parts of the application. Before submitting your application, please check that you have adhered to this requirement which is spelled out in Section D. 2. You are required to send an original and two copies of an application. 3. Indicate the priority area in the box at the top left hand corner of the SF 424. 4. The summary description (1,200 characters or less) should accurately reflect the nature and scope of the proposed project. 5. To meet the cost sharing requirement (see Section C above), you must, at a minimum, match $1 for every $3 requested in federal funding to reach 25% of the total project cost. For example, if your request for federal funds is $90,000, then the required minimum match or cost sharing is $30,000. The total project cost is $120,000, of which your $30,000 share is 25%. 6. Indirect costs of training grants may not exceed 8%. 7. In following the required format for preparing the program narrative, make certain that you have responded fully to the four (4) evaluative criteria which will be used by reviewers to evaluate and score all applications. 8. Do not include letters which endorse the project in general and perfunctory terms. In contrast, letters which describe and verify tangible commitments to the project, e.g., funds, staff, space, should be included. 9. If duplicate applications are submitted under different priority areas, AoA reserves the right to select the single priority area under which it will be reviewed. 10. If more than one project application is submitted, each should be submitted under separate cover. 11. Before submitting the application, have someone other than the author(s): 1) apply the screening requirements to make sure you are in compliance; and 2) carry out a trial run review based upon the evaluative criteria. Take the opportunity to consider the results of the trial run and then make whatever changes you deem appropriate. 12. Each application must be mailed by midnight, or hand-delivered by 5:30 p.m., Eastern Time, on the deadline date specified in the priority area under which the application is being submitted for review and funding consideration. Mail or hand-deliver the application to: Department of Health and Human Services, Administration on Aging, Office of Administration and Management, 330 Independence Avenue, SW., room 4644, Washington, D.C. 20201. Attn: AoA&hyph;94&hyph;2 Dated: May 9, 1994. Fernando Torres-Gil, Assistant Secretary for Aging.
