Anyone who, like Kohl, accuses Rau of "being a traitor to humaneness" shows that he has "lost touch with reality, good behavior, and morals in treating others in a democratic society," SPD Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen said in Bonn on Friday [18 February]. "Those who talk like that are becoming a danger to democratic culture and the future of our country." The chancellor had attacked Rau in connection with the SPD's former policy on Germany during an interview broadcast on ZDF, Second German Television.
