Speaking in Dublin following talks with the British Foreign Secretary Mr. Hurd, Mr. Spring also said there are no indications that the IRA is considering a temporary cease-fire. Derek Cunningham reports: [Begin Cunningham recording] Mr. Hurd arrived at Iveagh House in the company of the Tanaiste at around half past tenthis morning. The two men spent about an hour together and discussed a wide range of topics, including the present state of the peace process and the controversy over the enlargement of the European Union. After the meeting, Mr. Spring said that--in relation to comments attributed to him at the weekend concerning an IRA cease-fire--there were no indications that the IRA are considering such a move. He said a temporary cease-fire would be welcomed by the communities in the north and would be encouraged by the government, but Mr. Spring said it was difficult to accept peace messages from Sinn Fein by day while mortar attacks like those on Heathrow Airport and Crossmaglen continued. The British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the Downing Street Declaration was not a bargaining ploy but a robust statement of principle by the two governments. Mr. Spring will accompany Mr. Hurd on a visit to Newgrange later this afternoon. Derek Cunningham RTE news, Iveagh House. [end recording]
