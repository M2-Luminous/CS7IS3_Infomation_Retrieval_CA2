[Sha'th] Thank you. [Husayn] Dr. Nabil, could you please brief us on the results of the meetings of the past two days? [Sha'th] The talks seek to reach a written, signed agreement so that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho can begin as soon as possible. We have returned to Taba following a hiatus in the talks during which the Palestinian-Israeli Liaison Committee dealt with complicated issues including control over the border crossings and specifying the size of the Jericho area and the security zones that will surround the Israeli settlements in Gaza. We are still discussing these issues, among many others. We have a committee discussing the transfer of civilian powers to the Palestinian national authority in Gaza and Jericho. This committee has been successful and has already decided on the transfer of most departments. The Security Committee has been discussing the border crossings, Jericho, and other security issues. A third committee will formulate the general agreement that will also deal with the Palestinian national authority's powers. [Husayn] Dr. Nabil, in what spheres have you made progress? What spheres remain pending? [Sha'th] Progress has been made in the transfer of civilian powers. Discussions within the Security Committee are very slow and difficult. This is really the consequence of the Israeli attitude to these issues, especially as they are raising the stakes, insisting that the discussions will last long, and that they will not observe the 13 April date for completing withdrawal. Their public statements that they will not observe the agreement hinder progress on the security issue, the biggest problem in the negotiations. [Husayn] Have you proposed a compromise on control over the border crossings? [Sha'th] Each side is making proposals. But I believe we need to negotiate much more before we can announce real progress on this issue. [Husayn] Dr. Nabil, after reports from Taba said that agreement had been reached specifying the size of the Jericho area as 55 sq km, you denied this and said the reports were fabricated. What are the facts? [Sha'th] The reports were fabricated. The Israeli spokesman said the same when he was asked. The head of the Israeli delegation Major General Shahaq also stated that they were fabricated reports. [Husayn] Have you reached a solution on specifying the size of the Jericho area? [Sha'th] We are still working on it. Brother, these are the difficult points. They need much effort. [Husayn] Dr. Sha'th, I believe that Maj. Gen. Shahaq stated that the Israeli delegation came to Taba to negotiate over what he called the Cairo document. What do you think of this statement? [Sha'th] I believe this news has also been distorted. We are negotiating on the basis of the Declaration of Principles and the Cairo concepts. On some of these concepts the two delegations are close to each other and on others they are far apart. Hence, there is no such thing as a Cairo agreement, merely several concepts. Doubtless, we will profit from the ideas on which we have agreed. We will continue negotiating to reach agreement on the rest. [Husayn] Dr. Sha'th, the Israeli delegation reportedly presented 10 different maps to the Palestinian negotiators yesterday, Tuesday. How true is this? What can you tell us about the maps? [Sha'th] True. They submitted maps about new areas they have added to Jericho. They also submitted maps reducing the security areas around the Gaza settlements. They also proposed architectural plans for the border crossing buildings. All this reflected Israeli positions, which, although more advanced, remain insufficient for Palestinian purposes. [Husayn] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, in a move seen by observers as U.S. intervention, or rather assistance, the U.S. State Department issued a statement yesterday, Tuesday, urging the Palestinian and Israeli delegations to find prompt solutions to the unresolved issues. Do you see any significance in this U.S. statement? [Sha'th] I believe the Americans want the Palestinians and Israelis to make some progress before the meeting between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. I believe that pressure should be applied to the Israelis. As for us, we are willing to achieve results as fast as possible. [Husayn] Will you ask Egypt, the United States, or any other party to intervene if the Israeli attitude remains the same? [Sha'th] Naturally, if there is no progress. The Egyptians maintain constant contact with us and are following every development. [Husayn] We thank Dr. Nabil Sha'th. [Sha'th] Thank you.
