According to these reports, Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] lawyer Yaovi Agboyibor allegedly offered the post of National Assembly speaker to the presidential group. Let us listen to Mr. Mivedor: [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Chairman, in a clarification note to the media, the UTD disclosed that the CAR and RPT had allegedly held contacts. Thus, we learned that after the publication of the results by the Supreme Court, the CAR proposed the National Assembly speakership to the presidential group. Can you tell us what actually happened? [Mivedor] Yes, that is true. The CAR has made us that proposal, and we thank it for taking such an initiative, but as far as our group is concerned, we consider that by arrogating the post of prime minister to itself and allocating the other posts to other political parties, the CAR has implemented a policy which reminds us of what is called politicking, and this takes us many years back into the past. This is why the RPT has rejected this spontaneous proposal by the CAR concerning the National Assembly speaker's post. It rather hopes that new orientations for the political and economic reconstruction of the country will spring out of discussions among the various political parties who were involved in the elections. The RPT calls on everyone for moderation, so that a serene dialogue can be established among the various political parties. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Does the RPT have certain demands to make concerning the formation of the new government? [Midevor] The RPT is not making any demands. It adhered to the proposal made by the head of state a long time ago to form a broad-based union government. As far as the type of democracy that we know in our African countries is concerned, the RPT is for a participatory democracy, as opposed to an exclusionary democracy, that is, you lose and I win. The RPT is for the joint management of public property, which helps ensure national unity and the country's development. That is why the RPT is for a broad-based national union government. [passage omitted] [end recording] Concerning the new political situation in the country, the RPT issued the following statement: The RPT received from Mr. Agboyibor himself proposals relating to the distribution of responsibilities within the future government. The RPT thanks Mr. Agboyibor for his initiative, but wants all political parties participate in the negotiations. [Signed] For the RPT secretary general: Daouko Pere, RPT deputy general secretary. For its part, the CAR denies it has proposed the National Assembly speaker's post to the RPT, contrary to what was said. However, the party is happy about the fact that in a statement published on 16 March the CAR and the UTD reaffirmed that they constitute an absolute majority within the National Assembly and intend to jointly handle, along with the other democratic forces, the victory of the Togolese people for the actual advent of the change so called for by the people.
