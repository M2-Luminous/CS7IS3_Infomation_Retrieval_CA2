Ochoa Antich told the media that the meeting, which was to be held in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), was postponed at the request of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, in view of the difficult situation Mexico is experiencing due to the uprising in Chiapas. The foreign minister indicated that given that in the next few days there will be a number of important regional commitments, such as the inauguration of the new president of Ecuador [as received], the signing was postponed for after 2 February, when Venezuelan President-elect Rafael Caldera takes office. Ochoa Antich also said the presidents are studying the possibility of holding their meeting in another city. The G-3 trade treaty is a tripartite agreement for the expansion of the trade flow among Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. It provides for the complete elimination of tariffs within 10 years. The agreement that will be signed by the presidents establishes regulations for access to markets, regulations on origin of products, technical norms, intellectual property regulations, and regulations for the exchange of transportation, telecommunications, financial, and professional services. It is expected that this agreement, which at the moment of its signing contemplates an asymmetrical lifting of tariffs giving 28 percent preference to Mexico and 12 percent to Colombia and Venezuela, will go into effect in July, after it is approved by the countries' parliaments. Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela form a market of 145 million people, with $50 billion in total exports and $60 billion in imports. The GDP of the three countries is approximately $373 billion.
