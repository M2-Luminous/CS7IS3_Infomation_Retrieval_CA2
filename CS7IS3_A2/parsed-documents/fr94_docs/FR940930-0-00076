FR940930-0-00076 FR940930-0-00013 Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the U.S. Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). This rule does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore, is exempt from the regulatory flexibility requirements. Although exempt, the Coast Guard has reviewed this rule for potential impact on small entities. Because it expects the impact of this rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you think that your business qualifies as a small entity and that this rule will have a significant economic impact on your business, please submit a comment (See ADDRESSES ) explaining why you think your business qualifies and in what way and to what degree this rule will economically affect your business. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Federalism Assessment This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2.e.(32)(e) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges.
