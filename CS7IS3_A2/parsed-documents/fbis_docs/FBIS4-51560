[Begin Kumagai recording] Prime Minister Hata was involved in working out those reformist policies as deputy prime minister. I believe that the Hata government will inherit and develop the reformist policies which the Hosokawa government worked out. [end recording]. While speaking with the reporters, the chief cabinet secretary also stressed that the Hata government will promote political reform which still leaves the issue of drafting a bill on the demarcation of single-seat constituencies unresolved, economic reform to relax bureaucratic deregulations, and administrative reform to precipitate decentralization. Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai commented on the discussion of ways to reform the current tax system by ruling coalition parties in a recent interview with the NHK and said as follows: [Begin Kumagai recording] In the past, the SDPJ participated in the discussion. With the SDPJ breaking away from the coalition, however, the discussion is making little headway. Some are asserting that the discussion should be held without the SDPJ. It is important to promote reform of the current tax system in a way that we lure the SDPJ back to the coalition, but I believe that the SDPJ will absolutely not come bask to the coalition. Therefore, we will have to make substantive efforts to make the SDPJ come back to the coalition. [end recording]. In this way, Mr. Kumagai indicated that as a minority government, the Hata government will carry out the reformist policies while giving consideration to the SDPJ. With regard to the issue of Japan's participation in the collective self-defense set by the UN Charter, the government has so far taken the view that Japan's participation in the collective self-defense is tantamount to exercising the right of collective self-defense and that violates the Constitution. In this connection, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai said the Hata cabinet does need to alter the view. Thus, he made it clear that the Hata cabinet does not intend to put into effect the idea of changing the interpretation of the Constitution that has been broached by Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party].
