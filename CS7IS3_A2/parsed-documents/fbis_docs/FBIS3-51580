Velasquez to deal with the national financial system crisis resulting from the fall of Banco Latino, and to stop the "dangerous" rumor campaign, was warmly welcomed by banking representatives who said the program arouses feelings of security and confidence in the future. As he left the site of the president's speech, to which all the sector's representatives were invited, National Banking Council President Jose Bouzas Izquierdo said that the president's announcement to the effect that the BCV [Venezuelan Central Bank] will support the country's financial institutions constitutes the beginning of the definitive solution of the crisis created by the Banco Latino intervention. Bouzas characterized as very healthy the measures aimed at stemming the wave of rumors, comments, and remarks about specific banks which, in his opinion, should be rejected for the good of the financial sector and to safeguard those banks' depositors. The president was very emphatic in pointing out that criminal action will be taken against individuals who in any way spread such rumors or instigate distrust toward certain financial institutions. That is a fundamental issue, Bouzas said; it is up to us to work within the framework of the law and to adhere to the healthiest banking conventions, and it is up to the news media to echo the president's remarks concerning the need to control those rumors. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Carlos Rafael Silva said it was necessary to undertake this package of measures in view of the regrettable Banco Latino episode. In Silva's opinion, this plan not only has the full support of the national government but that of the president-elect and his team of collaborators. Silva stated explicitly that reducing the quantity of bank deposits will allow the release of [word indistinct] that could be very useful at this time of financial need. Silva confirmed the resignations of Banking Superintendent Roger Urbina and Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund] President Esperanza Martino who, according to Silva, resigned "to facilitate the work of the next government."
