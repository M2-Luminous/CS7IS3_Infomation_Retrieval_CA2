The notice also solicited information on the SEMP concept and the efforts necessary to implement a SEMP-like program. The MMS received comments from offshore operators, trade organizations, government entities, consultants, an engineering society, and an environmental organization. Generally, the commenters supported MMS's efforts to enhance safety and environmental protection in the OCS. Some were concerned that SEMP would cross jurisdictional lines and create regulatory conflict and confusion. Many commenters urged MMS to defer publishing SEMP regulations and allow the American Petroleum Institute (API) to develop a voluntary standard that addresses safety and environmental protection. In November 1991 and January 1992, as a part of the SEMP information gathering process, MMS invited a cross section of operators to give presentations on their safety policies and safety management programs. Those discussions were useful for gaining a better understanding of the overall development of industry safety programs for both large and small operators. Most company presenters were encouraged by the SEMP initiative. Several suggested that MMS wait until the API completed its recommended practice before making a SEMP decision. Some encouraged MMS to set goals for safety rather than promulgate regulations, while others suggested that MMS coordinate SEMP efforts with all other OCS-related agencies to streamline the regulatory environment. The MMS participated on the API subcommittee that developed ``Recommended Practices for Development of a Safety and Environmental Management Program for Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Operations and Facilities'' (API RP 75), published in May 1993. We believe API RP 75 provides a good foundation for promoting safety and environmental protection in the offshore oil and gas industry. The document generally captures our perception of what SEMP should contain. The API and Offshore Operators Committee (OOC) conducted three API RP 75 workshops in 1993, one in New Orleans and two in Houston. The purpose of the workshops was to provide attendees (especially small- and medium-sized independent operators) a better understanding of the purpose of API RP 75 and guidance for its implementation. The MMS participated in all three workshops. Approximately 600 persons attended the three workshops. The MMS Intentions and Monitoring Plan The MMS urges all operators to voluntarily implement the principles of SEMP through API RP 75. In addition, MMS will cooperate with the API/OOC SEMP committee (the Committee) in the continuing development of the SEMP concept and will monitor industry's progress towards the implementation of SEMP, while assessing its success.
