Kukoleva, Central Aerological Observatory; UDC (551.510.534:551.510.52).001.572+551.513] [Abstract] Empirical models of the vertical distribution of ozone in the altitude range 10-32 km have been published, but data on tropospheric ozone are lacking and data from the existing ozonometric network are inadequate for constructing zonal, global or regional models. However, data from the world ozonometric network were used in constructing models of the partial pressure of ozone in the troposphere for 35 stations. The data taken into account included the mean climatic distribution of the wind, climatic characteristics of the tropopause and location of the principal jet stream zones over the northern hemisphere. The seasonal variation of ozone partial pressure was determined for the 300- and 500-gpa surfaces for different points in the hemisphere. These data revealed that the classical seasonal variation of tropospheric ozone density with a summer maximum and a winter minimum is not always observed. The constructed models of the vertical distribution for these stations show that the accepted seasonal variation of ozone density occurs only in regions not subject to the influence of jet streams. In the latter, however, the ozone maximum, as in the lower stratosphere, is in the spring. It can be postulated that under definite synoptic conditions a considerable quantity of ozone is pumped into the troposphere from the stratosphere. Figures 3; references: 6 Russian.
