Clinton made this remark when answering a question at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Asked a reporter: There is now a growing call on the United States not to link U.S.-Chinese trade issues to the issue of human rights. What is your opinion on this? Clinton responded: "From a long-term point of view, I believe we can resolve this problem, strengthen relations between the United States and China, and stress our proposition on human rights." Clinton added: "We have spent, and will continue to spend, a great deal of time on handling the issue of our relations with China. Our policy will remain as it has always been, i.e. the issue of human rights is important, while other issues are also important."
