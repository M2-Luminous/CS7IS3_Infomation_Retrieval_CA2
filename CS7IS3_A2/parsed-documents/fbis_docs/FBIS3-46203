It has been learned that Anhui reaped a comprehensive agricultural bumper harvest in 1993. First, the production of principal agricultural products grew steadily, with that of grains, edible oil, meat, eggs, and milk all breaking records. Total grain production is estimated to have topped 25.4 billion kg, up 8.46 percent compared to the previous year and exceeding 1990's production total of 25.2 billion kg. Total edible oil production was 31.33 million dan [one dan equals 50 kg], up 11.86 percent compared to the previous year and exceeding 1987's total production of 30.21 million dan. Total silkworm cocoon production reached 32,300 dan, up 13.3 percent compared to the previous year and an increase for 15th consecutive year. Total meat production topped 1.372 million tons, up 6.4 percent compared to the previous year; total egg production was 370,000 tons, up 2.2 percent compared to the previous year; and total dairy products output was 27,000 tons, up 1.5 percent compared to the previous year. Second, the economic efficiency of agriculture was raised, and peasants' incomes increased markedly. Anhui's total agricultural output value (in 1990 fixed prices) is estimated to top 41.7 billion yuan, an increase of 3.3 billion yuan or 8.47 percent compared to that of the previous year. The per capita income of the province's farmers could reach 670 yuan, an increase of 97 yuan or 16.9 percent compared to the previous year. Third, market-oriented agriculture developed rather rapidly, and the proportions of high-quality agricultural products increased. The problem of surplus agricultural products was fundamentally solved. The entire province's total cultivated area of high-grade rice was 9.31 million mu, an increase of 2.64 million mu compared to the previous year. In seven counties and cities, 1 million mu of high-yield and high-efficiency demonstration zones for high-grade rice cultivation were established. The production at these demonstration zones was generally 30 percent higher than that of nondemonstration zones. The tasks for elevating our province's agriculture to a new stage in 1994 and the preliminary production goals for principal agricultural products this year included: 25 billion kg in total grain production; 6 million dan of cotton; 31.20 million dan of edible oil; 1.42 million tons of meat; 13 million mu of high-grade rice cultivation area; and the proportion of herbivorous animals and poultry to reach about 16 percent of the total agricultural output.
