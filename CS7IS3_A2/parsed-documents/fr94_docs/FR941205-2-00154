For communities with few or no minorities, this should include publication in the surrounding communities of the applicant's policy of fair housing for minorities and the disabled; _Assistance to minority families; and _Special programs (e.g. utilization of Community Housing Resource Board (CHRB) Programs, efforts to encourage local realtors to enter into voluntary agreements to encourage equal access to financial institutions, etc.). The fair housing strategy must include goals for each of the above elements. The date of adoption or development of the strategy should be indicated, as well as the date proposed activities will be or have been implemented. (2) Entrepreneurial Efforts and Local Equal Employment (25 points total). Applicants may request points for both of these subfactors and must use the format sheets included in the application. (a) Minority Contracting. 15 points_Outstanding performance points will be given to those applicants who have demonstrated that they have utilized minority businesses to the following degree. The applicant must demonstrate that at least five percent of all its contracts, based on dollar value, have been awarded within the past two years to minority owned and controlled businesses (businesses that are at least 50 percent owned by minorities) provided that the minority population is five percent or less. If the minority population exceeds five percent, then the applicant must have a corresponding percentage of its contracts awarded to minority businesses; however, 20 percent of the total dollar value of its contracts will be sufficient for award of points for any applicant. The applicable percentage of minority population is the percentage of minorities in the applicant's jurisdiction, or is the county percentage, whichever is higher. The applicant must provide the information as outlined in the suggested format, showing the name, address, telephone number, contract date and contract amount for each contract or subcontract with a minority business. This information is to be provided in addition to information required on the HUD Form 4124.4, and should be for the two-year period ending February 1, 1994. (b) Equal Opportunity Employment. 10 points_In order to be considered for points, if claimed, the applicant must document that its percentage of minority, permanent full-time employees is greater than the percentage of minorities within the county or the community, whichever is higher. Applicants with no full-time employees may claim points based on part-time employment provided that they document that the only permanent employment is on a part-time basis. 4. Final Selection. The total points received by a project for all of the selection factors are added, and the project is ranked against all other projects from all applications, regardless of the problem areas in which the projects were rated. The highest ranked projects will be funded to the extent funds are available. Applicants will receive a single grant in the amount of the project or projects applied for which were ranked high enough to be funded. In the case of ties at the funding line, HUD will use the following criteria in order to break ties: _The project receiving the highest program impact rating will be funded; _If tied projects have the same program impact rating, the project having the highest combined score on the needs factors will be funded; _If tied projects have the same program impact ratings and equal needs factor scores, the project having the highest score on the percent of persons in poverty needs factor will be funded; and _If tied projects have the same program impact ratings, equal needs factor scores, and an equal percent of persons in poverty needs factor score, the application having the most outstanding performance in fair housing and equal opportunity will be funded. As soon as possible after the rating and ranking process has been completed, HUD will notify all applicants regarding their rating scores and funding status. Thereafter, applicants may contact HUD to discuss scores or any aspects of the selection process. II. Application and Funding Award Process. A. Obtaining Applications.
