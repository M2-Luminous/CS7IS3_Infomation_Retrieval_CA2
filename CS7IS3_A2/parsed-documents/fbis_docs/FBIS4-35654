The statement said that "the manifestations and aspects of the retreats in the democratic approach include the dissolution of the House of Representatives before the expiration of its constitutional term, the amendment of the election law, arrests, interference in the work of the trade unions, and the dissolution of many municipal councils." The statement said that despite the existence of certain institutions and forms of democratic life, one can see and feel what the statement described as retreats and setbacks which "do not conform to the principle of [Islamic] consultation [shura]." The statement called for reevaluating these practices and adopting means and mechanisms to strengthen what the statement called the democratic shura principle and to prevent all forms of corruption and oppression so that Jordan might enjoy security and stability.
