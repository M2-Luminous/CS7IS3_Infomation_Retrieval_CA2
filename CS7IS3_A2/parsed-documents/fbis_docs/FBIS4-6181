The soldiers were paid $100 daily. These Vietnamese soldiers were used to fight in Cambodia before and some of them even used to be posted in Pailin. They can say some Cambodian words and have dressed up as Khmer Royal Armed Forces troops. They are front line forces. Somehow, in their onslaught on Pailin, 300 of them were killed or wounded in just a few days. Now, the remaining 200 soldiers are stationed at Kaong Kang Monastery and Phnum Yat adjoining Pailin town. Although the Vietnamese soldiers are front line intervention forces, the Pailin battlefield situation has so far caused them to prepare for hasty retreat. These actions are evidence that the two-headed government, communist Vietnamese, and the alliance have used national coffers to wage war. And they have gone so far as to hire the communist Vietnamese troops to destroy the Cambodian nation and people mercilessly. The nation and people are resolved to oppose the two-headed government, which has sold the nation out and destroyed the nation and people, and its masters until genuine peace is restored to Cambodia.
