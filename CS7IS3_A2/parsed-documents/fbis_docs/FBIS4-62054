Invited to take part in it, in addition to the participants of the "Semipalatinsk programme", were scientists from almost 60 research institutes, who have discovered hitherto unknown documents on Soviet nuclear tests, and their opponents. The participation of the latter, according to Valeriy Kiselev, director of the regional Medico-Ecological Problems Research Institute, is most important, because their views will allow the session to see more clearly the weak points of the programme and to further the ongoing investigations. As distinct from previous sessions, the current one will work only in plenum, which will allow it to create new conditions for the inter-disciplinary interaction of various specialists: Physicists, chemists, biologists, physicians and social scientists. Such complex studies are most necessary today. After all, Altay, which was affected by more than 58 nuclear blasts in the period from 1949 to 1990, and also by the first explosion of a thermonuclear bomb in August 1953, was turned into a sort of "human survival testing ground". Only the picture of the 1949 explosion was modelled so far. Much work is yet to be done on the other tests. But the after-effect of Soviet nuclear tests on the Altay population is well known. They are more terrible than those of the Chernobyl disaster, because the local population was exposed not once, but many times over to irradiation with radionuclides with a short period of decay. The session will analyse in detail the incidence of diseases among the territory's population, which was affected by explosions on the Semipalatinsk testing ground. According to Kiselev, the international scientific community expects from the parties to the programme a thorough analysis of the medical after-effects of nuclear tests, because a massive examination of all the people affected by radiation was carried out for the first time in Altay, which has involuntarily become a sort of research laboratory. The session will discuss the results of 1993 scientific works and the main directions of further studies. Moreover, it will be an important landmark in the preparations for an international conference on the "radiation test" programme, which will be held in Altay this September.
