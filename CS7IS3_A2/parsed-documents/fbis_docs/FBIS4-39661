Moroz at the Supreme Council Session on 31 May 1994] [Text] Esteemed deputies. We have completed an extremely difficult and unspectacular portion of deputy functions -- the forming of the Supreme Council's working bodies. They have for the most part been formed and their heads elected. Despite all the hardships that we endured in the recent days we have managed to take a step toward a totally different democratic structuring of the Supreme Council that accounts for the actual multiparty nature of society's political sphere. We have laid the foundation for the Supreme Council's steadiness, which gives hope that deputies will have no time for political feuds. On the one hand, the makeup of the commissions does not allow for deviating toward conflicts. On the other hand, the burden of responsibility for the performance of official duties and the observance of commitments for the electorate will demand accord and compromises at all the stages of the lawmaking process. Of course there is hardly a deputy in the session hall who would like the entire presidium. This is good, for it is a confirmation of the high potential of the session hall, a reserve of this potential. This does not close the road toward the improvement of the council's working bodies. In recent days, after we made a mistake at the beginning, we realized the importance of the procedure. Had we spent three days discussing the regulations, this would have saved us two weeks. I believe that now hardly anyone has doubts regarding the necessity to discuss regulations so that once a quality draft is prepared by the commissions, we pass it approximately within a month, and never resume the tactics of political battles in which there can be no winner. On what should we concentrate our efforts in the near future? I repeat, do not consider this lingering. A wise start is a guarantee of a successful finish. First, we have to complete the manning of commissions soon, as stipulated by the temporary regulations that we passed and the statute of groups and factions. We must select specialists among commission members for the division of functions within the commissions and the forming of their bodies. No one should be afraid of a situation where a commission comprises only one specialist, for you have the right to engage specialists who are not deputies. The main issue is to make good use of their knowledge, patriotic feelings, and healthy ambitions. I think that the Supreme Council leadership will provide the best material and technical conditions. Second, all the commissions should meticulously plan their work and envision in their plans urgent, long-range, and perspective goals. This should be done approximately in a week -- drafts approved in the commissions, and, by means of the secretariat, passed over to one of the legal commissions for generalizing and forming a kind of genealogy of the legislative process, approval by the presidium, the coordinating council, and the session. I believe it appropriate to entrust one of the deputy chairmen with organizing this work and exercising control over it. Third, urgent tasks should be regarded as supplements to the already determined issues and placed on each deputy's desk by next Tuesday's session. A large group of urgent issues is comprised of laws that regulate economic relations. It would take much time to simply enumerate these. We should unblock production and create normal conditions for the functioning of enterprises through taxes, credits, investments, and currency regulations. We must protect the people from further growth of prices, the threat of mass unemployment, the decline in wages, unavailability of goods and transport, impossibility of providing for their own and their children's summer vacations. Complex problems arise with regard to preparation for harvesting and quite soon for the winter as well. However if we turn into a "fire brigade" again, then, despite all attempts to professionally resolve emerging problems, our efficiency will be minimal, because we will face unresolved strategic problems every time. I will take the liberty of reminding you that in accordance with Clause 6 of Article 97 of the Ukrainian Constitution, it lies within our jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of the Ukrainian Supreme Council to determine the principles of state regulation and social development in Ukraine. This is currently our primary and most important task. Only under the condition of this issue's positive resolution can we hope to stimulate the deputies' productive work, clear the existing legislative field, and create a solid footing for stabilizing Ukraine's economy and launching actual reform. Only a complex of well-planned, purposeful, interrelated measures will facilitate a civilized resolution of the most acute problems in our lives -- resume the work of our enterprises, simultaneously stimulating their structural and technological reshaping; put tax and credit policies in order and free entrepreneurs, mediators, and banks from the criminal environment; improve our currency regulations and encourage an increase in the state's export potential; put in order imports; support the creation of a reliable monetary-financial system, without which there can be no market reform of which to speak. Then we will be able to meet all other demands of our electors -- index all their savings (we will have to pass an appropriate law prior to this); provide for people's large-scale participation in privatization; fix low prices for textbooks designated for schools and higher educational institutions, as well as for children's nutrition at kindergartens, summer camps, sanatoria, and schools; and finally, reimburse expenditures on burying the dead. These and a number of other burning social measures must be taken this year. We should expeditiously prepare a legal footing for this. We are going to take these steps not for the sake of populism, not to put a new patch on an old one. We are going to target our reform toward a social orientation, make it inevitable, all-encompassing and able to serve the interests of the people of Ukraine. This goal was set for the people drafting "The Basic Principles of the State Regulation of Ukraine's Economic and Social Development." Several groups of scientists, economists, and managers have intensively worked on this document over the last couple of months. The work is to be completed this week and it would be good if the document could be passed to the Supreme Council next week. Other options should also be discussed. I know how the groups of deputies, represented in this hall, worked; I am more or less familiar with their work, and believe that it is very interesting and useful. We should also hear a report on the results of their work. These results may help coordinate various aspects of understanding certain issues. They may also be regarded as alternative plans. We should submit to indepth analysis the long- range plans regarding the activities of the Cabinet of Ministers. Those plans exist and they are quite interesting. I had a talk with the acting prime minister yesterday; he is ready to submit those proposals (drafted earlier) for discussion by the Supreme Council. It will be logical to form the new government and elect the new prime minister following adoption of this document. However this is not connected with presidential elections and thus, there is neither the need nor the time for a delay. After we have realized and adopted strategic directions that correspond to the Ukrainian people's system of values (given that the people have empowered us to protect their interests), we will choose a prime minister to implement this course, and approve his candidacy here at the session. Through the prism of this strategy we will assess the government's program and our numerous laws -- both the existing ones and those that will be drafted. Such conscious constructive work by the Supreme Council will indubitably produce positive results and will be properly assessed by the people of Ukraine. We, both participants and observers, should quietly respond to all kinds of feuds within the Supreme Council. We should not stray from the painstaking creative work; we will later sort things out among ourselves. The Supreme Council must not be discredited; incidentally, such discredit amounts to paying bad service to President Kravchuk. Those who fail to understand this are actually blocking vital reforms, encouraging the continuation of the looting and selling of our state, the impoverishment of a majority of people and the strengthening of the existing parasitic groups. I am convinced that a majority of deputies will support the proposals regarding the organization of such work in commissions, constituencies, and at plenary sessions. From a perspective of strategic tasks we should consider a number of national programs toward which foreign investors have displayed interest. Supreme Council commissions should acquaint themselves with these programs and determine their role in speeding up the implementation of the latter. Among the entire range of these issues I would single out two groups that warrant special attention. One of them is the coordination of the acting laws to facilitate their normal functioning. For instance, a series of laws on enterprises and entrepreneurship have been distorted by sublaws, norms, and departmental instructions. The same concerns laws on land relationship, lease, privatization, freedom of thought, and especially laws on local administration and the forming of vertical structures in the administrative branch. The budget issue also belongs here and cannot be postponed any further. We are completing the second quarter of 1994 without an approved budget. Fourth, we will not be able to avoid resolving urgent current tasks, which will partially ruin the legislative system. I mean issues like the Crimea, preparations for the elections, and the formation of the Cabinet of Ministers. Thus those are the issues that will have to be discussed simultaneously. Fifth, we should step up control activities of the Supreme Council's working bodies, demanding that the provisions of laws and resolutions be unconditionally observed. I know that this stance is different from that of some deputies. This has been said on television and discussed here in the session hall. However no group of 10 deputies, even comprising the best lawyers, will be able to provide control over the efficiency of certain laws. This can be done solely by all the deputies working in the commissions, and performing a control function to the extent envisioned for the given commission. For special cases we can set up deputies' groups on a different basis. Everybody will then understand that one should not only draft laws but also control their observance. I repeat once again -- this is every commission's business, however, general coordination and analysis of this work should be supervised, I presume, by [Deputy Chairman] Oleksandr Tkachenko. At the initial stage we should analyze how the privatization program, passed by the Supreme Council, was being implemented after its adoption and has been implemented in 1994. This is the basic issue of reform and that is why the general outcome of privatization, in particular the leasing of property, would be interesting to both the Supreme Council, as the owner of national wealth, and to every citizen. We should also receive precise information regarding the use of money acquired through privatization, the privatization of partially constructed facilities (as compared to the general volume of privatization), and determine the state's profits. I believe that discussion of this issue in a month or so would facilitate the specification of the program and the mechanism for such change in ownership relations. The Commission for Deputy Ethics, along with the Administrative Office and the secretariat should help establish the normal work of bodies and individual deputies in Kiev and in the constituencies. Completion of the selection of advisers, the scientific-methodological and material provision of the lawmaking process -- everything should be organized for the deputies to realize that their desire to be absorbed in work meets with both understanding and a responsible attitude on the part of all the services and officials, no matter where the latter are employed. This, undoubtedly, primarily concerns the appropriate services of the Supreme Council, and these will be requested to treat deputies' work in an appropriate manner. You should not consider this dilettantism. We must initiate the collective work of all the Supreme Council structures, wisely task all the deputies, so that everybody, including the state, sees the results of our work. Excuse your opponents' harsh words and claims. Good luck!
