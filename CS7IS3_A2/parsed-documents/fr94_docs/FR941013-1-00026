Postage is for mailing the reregistration application and the registration certificate. 3 Management/Supervisory time is that time spent by management and supervisory personnel in the overall development and maintenance of the registration program, including establishment of program priorities and policy, resource allocation, and administrative direction. The following positions are involved: Deputy Assistant Administrator and Deputy Director of the Office of Diversion Control_.05 work year each_$14,619. Chief and Deputy Chief Chemical Operations Section_.1 work year each_$27,651. Chief, Liaison and Policy Section_.1 work year_$11,853. Chief, Policy Unit_.1 work year_$10,045. Total Costs_$64,168. Because the Management/Supervisory costs are related to the general operation of the registration program, they must be averaged across the entire reregistration applicant populations. For the initial reregistration year, DEA anticipates receiving 3,500 retail and non-retail reregistration applications. The average cost per application would be $18.33. 4Regulatory and policy development time consists of .25 work year of a program analyst time for drafting new/amended regulations and Federal Register notices, issuance of policy statements and directives related to the registration program and responding to registrant queries regarding registration matters. This time is for general chemical registration program purposes and must be spread equally across the reregistration applicant population. The cost of that time, $22,202, divided by 3,500 applicants equals $6.34. 5DEA will conduct follow-up investigations of retail registrants to ensure that they are complying with the chemical control requirements. The investigations will consist of a comprehensive review of each registrant's records, reporting systems and security provisions. Each investigation will require on-site record reviews; transaction follow-ups, including purchaser verification and record checks; travel; and report preparation. Based on present estimates, DEA anticipates that all such investigations combined will require 2 work years of Diversion Investigator time. The total cost for 2 work years of Diversion Investigator time is $166,616, divided by 2,000 retail reregistration applicants equals $83.30.
