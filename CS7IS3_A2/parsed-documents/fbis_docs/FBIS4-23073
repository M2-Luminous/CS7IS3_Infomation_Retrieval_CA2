The sensor is based on a multi-mode lightguide. An accelerometer calibration device was developed and its spec ifications are examined. The dependence of the signal to noise ratio on the frequency is shown. At about 30 Hz, the threshold sensitivity to angular displacement is about 4X10[.sup]-10[/] rad/Hz[.sup]1/2[/] and to acceleration, about 10[.sup]-6[/]g/Hz[.sup]1/2[/]. The design and design improvements are outlined. Figures 4; references 5: 4 Russian, 1 Western.
