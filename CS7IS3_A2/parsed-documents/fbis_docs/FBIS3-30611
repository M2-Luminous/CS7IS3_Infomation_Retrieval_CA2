The parliamentary Social-Democratic Party of Montenegro was the first to voice its opinion in reaction to reports on the alleged mobilization of refugees claiming that "with the blessing from the republic's bodies and the support of military authorities, refugees from the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina are issued call-ups to be mobilized into the army of the republic of Srpska." The issue was also raised at a session of the Montenegrin parliament, held last week, when deputy Savo Jablan asked: "Who is behind the forced mobilization of refugees in Montenegro, and what is its aim?". Stressing that the government of Montenegro has no official reports on the alleged mobilization, Perovic, in charge of that ministry, claims that the UN convention on the status of refugees is honored in Montenegro. "A decree on the care for refugees, passed in July 1992, regulates their position and status, and they are exempt from mobilization," Perovic stressed.
