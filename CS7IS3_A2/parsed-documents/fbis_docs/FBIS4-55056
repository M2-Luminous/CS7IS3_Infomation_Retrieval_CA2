Senate Adopted a Law on Regulation of Salaries"] [Text] On 5 May the Senate adopted a neopopiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] law, with 51 votes in favor, 14 against, and eight abstentions. In the only amendment submitted, the senators made the reservation that the law approved by them is to be in force until the end of the year. The document will go back to the Sejm, which must debate the amendment, and then it will wait for the president's signature. The law can become effective on the first day of the month following the month in which the law is announced. The senators rejected a motion by Senator Zbigniew Romaszewski of "Solidarity" to completely reject the law, and they decided to refuse to accept an amendment submitted by Senator Piotr Andrzejewski which would have limited the law's scope to independent shaping of salaries by all economic units. The law (similar to an earlier governmental document) provides that those enterprises that exceed the allowed salary limit will be penalized by a so-called sanction payment, which will be 1.5 zlotys for each zloty paid out above the norm. The payments will be directed to the state budget, with enterprises which send at least part of their production abroad, being given breaks. The law covers all state-owned and communal enterprises, state-owned banks, and companies where the State Treasury has no less than 80 percent of the shares. On the other hand, popiwek does not cover private enterprises or banks, firms with participation of foreign capital, or cultural institutions and convalescent homes. Based on the law, enterprises will be able to select one of the following four methods of shaping salaries: a managerial contract, an agreement with a local State Treasury Chamber, a limit dependent on the previous year's profit-salary ratio in the enterprise, or salaries determined by a trilateral commission.
