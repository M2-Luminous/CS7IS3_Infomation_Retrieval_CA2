Western analysts regard this as a significant step of assistance on the part of the European Union to the present Ukrainian leadership in implementing economic reforms and as an achievement by Ukrainian diplomacy. The visit to our state by the deputy chairman of the EC Commission, Commissioner for External Economic Issues Sir Leon Britten, has undoubtedly contributed to the successful completion of the debates on the possibilities and the date for signing the document. Aware of his positive attitude toward Ukraine, Ukrainian officials eagerly looked forward to his arrival, as they hoped that concrete problems would be resolved. However, the road toward the signing was not easy, and Britten's negotiations in Kiev were far from simple. The "lightening struck" during his talks with L. Kravchuk, when they started discussing the possibilities of signing, at the highest level, the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union. President Kravchuk expressed a desire to have this procedure over as soon as possible, whereas the EC commissioner hinted that some people in Brussels were linking it with Ukraine immediately joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. After talks with Minister of Foreign Affairs Zlenko, Britten stated that the European Community never linked the two issues and promised to make every effort to reassure those who were putting forward such demands. At the same time, he appealed to the Ukrainian leadership with a request to speed up the process of discussion of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in parliament. The head of the Ukrainian foreign policy department responded to that very sharply and stated that such a turn of events had not been expected and could be taken advantage of by certain political forces. It became clear from what he said that there exists a "third" party, which again wants to put Ukraine in a difficult situation and again create difficulties for it in the international arena. In Zlenko's opinion, it is now important, first of all, to fulfill the Ukrainian-U.S.-Russian tripartite statement on nuclear weapons. It is worth adding that some people in Brussels may have reasoned that the chairman of the EC commission had to sign such a historic document with whoever would be in power in Ukraine in the future. Britten's meeting with Vice Premier Landyk, Minister of the Economy Shpek, and other members of government left more optimistic impressions. They said that President Kravchuk would appeal to the European Community with a letter on granting Ukraine free assistance in food worth 200 million ECU, so that our state could sell some of its own agricultural products for hard currency and use the resulting money for purchasing the means for plant protection. However, one can only hope for any assistance if all the obligations are fulfilled. As is known, Ukraine was to have paid 4.5 million ECU to the European Community by 20 April. This sum is the interest on credit. Unfortunately, not only did our state fail to pay the debt, but did not even notify Brussels when it would pay it. The Ukrainian side accounted for the delay by the difficult situation in the agrarian sector: The sowing campaign has ended and we are ready to repay the debts. In addition to that, Britten stated that, for political reasons, anti-dumping measures against Ukraine cannot be used by any means. The European Community can also offer considerable assistance in building two power units at the Rivne nuclear power station [AES]. For that, Kiev must agree to closing down the Chernobyl AES. The Ukrainian ministers outlined a wide range of issues where our country may need technological and expert assistance and stressed that it is much easier to work with the European Community than, for example, with the IMF. The fourth round of talks on the Accord on Partnership and Cooperation between Ukraine and the European Community was completed very quickly, and then the document was initialed by Zlenko and Britten. It is now essential that, once it is signed at the highest level, the European Union would agree to conclude a so-called provisional accord, which would make it possible, even now, to implement the clauses of the principal document, without waiting for its time-consuming ratification by all 12 members of the body.
