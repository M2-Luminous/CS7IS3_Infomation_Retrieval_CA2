The differences came into the open when Hizballah held a memorial service in the Southern Suburb for the martyrs of the Zionist aggression against Hizballah's camp in 'Ayn Kawkab in al-Biqa' and the program did not include a speech by Fadlallah. It is worth noting that this was the first time in more than 10 years that Fadlallah had attended a function without delivering a speech. A number of Nasrallah's supporters left a ceremony held by the Iranian Embassy on 5 June to mark the anniversary of Imam Khomeyni's death when Fadlallah mounted the rostrum to begin a speech. It should be recalled that Fadlallah and Nasrallah share the loyalty of Hizballah members. But the Hizballah secretary general has been trying for more than a year to "purge" the party's ranks of the supporters of Fadlallah and the former Hizballah secretary general Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli. Within this framework, Nasrallah has been having his supporters distribute a book of remarks about Fadlallah's course. He has also been telling his supporters that Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli is responsible for the clashes that took place between Hizballah and the Amal Movement. [passage omitted] Nasrallah is currently facing problems with many Iranian parties because of the many setbacks Hizballah has suffered since Nasrallah assumed the post of secretary general. These setbacks--which he suffered among the Shi'ah scholars, party members, and the general public--recently forced him to expel more than 250 party members for various reasons.
