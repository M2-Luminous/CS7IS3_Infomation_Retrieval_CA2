FR940318-1-00009 FR940318-1-00004 Since the issuance of that supplemental NPRM, the FAA has determined that certain additional changes to the proposed rule are necessary. General Changes to the Proposal: ``The Comprehensive Approach'' The FAA has reviewed its position on the option that was provided in the previous supplemental NPRM, which would have permitted operators to revise the FAA-approved maintenance program to include procedures to address the problems associated with blue ice. The FAA now considers that an even more comprehensive approach should be taken to address the subject unsafe condition via the FAA-approved maintenance program. This approach should be based upon regular maintenance, training of personnel, use of hardware with proven reliability, and fixed, but less frequent, leak checks incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance program. Paragraph (b) of this supplemental NPRM has been revised to specify the requirements for the maintenance program revision that the FAA has determined are necessary in order to implement this ``comprehensive approach.'' (A more detailed discussion of these proposed requirements is presented later in this preamble.) In lieu of the revising the maintenance program, however, this supplemental NPRM will continue to provide operators with the option of accomplishing the specific leak check procedures on the drain systems. General Changes to the Notice: Extension of Leak Check Intervals The proposed AD would extend the previously-proposed leak check intervals for certain specific valves, provided that a suitable program of maintenance and training of personnel is also implemented. These intervals have been extended based upon data gathered to date regarding the service history of the valve types. The proposed AD would also require that any revisions to (i.e., extension of) the mandated leak check intervals must be approved by the FAA, specifically, by the Manager of the Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO). Requests for such revisions must be accompanied by certain data when submitted to the ACO [through the appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI)] for approval. In this supplemental NPRM, the FAA proposes a ``data collection format'' for these requests. Data submitted in accordance with the proposed format, if favorable to an increase of leak check intervals, will allow the FAA to justify increasing the leak check intervals with assurance that the valves involved have the required reliability. The data provided will also be important in assisting the FAA in making future determinations of appropriate leak check intervals for new valves that have shown promising, but not conclusive, service data. General Changes to the Notice: Flush/Fill Line Problems Certain comments submitted to the Rules Docket in response to the previously issued supplemental NPRM included reference to three incidents of foreign object damage from the forward toilet drain valve and flush/fill line on certain airplanes. The FAA also has received a report of a dent on the right horizontal stabilizer leading edge on a Boeing Model 737 series airplane that was caused by blue ice that had formed from leakage through a flush/fill line. In this case, the flush/fill cap was missing from the line at the forward service panel. The flush/fill line on the Model 737 is similar in design to that on the Model 727; therefore, the potential exists for the same type of incident occurring on the Model 727. Further, in their comments to the Rules Docket, numerous operators stated that leakage from the flush/fill line is a significant source of the type of blue ice problems addressed by this AD action. While there are not many documented cases of blue ice coming from the flush/fill line causing damage to engines, such blue ice is still a hazard to persons and property on the ground and, therefore, constitutes an unsafe condition. In light of this, the FAA has reconsidered its previous statement that flush/fill line leakage would be ``addressed by a separate rulemaking action,'' and is proposing requirements in this supplemental NPRM to install a cap on the flush/fill line and to perform periodic leak checks of the flush/fill line. The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 727&hyph;38&hyph;0021, dated July 30, 1992, that provides instructions for modifying the forward, aft, and executive lavatory drain systems by installing a cap on the flush/fill lines. This modification will prevent blue fluid leakage and subsequent ice accumulation in the executive and aft lavatory service panels, and in the forward lavatory waste system. This supplemental NPRM proposes to require the installation of the flush/fill line cap in accordance with the Boeing service bulletin within 5,000 flight hours. General Changes to the Notice: New Owners' Schedules A new paragraph (e) has been added to this supplemental NPRM to require that, before an operator places an airplane subject to the AD into service, the operator must establish a schedule for accomplishment of the leak checks. This provision is intended to ensure that transferred airplanes are inspected in accordance with the AD on the same basis as if there were continuity in ownership, and that scheduling of the leak checks for each airplane is not delayed or postponed due to a transfer of ownership. Airplanes that have previously been subject to the AD would have to be checked in accordance with either the previous operator's or the new operator's schedule, whichever would result in the earlier accomplishment date for that leak check. Other airplanes would have to be inspected before an operator could begin operating them or in accordance with a schedule approved by the FAA PMI, but within a period not exceeding 200 flight hours.
