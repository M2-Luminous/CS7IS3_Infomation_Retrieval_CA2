He also expressed his optimism over the possibility of overcoming the common import tariff obstacle within Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and the implementation of the integration process among his country, Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay as of 1995. Lacalle attributed the inadequate results of the Uruguay Round of the GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariff) talks to the protectionist measures imposed by Europe, while locally he discarded the representative nature of the Chamber of Industries and the main union central, which is controlled by the left, which have joined forces to criticize and pressure his government. According to the Uruguayan president today's world is quite different from the one that existed when the Uruguay Round was created in Punta del Este in 1986. He said: "Copernican changes had taken place, and the impetus given by Uruguay at the proper time was very important, as there were times of optimism and of development in the most important economies, with the purpose of making trade more sustainable." He added: "Today we are facing a very recessive Europe, which has prevented the Uruguay Round from acting in a more positive manner in the world economy." Lacalle was more optimistic within the South American framework, and said that Mercosur will finally be consolidated. "We have one obstacle left to overcome -- the common import tariff -- and with a little bit of realism we will be able to come to a decision according to the countries' interests. I think we have achieved a lot within Mercosur, and must not forget that we have been working on it for only three years," he said. Lacalle added: "Intrazonal trade has multiplied, and in our country it has been the great shakeup causing many people to start thinking of the future and of investing. I already consider it a success, and hope that when we presidents meet we will be able to make a similar judgment." Concerning reactions against his government by industrial businessmen and union leaders, he said "they startle me," because we have reached the lowest historical level of unemployment and the highest level of investment in the past 20 years. Lacalle said he considers very important "the 15 percent economic growth of the gross domestic product in this stage of government action." He stressed the continuous drop in the unemployment rate, which in 1993 had an average rate of 8.4 percent, the greatest drop since 1981. "Unemployment has been reduced, and therefore if it were not allied to political interests, the union organization PIT-CNT [Interunion Workers Plenum-National Workers Convention] would have been saying that this employment policy is best for workers," he said. He said that "in Spanish terms we would say that a policy that reduces strikes must be praised by the union organizations, but we all know that we are in a somewhat peculiar country, and I have no doubt there are obvious political intentions on the part of the PIT-CNT which do not represent the majority of Uruguayan workers." Concerning the Chamber of Industries, Lacalle said that it does "represent some industries, because I know other businessmen who tell us that the sooner we accelerate the opening process the better." The Uruguayan president added: "I therefore see that in the exercise of liberty which is so valuable for us, we have opinions which I do not believe to be the exact expression of the large sectors which they are said to represent." "The results of the last 45 months are emerging in a positive light, because what we had seen before from the government is now being seen by the people as part of a consistent, clear, and stable economic policy," he said. Lacalle insisted that his government practices "social liberalism" despite its policies being characterized as "neoliberal," which is traditionally understood as "opposite or at least contradictory to social-oriented policies." "However, the arrangement of finances and of the deficit, the foreign debt renegotiation, and fiscal prudence have gone hand to hand with a doubling in budget resources assigned to education and health," he said. He added that despite having a minority in Congress, and having organized a plebiscite against the partial privatization of state companies, his policy "has brought, to the extent possible, a considerable improvement in public finances and administration." "Taking into consideration all these problems, the results appear to be much brighter because they are obtained in the midst of great difficulties," he said. Lacalle expects that 1994 "will not be a year off because it is an electoral year, as three months are more than enough for an electoral campaign." According to the president the executive branch will send to Congress important initiatives, and he expects their approval "in a year which has no reason to be unproductive."
