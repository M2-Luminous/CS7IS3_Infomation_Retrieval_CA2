Sulima; UDC 621.397.13:629.783] [Abstract] A rotation mechanism with two rotation axes is normally required for rearranging the pattern of satellite TV antennas which would provide independent setting of azimuth and the axis' angle. Thus, the antenna can be directed in two stages to the selected satellite using its angular coordinates. However, the construction of the directing mechanism can be simplified, if the limits of the receiving antenna pattern are taken into account. Methods are described in this paper for computing accurate angular coordinates of optimal rotation axis of a single-rotation satellite communication receiving antenna, and the estimates are made of the maximum angular error in directing such antenna at specified locations, and coordinates of the satellite range of longitudes.
