[passage omitted] BKA President Zachert stressed his agreement with the minister on plans for an organizational reform of the BKA. Many measures, which are now to be implemented, had been discussed long before the operation. Kanther cited the reduction to nine departments, the merging of the departments for left-wing and right-wing terrorism in the BKA branch in Meckenheim (near Bonn), and a more intensive delegation of the president's international obligations to subordinate officials. [passage omitted] Nehm rejected reports that liaison man Klaus Steinmetz, who was uncovered during the operation, was a member of the RAF command structure [see previous Terrorism Report]. His authority had a corresponding note from the BKA, but the suspicion had proved to be incorrect during subsequent investigations, the chief federal prosecutor said. The questions that had been raised have been "answered in such a way that no criminal accusations against Steinmetz were made."
