After new information was given by the Saharan side with regard to the travel by thousands of Moroccan citizens to the Saharan territory, the UN mission in charge of organizing the referendum in Western Sahara denied this information. Over to you Abdelkader Cherti, [Abdelkeder] In a statement delivered to APS yesterday, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro [Polisario] affirmed the arrival by bus in recent days of thousands of Moroccan citizens in Laayoune and Bojador to participate in the voter identification, which started in Western Sahara under UN supervision before the organization of the referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara. The Polisario Front said that the operation is considered a blatant violation of the UN peace plan in Western Sahara and the aim behind it is to undermine the referendum and spoil the atmosphere in which the UN committee for voter identification works. In view of these developments, the Polisario Front called on UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the UN Security Council to take the necessary measures to guarantee the smooth operation of voter identification in an atmosphere of freedom and strictness. In contrast with the contents of the Polisario Front's statement, the UN committee in charge of implementing the referendum in Western Sahara denied yesterday evening the information contained in the Saharan statement and stressed that they did not notice buses loaded with Moroccan citizens, and, according to their statement, they did not receive any information to this effect.
