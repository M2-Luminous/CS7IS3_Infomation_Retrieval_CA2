FBIS4-30354 "dreas123_a_94032" FBIS-EAS-94-123 Daily Report 27 June 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Ichikawa on Resignation, Political Situation Ichikawa on Resignation, Political Situation OW2606195094 OW2606195094 BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese in its "Sunday Discussion" (Nichiyo Toron) program at 0025 GMT on 26 June begins broadcasting a 21-minute live interview with Komeito (Clean Government Party) Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa on Prime Minister Hata's resignation announcement, formation of a coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), and the future political situation. The program is moderated by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto at the NHK studio in Tokyo. Participating in the interview is commentator Naoki Tanaka. Yamamoto begins the interview by asking Ichikawa: "You said that the coalition will step down (geya). Do you mean to say that Komeito will become an opposition power without trying to come back into power?" Ichikawa responses by explaining: "If there were only two major parties, or if it were a bipolar political world, then what I said would really mean that we will step down from power. However, the current political world is made up of three major political powers. It is tripolar politics. Therefore, what I meant by stepping down (geya) is that we have no intention of actively calling on other party members to form a new government or try to unify the 180 people who were members of the ruling parties to form some kind of political power." He reiterates that Prime Minister Hata made the decision for the cabinet to resign and to see what the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the SDPJ will do to deal with the political situation. He rules out the possibility of holding policy meetings with the SDPJ to form a new coalition. He says his party will become an opposition party if the LDP and the SDPJ join hands to become a political power. Tanaka also asks Ichikawa if his party really has no intention of remaining in power. Ichikawa answers: "We will not remain in the government by being power-mad." He adds that his party will cooperate with other parties or groups -- who share the same basic policies as Komeito, want to legislate political reform bills, and support the idea of not dissolving the lower house under the current system. Ichikawa then explains the policy differences on various issues, including the consumption tax, between his party and the SDPJ. Asked whether an agreement will be reached on tax reform at a policy meeting with the SDPJ, if they are resumed, Ichikawa says that the SDPJ flatly rejected our compromise proposals. When asked if he thinks the current tripolar politics will change in the future, Ichikawa replies: "One reorganization of the political world will not be enough. I think reorganization of the political world will take place several times." "After all, I do not think there will be a stable government unless we form a majority group by surpassing the barriers of the party framework and joining hands with other groups whose policies are same as ours." Going back to the tax issue, which was the major obstacle in coalition-SDPJ negotiations on the SDPJ's return to the coalition, Tanaka says there was no need to insist on setting a deadline for tax reform. Ichikawa explains the reason the coalition and the SDPJ, when they held negotiations before the prime minister's resignation announcement, needed to reach agreement on the details of tax reform before September. He says that the tax issue will be shelved for a long time if no deadline is set, because lawmakers do not want to talk about raising taxes before elections. Asked if he thinks the LDP and the SDPJ will agree to cooperate with each other in winning power, Ichikawa answers: "They have a big policy gap. The gap between the SDPJ and the LDP is larger than the gap between us and the SDPJ. Also, I doubt that supporters of the LDP and the SDPJ will approve of the formation of a coalition between the two parties."
