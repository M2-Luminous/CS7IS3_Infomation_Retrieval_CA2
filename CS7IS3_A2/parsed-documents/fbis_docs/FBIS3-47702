In the spirit of promoting a prompt process, I ask your permission to inform you of the following: 1. In the message dated 8 January 1994, you wrote that you support the five-point initative of his majesty the king and that all five points should be simultaneously implemented. However, the other side has not yet accepted his majesty the king's five-point guideline. A. The Phnom Penh faction continues to demand that the party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] fulfill its three preconditions first, which are cease-fire, surrender of the liberated zones, and dissolution of the army. Moreover, they have demanded that the PDK be integrated into their military and civilian structures which, basically, are the communist Vietnamese structures set up since 1979. B. Their so-called need for constitutional amendments is merely a deception, and it means that they have already imposed a condition on the negotiations. C. On the battlefields themselves, they have launched large-scale offensives in an attempt to crush the forces of Democratic Kampuchea [DK] and block genuine national reconciliation and they have talked about nothing but fight, fight, and fight. Such actions cannot promote genuine national reconciliation because they are not a genuine rallying of national forces but an attempt to force the PDK into the cage that the communist Vietnamese have prepared since they first invaded Cambodia and to make the PDK commit suicide. I would like to take this opportunity to inform your highness that the PDK is supporting the five-point guideline of high majesty the king not to get this or that position for its own benefit within the government or in this or that ministry. The truth is that the serious situation facing our nation and people at the present calls for all national forces, including DK, to take part in solving it by playing a role in the government and in an army that truly belongs to the nation known as the Khmer Royal Armed Forces. The five-point initiative of his majesty the king stems from his wisdom, sagacity, and years of political experience, and he clearly understands that the situation requires that there be a solution not just by giving this or that position to this or that personality without according him any possibilities or rights to contribute to solving the nation and people's serious problems. 2. Concerning the technical group, I would like to propose that under the current circumstances it is desirable to allow the technical group to function as soon as possible without giving it any name, just as your highness graciously proposed to me on 17 December 1993, and with the participation of a representative of the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party. This is not just for form's sake. It also bears a political significance. If the technical group functions according to any formulas other than that described on 17 December 1993, even if it uses his majesty the king's five-point initiative as the basis for discussions, the spirit and the wishes of his majesty the king would not be fulfilled. Only by proceeding in the manner agreed upon between your highnness and I on 17 December 1993 can we meet and discuss ways to bring about early and lasting peace. 3. I sincerely inform your highness of the above because the desire and wishes of the PDK and myself are to see your highness and the FUNCINPEC party, along with other national resistance forces, enjoy full capacity and right to perform the work in accordance with your patriotic ideal. The overwhelming majority of our nation and people who gave their votes to your highness and the FUNCINPEC party also have these same desire and wishes. Very humbly yours. [Dated] 15 January 1994 [Signed] Khieu Samphan, president of the PDK
