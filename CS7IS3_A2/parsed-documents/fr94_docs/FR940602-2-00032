ACTION: Notice of Proposed Settlement; Request for Public Comment. SUMMARY: In accordance with section 113(g) of the Clean Air Act (``Act''), notice is hereby given of a proposed settlement of Alabama Power Company, et al., v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, No. 93&hyph;1611 (D.C. Cir.), and a proposed partial settlement of Environmental Defense Fund v. Carol M. Browner, et al., No. 93&hyph;1203 (and consolidated cases) (D.C. Cir.). The first case involves a challenge to a statement set forth by EPA in the preamble of a proposed EPA action published in the Federal Register on July 16, 1933, entitled ``Acid Rain Program: Notice of Draft Permits and Public Comment Period.'' 58 FR 38370 (July 16, 1993). The second case involves challenges by several parties to the acid rain core rules published in the Federal Register on January 11, 1993, at 58 FR 3590 (January 11, 1993). The proposed settlement related principally to the substitution and reduced utilization provisions of the January 11, 1993 rules. For a period of thirty (30) days following the date of publication of this notice, the Agency will receive written comments relating to the settlements from persons who were not named as parties to the litigation in question. EPA or the Department of Justice may withhold or withdraw consent to the proposed settlement if the comments disclose facts or circumstances that indicate that such consent is inappropriate, improper, inadequate, or inconsistent with the requirements of the Act. Copies of the settlement are available from Phyllis Cochran, Air and Radiation Division (2344), Office of General Counsel, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 260&hyph;7606. Written comments should be sent to Patricia A. Embrey at the above address and must be submitted on or before July 5, 1994. Dated: May 23, 1994. Jean C. Nelson, General Counsel.
