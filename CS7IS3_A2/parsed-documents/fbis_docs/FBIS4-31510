However, the main characteristic of the Romanian people's attitude is great anemia rather than revolt or the wish to bring about change. As a matter of fact, the Iliescu group has worked in such a way as to bring us to a state of despair that makes us see nothing before our eyes but the fierce struggle for survival. Very few people think about an alternative. Thus, the opposition has to offer us one. First of all, the opposition must convince us that this poor nation is really in need of an alternative. However, it seems that the opposition has not been very convincing. Without minimizing the force of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front), one should still stress that the central pillar of the opposition is the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR]. Its moves lead or decide on matters of the strategy of the opposition in the political game. The latest developments of the CDR should be examined from this angle. Nobody contests the fact that the most incisive member of the CDR is the Liberal Party-1993 [PL-93]. Many have even accused this party of being extravagant. If one examines the issue correctly and carefully, it becomes clear that the extravagance of the PL-93 is in reality well calculated. The debate on and endorsement of the law on the 1994 budget seemed to face a serious struggle. A heated atmosphere prevailed at the opening session of the joint meeting of the two chambers of Parliament. The PL-93 called for legal action against Prime Minister Vacaroiu and Finance Minister Florin Georgescu. In spite of the fact that the request of the PL-93 was very surprising, the arguments showed common sense and were indeed well- founded. Again, the fire lasted only for one day. The majority of parliament representatives succeeded in eliminating from the agenda the discussions on the issues proposed by the PL-93. However, the CDR members, in their addresses, permanently incriminated the prime minister and finance minister. But again, nothing happened. Even the members of the PL-93 abandoned the attempt. The fact that not much was achieved does not matter. However, it would have been an intelligent move against the Iliescu group. Through the echo of such a move, people would have realized that they are ruled by an incompetent government. Many people asked why the liberals gave up so easily. We do not believe that the reason was the CDR's inconsistency, its weakness, or its lack of dexterity in the political game. But the CDR did not wish to be accused of blocking in any way the proceedings of Parliament. In any event, although the result would have been the same, the CDR would have gained a lot in the political struggle. Coposu's declaration to the effect that the PNTCD will fight for a change of the Constitution and the reestablishment of monarchy came as an explosion. It has been proved and we believe it, that, at least for a long period of time, the constitutional monarchy is the best solution for Romania. However, unfortunately the majority of the population has not understood this. We are convinced that Mr. Coposu made this statement out of the wish to honestly communicate the intention of the PNTCD if it comes to power. There is no question about the fact that Mr. Coposu is the symbol of a righteous person. We are not convinced, however, that this was the right moment for such a declaration. How many of those who changed their option and started moving toward the CDR were bothered by this declaration? Many people were expecting a dispute to break out between the parties included in the CDR after the PNTCD leader declared its intentions. However, he explained that he had made the statement on behalf of the party. We admire Mr. Coposu's frankness, but repercussions for the CDR might still emerge in the Romanian political system. Out of too much honesty, one can lose the political ability. Let us not forget that while the Iliescu group promised changes, it is frantically working for restoration. It was a fat lie, but still, the Iliescu group is doing fine. Even with Mr. Vacaroiu....
