An official spokesman said by telephone from the Yemeni capital Sanaa that there was "nothing new" in the seven-point plan put forward in Aden by the southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP). He said that "the legitimate leadership in Sanaa demands the surrender of the war criminal" ousted vice-president 'Ali Salim al- Bid, who heads the YSP. They also wanted the surrender of "all the others responsible for the war, so that they can be judged for war crimes." The plan put forward Friday by the YSP called for an "immediate end to the war" and the creation of a government of national unity. The government would be charged with "wiping out the consequences of the war" and conducting an inquiry into "those responsible for the war," a source said in the southern stronghold of Aden.
