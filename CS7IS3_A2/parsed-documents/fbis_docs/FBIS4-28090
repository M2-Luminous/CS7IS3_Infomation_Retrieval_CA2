The OECD, which on Tuesday began a two-day ministerial conference in Paris, suggested in the statement that countries whose economies are not recovering from recession should adopt further financial easing and fiscal measures. "There certainly are such phrases (urging the measures) here and there. However, I don't think the wording means that they want Japan to specifically make additional efforts in its policies," Kumagai said.
