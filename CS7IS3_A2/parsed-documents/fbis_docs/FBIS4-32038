Deputy Prime Minister Borislav Skegro, in his department of economy, has to deal with most of those problems at present. Furthermore, his portfolio covers the constantly red- hot field of the transformation and privatization of social enterprises. [Mlinarevic] Mr. Skegro, would you comment on the Constitutional Court's decision that present salaries in the field of medical services are unconstitutional? Did that create a precedent or could similar decisions meet the same fate? [Skegro] I would not comment on the decision passed by the Constitutional Court. The court is an independent institution. I can, therefore, not predict the outcome of other cases either. [Mlinarevic] The health minister's warning that overruling the decision would undermine the basis of the stabilization program is an important phenomenon. [Skegro] Minister Hebrang has warned of resistance regarding the program, which we emphasize on a daily basis. His resignation shows his moral attitude. The resignation he submitted to Prime Minister Valentic does not necessarily have to be accepted. [Mlinarevic] While the government is waiting for deputies to take their seats, many say it has got unnecessarily involved in the Split case of "Banovina." Why has the government become so involved over the purpose of one building? [Skegro] I do not think it got involved at all, and that this is an insignificant problem, especially for Dalmatia. The Banovina building is the property of the state and the government must intervene in this and all similar cases. [Mlinarevic] You have successfully completed the last round of negotiations with trade unions about the pay deal. The latest rift in the biggest trade union head office may bring new negotiators. Could you comment on that? [Skegro] I would not comment on the events on the trade-union scene. Do you want me to come into conflict with trade unions, now that we managed to get used to being partners? But, seriously, the trade union turmoil is their internal problem. Government negotiators do not care who is the authorized negotiator of the other side. [Mlinarevic] Some say Mr. Lesar is a weaker negotiator than say Boris Kunst, who announced a new and stronger trade union gathering. [Skegro] I do not want to characterize negotiators, but in the present circumstances and considering our obligations toward international financial institutions, the government cannot, even if it wanted, be generous regarding trade union demands, which are often justified. [Mlinarevic] Trade union members say that, in the latest talks, they managed to "draw in" a large number of firms from the circle of those that do not submit to pay limitations. Have you really plant bait for the trade-unions of "51 percent of registered shares" in the agreement? [Skegro] Can you imagine that something like that is possible? Everybody has their own tactics in negotiations. Anyway, we do not fear salaries will explode in firms with more than 51 percent of registered shares. New privatization bills -- and we have been discussing them for a while -- propose that the dividend be paid on the entire package of shares, meaning also on the registered, partly-paid shares. Small shareholders will then have to consider which pays best. Before they give themselves a raise, they will calculate which pays better. If they opt for better salaries, they will reduce the dividend, although they should wait. And it does not take much calculation to figure out that income tax is much higher than profit tax. I do not think we will have to persuade shareholders that those figures are correct. [Mlinarevic] The arrival of "fresh" money in Croatia is imminent. Moreover, the minister of finances has set a definite date for the first round of the foreign loan to come to Croatia very soon. How will the money be "spent"? [Skegro] It was announced that the first loan from the World Bank of $128 million should be given the green light on 23 June, in addition to other loans that make up the sum of about $500 million, and this will not be "consumed," even if we wanted that. Those are strictly special-purpose funds that will be used for rebuilding and building places that were destroyed in the war, as well as for the construction of the infrastructure; roads, the electric-power industry, water management, and agriculture. There can be no improvisation regarding that, for the world institution will have full control at all times, from insight into the dynamics of work to payments for every rebuilt house, for example. [Mlinarevic] As deputy prime minister, you also function as the president of the Board of Management of the Croatian Privatization Fund. How do you account for contradictory views on the efficiency of the transformation process in Croatia, ranging from very positive to statements that the privatization model is a failure? [Skegro] Easily. As the deputy prime minister who is also directly in charge of that area, I am expected to give a favorable judgment. I would, therefore, not like to pass judgment on the past privatization period or measures we introduced from that position. I think that the judgment of an independent institution is most objective and it was presented to our public. There are weaknesses during the aftermath of the transition process in all countries -- and Croatia is no exception -- but IMF and World Bank experts say this process in Croatia is very good. Anyhow, all further relations with Croatia are tied to the results of privatization. They see great progress and their objections refer to public state enterprises that have not been privatized yet. I am personally very pleased with the pace of introducing new ownership relations in firms, and the job of privatization and restructuring the economy is a painstaking and long process, even without war. [Mlinarevic] So, you say that to say that there is social injustice in the transformation, which has also been compared with the South-American syndrome -- the rapid impoverishment of the masses and the rapid acquisition of wealth by a few -- is unfounded [Skegro] I do not want to list the arguments that prove that those statements are false. Let me refer once again to the evaluation by the international institutions, and they probably know the circumstances in South America much better than some of our economists. [Mlinarevic] Recently, several foreign companies have purchased shares in Croatian firms. Are foreign investors now more interested in Croatian firms? [Skegro] Of course. The climate for investment has improved significantly, now we have several prominent international companies in Croatia; "Ericsson" will soon sign a contract to purchase the shares of "Nikola Tesla," Belgian "Interbrew" is here, German "Messer" and some others. Furthermore, the success with swap arrangements, selling shares for "old foreign-currency savings" [that were lost as a result of the disintegration of Yugoslavia] on the Zagreb Stock Exchange, is evidence enough of the progress of privatization. [Mlinarevic] Still, the state is reluctant to relinquish its property. [Skegro] I would not say it is reluctant or that it does not want to do that. However, we cannot rush into selling off firms just to get privatization off our backs. For example, can we do that with hotels for which there is a lot of interest in a situation like this? Are we to sell hotels cheaply just because the roads leading to them are destroyed at present? Furthermore, I do not think it is wise to sell firms that are making a profit in these circumstances as well. The state needs some of them. However, private property must prevail. [Mlinarevic] Sessions of the Managing Board of the Privatization Fund have recently been opened for the press to see how decisions on selling firms are passed. On several occasions, you emphasized that this makes your work much easier. [Skegro] Decisions about purchases and sales, and which also concern the destiny of firms and people employed there, are neither simple nor easy to reach. We must often consider elements that require sane judgment from different angles. It would be easier if money was the only element to be considered. Discussions, people advocating different things, the way of voting, that is all available to the press, it is all transparent, and that makes it easier for us to work, knowing that there can be no additional interpretations, which is a frequent phenomenon in everything that happens in the process of transformation. [Mlinarevic] Journalist had the opportunity to notice that all members the Managing Board of the Privatization Fund meet very rarely, and their meetings most often barely have a quorum or are inquorate, as the last one was. How will you tackle this extensive agenda? [Skegro] It will be difficult. It is obvious that the Managing Board is turning into a bottleneck of a kind. Composed of deputies, ministers of some key departments, and trade-union representatives who are burdened by other obligations, often away on business, the board is essentially a hindrance. Firms are waiting for decisions and this delay is impossible and costly for several reasons. [Mlinarevic] Meetings of the Board, which are few and far between, have prompted you to consider professionalizing that body. [Skegro] That should also be considered. Whether to have a fully professional, competent team that will be directly responsible to the government and parliament for each decision it makes or something similar to that effect. I think new privatization laws will introduce some new details into the work of the Managing Board. [Mlinarevic] Will that also refer to the lower level, to managing boards in firms? [Skegro] Managing boards in firms are not that much of a problem, although they will also be "checked." The more efficient the managing boards and the privatization, the fewer firms will have to be run by the state. [Mlinarevic] New privatization laws were announced some time ago. From what was available to the public, we can deduce that the emphasis is on small shareholders. [Skegro] That is correct. Very soon, the government will put together a new bill to be put before parliament. We are aware that the present pace of payment of share installments is very difficult for small shareholders without great sacrifice, although we did make some concessions at the beginning of the second year of payment. We will, therefore, considerably prolong the period of payment by installments and it will be longer than the present period of five years. Furthermore, we will also give a considerable discount for payment in full. After disabled veterans and the families of dead soldiers, the second category of citizens will follow -- refugees who will be given shares. [Mlinarevic] Will this enable the reaching of a social consensus of all classes, because some say the state cares only about the chosen "critical mass" of shareholders? [Skegro] I think the state should care about the small shareholders who trusted their firms, who, after all, accepted the risk of shareholding. However, all other categories will sooner or later be taken care of. But, everybody cannot be given an equal number of shares, nor do they deserve that. [Mlinarevic] According to the first version, it is planned that the refugees are to get about 20,000 Croatian kuna worth of shares. Is that a modest amount? [Skegro] Even children, minors, will have the right to get shares, so it will not be that insignificant in one family. However, it is more important which shares to distribute, and how to secure high-quality, profit-yielding shares that can be sold at a price not lower than nominal, instead of just "paper." [Mlinarevic] You attempted to solve the problem -- with regard to disabled veterans -- by founding the HDF [Croatian Patriotic Fund]. You got involved personally, but as we see, the HDF is not functioning as it should. [Skegro] Yes, I personally supported the HDF project as the first investment fund, the forerunner of others to come, however, we encountered problems on two levels. Firstly, the lack of experts who would lead such a fund. We simply do not have people educated for that and this will continue to be a problem. On the other hand, disabled veterans demanded -- and no one can or wants to deny them that right -- that they chose the shares themselves and manage them independently, keeping them or selling them on the market, instead of keeping them at the HDF with a guaranteed dividend. Therefore, the Managing Board of the Fund has recently decided to share out, from its own portfolio, all shares of the Zagreb Tobacco Factory, which are in great demand among disabled veterans. [Mlinarevic] Investment funds, as a part of the further privatization strategy, have been announced, but also forgotten, it seems. Is the HDF one of the reasons? [Skegro] They were not forgotten. We have been encountering the same problems: Who will lead those funds? We are preparing the establishment of the largest investment fund, the Fund for Rebuilding, whose beneficiaries will be those who suffered most in the war. This could be a possibility for the refugees, but, having learnt from the experience with disabled veterans, we do not know how the refugees will want to realize their right to shares. Furthermore, there is the Pension Fund and a couple of other funds. [Mlinarevic] On the other hand, the distribution of shares -- and the Zagreb Tobacco Factory is a case in point -- could quietly lead to a take-over of factory by foreign companies, and the state is protecting the tobacco shares precisely from that. [Skegro] In the ownership structure that will, in time, develop in the Zagreb Tobacco Factory, once the shares are distributed -- and there will be a large number of small shareholders -- take-overs will not occur unforeseen. But you can rest assured that we created protection mechanisms in the firm itself, and the state has its own way of influencing the course of privatization of the firm. There will be no major take-overs, especially after the experience of some eastern countries, where tobacco factories were bought just because of the market and then closed. [Box, p 9] The Right Time Is Yet to Come [Mlinarevic] You also advocate the distribution of shares. If they are being shared out as late as now, was the pace and the time for the distribution not more important than the principle of distribution itself? [Skegro] That is correct. I think that the time for mass privatization was determined well in Croatia. What would happen if we had such a strategy at the beginning of transformation? An abundance of vouchers in a country at war! I claim that would be lethal; who, today, could know who owes shares? A "hostile take- over" of our firms, as an economic term, would probably also happen literally. Naturally, we are counting on the distribution of shares in transition. Disabled veterans were first in line, and we will also cover other categories of the population. [Box, p 9] Bankruptcy [Mlinarevic] In spite of the good results of the stabilization program, the latest data show many insolvencies among firms. How do you explain that? [Skegro] It is very simple. Insolvency, just that part concentrated in two or three branches of economy, is the result of the chronic nonsettlement of debts between firms that surface powerfully at a time of zero-inflation. [Mlinarevic] Still, regarding that, the question of bankruptcy has again become topical. One gets the impression that there are no bankruptcies, for they are a matter of political decision. [Skegro] There are no bankruptcies of large firms like there were three years ago. Not that many and with such consequences. However, it is not true that bankruptcy is a matter of political decision, nor that politics controls it and artificially inhibits it. Anyhow, bankruptcy is an everyday occurrence, our data show that. Indeed, they are not very stormy, which is good, they do not include a large number of employees at one place. There are no big changes, but that does not mean there are no bankruptcies as a normal phenomenon in the market economy. However, there will be large-scale bankruptcies, but we must take them as a process of healing the economy that will be accompanied by a strengthened social program.
