In the 15 municipalities, the provincial commission of the SUVP will inspect marketplaces, supermarkets, hospitals, childcare centers, food warehouses, cold storage centers, and factories to learn how theft and embezzlement are being fought in those centers. Giron-94 will be held in Havana throughout the week and includes energetic actions against clandestine restaurants, whorehouses [candongas], and those who rent cars to foreigners around tourist facilities, among other illegal activities.
