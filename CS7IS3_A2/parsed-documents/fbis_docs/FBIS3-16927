Future of Economic Reform Is Very Hazy"] [Text] The week of the president's absence on vacation has seen the return to use in Russia of a word that is politically not in the first flush of youth, a word well and truly worn with futile overuse -- "accord." Boris Yeltsin put it into circulation by organizing the formulation of the Memorandum on Civil Accord. But accord between and with whom? If it is accord between Russian citizens (why else should it be called "civil" accord?), the bulk of these citizens do not seem overly worried about putting up barricades. There are no signs of any intense emotion anywhere, no apparent upheaval -- which does credit to not only the people's tremendous long-suffering but also their common sense. We are of course talking about accord among political forces. As predicted, the opposing parties and movements have their own ideas of this accord and their own means of achieving it. While a working group comprising representatives of the presidential administration, the government, the Moscow Patriarchate, the leadership of the State Duma, the Federation Council, and the Constitutional Court is preparing a draft memorandum, opposition leaders have already presented theirs. And they have founded without lengthy disputes the "Accord for Russia" movement, which observers have viewed as the opening of a second National Salvation Front. Rutskoy, Lukyanov, Prokhanov, Zyuganov, Zorkin, Chikin, Tuleyev, Baburin, and Govorukhin (the declaration carries 14 signatures in all) are proposing a "social contract among all patriotic forces and movements that deny violence, racism, and nationalism." This retaliatory "peace initiative" is reminiscent of a counterclaim. The Communists and the patriots are prepared to seek accord solely on their own political territory, as Gennadiy Zyuganov said with party-minded bluntness at the 15 March Communist Party of the Russian Federation Central Executive Committee plenum: "During the voting in the Duma in favor of the Memorandum of Accord the Communist faction also came up with further conditions that are essential for national reconciliation." Namely, a change in the socioeconomic course, a socialist path of development, the restoration of the union state, etc. Opposition leaders are hardly giving way to illusions: No accord other than accord between Prokhanov and Zyuganov, Rutskoy and Lukyanov, Baburin and Govorukhin can be secured on these terms. However, it is easy to ensure that the party economic nomenklatura returns to power at local level on these terms, as the provincial election campaign reminded us this week. The idea of electing the president not by national ballot but by a kind of new Zemskiy Sobor [ancient council of nobles] comprising members of the Federation Council and representatives of the territories can be developed on these terms -- an idea that has been abandoned like a trial balloon. In these areas the president's opponents have been extremely successful over the last few days and have effectively encountered no resistance from the president's supporters. The four-day Duma discussion of the president's message also provided a reminder of the agglomerations and obstacles in the way of political accord. Finally, after two meetings, the conciliation commission comprising members of various factions and deputies' groups formulated a document which has won the approval of a Duma majority. Deputies in the Federation Council were meanwhile fighting an exhausting campaign for their powers, saying that they alone had the right to dismiss the general prosecutor and not the president -- and there were no signs of accord with the latter here. Last, there was also a street gathering of dissenters -- a 17 March rally on Moscow's Theater Square organized by the National Salvation Front and the "Revival" and "Working Moscow" movements to mark the third anniversary of the all-Union referendum on the future of the USSR. However, virtually everything that happened in the parliamentary chambers, on the square, everywhere that saw political rallies this week was accompanied by calls for civil peace. The political result of the past week must be deemed to be the appreciable consolidation of antireform forces rejecting broad civil accord or prepared to secure it only on their own terms, which they know to be unacceptable to democratic parties and movements. The latter's equally obvious passivity at this time is enabling "Accord for Russia" to form an organization that can pool its efforts in the fight for power.
