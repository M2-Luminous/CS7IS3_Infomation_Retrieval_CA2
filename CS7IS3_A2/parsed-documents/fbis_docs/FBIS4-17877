According to him, "everything is going well at the moment" and Kazakhstan's representatives will obviously continue to take part in the work of the joint delegation, since some work on the demarcation of the border still lies ahead. Russia, the diplomat said, has "absolutely no problems" on the 55 kilometer western section of its border with China.
