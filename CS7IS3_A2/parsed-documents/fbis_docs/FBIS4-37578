According to this source, in the meeting the two men held yesterday Peres asserted that Rabin had largely blocked the Syrian channel to him. Peres told the prime minister that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher had called off his visit to the region because he reached the conclusion that there had been no progress in the Syrian channel and that a mission under such circumstances would be doomed to failure. Peres stressed to Rabin that he could promote the negotiations and complete them within a few months. Following these assertions, Rabin notified Peres of his decision to place him in charge of the negotiations with Syria. This decision paved the way to settling their dispute, and shortly afterward Peres informed the media that the gathering of his supporters had been canceled. Peres said that he and Rabin were jointly steering the entire peace process, including the Syrian channel, and denied that he had voiced any complaints on the issue to Rabin. Nevertheless, a senior source associated with Peres confirmed that Rabin appointed the foreign minister to head the talks with Syria. However, the source noted, Rabin's move was not related to Peres' decision to call off the gathering of his supporters. The conversation held by Rabin and Peres, some of which was attended by Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili, allayed the turmoil in the Labor Knesset faction. The meeting of the faction yesterday afternoon was very relaxed, and none of the participants attacked the prime minister and criticized what has been happening in the party. The brief session ended after the faction endorsed Knesset Member Eli Goldschmidt's proposal to put off a debate on postponing the implementation or abrogating the law on the direct election of the prime minister to a later date, until the situation in the party calmed down.
