According to one of its members, Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Committee for CIS Affairs and Relations With Compatriots, the delegation "went practically everywhere and met practically everyone." "Certain obvious conclusions" of the group were offered the Duma at the end of the past week, in the form, specifically, of a draft federal law on a suspension of Russia's participation in the sanctions against the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. "We consider it essential that the Duma address to the parliaments and peoples of the world a message reflecting its idea of how the Yugoslav conflict should be settled," Konstantin Zatulin shared his conclusions. "First, an immediate cease-fire, without any conditions. The second idea is an appeal to parliaments that they not add fuel to the fire. Finally, the third initiative concerns a conference with the participation of the great powers and the Balkan countries, which would discuss, in particular, the prospects of a lifting of sanctions in respect to the new Yugoslavia." [Sharyy] This initiative is, obviously, the main conclusion that the group of Russian deputies reached in the course of their trip? [Zatulin] Yes, and it is reflected in the documents of the State Duma: that it be recommended that the president, the government, and the Foreign Ministry adopt vigorous measures within the UN framework for a repeal of sanctions. I would like to explain why Carthage, which is to be destroyed, is in this case to be restored. Sanctions are pernicious and ineffective. However paradoxical, they have united the Serb people now living on the territory of various states. Militarily, the prohibitory measures do not play a big part: The armed might of the Serbs is great enough. But when it is a question of the position of the civilian population, the prospect of social conflicts.... Here, yes, sanctions are simply strangling Yugoslavia. The immorality of an attempt to bring an entire people to the brink of extinction is obvious. That Russia formerly adopted the decision to participate in the sanctions is a cause of constant internal political friction. We were in too much of a hurry, disregarding the country's national interests, and all of Russia's subsequent diplomatic maneuvers have been clumsy attempts at self-rehabilitation. [Sharyy] The Duma occupies a hard-line position in respect to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it would seem? [Zatulin] Deputies structuring their relations with the diplomats on a confrontational basis is not what I would want. But we are having to do this, unfortunately: Compliance with the decision of the State Duma is being monitored, and unless the Foreign Ministry and the government take the appropriate action, we shall be forced to pass a law on Russia's unilateral withdrawal from the regime of sanctions. This is a disputed, declaratory decision, which will do little, but it will help Russia preserve its honor. And honor is something in itself. It is absolutely pointless for our foreign minister to imagine himself a latter-day George the Dragon-Slayer, who is intent on lancing socialism and communism in Serbia. I am concerned for the friendship of Russia and Serbia, but I do not believe that friendship can justify everything. What kind of friendship of Moscow and Belgrade, generally, are we talking about? The Serbs had and continue to have a desire to rely on Moscow, but our Foreign Ministry has never endeavored to lend a hand. Russia cannot allow a people that are related to it to be reduced to a primitive condition. The Yugoslav conflict has demonstrated that no one can be confident of his own security with a hungry, confused neighbor, one armed to the teeth, what is more. The Serbs, like the Russians, are not in a position to secure for themselves a decent life but they could perfectly well spoil the life of others.
