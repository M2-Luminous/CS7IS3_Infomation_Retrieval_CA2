FR941206-2-00061 FR941206-2-00046 [Social Security Ruling SSR 94&hyph;5p] Title XVI: SSI Treatment of Department of Veterans Affairs Payments to Fiduciaries AGENCY: Social Security Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice of Social Security Ruling. SUMMARY: In accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), the Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of Social Security Ruling 94&hyph;5p. This Ruling explains the continued longstanding policy that payments made by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to an individual who acts as a fiduciary for another are not income or resources to the fiduciary for the purpose of determining his or her eligibility for or amount of benefits under the supplemental security income (SSI) program. The Commissioner also gives notice that this Ruling supersedes SSR 82&hyph;31. SSR 82&hyph;31 (C.E. 1981&hyph;1985, p. 777) contained policy in addition to that concerning VA payments to fiduciaries, regarding the treatment of veterans benefits made to SSI claimants where VA augments the benefits because the recipient has dependents. The policy on the treatment of VA augmented benefits is no longer applicable because of regulations promulgated on this date. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 6, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joanne K. Castello, Division of Regulations and Rulings, Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235, (410) 965&hyph;1711. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Although we are not required to do so pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(1) and (a)(2), we are publishing this Social Security Ruling in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1). Social Security Rulings make available to the public precedential decisions relating to the Federal old-age, survivors, disability, supplemental security income, and black lung benefits programs.

Although Social Security Rulings do not have the force and effect of the law or regulations, they are binding on all components of the Social Security Administration, in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), and are to be relied upon as precedents in adjudicating other cases. If this Social Security Ruling is later superseded, modified, or rescinded, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register to that effect.
