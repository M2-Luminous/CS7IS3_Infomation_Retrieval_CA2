Bilateral talks between senior officials in Brussels on February 2 left both sides talking of a "friendly" atmosphere which had brought the Europeans and Americans closer together on issues including policy on Russia, trade with Japan and on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The U.S. Under Secretary for Economic and Agricultural Affairs, Joan Spero, said after the talks that she hoped for gentler exchanges on EU/US trade in audiovisual products, one of the hotly-contested elements in the recent GATT Round of trade talks. "We would like to find a way to have a somewhat quieter dialogue," she said, a line which the Commission later welcomed. Officials also agreed to set up an "early warning system" to identify and deal with bilateral disputes, nearly a year after the idea was first floated, and discussed the "new generation of sectors" within GATT, notably the environment, the possibility of a social clause in trade rules and competition issues. The European side also sought and received reassurances from the U.S. officials that the EU would be kept informed of the ongoing U.S./Japan trade negotiations. Finally, Under Secretary Spero announced that U.S. and EU scientists were to organise contacts on possible cooperation in work on information technology. Other possible areas singled out for EU/U.S. cooperation include mobile satellite phones, pesticides and environmental questions related to packaging waste.
