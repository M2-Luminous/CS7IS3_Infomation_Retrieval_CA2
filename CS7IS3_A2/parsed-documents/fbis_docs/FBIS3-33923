He described these proposals as a way to beautify the Oslo accord, noting that this means giving sovereignty to Israel. In response to a question by SAWT AL-SHA'B, Staff Major General Muhammad Jihad, who is also a member of the Fatah Central Committee, called on all Fatah military cadres to reject these proposals and warned against the consequences of attempting to coordinate with the Israeli Army on these patrols. [passage omitted] Asked about instructions from the Palestinian leadership to Fatah cadres inside the occupied Arab territories to surrender their weapons to the Israeli Army and stop military operations, Jihad said: I asked President Yasir 'Arafat about this and he categorically denied issuing such instructions. Jihad reaffirmed that the Fatah Central Committee did not issue any such instructions. Maj. Gen. Jihad said that the instructions issued to members of the Fatah Movement inside the occupied territories are the same instructions issued before the signing of the Oslo agreement. He noted that these instructions stipulate that we continue our tasks, especially regarding our struggle against the Israeli occupation. He said: The intifadah activities and military operations inside the occupied territories are evidence that the Oslo accord did not change anything.
