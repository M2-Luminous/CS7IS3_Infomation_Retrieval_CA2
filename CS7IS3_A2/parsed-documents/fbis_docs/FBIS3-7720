Jadranka Kosor spoke to Granic over the phone following his address: [Kosor] Croatia has sharply condemned every kind of violation of human rights, Mate Granic said in his address. [Begin Granic recording] In addition to this, I spoke clearly in my address about ways envisaged by the Republic of Croatia to resolve the current crisis, both with regard to the negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina and to relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, i.e. the normalization of these relations, which crucially depend on developments in the UN Protected Areas, that is the reintegration of these areas into the constitutional and legal system of the Republic of Croatia. I also stressed that--regardless of Mr. Mazowiecki's report, the U.S. State Department's report, and those of some other important nongovernmental organizations in which they reflect on some violations of human rights in Croatia--Croatia has, nevertheless, welcomed all international institutions. They conduct their activities in the former Yugoslavia from their bases in Croatia. [end recording] [Kosor] Croatia proposed to the Human Rights Commission a special resolution in which the problem of missing persons would be treated as separate from other humanitarian problems. Representatives of associations of families of missing persons and POW's are also in Geneva, Granic said. They were received by the president of the Human Rights Commission today. The Croatian foreign affairs minister has left Geneva for London.
