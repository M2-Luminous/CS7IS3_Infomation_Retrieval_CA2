This was greeted with laughter because, the previous night, the two leaders left the building of the Council of Ministers Office quietly by a side gate, just as they had entered it earlier, well after 2300 hours. Following that evening meeting as well as the one that took place yesterday afternoon, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] leader stressed that the talks, held after the present government's 100 days in office, were essential: Both sides, which had never collaborated officially before, should assess pragmatically what was good and what was bad in their joint track record so far. In Aleksander Kwasniewski's opinion, the case of [the resignation of Finance] Vice Minister Borowski, which arose in connection with Stefan Kawalec's dismissal, was a simple case of "casualty at work" and could not in any way affect relations within the coalition. According to Kwasniewski, the prime minister still wanted to work with Borowski, whom he regarded as an important figure in the government. "There is no other way than reinforcing the coalition," Aleksander Kwasniewski insisted, "because it would be a pity to waste time on conflicts." GLOS PORANNY's reporter asked Aleksander Kwasniewski whether matters connected with privatization were one of the subjects of his talks with the prime minister. In reply, the SLD leader said: "Too much of a fuss is made about this problem. We have agreed with the prime minister that, beginning next week, we will talk about that whole question in the company of competent people. We do not score any credits by our present handling of the privatization question. The prime minister had an opportunity to talk in Brussels with representatives of the European Union as well as with U.S. investors, and he knows that they all await answers on questions of privatization. We cannot talk about these questions at the same time with the voice of Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek and that of Bogdan Pek (Polish Peasant Party), chairman of the Sejm Commission for Ownership Transformations, because no sensible concept will arise from the combination of these two views." The SLD leader also told us: "It is premature and probably quite inappropriate to talk about the Bank Slaski [Silesian Bank] racket [reference to recent stock exchange dealings]. I do not believe that anyone could formulate such far-reaching conclusions from the quite unique situation that prevails at the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Let us not make such rash judgments. If such an admittedly somewhat unfortunate operation connected with the Bank Slaski can become a potential starting point for a government crisis, we should draw only one conclusion from it: We must allow no more risky operations like that--no privatization, no stock exchange, no capital turnover. But what can we have instead? Well, we already know, more or less, what we can have instead. We cannot claim that we have not tried an alternative solution before. In my opinion, we should rather reinforce those mechanisms that permit better and more effective functioning of financial systems, and we should draw appropriate conclusions from our failures. But let us not resort to invoking the bogeyman of financial rackets."
