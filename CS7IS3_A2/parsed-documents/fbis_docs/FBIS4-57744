Banic General Manager Esteban Duquestrada pointed out that while banks are allowed to lend up to 16 times their capital, the private banks are "generally reluctant" to grant credit. The sale of the loan portfolios is being financed by AID, according to the article. Duqestrada said that one of the drawbacks of the program is that state banks are losing their best customers to the private banks, which will only purchase the portfolios of the best loan risks.
