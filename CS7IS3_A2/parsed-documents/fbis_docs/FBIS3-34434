The Majles held an open session with Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri presiding, and the deputies of the Zoroastrian minority, Ardabil, Taft, Ahvaz, and Qom made speeches. Then the Majles went into session. We call to your attention the detailed discussions. Parviz Ravani, Deputy of the Zoroastrian Minority I Condemn the Publication of Incorrect News Regarding the Observance of the Rights of Religious Minorities in Iran The first pre-agenda speaker of yesterday's session of the Majles was Ravani, the deputy of the Zoroastrians, who offered his condolences on the death of Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani and said: We Zoroastrians during our prayers stand towards the light, that is, the light is our Kaaba. But we also have another light, which is the light of science and knowledge. Referring to the establishment of more than 30 schools by Zoroastrians in the country, addressing the minister of education, he said: These schools, which one day were the banner carriers of fighting illiteracy, are about to lose their true efficiency. In my recent visit to Yazd, I realized that some of these schools that are endowed in the villages are engaged in noneducational matters. Referring to the Zoroastrian schools in Tehran, Ravani said: Despite the fact that Zoroastrians have numerous buildings for elementary and high schools, they still do not have a middle school for girls. Certainly, the education officials will help in establishing this educational institution next year. Requesting that the mayor of Tehran pay attention to Zoroastrian religious places, some of which are in the green areas, he pointed out: The history of Iran in the past 100 years, especially since the Constitutional revolution, shows to what extent spreading rumors and creating skepticism has worked and does not allow the creation of an atmosphere of understanding for necessary government decisions. If history shows a picture of how Amir Kabir was the victim of injustice in the face of all domestic and foreign conspiracies, which indicates the plans that have always put pressure on our political figures, we would not have made an exaggerated remark. Today, under conditions much harsher than that period, the administration of the country is faced with similar conspiracies. The present approach is to avoid the scrutiny that can be seen in action and superficial reactions and finding fault. We must follow the recommendations of the grand leader and in our judgment and expression of opinion respect all the strata of the nation. We must accept the fact that in all cases, the implementation of great projects can only be achieved through the perseverance and courage of the faithful and self-sacrificing implementors, and is coupled with intentional or unintentional shortcomings. He added: We must never judge on the basis of the standards of those who are always standing outside and awaiting an opportunity for their own personal interests. What is noteworthy and praiseworthy during this period is the prescription of the Constitution and attention by the officials of the regime to preserving national unity and the hopefulness of people of different religions in the preservation of their basic rights in their place of birth, Iran. Stating that we must protect the manifestations of our national culture, literature, and language, he said: In conclusion, I condemn the publication of incorrect news concerning the observance of the rights of the religious minorities in Iran and ask God for the prosperity and glory of the Iranian nation and the success and victory of the officials of the regime of the Islamic Republic. 'Ali Mohammad Gharibani, Deputy From Ardabil One of the Effective Factors in the Fight Against Cultural Invasion Is the Fight Against Poverty The next speaker was 'Ali Mohammad Gharibani, from Ardabil, who offered his condolences on the death of the revered Shi'ite source of emulation, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, and said: [passages omitted on world arrogance and anti-American rhetoric] In continuation, he asked the speaker of the Majles, because the content of the letters of Mr. Raja'i-Khorasani in connection with relations with the United States has been reported widely in the newspapers and on the radio, in order to clarify it for the honorable colleagues and the noble people of Iran, to grant permission to use the legal authority in the bylaws to state his explanations concerning this matter. The deputy from Ardabil considered one of the effective steps in fighting cultural invasion to be fighting poverty and said: This will not be possible except through adequate economic planning and decisive dealing with hoarders and economic terrorists, those who in coordination with the West and taking advantage of the chaos in the market and accumulating large wealth want to bring about poverty and misery, and facilitate the spread of deviation resulting from poverty and destitution throughout the country, and allow financial corruption and bribery once again to become widespread. We all know that one of the most important consequences of the victory of the Islamic revolution was the elimination of usury and decisive dealing with the belligerent against God. In this connection, a number of judges were assigned by the Imam to put usurers on trial and investigate their corruption. But now, unfortunately, we witness the mushroom-like growth of usurers in various parts of our Islamic country. He added: One of the important factors in the reappearance of this ugly and ignoble phenomenon is the imposition of economic policies without any control and lowering the value of the national currency and making it dependent on the dollar. The other part of my speech is addressed to that group, some of whom are said not to have severed ties to the organization that was hated by the Imam and to not have repented and who are the cause of all the economic and social misfortunes. In connection with one of them, the Imam, addressing one of the high-ranking officials of the country, wrote: Be careful lest suddenly you realize that the Hojjatiyeh Society members have destroyed all you have. Considering these statements, the officials of the regime, God willing, will not allow the key positions to fall to these sorts of people and not allow them to infiltrate the important national organizations. Gharibani then referred to some of the characteristics of this group and said: On 28/05/1360 [19 August 1981], on the order of the Imam, in a session in the presence of the representative of his honor and the representatives of revolutionary institutions and members of the Central Council of the Hojjatiyyeh Society, a meeting was held and discussions continued for several hours. The leaders of the Hojjatiyyeh Society, in defending the ceremonies and trying to prove themselves to be revolutionary, made certain statements, and in rejecting their statements, one of those who had repented said: In the course of the Islamic studies lessons that the society teaches to its members, such as theology, etc., nothing has been said about a God who fights injustice and corruption. This is an ideological deviation by the society. He continues that he himself has heard the opposition of so and so, that is, the leader of the Hojjatiyyeh, to religious guardianship. When you say that he accepts religious guardianship it is a pure lie. He then states: Another issue is the categorization of individuals as political and religious figures. The deviation of the Society is this very separation of religion and politics. And the relations of the Society with SAVAK were not bad, and the seminar in Mashhad was carried out with SAVAK's permission. He says: The leader of the Society, after being disrespectful towards the Imam, had such opinions about the revolution: "The buzzing of the baby mosquito of the phantom"; "It is like pounding the fist on an anvil"; "We cannot be rid of the rule of the tyrant." And in justifying the shah, he said, "The shah is more chaste than all the other kings." He then continues: The first action by one of the leaders of the Society after the victory of the revolution was to raid SAVAK throughout the country to destroy the files of the Society. After the victory of the revolution, when there were many members of the Society, the leader of the Society said: The Imam must become desperate enough to write me a letter for me to place my forces at his disposal. Also, the tapes of the speeches of the leader of the Society over 55 years are available. He continued: By the way, why do the true forces of the Islamic revolution and the values of the revolution gradually leave the scene? Why should such revered persons, such as the honorable wife of Martyr Raja'i, be forgotten and should we not see them on the political scene? Gharibani referred to the many shortages in the province of Ardabil and asked the president to issue the necessary instructions in connection with conformity to the ratifications of the government with the law and the procedures for their implementation. Mr. Speaker, after being elected speaker of the Majles, you said that you would not change the employees of the Majles. You said that some officials during the change will get on the bus, I will not even go on a minibus. Apparently, the board of directors, on the basis of these statements, chose a train and not a bus or a minibus. After the speech of the deputy from Ardabil, the speaker of the Majles said: We must make use of Article 77 and say something. Seyyed Mohammad Taqi Mohassel-Hamadani, Deputy From Taft One of the Grave Duties of the Majles and the Government Is To Create a Safe Climate for Investment and Fundamental Work Mohassel Hamadani was the third pre-agenda speaker of the Majles yesterday. He offered his condolences on the occasion of the spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, to the Imam of the Age, the grand leader, and all the Muslims and expressed hope that our seminaries continue to be the cradle to nurture religious figures. He continued: The First Five-Year Plan is about to end and the Second Five-Year Plan is about to be devised and ratified. It was expected that before the ratification of the Second Plan, a full report on the quality and quantity of the implementations of the First Plan would be given to the Majles and its weak and strong points would be examined to make the necessary precautions in the implementation of the Second Plan. 1) It seems that implementation of the economic modifications made the implementation of the Five-Year Plan face stagnation, and the related results were not achieved. It is necessary to specify the reasons and eliminate them. Perhaps this important task is the duty of the Majles, which in not doing it will commit a dangerous act of negligence. 2) The problems due to the modification in economic affairs and the conspiratorial acts of the East and the West in reducing the price of oil and the occurrence of unexpected events, such as floods and earthquakes, require consideration for the condition of the people, especially the vulnerable stratum of the society. After determining the actual resources, except for fundamental affairs and observing priorities, the Majles should budget expenditures. 3) The action of the government in regards to purchasing transfers [as published] of the shares of government companies to the private sector is successful and beneficial. But this action must be carried out properly and devoid of any misuse and the supervision of the government can be effective in this regard. 4) Attention of the Majles and the honorable Cabinet to achieve administrative discipline is a necessary issue and has first priority, and lack of attention to it will increase the problems and anger the people. It is necessary to act as soon as possible. 5) One of the problems of the country is the existence of several prices for the necessary goods and public needs. It was hoped that the Ministry of Economy and other honorable officials would find a solution for this social problem, to which some of the business people have been accustomed, but, unfortunately, there is no sign of it. 6) One of the grave duties of the Majles, the government, and all the officials is to create a safe climate for investment in commercial, industrial, and agricultural affairs and fundamental work, for there is no other way to transfer the capital of Iranians living abroad, which is not insignificant. In conclusion, he made reminders to the Ministry of Education concerning the problem of elementary and middle school teachers and asked the president to attend to the executive affairs and planning for the cities and villages in his constituency. Seyyed Mohammad Reza Mavalizadeh, Deputy From Ahvaz Mavalizadeh was the fourth pre-agenda speaker of the Majles yesterday. He offered his condolences on the death of the Shi'ite source of emulation of the world, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, and said: Last week, the noble and always-present-on-the-scene people in the blood-stained province of Khuzestan were the hosts of a very dear guest, the loyal friend of the late Imam and a trustee of the leader, Mr. Nateq-Nuri, who truly is one of the valuable pillars of the sacred Islamic regime. In his five-day visit to the province of Khuzestan, he brought hope to the martyr-nurturing people of the province. Despite the intensity of the programs, the significant point that the deputies of the province of Khuzestan in the Majles observed during this visit was his pleasant attitude, patience, humility, modesty, interest in the people, precision, care, and proper moral behavior. Continuating, while thanking the speaker of the Majles and the accompanying delegation, he said: I request that the honorable Cabinet help approve six of the villages of Ahvaz as deprived areas, which have also been approved by the Office of Deprived Regions. He also made reminders to the Ministry of Education in connection with the shortage of educational cadre and space and the shortage of other educational aid in his constituency. Hoseyn Irani, Deputy From Qom Sources of Emulation and Leadership Are Two Wings Flying Together and a Single Hand The last pre-agenda speaker of the Majles yesterday was Mr. Irani from Qom, who offered his condolences on the death of the revered Shi'ite source of emulation and continued: [passages omitted on Golpayegani's praises] The presence of the people increased the responsibility of the officials of the country lest we be negligent in serving the resistant people and the untiring forces supporting the regime, particularly the vulnerable stratum. It was once again the covenant of the people with the leadership and source of emulation and the fact that the source of emulation and leadership are two wings flying together and a single hand. This vast movement was a response to those unaware people who look to the West with awe, who consider the religious source of emulation and religious jurisprudential management incapable and question it, and who consider Western rule and compromise with the Great Satan and criminal United States the solution. It was also a deadly response to global oppressors and deceptive international assemblies who everyday threaten great Iran with a new accusation or warn with the old weapon of the violation of human rights. They must know that if they want to stand against the ideology and the country of this brave nation, we shall stand with all of our power against their empty and hollow world, as they learned about the sacred defense and numerous conspiracies. In conclusion, he also added: Has the time not come to attend to the needs of Qom, which has been left out, and eliminate the administrative and resource shortcomings of this city? Ratifications The first item on the agenda of the open session of the Majles yesterday was a report on the second round of discussions of the Health Committee concerning the bill on calculating the service of medical students (interns), which according to the related ratifications have served in the war-stricken regions as a part of their outside-the-capital service or the service of physicians and paramedics, for which the single article and the note were ratified. Single article. The period of service of that group of medical students (interns) who, based on the ratifications related to the time of the imposed war, have served in the war-stricken regions, provided that period has not been calculated as a part of their military service and internship, may be calculated at the same ratio as part of their service outside the capital or the law of the service of physicians and paramedics (as the case may be), and the above-mentioned period shall not be deducted from the rural emergency period of those subject to this law. Note. The implemental bylaws of this law shall be prepared by the Ministry of Health, Treatment and Medical Education. The second item on the agenda was a report on the first round of discussions by the Commerce Committee regarding the proposal to amend certain articles of the Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Mines of the Islamic Republic of Iran, ratified in 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991], the general points of which were ratified. In this proposal, the establishment of the Chambers of Commerce in cities with at least 50 members was announced as permissible. Efforts to establish export and import unions and production syndicates in regards to mining, industry, commerce, and service activities in accordance with the regulations are among other instances that have been projected in this amendment proposal. In the continuation of the open session of today, examination of the urgent proposal for the procedures of the examination by the Majles of the annual budget and Five-Year Plan bills of the country continued and received final ratification. According to this ratification, parts of Articles 76 and 106-118 of the internal bylaws of the Majles were amended. For ratifying the proposals related to the internal bylaws of the Majles, the vote of two-thirds of the deputies present in the session is necessary. According to one of the paragraphs of this ratification, for discussions about the general points of the annual national budget, 10 hours, including three and a half hours for opponents and three and a half hours for supporters, one hour for the spokesman of the committee, two hours for the representative of the government, and 15 minutes for every speaker, have been allocated. The examination of the national budget bill and the amendments and attachments shall take place in the committee. Also, during the discussion of the first and second rounds of discussion of the budget bill in the Majles, the sessions must be held continuously on all days of the week except Fridays and official holidays for at least six hours per day. Continuing this session, the examination of the proposal to attach the National Library to the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance in the first round of discussions began and after the speeches of a number of supporting and opposing deputies, the continuation of the examination was postponed to the next session. Deputies of Khuzestan Thank the Speaker of the Majles The deputies of the cities of the province of Khuzestan in a letter to the honorable speaker of the Majles thanked him as follows for his visit to that province. [passages omitted on words of appreciation] Five Days With the Warm People of Khuzestan Seyyed Amir Purfazeli, Dispatched Reporter. Part I It was decided that the speaker of the Majles would make a five-day visit to Ahvaz to meet with the brave and untiring people of Khuzestan and to open and visit the developmental projects of the province and examine the process of the reconstruction of Ahvaz. After the passage of one and a half years in the Fourth Majles, Mr. Nateq-Nuri came to the province of Khuzestan, a province that according to the Imam has "paid its debt to Islam." In the course of the "eight years of sacred defense," Khuzestan created glory and heroism in such a way that the tongue and the pen fail to describe. Could anyone forget "brave and heroic Khuzestan"? Is there anyone who does not know "what Khuzestan did"? In this meeting, first Engineer Moqimi, the governor-general of the resistant and hard-working people, presented to him a report about the conditions of the provinces and then several officials reported on their work. Jadari, the concerned deputy of Dasht-e Azadegan, said in this meeting: The resources of the province of Khuzestan are known to everyone. One-third of the water in the country is provided from this province. Such resources exist in few provinces in the country. In the course of the war, the resources of the province stopped, and lack of development of the province during the war was quite apparent. Also, the director general of the Construction Jihad of the province of Khuzestan said: "The villages of the province five years after the war have a desirable growth, so that from 3,863 villages throughout the province, 1,796 villages have electricity and 1,350 villages have safe drinking water. But, unfortunately, 35 percent of the people of these villages do not have safe drinking water, and it is hoped that by the end of the Second Plan it will reach 95 percent. [sentence as published] Also, by the end of the Second Plan, all the villages will have electricity." When the speeches ended, the speaker of the Majles made a speech and explained internal and external issues and the problems and pressures that our country is facing. After the session, Mr. Nateq-Nuri visited the implemental operations of the Mirza Kuchek Khan industrial and agricultural project, with the development of sugar cane and its secondary industries. In this visit, the minister of agriculture and the deputy ministers of that ministry were also present. For two hours, the speaker of the Majles familiarized himself with the work of this great project, which is an exemplary effort by the government. This project has been implemented on 84,000 hectares of barren and low-return land of Khuzestan and will produce 700,000 tons of sugar, 700,000 tons of animal feed, 350,000 tons of paper pulp, 20,000 tons of animal husbandry protein, and 100,000 tons of semilight fiber. The cost of the implementation of this project has been estimated at more than 400 billion tomans. A noteworthy point of this project is that in 10 years it will gain more than $1 billion in additional revenues. Also, with the implementation of the above-mentioned project, the import of red meat and sugar will gradually stop, and 50,000 direct and indirect jobs will be created. It is noteworthy that the operation of the project has been projected for 1376 [21 March 1997-20 March 1998]. Some of the plains of Khuzestan are barren, low return, and nonarable. The implementation of these projects will make the province prosper. This example of fundamental work will certainly reach fruition in the self-sufficiency of the country, given the fact that in the future countries will face severe crisis in terms of food.
