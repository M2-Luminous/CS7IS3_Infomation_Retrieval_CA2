Commenting on this event, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry explained that it is a case of the two programs starting simultaneously. One of them, "Russia-NATO," reflects Russian priorities in cooperation with the alliance while the other, NATO's "partnership for peace," reflects the North Atlantic Alliance's proposals which have been accepted by the Russian side. The two programs, Kozyrev said, do not contradict each other but on the contrary supplement each other. It is symbolic that the ceremony of Russia's accession to the "partnership for peace" program took place 22 June, on the anniversary of the start of the Great Patriotic War, one of whose results was the world's division into two opposing camps. Having become the West's partner in European and global security, Russia has thus overcome one more frontier on the path toward a civilized world community. Here, NATO Deputy Secretary General Sergio Balanzino stressed, Russia is the only superpower in Europe and it will continue to retain this status. Without it it is impossible to achieve success in building a new, secure Europe.
