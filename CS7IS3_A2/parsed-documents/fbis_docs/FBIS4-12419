FBIS4-12419 "drnes068_s_94005" FBIS-NES-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 Iran Foreign Ministry Official Comments on Various Issues Foreign Ministry Official Comments on Various Issues LD0704233194 LD0704233194 BFN [Editorial Report] Tehran IRIB Television Second Program Network in Persian at 1530 GMT carries its regular "Political Roundtable" program. The guest in the 50-minute program is Hojjat ol-Eslam Mostafa Ha'eri-Fumani, director general of the Persian Gulf desk of the Iranian Foreign Ministry. He is interviewed by an unidentified correspondent on the topic of the stance of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] following the recent foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh, and the hajj issue. The program follows its usual format of approximately five-minute video reports interspersed with questions and answers. The first report repeats a Foreign Ministry statement in response to the final communique of the GCC summit in Riyadh, after which the correspondent asks: "Mr. Fumani, although it was expected of the members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [PGCC] to stress, in their final statement, the agreeable and positive aspects of relations between members and regional countries, we see the final statement causing greater tension among regional countries. What is your evaluation of this sessions's final statement?" Fumani replies: "In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. As you pointed out, it is a source of astonishment. In a situation where the Islamic world, international society, and in particular our region -- which is very sensitive -- need tranquility and where Islamic countries need cooperative thinking, a united vision, and cooperation, we witness meetings which are producing results that contradict the needs of Muslim people and nations, are more likely to create divisions and tensions among nations, and issue statements and acts in line with this. "It seems to me that the final statement of the 50th session of the foreign ministers of the PGCC cannot be evaluated separately. These days we are witnessing acts that tend to intensify divisions inside and outside the region. For example, PGCC members have had differences and contradictions in the past. But their differences have intensified these days. You must have witnessed this; it was also in the international media. For instance, divisions which erupted between Kuwait and Qatar. Or previous differences between Qatar and Saudi Arabia which have been again intensified and are well on the agenda. In the session of the member countries of the PGCC, a significant part of the discussions were on differences among themselves. Furthermore, news available here and there and in the media indicates that some member countries intensified contradictions with their neighbors, such as what we are witnessing in Yemen. Well, after a long separation and following a desire by the nations of the former South and North Yemen as well as the peoples of the region, the two Yemens united and moved on the path of unity. But we are now witnessing intense differences between the north and the south, and we see some regional countries and even some members of the PGCC aggravating the difficulties and contradictions between these countries. Or things that we possibly see in the intensification of domestic differences in Afghanistan -- where a selfless and struggling nation managed to bring down its enemy and take over the management of the country's affairs. But now they are suffering from differences. Some Islamic countries, in the region, instead of helping, are intensifying the differences. There are the things that we see in the statement of the 50th session regarding the Islamic Republic. Issues regarding the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf and the baseless claims made by one of these countries, the United Arab Emirates. Of course this is not the first time that the claims have been made, for the case has a 20-year history. It has been made four or five times. But it has intensified recently. Taking into account the international situation and the situation in the Middle East, taking into account the fact that some persons outside the region wish to impose a prepared and predetermined plan on regional countries; taking into account the long struggle against the Zionist enemy in some countries; and taking into account the fact that the Islamic world needs cooperation and unity; and taking into account the crafty acts of the Zionist regime and the killing of Muslims -- the killing of innocents at a time of prayer and fasting -- it is necessary for Muslims to unite in order to attain their ideals and goals." These remarks are followed by a report on background to the GCC and a repeat of a commentary on the GCC's stance toward the issue of the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs. Asked to assess Iran's relations with the PGCC member countries, Fumani replies: "Our neighboring countries, particularly the states that are situated in the southern section of the Persian Gulf, or in other words, members of the PGCC, had previously also made wrong a analysis and this is not the first time they have fallen for a wrong analysis. During the Iraqi war against Iran they made a wrong analysis, thinking that Iran was their enemy. I remember that case from the time when I was the ambassador to the region, in the United Arab Emirates; when we held meetings with them they would say, in a friendly way, that we are afraid of Iran and that if Iran becomes a powerful regional country it may pose a threat against us or our interests." He goes on to say that during the past 15 years Iran has always supported its neighbors and its foreign policy gives priority to its ties with other neighboring and Muslims countries. Fumani continues: "During the war that Saddam Husayn waged against Iran all of those countries, in one way or the other, supported the Ba'thist regime of Saddam, making him powerful in order to avert a situation created by their wrong analysis, thinking that a powerful Islamic Republic would pose a threat against them." He then says that the Persian Gulf littoral states realized their mistake when Saddam invaded Kuwait. He continues: Since the second Persian Gulf war we have witnessed some changes in the judgement and thinking of those countries and in the way they have opted for appropriate stances, but at a very slow-moving pace. If we wanted to give an assessment of the trend of our ties with the regional countries during the last 15 years, we could describe it as a developing process and an expanding process. That is the expansion of relations. But we have never been satisfied with the slow-moving expansion of ties. We believe that regional countries, as neighbors of the Islamic Republic, should be able to live side by side the Islamic Republic, have a peaceful life, live in an atmosphere of understanding and a healthy climate, and work alongside each other in a healthy and peaceful situation, particularly when it comes to the safeguarding of the sensitive waterway of the Persian Gulf, which can serve all regional interests. "During the last 15 years the process of our relations with those countries has varied. Our relations are better with some of those countries. Our relations with some of those countries have reached a level where many agreements and memorandums are forged and are developing in a satisfactory manner. In future we should witness the presence of high-ranking officials from a number of those countries in the Islamic Republic. Of course Qatar is currently leading the way and its highest official, even higher than its Foreign Ministry officials -- the crown prince -- has already been to Iran. In future we shall see the highest ranking officials of Kuwait and Qatar in the Islamic Republic. We shall, God willing, hold meetings with them in a friendly and sincere atmosphere which should present a supreme model of neighborly and peaceful life to the people of the region." The correspondent says: "Mr. Fumani, the majority of the PGCC members adopt a united stance. But when they meet separately with Islamic Republic officials they adopt stances different from those taken at the PGCC. What is the reason for that?" Fumani replies: "That is right. That is an issue which we also raise with them. Some of those countries, in separate and private talks with us, say that we should not attribute the PGCC actions to them and that, in fact, their relationship with us is a special one. Of course during the 11th and 12th PGCC sessions, and particularly the 12th session which was held in Kuwait, they reviewed the issue more precisely. A number of those countries mentioned that they wanted to have special relations with the Islamic Republic and the Council, as a whole, sometimes acts in a way which is disturbing to bilateral moves. It was in that session that they made the decision to allow every individual member to establish separate ties with the Islamic Republic, and a number of those countries took further steps in that context. Obviously the role of a number of those countries -- that play a more influential role in the adoption of their collective stances, as you know -- is very effective, and we are aware of them." The program is interrupted at 1600 GMt for a seven-minute newscast. The program resumes with a report on the dispute with Saudi Arabia on the issue of the hajj. An announcer reads the following commentary. After the news bulletin, the final report repeated Iran's accusation that Saudi Arabia had broken the deal with Iran on the number of pilgrim's for this year's hajj, see IRTV1 021644, but added that the Saudi authorities had taken the decision under pressure from Washington. Fumani's comments on the subject were mild compared to previous Iranian pronouncements, saying that Iran understood that Saudi Arabia could not cope with a massive influx of pilgrims every year. [passage omitted] "This year, the Saudi regime -- in violation of previous agreements and the results of negotiations between Tehran and Riyadh -- has announced that, because of particular difficulties, it will accept only 60,000 Iranian pilgrims. Therefore, the Saudi regime has once again started to put a spanner in the works of the great gathering of the world's Muslims. Arabia took this stance at a time when a number of events during recent months had strengthened the idea that Riyadh, taking into account regional and global realities, had reexamined its policies and discovered that an improvement in relations with Tehran was an objective and tangible necessity. "A number of political experts, considering these developments, believed that Arabian authorities had apparently found out that the efforts of Western powers, especially America, to prevent an improvement of relations of other countries with the Islamic Republic of Iran was only in the interest of Washington and would, in practice, be to the detriment of regional countries. These experts emphasized that Riyadh did not see its anti-Islamic Iran policies to be in its interest, and viewed efforts to exclude the most powerful country of the region from regional developments as a useless effort. "Although a number of events had pointed to the correctness of this analysis and the pragmatism of the Saudi rulers in certain situations, the recent policies of Arabia show that because of certain reasons, including renewed pressure from the White House, the Riyadh authorities have not yet reached a clear understanding of future regional relations." The announcer goes on to state that participation presence in the hajj is the right of Iranian Muslims. The announcer then asks Fumani to comment on the hajj issue. After discussing the importance of the hajj for Muslims, Fumani says: "We have had difficulties over the past 15 years concerning the hajj. Considering the large number of people in our country who enthusiastically wish to be honored by visiting the house of God...[pauses] On the other hand, Saudi Arabian officials have always said that the holy places do not have the capacity for a large number of pilgrims. Of course, whenever there was tension in our relations with Saudi Arabia, it would affect the hajj; or vice versa: whenever there was a problem over the hajj, it would affect bilateral relations. We have always told Saudi Arabia that bilateral relations should be separate from the issues of hajj; and that hajj is an international Islamic issue, it does not concern one or two countries alone." He then says: "Saudi Government officials have always said that the house of God does not have the capacity for a flood, for a large influx of people. This is, of course, understandable." He then reviews the history of the hajj quota system, and says that the Saudi authorities are not observing an agreement made between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Saudi Arabia in Muscat, Oman, in 1993. He says: "The Saudi authorities are not abiding by this agreement. Of course, this is still unacceptable for the Islamic Republic. At the same time, we do understand what Saudi government officials are saying when they announce that the holy places do not have the capacity. Of course, they in turn must understand the situation of the Islamic Republic and abide by their promises and signatures. We have announced to the Saudi Government that we are ready to hold negotiations." The program ends at 1620 GMT.
