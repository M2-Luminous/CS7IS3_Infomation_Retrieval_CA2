In a lengthy, signed commentary, the official communist party organ said reforms granting more autonomy to state enterprises had not been fully implemented, resulting in "contradictions" between management and government over industrial policy. "The functions of the government and enterprises are mixed up" the commentary said, causing damaging delays in such areas as the purchase of sorely needed modern equipment. Many state firms are still operating the "iron rice bowl" system guaranteeing jobs for life, which burdens management with welfare obligations that are incompatible with China's emerging market economy, it added. At the same time, increased production costs resulting from a shortage of energy and raw materials are exacerbating the losses suffered by state sector firms producing essential goods that are still subject to government price controls. Reform of the state sector is an extremely sensitive issue in China, given the inevitability of bankruptcies and mass layoffs that goes with it. New fiscal reforms introduced at the beginning of the year have also taken their toll, the newspaper said, as many firms have lost essential financial and tax breaks. Sorely unable to compete in an increasingly market-driven economy, more than one third of China's 13,000 medium to large state firms are in the red and a similar proportion in difficulty. Losses in 1993 totalled around 30 billion yuan (3.4 billion dollars), up more than 20 percent from the previous year. However, according to the People's Daily commentary, the only way out of the crisis is to deepen the reform programme and create a national economic environment that will benefit the state sector in the long term. Meanwhile, steps should be taken to clarify and strengthen the administration of state firms, improve product quality and upgrade technical equipment.
