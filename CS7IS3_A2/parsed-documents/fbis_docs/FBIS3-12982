He met with the state secretary in the Swiss Foreign Ministry, Jakob Kellenberger, for talks on issues ranging from the Middle East peace process to closer economic ties between the two countries. Mr. Kellenberger expressed concern about human rights in the occupied territories following the Hebron massacre last week in which a Jewish settler shot over 40 Muslim worshippers. At a press conference in Berne I asked Mr. Beilin how much of a threat the massacre poses to the Middle East peace talks. [Begin recording] [Beilin] We hope and pray that it won't be a kind of a setback, and that all parties will understand that the best answer to the lunatics of this world is not to stop the process but to accelerate it, so that we will be able to conclude the negotiations about Gaza and Jericho and to go on to implement it as soon as possible. And once there is the change on the ground and once the Palestinians are having their own police forces and they are in charge of their own business, that will be the best answer to the extremists who would not like to see a peaceful solution for the Middle East. [Correspondent] I wanted to know what measures Israel is going to take now to reassure the PLO and to get it back to the negotiating table. [Beilin] Well, first of all I believe that the most important thing is to get back to the negotiating table. We took some measures but it is mainly for ourselves in order to do whatever possible to prevent the recurring of such an awful event. We are speaking about confiscating of the arms of some of the extremists in the West Bank, about restricting their moves [as heard], about the first time when there was a closure on a Jewry [as heard] settlement in the territories. We also released 500 prisoners, Palestinian prisoners, and we are going to continue this process of releasing prisoners. But I believe that getting back to the negotiating table should not be a result of those steps or others, but a real interest of both parties. Because that is the best and only solution for the situation: Until now there were about 35 Israelis who have been killed by Palestinians since the signing of the agreement, there were more than 50 Palestinians killed in this massacre and later on. We have to put an end to this bloodshed and the only way to put an end to it is to sign the agreement between us and to implement it. The leaderships are ready, we have to educate both our peoples that there is no better option than that. [Correspondent] How is Israel planning to ensure the security of the Palestinians in the occupied territories? [Beilin] Well, first of all, I think that the most important thing is that they will have their own Palestinian police force, and they may have it if we sign the agreement, and we're speaking about weeks, not about months. It is a very important challenge for the Palestinians themselves -- I can understand the difficulty which is there -- but they have to take this challenge and to fulfil it. Of course there are Palestinians in other parts of the West Bank which will not be under the jurisdiction of the Gaza-Jericho council and we will have to do whatever possible in order not to expose them to dangers. I believe that those measures which were taken by the government and to which I referred to before, will help us in ensuring the security of the Palestinians. [Correspondent] Is there any question of moving the settlers back to Israel? [Beilin] No, we are not speaking about such a thing. We agreed with the Palestinians that the whole issue of the future of the settlements will be considered and debated towards the permanent solution and we agreed to (?reach) a permanent solution in five years from now, which means '99, and until then we will have to negotiate about the future of the borders, of the settlements. We cannot do such a thing in a very short while, and I think that we shouldn't. [end recording] [Correspondent] That was Israel's deputy foreign minister Yosi Beilin at a press conference in Bern.
