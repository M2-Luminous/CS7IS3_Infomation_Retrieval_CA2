In this the authorities have gone so far that they have set against themselves even some of their former patrons. Almost six months after the referendum and the elections pro-U.S.-oriented foreign news sources suddenly reported that their results had been falsified: There was a voter turnout of less than 50 percent, which means the Constitution was not adopted. The international observers who concealed the truth assume the expression of naive simpletons, pleading concern for Russia. Several months ago this concern made them lie, but now it makes them tell the truth. Love really is unpredictable. So, the powers that be and the Constitution carved out by them have received from the West a crushing blow instead of credits, about which no one has breathed a word recently. And for the president -- a bomb under the czar's throne? Russia's rulers might end up on a par with their colleagues in Haiti. The blow was not unexpected. Let us recall the scandal over the Russian spies, the Ames, which was blown up out of all proportion. Having kept them in cotton wool for about two years, for some reason they exposed them at just the time when B. Yeltsin was in the greatest need of foreign support. There is more. When the Russian Government tried to pick up brownie points with its diplomatic activity in Yugoslavia, the United States ignored those peacemaking efforts and shot down Serb aircraft. There then followed the militarily pointless bombing of Serb territory. In response to Russia's attempts to show itself a great power, the United States roughly put it in its place, making it clear that Russia was no more than a provincial actress in a U.S. show. The presidential team, above all, was slighted. Why has "friend Bill" swapped favor for anger? Or has he forgotten about the trillions of dollars spent on the struggle against communism, and is he now indifferent to what will happen to Russia? The stubborn show of U.S. hostility toward Russia can only be explained by a firm resolve to change its ruling clique. By what motives might the United States be guided? The situation in the country is steadily deteriorating and will evidently be critical by the fall. The stoppage of enterprises and mass unemployment on the one hand. Harvest failure for well known reasons, a sharp fall in the livestock population, and the threat of famine on the other hand. Thus, a tight knot of very acute problems will have been tied in a number of regions by the fall: unemployment, a food shortage, and high prices. A social explosion is really in the cards. Those who look at Russia with sober eyes understand that indignation will turn against capitalizers. Last year's elections convinced them of this. The people will sweep capitalism away, and some strong individual might accede to power on a broad wave of protest. The West does not doubt that such people still exist on Russian soil. It is frequently possible to hear the surprised comment: "The people are being robbed, but they stay silent. They have simply been zombified!" This is nonsense, of course. Over the years of Soviet power a distinct type of social consciousness took shape in our country: The cells of society -- labor collectives -- were geared to the leaders and lived according to the rules of large families. Workers are not making a resolute protest not because they have been stupefied by somebody but because they cannot yet overcome a psychological barrier -- the president's authority. The masses do not see a sufficiently strong figure in the opposition. When one appears, the people will wake up at once. They have already voiced their protest by casting their votes for Zhirinovskiy, although the majority take a highly ambiguous attitude toward him, to put it mildly. Therefore the peacemakers have good reason to make haste with the presidential election, without waiting for the masses themselves to nominate their leader. The chief consequence of the election will not be a new president but a coalition government, whose creation is insisted on by practically the entire opposition. Being the Duma in miniature and being politically ill-assorted, it will not change the policy of capitalization. On the other hand, it will dissipate the working people's future discontent and carry it away. Under these conditions the left-wing opposition must formulate more exactly its demand for a government of public confidence. In our view, the question should be raised of creating a socialist government which advocates the power of labor collectives based on the supremacy of ownership by the whole people and Soviet self-management. It is highly doubtful that the trip to Germany will strengthen the president's position. It seems that there is still no getting away from an early election. But a coalition government...is already being created, as evidenced by the appointment of N. Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, as a minister. The fact that he will be without a portfolio is also symbolic.
