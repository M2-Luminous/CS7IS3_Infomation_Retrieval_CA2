FR940504-2-00067 FR940504-2-00057 [Investigation No. 337&hyph;TA&hyph;351] Commission Determination Not To Review an Initial Determination Terminating the Investigation as to Respondent Srinivisan v. Chari Pursuant to 19 CFR 210.51(a) and as to Remaining Respondents on the Basis of a Settlement Agreement In the Matter of certain removable hard disk cartridges and products containing same. AGENCY: U.S. International Trade Commission. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review the presiding administrative law judge's (``ALJ'') initial determination (``ID'') terminating the above-captioned investigation as to one respondent pursuant to 19 CFR 210.51(a) and as to remaining four respondents on the basis of a Settlement Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Rachele R. Valente, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, telephone (202) 205&hyph;3089. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 20, 1993, the Commission instituted this investigation, which concerns allegations of violations of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, in the misappropriation of trade secrets and trade dress, infringement of federally-registered trademarks, false designation of origin and passing off in the importation, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation, of certain removable hard disk cartridges. On March 16, 1994, complainant Syquest Technology, Inc. filed a motion to terminate the investigation as to respondent Srinivisan V. Chari pursuant to 19 CFR 210.51(a). (Motion 351 24). On March 17, 1994, Syquest and respondents Nomai, S.A., Iomega Corporation, Marc Frouin, and Herve Frouin filed a joint motion to terminate the investigation on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding and a Settlement Agreement (Motion 351&hyph;26). On March 23, 1994, the Commission investigative attorney (``IA'') filed a response in support of the Motion 351&hyph;24, and a response in support of Motion 351&hyph;26, contingent upon the parties' filing a more complete public version of their MOU. The IA concluded that Motion 351&hyph;26 met the requirements for termination based upon a settlement agreement, and that the settlement agreement does not appear contrary to the public interest. On April 5, 1994, the ALJ issued an ID granting both motions. No petitions for review, or agency or public comments were received. This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1337, and Commission interim rule 210.53, 19 CFR 210.53. Copies of the ID and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this investigation are or will be available for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone (202) 205&hyph;2000. Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information on the matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on (202) 205&hyph;2648. Issued: April 28, 1994. By order of the Commission. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10701 Filed 5&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
