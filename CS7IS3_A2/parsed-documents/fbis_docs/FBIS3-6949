The businessmen appreciate the Bank of Thailand's policy of allowing qualified Vietnamese companies and Thai-Vietnamese joint ventures to be listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in the future. They say the move will be an incentive for local firms to invest more outside Thailand. Dr Som Chatusiphithak, chairman of the Thai Bankers' Association, and Wichian Techaphaibun, vice-president of the Board of Trade of Thailand have backed the central bank's decision to expand loans through the Bangkok International Banking Facilities (BIBF) scheme. They say both moves will boost Thailand's push to become a regional financial centre. The two share the view that it is time the Thai Government offered investment perks for local businessmen to expand their investments abroad, not just providing such privileges for local investment as at present. Difficulties over monetary regulations include the allowable limit of funds to be taken out for investment abroad, says Mr Wichian, who is also the president of Bangkok Metropolitan Bank. Thanin Chiarawanon, chairman of the Charoen Phokphan Group, says that even where the two countries have something in common, such as in agricultural goods, Thailand should not consider Vietnam as a rival in exporting. However, the government should promote and support local businessmen to invest here to make Vietnam partially a production base. Wikrom Kromadit, president of Bangpakong Industrial Park 2 Co, echoes this view. He says the Board of Investment should act as an agency to encourage investment abroad, like the Japan External Trade Organisation. He sees better prospects for bilateral ties after the Chuan visit, but he thinks real action or real investment from Thailand is much needed. Mr Wikrom says his Long Binh Industrial Estate project, for which the contract was signed during the Chuan visit to Vietnam, will, if completed, become the hub of Thai investment in Vietnam. He aims to provide several services including seeking Vietnamese partners and investment consultancy over rules and regulations here. Many Thai products, for example canned pineapple, canned tuna and other canned seafood products, have a good reputation in foreign markets, and it is thus possible to shift the manufacturing base to Vietnam while using the same Thai brand names. During the visit, there were two agreements on tourism cooperation an agreement between the Federation of Thai Industries and Vietnam's State Committee for Cooperation and Investment; and four joint investment contracts between Thai firms and Vietnamese government agencies. Mr Chuan witnessed the signing of the contracts.
