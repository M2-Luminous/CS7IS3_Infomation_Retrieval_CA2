Prince Salman Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz, governor of Riyadh Province and chairman of the Higher Council for the Collection of Donations for Bosnia-Herzegovina Muslims, has decided to open a permanent council office in Sarajevo, in addition to an office in Zagreb, to deliver aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina Muslims. Observers have pointed out that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is just about the only country in the world that adheres to providing aid to Lebanon, whereas other countries continue to procrastinate in implementing their commitments to advance meaningful aid to Lebanese reconstruction projects. Observers added that King Fahd's decision on Lebanon confirms that aid to brothers is a constant principle of the Saudi strategy, which adheres to King Fahd's ideas based on constants derived from the heart of the orthodox religion. King Fahd has instructed the Saudi authorities concerned to disburse a sum of $100 million to the Lebanese Government in order to help Lebanon move forward to achieve the benevolent goals to which everybody aspires. An official source said that these instructions come within the context of the interests of the custodian of the two holy mosques to see Lebanon move toward security and stability in accordance with the stipulations of the al-Ta'if accord and on the basis of the king's ceaseless eagerness to contribute to whatever is likely to aid Lebanon; to help its people overcome the consequences of the Lebanese war in various vital fields; and to enable Lebanese development agencies to perform an effective role in serving the Lebanese people. The instructions were given after the king had received Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri at al-Salam Palace in Jeddah. Upon returning to Beirut, al-Hariri thanked King Fahd for his ceaseless aid to Lebanon and its reconstruction. Al-Hariri said, "Saudi Arabia has gotten us accustomed to the special attention it always devotes to the conditions in Lebanon. In addition to the ceaseless political support for the national concord procession, this grant comes as a new expression reflecting the love and care King Fahd harbors for Lebanon and its people under all circumstances. The Lebanese people will not forget the aid the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, led by the custodian of the two holy mosques, has offered Lebanon during its ordeal, and now the kingdom is leading the reconstruction and development procession." Within the framework of Saudi Arabia's efforts to keep pace with the steps to restore security and stability in Lebanon, informed sources expect that the Saudi Embassy in Beirut will be reopened shortly and that Saudia [Saudi Airways] will resume its flights to Lebanon. To Bosnia Within the context of the same principles, the king himself has issued instructions for the disbursement of 50 million riyals to provide additional aid for the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Saudi Council of Ministers has expressed its profound regret and deep pain at the continued Serbian attacks and unjust actions against the unarmed Bosnian people, who lack all means of self-defense. The council renewed its appeal to the Security Council and international circles to "continue their efforts to put a stop to the Serbian attacks; to establish a cease-fire immediately; and to enable aid organizations to treat the wounded and save whatever can be saved under the poor conditions that are worsening day after day." King Fahd instructed the authorities concerned to disburse 50 million riyals to secure more in-kind aid, food, and medical supplies and to ship them immediately to the victims and the sons of the Bosnia-Herzegovina people who have been evicted from their towns and villages, and to also transport a number of wounded sons of the Bosnia-Herzegovina people for treatment in Saudi Arabia. King Fahd also urged citizens to continue their customary humanitarian activities by making financial contributions to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina through the Saudi Higher Council for the Collection of Donations for the People of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is headed by Prince Salman Ibn 'Abd-al-Aziz, the governor of Riyadh Province. The council's permanent office in Sarajevo, on agreement with a certain company, has secured seven trucks to ship wheat and flour to Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this connection, Prince Salman appealed to all citizens and residents and all companies and establishments to extend a helping hand to our afflicted brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina so as to console them and bolster their steadfastness in the face of their enemies and rescue their old men, children, and women from the murder, displacement, desecration of honor, and mass annihilation to which they are being subjected. And Somalia Persevering in the course of helping Muslim victims of natural or human catastrophes anywhere, King Fahd explained in the latest cabinet session the mission of the Saudi force dispatched to this country [Somalia] to participate with the UN forces in facilitating the delivery of food supplies and aid to the besieged and the victims in all parts of Somalia and to cooperate with the UN forces constantly in whatever serves Somalia's interest. King Fahd said, "The reports we are receiving confirm all the time that the Saudi soldier is liked and appreciated by everybody in Somalia." Under the supervision of Prince Salman, the Higher Council for the Collection of Donations has distributed 31,200 copies of the Koran, translated into the Somali language, as a gift from the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques Complex for Printing the Venerable Koran to Somali emigrants in Nairobi. A source at the council said that this gift pleased the emigrants because of the desirable benefit it yields and because it helps Muslims morally and preserves their faith in a country where misguided religious and denominational movements compete to attract these emigrants and exploit their poverty and need in order to steer them away from their faith. The source said that supplying Somali emigrants with the venerable Koran in their own language makes it easier for them to understand it; strengthens their adherence to their faith; and fortifies them against their enemies. Victimized and needy Somalis are helped, moreover, with various foodstuffs. The council is eager to make sure that these foodstuffs are of the highest quality, a fact that has made the emigrants view materials supplied by the council as foodstuffs that include all necessary ingredients. The council office provides material aid to mosque imams and supervisors of Islamic schools. Moreover, the council office also takes care of orphans at six centers for a period of six months. The cost of these centers amounted to 1,619,880 Kenyan shillings. The office distributes food supplies to needy families according to number of family members. A survey is made of families in camps, centers, and poor villages so cooperation can be established between the working team assigned by the council office in Nairobi and notables in these places, such as quarter imams, mayors, and teachers. In the past four months this food aid cost 1,370,541 Kenyan shillings. The council office in Nairobi also distributed the meat of livestock sacrifices made on al-Adha Holiday to deserving people. At the end of the pilgrimage season, the government of custodian of the two holy mosques shipped this meat to Islamic countries so it could be distributed to the needy in these countries according to the directives of the government of custodian of the two holy mosques, which seeks to help the needy and afflicted in all parts of the world. Islamic Concept A diplomatic source said that the monarch, government, and people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believe that Muslims in all countries are like one body and soul or like one structure in which each part supports the other. To embody this great Islamic concept, the custodian of the two holy mosques has instructed the kingdom's official and popular circles to exert the utmost efforts to aid and provide relief to their brothers in faith who are confronted by terrible tragic circumstances as a result of aggression, war, and blind domestic sedition. The kingdom's monarch, government, and people have risen to help the brothers in Afghanistan and, previously, the brothers in Palestine. Lately they have risen to help the brothers in Somalia and the brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who are being subjected to the most heinous forms of oppression and annihilation by the malicious Serb militias. The source added that in view of these painful ordeals, catastrophes, and tragedies, which are afflicting Muslim peoples with their woes, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has responded to the call of duty, donating everything valuable and priceless and following in the footsteps of the custodian of the two holy mosques, who was the first to contribute his own money. He has also directed that air corridors be established so as to ship aid, food, medicines, and tents, plus doctors and medical equipment, aboard Saudi planes flying from the kingdom to the afflicted Islamic countries to aid their peoples, ease their grief, and alleviate their suffering. Moreover, the kingdom's relief organizations, which are headed by His Royal Highness Prince Salman Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz, governor of Riyadh Province, have been actively collecting donations from the Saudi people, who have been contributing most willingly and generously out of awareness of their duty toward their brothers in the faith. Observers said that these charitable efforts and noble humanitarian positions emanating from the heart of Islam, which have been taken by King Fahd Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz, custodian of the two holy mosques, and his government and people, are the best proof confirming the kingdom's ceaseless eagerness to embody cooperation, solidarity, and unity among Muslims everywhere. Observers said that this is nothing new to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which represents strong support for Islamic causes. Throughout its history the kingdom has been the sanctuary and strong support for its sisters, Islamic states, especially in times of tribulations and ordeals. This is dictated by the kingdom's Islamic faith and its genuine Arab character. The observers added that the kingdom offers material and moral aid to Islamic states and peoples needing aid and assistance out of the dictates of its Islamic faith and because it seeks to please God, may He be praised and exalted, and to gain His reward. The kingdom does not offer this aid because of political or propaganda considerations or out of hollow, glittering, and misleading slogans. This is the kingdom's course and its constant policy toward its Muslim brothers everywhere. When all groups of Saudi people rise to contribute, sacrifice, and aid and help their Muslim brothers, they reaffirm their adherence to their faith, to the teachings of their religion, and to their genuine Arab traditions. They follow in this regard the footsteps of their leader, the custodian of the two holy mosques, who spares no effort to support Islam and Muslims and to embrace the Muslims' just causes at every level.
