At today's news conference McCloskey stated his impressions of his visit to Sarajevo and Mostar. Guests at the conference were Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and the President of the Serbian Consultative Council Ljubomir Berberovic. Nedzad Leko reports: [Begin recording] [Leko] Congressman Frank McCloskey, member of the Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees in the U.S. Congress, said that the renewed attacks at Gorazde and Bihac confirm that the war is not over. [McCloskey, in English fading into Serbo-Croat translation read by Leko] There is no doubt at all that the war still continues. Sarajevo, despite everything, is not a free city. It is a city under siege although it is not being shelled at the moment. I visited Mostar on two occasions on Friday and Saturday. The people on the eastern banks are still suffering, the food is inadequate, there is no electricity, they drink unfiltered water from the Neretva River. In the meantime, the terrible ethnic cleansing continues, particularly in the region of Banja Luka and Prijedor. Sixty thousand citizens of Gorazde are under siege. Many things still need to be done. In comparison to the pre-war situation, only 24,000, or 7 percent of the non-Serbian population, has remained in the region of Banja Luka. The entire world continues to turn a blind eye while this ethnic cleansing continues in Banja Luka and other areas. The planned evacuation from Prijedor is against all the provisions of international law and human ethics. That is why we need to ask ourselves what the world is doing, why is it not acting? Something must be done. The world must not turn a blind eye to this. When I return to Washington, I will request the Administration to send U.S. personnel here. For the time being, these do not need to be peace forces, but logistics personnel, engineers, administrators, medical crews. I believe that this would help maintain the peace between the Bosniaks and the Croats. [Leko] Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic called on the international community to react urgently to the attacks on Gorazde and the ethnic cleansing. [Silajdzic, in English fading into Serbo-Croat translation read by Leko] The question is why the UN Security Council is not reacting to this. What does the term safe haven mean if not the protection of the civilian population in Gorazde and Bihac? Second, why is the Convention on Genocide from 1949 not observed, when genocide continues in Bosnia-Herzegovina? The process of ethnic cleansing is being drawn to a close in Banja Luka and Prijedor, genocide is being completed. This, of course, to a great extent calls into question the continuation of the peace process. If in this way a situation is created where there will be no non-Serbian population in the occupied areas, then this creates a different situation at the negotiating table. The problem is that the international community minimizes this fact, which in turn creates yet another situation, that is, these people are encouraged to carry on. They are attacking Gorazde, Bihac, they are ethnically cleansing Prijedor, Sipovo, Banja Luka, yet there is no reaction. Our question is why the Security Council is not reacting to this, because they have an obligation to react. [Leko] Dr. Ljubo Berberovic, president of the Serbian Consultative Council informed the correspondents about the measures this body was taking in connection to this. [Berberovic, in English fading into Serbo-Croat translation read by Leko] The Serbian Civic Council and the Serbian Consultative Council in Sarajevo have written to the UN Security Council demanding urgent action to stop the further maltreatment of civilians and any further ethnic cleansing. If this is not done, there will be little chance of successfully defending Bosnia- Herzegovina as a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural community. We have proposed that groups of observers be urgently sent to Banja Luka and Prijedor as the first step toward maintaining chances for a successful continuation of the peace process. [Leko] At the end of the news conference, Congressman McCloskey said that it was still not too late for the salvation of hundreds of thousands of human lives. Genocide and ethnic cleansing must be stopped by an urgent action of the international community. [end recording]
