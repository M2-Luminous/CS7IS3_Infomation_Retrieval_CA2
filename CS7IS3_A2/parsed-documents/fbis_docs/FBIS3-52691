The talks will resume on 10 January. Heads of both delegations, Dr. Nabil Sha'th and Major General Amnon Shahaq, will discuss the two drafts Israel and the PLO have formulated. Several of the disputed issues in the drafts are not at all simple: For example, control over travel axes in Gaza, the size and authority of the Palestinian council, the manner in which civilian authority will be transferred, and other issues. [passage omitted] A senior political source said today that it is worth paying attention to the fact that the compromise formula makes no mention of the demands Yasir 'Arafat presented in the documents faxed to Israel over the last week. These demands deviated from the Cairo understandings and even from the Oslo document of principles.
