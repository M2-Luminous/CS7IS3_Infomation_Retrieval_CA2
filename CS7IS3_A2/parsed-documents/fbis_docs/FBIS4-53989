Visiting Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, meeting his counterpart Ali Alatas in morning talks, explained North Korea's obligation to accept International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections, South Korean officials said. Indonesia chairs the Non-Aligned Movement and is the subject of heavy diplomatic lobbying by North Korea, which keeps its third largest mission here with a staff of 25 to serve as a base camp for Southeast Asia. NAM foreign ministers meet on May 31 in Cairo, with the North Korean nuclear problem on the agenda for the first time for inclusion in the ministerial statement due at the meeting. Han requested Indonesian support for South Korea's first bid for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 1996-97, the officials said. Their discussions included an exchange of views on overall revisions to the security council makeup, they said. The two foreign ministers also swapped views on the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November, to be hosted by Indonesia. South Korean officials expect a major difference from last year's APEC summit in Seattle, Washington, which was mostly dominated by the United States and other advanced countries. This year, the home advantage and participation of Malaysian Premier Mohamad Mahathir are likely to change the tone and direction in favor of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), according to the officials. South Korean President Kim Yong-sam plans to attend the APEC summit. The foreign ministers touched base on bilateral trade issues, expressing satisfaction at the steady increase in volume and at active investment by the South Korean side. Two-way trade is predicted to reach 5.1 billion U.S. dollars this year with Seoul actually ending up about 500 million dollars in the red. Han asked for Jakarta's cooperation in ensuring a steady supply of petroleum and liquefied natural gas (LNG) to South Korea, the officials said. South Korea imports most of its LNG from Indonesia. This year, 3.7 million tons of LNG out of the expected 4.7 million tons in demand should come from Indonesia. The South Korean foreign minister winds up his visit to Indonesia on Tuesday after paying a courtesy call on President Suharto.
