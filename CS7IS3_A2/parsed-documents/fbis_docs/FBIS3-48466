So far a mixture of four to six kinds of raw materials was baked at high temperature. But the new technique requires the baking of one kind of raw material at low temperature. The new method increases the kiln efficiency two or three fold. In the past it took 12 to 14 hours to get powder of mixed materials, while the new technique requires less than eight hours. The new method is favorable for transport because it relies on the raw material rich in different parts of the country. It also saves fuel, electricity and manpower considerably. The porcelainware made by the new method is light, solid and low in absorption rate. When used as a building material, its life span is considerably lengthened. The method has been developed by teachers and researchers of the geological department of Kim Il-song University and technicians of the Taesong ceramic factory.
