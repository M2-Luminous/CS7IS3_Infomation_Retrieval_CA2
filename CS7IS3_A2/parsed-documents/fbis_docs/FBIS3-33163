The "demilitarization" of northern Nicaragua and the inclusion of the demobilized in the National Police are among the rebels' conditions for establishing a schedule for their disarmament within the next few days. Ortega reasserted the Army will reduce to a minimum its presence in northern Nicaragua--an area of conflict since the past decade when the contras struggled to topple Daniel Ortega's government-- after the recontras end the armed struggle. For the first time ever, Ortega admitted that as total peace is achieved in Nicaragua "it will become unnecessary for the EPS to deploy troops." According to military sources, a meeting between the rebel leaders and EPS officers with the mediation of a commission formed by the OAS and Catholic Church is scheduled to take place on 21 February in the city of Antigua. This will be the first meeting between the rebels and the EPS High Command, who have been political and military foes since the past decade and over the past two years when the "recontra" groups emerged. After presenting a military base to the Natural Resources and Environment Ministry, near km 20 on the Managua-Masaya Highway, Gen. Ortega dismissed the possibility of a "fatal deadline" in order to achieve results in the talks with the rearmed groups. He said, nevertheless, his desire is to achieve "as soon as possible" the demobilization of the main group that is still up in arms against Violeta Chamorro's government. Ortega admitted pacification in the north requires economic and social programs to deal with the region's high levels of poverty and unemployment and to secure means of survival for hundreds of rebels who for the second time will lay down their weapons. The military chief acknowledged the shortage of jobs in the country and the "considerable poverty" this generates; he also said "disarmament is not enough," because effective social programs must be executed. Ortega, in a letter he sent recently to 3-80 Northern Front chief Jose Angel Talavara, guaranteed respect for the lives and property of members of the group who immediately lay down their weapons. Talavera responded with a list of requests that included social and economic demands and the return of government troops to their headquarters.
