Egorov and V. Zhukovskyy: "What Is Vladimir Hrynyov, the Man and Politician, Striving For?"] [Excerpt] [Question] The Inter-Regional Reform Bloc mentioned above, one should assume, is that pre-election pony, saddling which, you want to win the election? [Hrynyov] Not only win, but, what is most important, strive for its implementation in life. The people are tired of promises which have been coming for many years from state offices. Today, however, it is quite clear that current state power structures have proven to be profoundly alien to the Ukrainian people and can no longer bring them anything but poverty and crises. [Question] Now, six months after your departure, the causes of the socioeconomic collapse in Ukraine can probably be seen with greater clarity. [Hrynyov] I saw them even then and spoke about them quite frankly. Whether they were seen at the summit is another matter. Things have gone too far, but I dare assure my countrymen that it is still not too late to take control of destiny and halt the descent into an abyss. After all we foresaw what happened--empty shelves in stores, cold temperatures in the apartments, swift devaluation of currency, and impoverishment of low-income citizens. Without losing a single day, a single hour, it is necessary to halt the disintegration of society and overcome the degradation of the state and authority. Through our own experience we became convinced that there is a lack of concern for man at the highest levels where narrow agency and clannish interests predominate killing all rational individual initiative. Only a group of skilled and responsible individuals, working in a coordinated manner in parliament, in the government, and in local administrations will be capable of moving Ukraine away from the precipice, from the brink on which it stands. [Question] Reports have appeared in the mass media on a merger of efforts in that direction by two political leaders--Hrynyov and Kuchma, or Kuchma and Hrynyov. [Hrynyov] The order of the names is of no significance whatsoever. What is important is that we turned out to be thinking along the same lines. I left a high post being dissatisfied with it and the same was done somewhat later by Leonid Danilovich, seeing how legislative and executive structures were nullifying his sincere efforts. In that critical situation we pooled our knowledge and experience with the full potential of the centrist bloc for the purpose of education and the exertion of an active influence on the course of events. Why centrist? Both New Ukraine and the PDVU [Party of the Democratic Revival of Ukraine] as well as today's reform bloc are based on liberal-democratic centrist positions which means that we will not accept either the bankrupt pro-communist structures nor some adventure-prone, in a number of cases national-radical, aspirations. Our concepts are shared by the union of industrialists and entrepreneurs which is headed by former Prime Minister L. D. Kuchma. Hrynyov believes that the principle that the state exists for the people and not vice versa is the bulwark of a civilized society. The state and its sovereignty are created by citizens "from the bottom to the top" for the development and protection of their rights and opportunities and not for their restriction, which is still far from being eliminated in sovereign Ukraine. Therefore the scheme: individual--district--(city)--country must be systematically realized. It is specifically with the aid of such a scheme that it is possible to utilize skilled intellectual forces from the regions and adopt decisions in the interests of the individual. Having announced creation of the MBR [Inter-Regional Reform Bloc] Hrynyov and Kuchma are not planning on utilizing it only for the conduct of the election campaign. By their conviction it must be a permanently functioning political force capable of influencing the course of events in Ukraine, including influence, if you will, through its own faction in parliament, which is prepared to assume responsibility before society for the management of regions and the country. To that end they are engaging in the formation of pre-election coalitions, working with candidates from among the regional leaders, elaborating legislative initiatives of the bloc, and, of course, earnestly preparing suggestions of the bloc regarding personnel selection. The logic behind activity of the bloc during the presidential campaign as well, is being worked out. Both of the leading candidates will perhaps attempt to enter into an honest competition in this area as well. Meantime Vladimir Borisovich is working on his candidacy: in his own district he held more than 40 meetings with voters. The first MBR conference took place in Kharkov. Its participants adopted a declaration on the formation of the bloc and studied the path of Ukraine toward an economic revival, a civil society and a civilized state. The confederation cited the disastrous consequences which were brought about by destruction of the economic space, the fabricated confrontation primarily with Russia, the isolationist course of the ruling circles of Ukraine, the "great power" cult, and the expensive military and political ambitions accompanied by national-patriotic jingoism of a portion of the society. Getting better acquainted with the bloc program adopted at the conference, we become convinced that much in it has been tried and tested. In studying the problem of transformation of the state sector of the economy, for instance, the MBR quite justifiably gives it a role of the principal producer of goods and a source of revenue for the population. As the inevitable generator of inflation and an instrument of the destruction of the economic potential, however, in the opinion of the author of the programs, the state sector must first of all be subjected to some well thought-out reforms, without which it is impossible to create a full-fledged market environment. That is why Hrynyov favors privatization of state enterprises, and their transition to various, including corporate, forms of private ownership. But, he stresses, inevitably with observance of social justice. Take any point in MBR programs and you will be convinced that concern for the individual is of paramount importance here. The bloc, and naturally, its leaders justly consider that suppression of inflation cannot be carried out through limitation of the income of the population or by confiscatory monetary reforms. The inclusion of land, real estate, and means of production in the market turnover is a decisive factor in strengthening the monetary system. One more thing: the personal funds of citizens in their privatization accounts may amount to a substantive share of the growth in credit resources. That would suit the main strategy of the reforms proposed by the bloc--stabilization not at the expense of the population, but against a background and on the condition of a rise in its welfare. What can one say? It has been a long time since we have seen such concrete, clear, and farsighted proposals for economic recovery and resolution of the prolonged crisis. At the same time pragmatic Hrynyov repeatedly pointed out the factor which is capable of nullifying all of the reforms. It is the psychology of the increasingly impoverished population. "Just try to conclude that in order to balance the budget and lower inflation it is necessary to freeze social subsidies," he said. "Our people, particularly young people, are not used to living according to their means. They refuse to understand that the state redistributes only what is produced by the economy. Therefore it appears necessary to earn the daily bread not through speculation from vending stands, but in the shops, the fields, and on the farms." Creation of new jobs and retraining centers is proposed in case of unemployment. Vladimir Borisovich is likewise convinced that the conduct of social reorientation of the state and the shifting of priorities in the direction of the population is possible with its regular briefing on expenditures--state and local--of taxpayers money with a well-adjusted mechanism of social evaluation of the quality of work by organs of power at all levels. The intention of the Inter-Regional Reform Bloc to eliminate political censorship along with social and national prejudice, and grant citizens the right for recognition of their native languages and everyday languages, are among the priorities aimed at the individual, at the protection of his honor and dignity. Speaking at the first MBR conference V. B. Hrynyov also presented the main organizational principles underlying the activity of the bloc. They include such positions as the creation of an electoral coalition, and a data system for the communication of central MBR organs with the coalition at the local levels, work with candidates from the block, elaboration of a detailed program of economic action, and formation of a package of priority laws (before entering parliament Brazauskas' party in Lithuania published 20 drafts and the MBR plans to utilize that experience). Hrynyov attaches considerable significance to the decisions of the second MBR conference which ended yesterday at Dnepropetrovsk. It was preceded by a sociological monitoring of the situation in more than 20 districts in eastern and southern Ukraine. In general participants of the conference coordinated a platform for the candidates. Two more points, which allow an understanding of the prospects should also be noted. It concerns the formation of a faction at the third bloc conference, but only after the election, and elaboration of parliamentary tactics. That, however, will depend on the number of deputies in the bloc. "We must realize," Hrynyov stressed, "that the influence of representatives from the regions will be like it is in a joint-stock company: the number of shares in this faction will equal the number of deputies elected." And finally, the structure of the future party. "But more about that later," Hrynyov noted, after the faction is formed. Without a party structure it is impossible to manage the economy and policy. The bloc understands that very well. No one is casting doubt on the fact that the activity of the Inter-Regional Reform Bloc to a large extent has been initiated by Vladimir Borisovich Hrynyov. Taking into account his personal qualities--such as constant search for answers to complicated questions of political and economic life, strict realism, the desire to work and absence of fear of responsibility, one can hope that Hrynyov, the man and politician, is preparing to play his principal role in life in the nearest future.
