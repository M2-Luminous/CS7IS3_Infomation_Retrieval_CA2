The proposal to include Venezuela among those countries receiving compensation for their fight on drugs was made by the foreign ministers of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela at a meeting they held today with Manuel Marin, a Spaniard who serves as EC vice president and commissioner for Latin America. In remarks to EFE, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin said they had asked Marin "that the EU study the possibility of extending those benefits to Venezuela, a country that also needs trade compensation for allocating its resources to fighting the drug trade." Several export products from Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are entitled to tariff reductions in Europe under a special paragraph of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), a mechanism whereby the EU regulates its trade with Latin American countries. Marin, who met with the foreign ministers of Andean countries to listen to their proposals concerning the renewal and expansion of the GSP, will convey these proposals to the other EC members. The GSP expires late this year, and the EU must decide whether to renew the foreign trade mechanism as is, amend it, or expand it. The Andean countries, Sanin said, expressed their interest in having the GSP renewed and expanded and that the trade benefits the EU is granting countries involved in drug enforcement efforts be extended to Venezuela. The meeting between Marin and the Andean foreign ministers was held simultaneously with the fourth meeting of Rio Group and EU ministers that began today at the Latin American Parliament building in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo. Marin is scheduled to meet on 23 April with the foreign ministers of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member countries (which consists of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) to hear their proposals regarding the GSP. Attending the ministerial meeting are all the foreign ministers of the Rio Group members countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Also attending the meeting as observers are the ministers of Trinidad and Tobago and Guatemala, representing the Caribbean and Central America, respectively. The EU is represented by the foreign ministers of Spain and Portugal; Greek Alternate Foreign Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos; and deputy ministers and vice ministers from the other EU member countries (Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom). Since the signing of the Rome Declaration (1990) -- which institutionalized talks between the EU and the Rio Group, the main Latin American forum for concerted political and economic action and for promoting integration -- the two sides have held three meetings: the first in Luxembourg (April 1991), the second in Santiago, Chile (May 1992), and the third in Copenhagen (April 1993).
