FBIS4-13528 "drnes077dd_94011" FBIS-NES-94-077 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Makeup National Authority Said Almost Complete Makeup National Authority Said Almost Complete JN1904124794 Amman AL-ASWAQ in Arabic 19 Apr 94 pp 1, 17 JN1904124794 Amman AL-ASWAQ Arabic BFN [By Nasir 'Arif] [Text] An unpublicized Fatah Central Committee session convened on 17 April in Tunis, was devoted to a discussion of the makeup of the national authority due to take over in the self-rule areas once Israel withdraws. The meeting, according to informed Palestinian sources, also considered the logistics for the arrival of the authority's bureaucrats and police forces. The PLO is close to naming the members of the national authority, which will likely be composed of 18 members. Of these, seven will be PLO Executive Committee members, two Fatah members, another two diaspora Palestinians, and the balance technocrats from the territories occupied since 1967. 'Arafat, predict the same sources, will move to Jericho shortly and take up residence at the Hisham Palace Hotel, which will also serve as offices for the national authority, assuming a mechanism is agreed on for the implementation of the Declaration of Principles now being hammered out between the PLO and Israel in Cairo. Meanwhile, a top Palestinian official disclosed to AL-ASWAQ that the configuration of the national authority has virtually been completed. The list will now be presented to the sponsors of the peace process and the Rabin government for clearance. Over the past few days, the PLO has directed the Political Department's staff to be ready to travel for the self-rule areas next week. In another development, an official in charge of the expellees affairs said the negotiating Palestinian team in Cairo yesterday got clearance from the Israelis for the return of 50 exiles whom the PLO had demanded be allowed back at the first round of the Cairo talks. The list has been handed to Yasir 'Arafat who, for unknown reasons, preferred to wait a few days before making it public. Israel radio said yesterday Israel has okayed the return of 17 wanted Palestinians, whose repatriation, originally set for last Sunday, had been delayed for what was termed as purely technical reasons.
