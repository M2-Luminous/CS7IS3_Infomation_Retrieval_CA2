At the Spring Festival party and inaugural ceremony for the 43d Executive Committee of the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association last night, Zhu Yucheng said: On the airport issue, the Chinese side has always acted in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on the Airport, but it was only after a very long delay that the British side put forward the fourth proposal. There is still the big question of a more than HK$20 billion [Hong Kong dollars] debt in this financial proposal. He said: By making the Airport Authority into a company, the British Hong Kong Government wants to shift the debt onto that company. The Chinese side has pointed out that, like the Mass Transit Railway Corporation, the Airport Corporation is a company which is fully funded by the Hong Kong Government, and the debt will ultimately be shouldered by the government of the future special administrative region. Therefore, the Chinese side maintains that, regarding the airport issue, there must be a supervisory organization, that the airport authorities cannot be allowed to spend money indiscriminately, and that the supervisory organization must reflect the will of the Hong Kong people. In response to a reporter's question as to whether the Airport Consultative Committee could play a supervisory role, Zhu Yucheng said: It depends on whether its composition represents the will of the Hong Kong people, and this must be considered in light of the situation at the time. The composition of the Airport Consultative Committee itself has yet to be studied. He said that the new airport has four essential elements, the airport runway, airport support facilities, airport control system, and airport traffic system. He said that the British Hong Kong Government's practice of offering these services as separate contracts, as opposed to approving them as an integral whole, is not conducive to the management of the airport. He pointed out that the Chinese side does not want the various elements of airport management to be separated, because an airport is different from other types of businesses. He said that all one can do is wait and see how the Hong Kong Government divides up the new airport. Zhu Yucheng said: The Hong Kong people should pay special attention to these areas. The goals of the British before their withdrawal are very clear: Economically, they want to reap the maximum benefit. Politically, they are preparing their own people in an attempt to force the government of the special administrative region to accept the exercise of British rule without their presence. He said: "Comrade Deng Xiaoping has discussed these problems very clearly before. The problems he mentioned have now occurred one after another. The current problems between China and Britain are something that the Chinese side does not wish to see." He hoped that the Hong Kong people will stop dreaming and said that they can no longer expect a colonial official to leave anything good for the Hong Kong people. He said that the British officials will only grab the maximum benefits for the British side and cited a proverb, saying that it is easier to move mountains and change the course of rivers than for one to change one's character. Zhu Yucheng added: The Chinese side has already made it very clear that, on the airport issue, the British Hong Kong Government has to conform to the Memorandum of Understanding by leaving HK$25 billion to the government of the special administrative region and by borrowing no more than HK$5 billion. He said: The question should have been settled, but the British Hong Kong Government is playing a game of figures by putting forward this and that proposal and intends to pass the debt on to the government of the future special administrative region after all. In response to a reporter's question as to whether the airport issue is being affected by the Sino-British dispute and by the deterioration of relations, Zhu Yucheng said: In the past, the Chinese side always hoped that politics and economics would be separated. But it appears that the road the British Hong Kong authorities are taking has completely blocked the road of Sino- British cooperation. Therefore, it will be very difficult for China and Britain to travel on the road of cooperation again in the next three years or more. Since the first day of his arrival in Hong Kong, Chris Patten has chosen the path of Sino-British confrontation, and now it seems that he will continue this confrontation to the very end. This will surely have an impact on cooperation in all areas of the Hong Kong economy. He said that there is a Memorandum of Understanding for the airport and that it is now up to the British side to abide by it. Zhu Yucheng said: In the past, we had the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and the agreements reached between the foreign ministers of the two countries before, but the British side has ruined these three foundations of cooperation. Now let us see whether the British side will abide by the Memorandum of Understanding. In addition, regarding the White Paper published unilaterally by the British side, Zhu Yucheng said that the British side has unilaterally violated the principle of confidentiality. He said: "Last time, I said that the British side did some editing and merging, and you editors should be aware of this. They themselves have also admitted that they have not released the whole story; that is to say, they took those elements that they needed, but did not reveal the entire real substance of our talks." Zhu Yucheng said: The Chinese side set forth a five-point foundation at the beginning of the talks, which Deputy Director Zhang Junsheng has also discussed publicly. The Chinese side had discussed these issues, but the British side did not keep its promise. He said: "As a government, it has to be responsible. It must not be irresponsible in the remarks it makes. It is not good if one says one thing today and then says another tomorrow. A government must be responsible, must admit when it has said or done something, and must be honest. We say we all speak the truth and we must not act like they do." Zhu Yucheng added that whatever the Chinese side says is true, and the Chinese will make a response very soon. He urged the reporters to be patient and said that a comprehensive reply would be given very soon.
