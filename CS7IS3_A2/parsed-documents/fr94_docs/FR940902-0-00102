In addition to the definitions contained in section 4 of the Act, the following definitions of terms used in the Act or parts 626&hyph;631 of this chapter apply as appropriate to programs under titles I, II, and III of the Act: Accrued expenditures means charges made to the JTPA program. Expenditures are the sum of actual cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, and the net increase (or decrease) in the amounts owed by the recipient for the goods and other property received, for services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services or performance are required, such as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments. Act means the Job Training Partnership Act. ALJ means an administrative law judge in the Office of Administrative Law Judges of the U.S. Department of Labor. Awarding agency means: (1) With respect to a grant, the Department of Labor; and (2) with respect to a subgrant or contract, the party that awarded the subgrant or contract. Capacity building means the systematic improvement of job functions, skills, knowledge, and expertise of the personnel who staff and administer employment and training and other closely related human service systems. Capacity building is designed to enhance the effectiveness, to strengthen the caliber of customer services provided under the Act and other Federal, State, and local employment and training programs, and improve coordination among them. Capacity building includes curriculum development, appropriate training, technical assistance, staff development, and other related activities. Chief elected official (CEO) means the official or officials, or their representatives, of the jurisdiction or jurisdictions which requested designation by the Governor as a service delivery area. Commercial organizations means private for-profit entities. Commercially available off-the-shelf training package means a training package sold or traded to the general public in the course of normal business operations, at prices based on established catalog or market prices. To be considered as ``sold to the general public,'' the package must be regularly sold in sufficient quantities to constitute a real commercial market to buyers that must include other than JTPA programs. The package must include performance criteria pertaining to the delivery of the package which may include participant attainment of knowledge, skills or a job. Contractor means the organization, entity, or individual that is awarded a procurement contract under the recipient's or subrecipient's procurement standards and procedures. Cost means accrued expenditure. Department means the U.S. Department of Labor. DOL means the U.S. Department of Labor. ETA means the Employment and Training Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor. Family is defined at section 4(34) of the Act. An ``individual with a disability'' shall, for the purposes of income eligibility determination, be considered to be an unrelated individual who is a family unit of one, consistent with the definition of ``economically disadvantaged'' at section 4(8) of the Act. The Governor may provide interpretations of the term ``family'' related to how ``dependent children'' are defined for programs within a State, consistent with the Act, and all applicable rules and regulations, and State or local law. Such interpretations by the Governor may address the treatment of certain individuals who may need to be viewed discretely in the income eligibility determination process, such as runaways, emancipated youth, and court adjudicated youth separated from the family.
