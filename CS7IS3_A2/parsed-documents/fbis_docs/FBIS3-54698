For several days now the Azerbaijani troops have been attacking all along the Karabakh front line. In the north they have managed to advance some way. Both sides are suffering heavy losses. The Azerbaijan army needs if not a real military success then at least the semblance of success. It is not clear what the ultimate goal is -- to reinforce their positions at the talks or on the contrary to wreck these talks? The Russian diplomats are saddened by Baku's decision to start an offensive. The signing of the latest cease-fire agreement has been thwarted. All details had been agreed verbally but at the last moment the Azerbaijanis refused to sign the document. It may be expected that in the very near future the Karabakh Armenians will try to seize the initiative and switch to a counteroffensive as a result of which some part of Azerbaijani territory will again be occupied. That will worsen the prospects of attaining peace. Envoy Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian president's special representative, is again setting off for Baku, Yerevan, and Stepanakert. It has been decided to turn the page on the incident of the Armenian soldiers' shooting of his automobile in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. During the talk in Ashgabat between Boris Yeltsin and Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, the Russian president, we have found out, "talked through gritted teeth" and something in the nature of an apology was made. At any rate Minister Kozyrev has decided to interpret Ter-Petrosyan's words as an apology. The Russian diplomats will insist that the leaders of the opposing sides come to Moscow -- here, outside the meetings environment, they are usually easier to convince. Meanwhile the situation is obviously deteriorating. Only a month ago Academician Primakov, director of the Foreign Intelligence Service, was speaking of the activation of the Afghan mojahedin in this war. But he noted at the time that the reports at the intelligence service's disposal "attest to intentions more than to facts of participation right now." According to recent information from Moscow experts, 1,500 Afghan mojahedin are taking part in the war on the Azerbaijan army's side and there will soon be more. The Armenians also suspect that Turkey is taking part in the conflict. In early December IZVESTIYA's Yerevan correspondent, Sergey Bablumyan, reported that the Dashnaktsutyun party analytical center, citing the French special services, was warning that in mid-December Turkey was preparing a missile strike against Armenia's energy centers. The pretext was the presence on Armenian territory of bases of the Kurdish Workers Party, which is struggling against Turkey and Turks throughout the world. The Dashnaktsutyun party's statement is most likely propaganda. Any military action against Armenia would put into operation the treaty on the CIS countries' collective security; that is it would pit Turkey against Russia. Turkish servicemen take no part in combat operations on the "Karabakh front," although it is known that they are engaging in the Azerbaijan army's combat training. Since Azerbaijan's accession to the CIS countries' collective security treaty, the appearance of foreign servicemen on its territory looks quite dubious. As for the bases of the Kurdish rebels, the Russian Foreign Ministry knows only that this information has appeared in the Turkish newspapers, which of itself is not proof. Representatives of the Russian intelligence service unofficially doubt there are such bases, but officially they cite the absence of a mandate allowing them to work on the territory of the CIS countries. The ally relations of the North American and West European countries within NATO do not prevent them -- thoroughly and while observing the proprieties -- from spying on each other. It would be logical to give Russian intelligence similar powers. The political and military leadership in Moscow is quite obviously in need of information, including that obtained promptly. And the intelligence assessments of the situation in republics neighboring on Russia should be made public in the most general form. The taxpayers have the right to know what is happening around Russia and to have the opportunity to judge competently how far Moscow's peacemaking efforts accord with the gravity of the situation in the conflict zone.
