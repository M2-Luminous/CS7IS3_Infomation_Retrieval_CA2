Speaking at a session of the parliament on Wednesday, Moroz said that among the subjective causes are "intolerance in solving ethnic problems and the clash of several nationalist tendencies." "It is necessary now to neutralise these factors as soon as possible by restoring economic ties and providing conditions for normal rest and recreation in the Crimea," Moroz said. He stressed that Ukraine must use all possible diplomatic channels to ease tension and put the problem within the constitutional framework, without using force.
