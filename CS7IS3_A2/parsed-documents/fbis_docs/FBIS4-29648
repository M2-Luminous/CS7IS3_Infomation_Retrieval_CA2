He said if money politics is accepted within the party, corruption becomes a culture in UMNO and party leaders are elected through bribery, the government will be led by criminals and the corrupt. The prime minister, who is the president of UMNO, was opening the party's special assembly in Kuala Lumpur. He said people who regard corruption as part of the political and administrative tools, only serve their own greed. Their interest to become leaders is only for their own good and not for the benefit of the people and the country. When the government is corrupted, so are the government servants. This will result in the whole government machinery being corrupted. The prime minister said untiring efforts are required to stamp out corruption before it becomes a part of the country's culture. It will be beyond control once it becomes a culture. The people will not get the protection of the law. They will be victimized as they have no place to air their grievances. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said in the party, a person who buys votes will not be ashamed to sell his dignity when he becomes a leader. His priority is not to struggle for the religion, the nation, and the people, but self-interest. Such a leader has no dignity and responsibility and is even willing to sell the country and people. The prime minister also spoke of the ill-effects of corruption if it is not checked. He said a society which is influenced by corruption will not achieve progress. Costs will shoot up while all transactions will move at slow pace. It is the people who will suffer. UMNO members face penalties ranging from a warning to expulsion if they are found guilty of abuse of power or involvement in money politics under the proposed amendment to the party constitution. UMNO deputy president Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim, who tabled the motion for the amendment outlined the actions that could be taken by the Supreme Council under a new clause. Measures that could be taken include warning, suspension of party privileges, disqualification from vying for party posts, or contesting in general and state elections for a term specified by the Supreme Council, and other punishments being fixed and in accordance with the constitution. The motion to amend the constitution involves the insertion of the new clause 18.6 and three other new clauses and amendments to two clauses aimed at combating abuse of power and money politics which it was feared would destroy the party if left unchecked.
