President Alfredo Cristiani has said that there is no concrete evidence on information disclosed by Guatemalan authorities related to weapons caches destined for Guatemalan guerrillas originating from El Salvador; he added, however, that the clues they have so far are quite convincing, and he expressed his concern for rising violence in Guatemala, where the last guerrilla group in Central America is still active. In reference to the armed uprising that has been taking place during the past few days in Mexico--which is led by the peasant group the Zapatista National Liberation Army--Cristiani expressed his regret that even Mexico has a problem now. We all wish that this type of problem did not exist and we are willing to cooperate with each other, the president added. With respect to the events in Mexico, the Salvadoran president said that the participation of Central American nationals has not been confirmed; nevertheless, he announced that the issue would be examined together with Mexican authorities during an official visit. Cristiani did not disclose when the official visit to Mexico would take place.
