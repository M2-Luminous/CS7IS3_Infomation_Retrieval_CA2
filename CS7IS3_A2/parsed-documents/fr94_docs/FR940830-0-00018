FR940830-0-00018 FR940830-0-00005 The final regulation expands the categories of depository institutions with which Federal stock associations have the power to merge from only FDIC-insured depository institutions to any depository institution. Federal stock associations have been authorized to acquire or be acquired by non-FDIC insured depository institutions in purchase and assumption transactions since 1985. 14 The OTS has concluded that continuing to require such transactions to be accomplished through purchase and assumption transactions, rather than through merger transactions elevates form over substance, and may impose unnecessary expenses and complications on Federal stock associations that propose to engage in transactions with uninsured depository institutions. 14 See 50 FR 16071 (April 24, 1985). Where a Federal stock association proposes to merge with an uninsured depository institution, and the Federal stock association would survive the transaction, the Federal stock association would be required to seek approval from the FDIC under section 18(c)(1) of the FDIA, as well as from the OTS under the transfer of assets regulations at 12 CFR 563.22(c). If the Federal stock association is not the resulting institution, the association must obtain OTS approval under 12 CFR 563.22(c), and provide any required notices to depositors, and to the FDIC. B. Combinations Involving Federal Mutual Associations The OTS has retained the prohibition against Federal mutual associations combining with stock form institutions where the resulting institution is not a mutual savings association, except where the mutual savings association converts to the stock form of organization pursuant to 12 CFR Part 563b, and subject to other, limited, exceptions. 15 15 The OTS's recent amendments to the conversion regulations generally prohibit merger conversion transactions except in certain supervisory situations. See 59 FR 22725, 22729&hyph;22730 (May 3, 1994). The OTS notes, however, that the concerns regarding the protection of mutual accountholders' interests in the acquisitions of Federal mutual associations do not arise when the Federal mutual association is the acquiring/surviving entity. Accordingly, the OTS is amending 12 CFR 546.2, governing mergers involving Federal mutual associations, to permit Federal mutual associations to merge with FDIC-insured depository institutions, as well as non-FDIC insured depository institutions, where a mutual savings association is the resulting entity. This treatment parallels the treatment of Federal stock associations. These combinations also would be subject to the same statutory and regulatory approval standards as apply to stock form associations engaging in a comparable transaction, described above. Section 546.2 has not previously addressed the ability of Federal mutual associations to combine with other institutions in purchase and assumption transactions. The OTS has amended ยง546.2 to provide specific authority for Federal mutual associations to combine with other entities in purchase and assumption transactions, subject to the same limitations that apply in the case of merger transactions involving Federal mutual associations. The OTS has made technical and conforming amendments to 12 CFR part 546 in order to implement these revisions to ยง546.2. C. Charter Conversions by and to Federal Savings Associations The OTS is adding 12 CFR 552.2&hyph;7 to the Federal stock savings association regulations, which specifically permits Federal stock savings associations to convert to state or national banks in so-called ``Sasser'' conversions. 16 New ยง552.2&hyph;7 provides that converting savings associations must comply with the procedures set forth in new ยง563.22(h)(1) or (h)(2)(ii) of the amended merger regulation, which requires prior notification to or approval of the OTS in the manner described in Section III.D. below. 16 The OTS regulations for Federal mutual savings associations have not been amended to authorize specifically the conversion of Federal mutual savings associations to state mutual savings banks, because such conversions are specifically authorized under section 5(i)(3) of the HOLA. Federal mutual savings associations proposing to convert to state mutual savings banks are required to notify the OTS or obtain OTS approval as described in section III.D., below. The OTS is amending 12 CFR 552.2&hyph;6 to permit, with prior OTS approval, any stock-form depository institution that is, or is eligible to become, a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank, to convert to a Federal stock savings association charter. The depository institution, at the time of the conversion, must have deposits insured by the FDIC. In addition, the depository institution, in accomplishing the conversion, must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations, including, without limitation, the insurance fund conversion moratorium provisions set forth at section 5(d) of the FDIA. The OTS has broad legal authority with respect to Federal savings associations under section 5(a) of the HOLA, which authorizes the Director of the OTS, under such regulations as the Director may prescribe, to, inter alia , provide for the organization, incorporation, examination, operation, and regulation of Federal savings associations. Section 5(a) of the HOLA provides the OTS with plenary authority over Federal savings associations, and, as the Supreme Court has noted, it would be difficult for Congress to give a broader mandate. 17 17 See Fidelity Federal Savings and Loan Association v. de la Cuesta , 458 U.S. 141, 161 (1982) (scope of authority of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the predecessor agency to the OTS). The OTS notes that section 5(i)(1) of the HOLA provides specific authorization for ``[a]ny savings association which is, or is eligible to become, a member of a Federal home loan bank'' to ``convert into a Federal savings association,'' subject to such regulations as the Director may prescribe. Immediately prior to the enactment of FIRREA, section 5(i)(1) of the HOLA permitted any ``institution'' which is, or is eligible to become, a member of a Federal home loan bank to convert to a Federal savings and loan association or Federal savings bank, subject to the regulations of the FHLBB. FIRREA revised the language of section 5(i)(1) of the HOLA from any ``institution'' which is, or is eligible to become, a member of a Federal home loan bank, to any ``savings association'' that met such criteria. However, the OTS's review of the legislative history of FIRREA has revealed no intent on the part of Congress in the FIRREA to limit the types of depository institutions that may convert to a Federal savings association charter. Instead, it appears that the change in the ``institution'' terminology in section 5(i)(1) of the HOLA was inadvertent, and occurred when the term ``insured institution,'' occurring throughout the HOLA, was changed in FIRREA to ``savings association.'' Accordingly, the use of the OTS's authority under section 5(a) of the HOLA to broaden the class of depository institutions that are eligible for a Federal charter is not inconsistent with the FIRREA amendments to section 5(i)(1) of the HOLA. New section 552.2&hyph;6 enables commercial banks and other depository institutions to accomplish directly what they have previously been able to accomplish indirectly. For example, in many cases, a state bank or other depository institution may, under state law, convert to a state-chartered savings bank, or a state-chartered savings association, which may, consistent with state law and section 5(i) of the HOLA (or, in some cases, section 5(o) of the HOLA), convert to a Federal savings association or a Federal savings bank. Similarly, a commercial bank or other depository institution may cause the chartering of a Federal association, and then transfer its assets and liabilities to the savings association.
