The prime minister replied to reporters' questions, taught them to be constructive, grieved over his poor pedagogical skills, bored everyone to death with his lengthy replies, and censored himself. [RESPUBLIKA] With which newspaper do you begin your day? [Slezevicius] I regret that V. Baublys, chief of the government press service, surveys only exceptional issues. I myself have very few opportunities for reading, although I used to read all newspapers earlier. [RESPUBLIKA] After the events in the woods near Kaunas [reference to volunteer mutiny], you signed a resolution sending J. Gecas, chief of staff at the Volunteer National Defense Service [SKAT], and commander E. Nazelskis for training to the Czech Republic. This is a promotion rather than a punishment. [Slezevicius] It is very good that people seek education. I do not think that J. Gecas played a great negative role in this story. Can all SKAT leaders be doomed to infinite remorse for something that occurred in one unit? J. Gecas has resigned his position. We will decide separately how to utilize his skills. [RESPUBLIKA] J. Gecas is the current acting deputy defense minister, and a few days ago he was appointed chairman of the SKAT officers' certification commission.... [Slezevicius] I am not familiar with this situation. [RESPUBLIKA] What is the fate of V. Zedelis, chief of the department for the protection of government secrets? RESPUBLIKA has already reported about his repeated visits to the prosecutor's office in Vilnius concerning the possibilities of B. Dekanidze's [suspected of journalist Lingys' murder] release. [Slezevicius] His services will be declined. [RESPUBLIKA] You lead not only the government but also the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP]. What influence may the developing collapse in the LDDP faction have on your position in the government? [Slezevicius] What is the basis for your talks about a collapse? Only three people out of 70 have left the LDDP faction. There have been many complicated discussions over the last nine months. My agrarian policy not always meets with support from my party colleagues. Sometimes the latter maintain that I am too liberal, or that I lack social democracy. My reply to all critics inside and outside the party is as follows: The formation of a free market alone can ensure economic stability, while the latter allows the implementation of social democratic ideas through distribution. We are enacting this very consistently. Social tensions have eased slightly, because we have managed to achieve a real, although insignificant, increase in real incomes. [RESPUBLIKA] Do you believe that the law on the stability of the litas will be adopted? The draft law alone forced the Lithuanian Bank to defend itself. A future confrontation between the government and the bank is inevitable. [Slezevicius] If I did not believe in the adoption of this law, I would not present it. One thing is obvious: Lithuania's economy cannot be a hostage of banks, primarily commercial ones. Last July and August, the economy received a painful blow due to the ruining effect of the unstable litas. Now the Central Bank has exhausted all possibilities for ensuring its stable exchange rate. The negative effect of our proposal is that the government is losing the possibility of replenishing the budget or removing its deficit from the Central Bank reserves. Mr. Visokavicius [former central bank chairman] has taught the government the art of banking. We realized the negative effect of the Central Bank on the economy too late. This is my great mistake. It is no accident that R. Visokavicius was the most honorable guest at the conservatives' congress.... [RESPUBLIKA] Who left the bugging equipment in his office? [Slezevicius] Mr. R. Visokavicius' reaction was strange. His statements were as though based on rumor. Maybe, he left the equipment there himself.... But this is not for the press. I am saying this by taking advantage of the right of the chief editor position. [RESPUBLIKA] You have submitted a draft law to the Seimas [parliament] which establishes a 35-percent income tax alongside a 30-percent social insurance tax. Are you trying to cover the hole in the budget with this terrible patch in advance? [Slezevicius] This law has been drafted by the social democrats, and we do not coordinate our policies with them. We are not as bad as the social democrats. We are more socially oriented. Taxes should be collected in a better way rather than increased now. By the way, taxes and crime are very much linked together. [RESPUBLIKA] Why is the LDDP opposing the adoption of the law on income declaration so strongly then? [Slezevicius] I am not well informed about the Seimas' current debates on this issue. It is difficult to follow everything. [RESPUBLIKA] The Seimas proposed the resignation of your appointed minister while discussing the agrarian issue. Despite your disapproval, the Seimas adopted a law on the improvement of the difficult situation in agriculture. If the opinions of the government and the Seimas were really different, how will things be with agriculture? [Slezevicius] It will survive. The situation was better three years ago, but we will not return to it. It is obvious that agriculture requires assistance. It is also evident that the new laws do not resolve anything. [RESPUBLIKA] Will you not implement this law? [Slezevicius] There is nothing to implement, and the law is good because of this, while the government is obedient. [passage omitted] [RESPUBLIKA] It seems that the current security policy can be called that of "Bobelis-Jurgelis" [chiefs of the Seimas Foreign Affairs Committee and the security service]. However, no one knows what it is like. Do you have your own idea about this issue? [Slezevicius] One thing is clear: We can try to protect ourselves, but we are not able to accomplish this. Therefore, our national security concept should be our integration with European defense structures. During the meeting of the Baltic prime ministers, we discussed the necessity of a better defense of our eastern borders and the easing of border regime between the Baltic countries. [RESPUBLIKA] Don't you think that the national security concept should advocate an increased birthrate? [Slezevicius] I am not educated enough to grasp the link between the birthrate and national security. I think that the birthrate is associated more with our possibilities of supplying heat and electric energy. This is what we are doing to expand our reproduction.
