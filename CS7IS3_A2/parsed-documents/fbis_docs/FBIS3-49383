President Michal Kovac raised the issue of a wider coalition in his New Year's address, and opposition parties as well as part of the coalition Slovak National Party (SNS) supported the idea. The programme for the April 1993 SNS conference in Ruzomberok, Central Slovakia, included the idea of a wider coalition, SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak said today. The 1994 budget vote, which took place in last December, tested the coalition's strength, HZDS Deputy Hvezdon Koctuch said. The opposition aimed at the rejection of the budget, which they had hoped would result in a vote of no confidence in the government and Meciar, Koctuch said, adding that in this way the opposition would achieve its alleged aim that some other politician represent Slovakia as premier during the coming talks between U.S. President Bill Clinton and representatives of the Visegrad countries (Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary and Poland). Meciar is open to cooperation, said SNS Deputy Chairman Jozef Prokes, who had attended the meeting as a guest of honour. Prokes is a member of the SNS parliamentary group, which favours the HZDS-SNS coalition at all costs. Cernak belongs to the SNS national democratic parliamentary group lobbying for a wider coalition.
