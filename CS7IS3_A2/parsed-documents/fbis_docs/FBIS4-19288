Austria would actively support this as a member of the European Union [EU], Mock said before the group of the European People's Party. On the same day, the 800-page text of the treaty of accession was delivered to the members of parliament. Mock appealed to the deputies: "Vote for Austria on 4 May! In this way, you will create the decisive prerequisite for us to jointly develop the Europe of tomorrow." Chancellor Franz Vranitzky also wooed the Europeans. In a letter, the Social Democratic Party of Austria chairman politely asked his party colleagues to advocate sufficient participation of the Social Democratic members of the European Parliament in the decisive vote. Moreover, Vranitzky asked Vice Chancellor Busek to step in for him at the hearing of the four candidate countries before the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday, since he will be unable to attend because of his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
