In addition, in the 1992 Order, Entergy, ESI, System Fuels, and EOI are authorized to participate in the Money Pool through November 30, 1994. The Money Pool is composed of available funds invested by the companies that participate in the Money Pool, which funds can be borrowed by those companies other than Entergy to meet their respective interim capital requirements. In orders dated June 5, 1990 (HCAR No. 25100) and April 29, 1992 (HCAR No. 25526), and in the 1992 Order, EOI is authorized through November 30, 1994 to (i) borrow from Entergy up to $15 million pursuant to a June 6, 1990 loan agreement (``EOI Loan Agreement'') and an additional $5 million over which the Commission has reserved jurisdiction and (ii) enter into loan agreements with banks to reduce the amount Entergy committed to EOI under the EOI Loan Agreement.

In orders dated September 17, 1991 (HCAR No. 25376) and October 23, 1991 (HCAR No. 25395), and in the 1992 Order, ESI is authorized through November 30, 1994 to (i) borrow from Entergy up $90 million pursuant to a September 18, 1994 loan agreement (``ESI Loan Agreement'') and (ii) enter into loan agreements with banks to reduce the amount of Entergy committed to ESI under the Loan Agreement. Loans under the ESI Loan Agreement are evidenced by a note that matures on November 30, 1994 (``ESI Note''), which obligates ESI to remit the full $90 million or the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all loans thereunder. The Utilities and SERI propose to continue to finance their interim capital needs through loans from the Money Pool and through the issuance and sale of unsecured short-term notes and commercial paper through November 30, 1996. The maximum amount of loans, notes, and commercial paper would be $243 million for AP&L, $395 million for GSU, $236 million for LP&L, $108 million for MP&L, $39 million for NOPSI, and $195 million for SERI. Entergy, ESI, EOI, and System Fuels propose to continue to participate in the Money Pool through November 30, 1996. In addition, EOI and Entergy propose to (i) extend the EOI Loan Agreement and the EOI Note through November 30, 1996 and (ii) extend the authorization for loan agreements with banks through November 30, 1996.

The Utilities, SERI, Entergy, ESI, EOI, and System Fuels (``Companies'') propose to participate in the Money Pool, which will continue to be administered by ESI. The Money Pool will consist of funds from the Companies loaned on a short-term basis to other Companies_besides Entergy_or invested. The Companies will not borrow funds to participate in the Money Pool. Entergy will invest in the Money Pool but under no circumstances will Entergy be permitted to borrow funds from the Money Pool. The Money Pool will be managed to match the available cash and capital requirements of the Companies to minimize the need for loans by the Companies from external sources. However, the Companies might make some short-term loans or issue some commercial paper to maintain a market presence. The Utilities and SERI will have a priority on funds from the Money Pool_ESI, System Fuels, and EOI will be permitted to borrow through the Money Pool if there are additional funds available. If the available funds in the Money Pool are insufficient for the short-term capital requirements of the Utilities or SERI, those Companies will use external loans through banks and sales of commercial paper.
