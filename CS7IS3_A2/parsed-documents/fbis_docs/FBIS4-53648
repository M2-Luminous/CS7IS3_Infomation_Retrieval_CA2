The news analyst says: The Japanese reactionaries invented a "nuclear suspicion" about the DPRK and have acted as if they were a "nuclear judge". Expressing dissatisfaction at the adequate inspections of the DPRK, they have resorted to pressure demanding a "special inspection", an "additional inspection" and kicked up a row in an effort to make the United Nations impose "sanctions" on the DPRK. They even prepared an "emergency legislative arrangement" for a dispatch of their "self-defence forces" to the Korean peninsula, talking about "response" in case the UN should adopt a resolution on "sanctions". The recent discovery of plutonium kept in hiding made it all the clearer why Japan has been so hell bent on false propaganda about "nuclear suspicion" on the DPRK. It is, indeed, a mean intrigue that Japan has engaged in hostile acts against the DPRK, spreading a groundless lie to brand it as a nuclear criminal, while keeping a large quantity of nuclear weapons- grade material in hiding. Japan, a nuclear criminal, has tried desperately to place others in the dock as a nuclear criminal, but she herself has to sit in it. Japan must stop at once her intrigues to do harm to the DPRK over the "nuclear issue", clearly declare to the international community the total amount of plutonium concealed nationwide and give up her nuclear armament.
