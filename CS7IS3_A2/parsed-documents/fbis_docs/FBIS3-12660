How do you assess the U.S. and South Korean Governments' stance on this? [Choe Yong-no] In order to assess this issue, we should seek the roots of the matter and basically see on what basis the nuclearization of the Korean peninsula is discussed. The issue of the nuclearization of the Korean peninsula should be assessed from two positions. The first is that the United States has deployed its most advanced arms in South Korea and since these arms threaten our country, it is necessary for us to arm ourselves. The second is that this is an American plot. By fabricating various documents the United States has sparked a commotion on the manufacturing of nuclear arms in North Korea. We have repeatedly stated that we do not have any wish to manufacture such weapons, that we have no potential in this field, and that we do not wish to manufacture these items. We still do not have a nuclear power plant in our country. There is only one research center and a few small reactors that we are using for tests. This center has some needs that had to be met before a nuclear power plant could become operational, for which these reactors were used. Related to this, the IAEA has inspected our country many times and has stressed that our nuclear policy is completely peaceful and there is no doubt in this. A few years after these inspections they inspected our military bases and said that we manufactured nuclear arms there. This is a blatant U.S. plot; this superpower is constantly looking for a pretext. Unfortunately, the IAEA has become a U.S. puppet, is pursuing a policy of double standards toward our country, and is accusing us of being in the process of nuclearization. This is at a time when some U.S. minions such as Israel and South Africa are equipped with the most advanced nuclear weapons and the West--the United States--is not acting against them in any way. We cannot tolerate their policy of double standards and hostility, and have thus told them that they should rectify their unjust stance. For this reason, last March we stated that we would be leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. We have repeatedly stated that the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula should be solved through direct talks. Until now we have had two official talks and several talks at the level of Korean and U.S. experts. Recently the United States has trampled on all the agreements and issues to which we had reached a conclusion. Thus, the talks on the nuclear issue have been overtly placed at an impasse. In our opinion, the United States has no intention to solve the nuclear issue through peaceful means but is mostly interested in solving the issue through force and pressure. For this reason, our country has issued a statement underlining our decisive stances. Among the reasons that led to the above statement was the fact that the United States trampled on all the agreements that we had reached in New York. American acts and approaches are considered blatant crimes and a flagrant violation of international resolutions. We once again stress that we do not wish to hold further talks with the United States. Also, we hope that the government and people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is our good ally, will stand next to us. If today we submit to America's incorrect acts, tomorrow it will be the turn of Iran, and then another country, to be placed under America's yoke. [Correspondent] As you know, the government of Pyongyang recently expressed its concern over the launching of Japan's H-2 satellite and has said that this act shows that Japan's military strength has reached a sensitive point. How do you assess this issue? [Choe] This issue is connected more with Japan's militarism. The Japanese are more active than anyone else in the manufacture of nuclear arms. A few days ago we received news that the Japanese will begin operation of a nuclear accelerator reactor. This reactor is the third such reactor in the world. The Japanese have stored a large quantity of plutonium and these reactors can manufacture several thousand nuclear bombs. This is considered a dangerous act in eastern Asia because the launching of a space satellite is mostly connected with the collection of information on regional countries. Therefore, regional countries are worried about such aggressive acts. The Japanese are the first and only country to have been harmed by the nuclear bomb. Therefore, they should not seek to develop such arms, in view of their bitter experience, and should be more interested in nuclear disarmament and the end of mass destruction. [Correspondent] As you know, Mr. Ambassador, in Europe, which the Westerners consider the cradle of civilization, a war of attrition and dangerous genocide is taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What is your country's stance on the Serbs' crimes and savageries and on the silence of international forums? [Choe] International forums have focused their attention on the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem. We want a solution to the war and the conflicts in the region through peaceful means without any massacres. Unfortunately it is very regrettable that international forums are silent and have failed to solve the problem. [Correspondent] In view of the fact that you were considered a Soviet ally, what are relations like with regional countries, especially Russia, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union? [Choe] Trade with Russia continues and relations are the same. We also have political-commercial relations with the CIS members. We had one embassy in Moscow in the past. Now we have several embassies in the region. Since peace, friendship, and the preservation of the independence of all countries is part of our foreign policy, we have no problems in establishing relations with any country that respects the principle of mutual rights. As for Russia, there is no place for worry. Relations are good. But there is one thing that should be noted and that is that Mr. Yeltsin should not follow America around too much and make some effort to stand on his own two feet. [Correspondent] In view of your country's economic growth, in which direction is your country moving: toward industrialization, agriculture, or...? [ellipsis as published] [Choe] On the basis of President Kim Il-song's policies, our basic policy grants priority to heavy industries, while light industries and agriculture are second in priority. On the basis of this theory, we have sought to develop the country for two to three decades. Last year we witnessed the end of the Third Seven-Year Plan. However, we have set the period beginning this year and the next three years as a period during which we will prepare the next plan. During these three years, we will grant more priority to agriculture, light industries, and trade. [Correspondent] How much of your technology depends on foreign countries and how much operates independently? [Choe] We supply our needs mostly from domestic resources. However, we import some of the raw materials that we lack in our country. Our country definitely lacks some industrial installations such as petrochemical refineries. Therefore, we have to import these installations and complexes from other countries. [Correspondent] Which country does your country primarily depend on? [Choe] Our economic relations cannot be described as being dependent on one country. We have trade relations with Asian countries and especially with neighboring countries. Before the end of the 1980's we had extensive trade and industrial relations with the Eastern Bloc. After the disintegration of Eastern Europe, our current relations were automatically created. But it is not as though our major trade and economic relations were dependent on Eastern Europe. It should be noted that we have no relations with the United States and Japan because both these countries have a colonialist attitude and have imposed economic sanctions on our country for decades. Thus, our nation does not have any good feelings about these two countries. Since the 1950's, the United States has been implementing its imperialistic policy toward us. It has always been seeking to destroy our socialist system, and in many cases we have been threatened by them. The Americans have stationed themselves to the south of our country and are striving to occupy and destroy the Korean peninsula and are always plotting their objectives. [Correspondent] How are relations with your neighbors and what is your country's foreign policy concerning your neighbors? [Choe] We have good relations with countries like China, with which we share common borders. We have traditionally had good relations with our neighbors. However, there is strong dislike between us and the Japanese because of the great crimes they perpetrated against our country and people during World War II, which can never be forgotten. [Correspondent] What is the per capita income, the gross national product in your country? [Choe] Because our country's general policy focuses on the people's welfare, emphasis is placed on increased production and the government's policy is to ensure good living conditions for the people. We have adopted various methods to increase our GNP, but I am not aware of its precise figure. I should say that our country is basically different from other countries because our government does not tax the people; as far as I know, there is no other country that does not tax its people. Education is compulsory and free in our country. University education is also free and everyone can attend. We call this method that has been put forth by our leaders as a "policy of affection," which is aimed at friendship with the people. Needless to say, our surplus GNP is used to meet the people's needs. [Correspondent] What measures have you considered taking to replace tax revenues? [Choe] The surplus GNP and any other government income is set aside for the next year and some percent of the general GNP is used instead of tax revenues to meet the people's needs and to run the government. Another point that should be explained is that JAHAN-E ESLAM is known to our people. The majority of our people are acquainted with it and always consider your newspaper to be among the frontline newspapers. On 19 March your newspaper published a commentary on our country's nuclear issue, which coincided with our decision to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Many countries placed pressures on us to return to this pact. In your commentary you said that U.S. pressure was the reason we decided to leave the pact and that other countries are wrong to insist that we return. Your newspaper's commentary was cited in our country. This shows that your newspaper was sufficiently aware of the crisis and recent incidents. We hope that your newspaper will carefully reflect the official stance of our government, nation, and country.
