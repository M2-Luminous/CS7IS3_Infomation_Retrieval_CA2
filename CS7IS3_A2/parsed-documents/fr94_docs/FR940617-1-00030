ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the form of an amended tentative final monograph that would establish conditions under which over-the-counter (OTC) topical health-care antiseptic drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. FDA is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the previous notice of proposed rulemaking on topical antimicrobial drug products (see the Federal Register of January 6, 1978, 43 FR 1210) after considering the public comments on that notice and other information in the administrative record for this rulemaking. FDA is also requesting data and information concerning the safety and effectiveness of topical antimicrobials for use as hand sanitizers or dips. This proposal is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA. DATES: Written comments, objections, or requests for an oral hearing on the proposed regulation before the Commissioner of Food and Drugs by December 14, 1994. Because of the length and complexity of this proposed regulation, the agency is allowing a period of 180 days for comments and objections instead of the normal 60 days. New data by June 19, 1995. Comments on the new data by August 17, 1995. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination by December 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments, objections, new data, or requests for an oral hearing to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William E. Gilbertson, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD&hyph;810), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;594&hyph;5000. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of September 13, 1974 (39 FR 33103), FDA published, under §330.10(a)(6) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(6)), an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a monograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products, together with the recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Topical Antimicrobial I Drug Products (Antimicrobial I Panel), which was the advisory review panel responsible for evaluating data on the active ingredients in this drug class. Interested persons were invited to submit comments by November 12, 1974. Reply comments in response to comments filed in the initial comment period could be submitted by December 12, 1974. In response to numerous requests, the agency issued a notice in the Federal Register of October 17, 1974 (39 FR 37066) granting an extension of the deadline for comments until December 12, 1974, and for reply comments until January 13, 1975.
