Defense Minister Yi also said that the ROK purchase of Russian weaponry was not discussed. The ROK had a lot of expectations on the talks on the issue of defense industry technological cooperation. The Russian side was also reported to have expected the ROK to show a minimum positive response to the issue of purchasing Russian weaponry. However, neither side scored any gains in what it had hoped for. Meanwhile, the ROK Defense Ministry source released a report in Seoul at about the same time saying that the defense ministers of the two countries agreed at the talks on that day that the two countries would build a system for assistance in defense industry technological cooperation. Since this was not a slight difference between the two reports over the same fact that could occur in the course of conveying the report, it should not be regarded as a communication error. One of the two must have lied, exaggerated, or concealed the truth. Noteworthy is the fact that an incident of this nature occurred again two weeks after a similar one regarding ROK relations with Russia. The report released by the ROK Foreign Ministry immediately after ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu had talks with Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev in Moscow on 14 April was that Russia agreed to actively cooperate with the ROK on the problem of the North Koreans escaping from the logging site in the Russian Far East. The truth, as it turned out later, was that Russia only reconfirmed its previous principled position. ROK Embassy officials in Moscow are very embarrassed at the reports which are openly released in this manner distorting the fact and interpreting everything to one's own advantage. We worry about the possible tendency in the government to have an illusion that Russia may accede to our demands easily because of its deteriorated prestige and debt to the ROK, or to think lightly of Russia. We should prevent a recurrence of an incident in which the people are fooled and the country loses face by pretending that there was success when there was no success.
