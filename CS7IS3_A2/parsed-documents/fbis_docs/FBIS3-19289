U.S. President Bill Clinton, who suggested the conference last year, considers the meeting a first step "toward starting a dialogue with our international partners that will open up ways for sound economic conditions" for the 21st century. The German delegation will include Ministers Waigel, Bluem, and Rexrodt. As the current unemployment problem is mainly a structural one, Bonn thinks that "the exchange of ideas on flexibility and deregulation, training, the importance of labor costs, as well as opportunities of labor policy" ought to be the central issues of the talks. Bonn wants to refer to the plans laid down in the government's paper on Germany as a business location, which have been partially put into practice already, on how to do away with obstacles to employment by rigid labor market strategies. In addition, the German ministers want to ask the other countries at the Detroit conference to enforce the results of the GATT free trade talks consistently. In the long run, protectionism does not secure any jobs but endangers them, the German conference paper says. With these positions, Bonn seems to be wanting to counteract U.S. intentions to make the Bundesbank's interest rate policy a central issue in Detroit. In the days prior to the conference, U.S. politicians repeatedly pointed out that the U.S. economy is on a course of sound economic growth, which has already led to a reduction in unemployment from almost 8 to 6.5 percent. Now it is time for the European and Japanese economies to be boosted. In particular, U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers has voiced such demands prior to the "Job Summit." Lower German interest rates would be an important contribution to strengthening demand in Europe, he said. [passage omitted]
