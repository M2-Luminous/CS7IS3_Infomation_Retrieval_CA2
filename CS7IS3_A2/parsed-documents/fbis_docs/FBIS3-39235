"I stick to my flowering landscapes. But it will take somewhat longer than we originally expected," Kohl said at the annual reception of the Southwest Saxony Chamber of Commerce in Chemnitz on Friday [11 February]. While investment is declining in western Germany, it is increasing sharply in the new laender. East German public and private per capita investment is already higher than the western German one. With these investments, together with future-oriented technology and know-how, eastern Germany creates opportunities for the whole of Germany, Kohl said. Kohl called upon banks to get more involved in the construction of the east Germany economy. He deplored that they were only hesitatingly fulfilling their promise to participate in Trust Agency companies with 1 billion German marks [DM]. The insurance companies, on the other hand, have kept their promise to contribute DM1 billion. Kohl said that the banks should become more of a partner to small and medium-sized companies in eastern Germany and should take more account of the fact that the economy is still being developed when rating companies' creditworthiness. The people in the east have not had the opportunity to collect capital for 40 years in order to offer the securities that banks ask for today. After the reception, Kohl discussed Chemnitz as an industrial location, unemployment, and vocational training with trade union representatives, representatives of the chamber, and Mayor Peter Seifert. A meeting was agreed on 2 March, where representatives of the Chancellor's Office and Chemnitz authorities will discuss a regional project to fight long-term unemployment.
