This means an annual increase of just 1100 ha! When the National Wasteland Development Board was set up in 1985, the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi announced that five million hectares would be greened every year. Subsequently this target was dropped as too tall and unrealistic an order. At the forest ministers conference on Monday, Environment and Forest Minister Kamal Nath said only 2 million ha a year could be greened. But going by the Forest Survey of India report even this is a tall order. This indicates that the survival rate of the new plantations is not as glorious as recorded and the amount of forest land being diverted for so-called development projects is more than what is planted. While the forest cover in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh Karnataka, Kerala, Nagaland, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andaman and Nicobar islands has increased, it has decreased in Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa. Daman and Diu, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalayas, Mizoram and Orissa. Reports from the seven North Eastern States are in particular depressing. While the dense forest cover (crown density of 40 per cent) increased by 31 sq km between 1991 and 1993, there was a decrease of 666 sq km in the open forest cover (crown density of 10 to less than 40 per cent) area. The worst culprits are Assam, which has 243 sq km less of forests, Mizoram -- less by 156 sq kms, Meghalaya -- less by 106 sq km, Arunachal Pradesh -- less by 96 sq km. In all North Eastern states forests continue to be devastated by shifting cultivation of jhoom [rotational crop planting] operation despite the Central government's efforts to stop jhoom. While 702 sq km of forests was lost in these states to the traditional practise of shifting cultivation, 281 ha was lost due to other reasons. However there was regeneration in 315 ha which had been felled for cultivation. The total forest cover in the country is 6,40,107 sq km (excluding tea gardens), which is 19.47 per cent of the total geographical area of the country.
