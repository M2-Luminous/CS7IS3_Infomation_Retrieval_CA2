"The traitor 'Arafat will not be the only one to pay the price over this massacre, Jews in their synagogues will also pay," the Revolutionary Army for the Liberation of Palestine said in a statement received here by AFP. The group, which is opposed to the PLO-Israeli autonomy accord signed last September, emerged several months ago. It said in an Arabic-written statement it would assume full responsibility for eliminating 'Arafat, adding that it had already judged him. The Hebron massacre was the result of the "odious policies of the United States, and its allies, namely (Egyptian President) Husni Mubarak," the group said. One or more settlers shot dead 58 Palestinians and wounded dozens more when they opened fire inside a mosque at the Tomb of the Patriarchs, which was packed for prayers during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
