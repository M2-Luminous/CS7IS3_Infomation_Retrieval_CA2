Babayan; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] According to the approved agenda, parliamentarians [of the Crimean Supreme Council] are to deal with two issues: The first issue deals with the composition and structure of the Crimean Cabinet of Ministers. The second issue deals with giving decrees by President Meshkov the status of laws of the Crimean Republic, but only in cases when they refer to the issues that are not temporarily reflected in the Constitution of the Crimean state. Speaking to Supreme Council deputies, Yuriy Meshkov said that their civic duty is to approve the proposed composition and structure of the Crimean Government as soon as possible. Meshkov continued and warned the deputies that otherwise the Cabinet of Ministers will be approved by a special decree of the president. In doing so, he referred to the March opinion poll of the population. Deputies had an extremely negative reaction to the ultimatum-like statement by their president. In their opinion, Yuriy Meshkov does not have the right to approve the structure and membership of the Cabinet of Ministers by his decree. Incidentally, parliamentarians stated that the president's referral to the poll of the population is not convincing, as a poll is not a referendum and consequently its results should not be regarded as the will of the peninsula's citizens. Crimean parliamentarians are convinced that such behavior on the part of Yuriy Meshkov pursues only one goal--to establish a regime of dictatorship in the Crimea.
