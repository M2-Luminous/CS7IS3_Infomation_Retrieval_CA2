Li Peng, Hu Jintao, Qian Qichen, Zhang Zhen, Qin Jiwei, Cheng Siyuan, Li Peiyao, Yang Rudai, Wang Zhaoguo, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigmei, Sepydin Aza, Hong Xuezhi, Wan Guoquan and others attended the commemorations, or had their pictures taken with representatives of the military academy's alumni prior to the commemorations. Li Ruihuan addressed the meeting. He began his speech by extending the CPC Central Committee's warm greetings and sincere regards to the alumni and to the academy's teachers and cadets at home and abroad. Li Ruihuan said: Huangpu Military Academy was founded 70 years ago by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and Chinese communists represented by Zhou Enlai. Now 70 years have gone by and the Chinese people led by the CPC and Comrade Mao Zedong have accomplished the democratic revolution, which Dr. Sun Yat-sen did not accomplish, and developed this revolution into a socialist revolution. Achieving our motherland's peaceful reunification accords with the will of the people, it is what our nation wants, and it is also a sacred mission for Chinese people of all nationalities, including our countrymen in Taiwan. I hope Huangpu alumni on the two sides of the strait will unite and contribute more to our motherland's reunification and China's revitalization. (full text of the speech will be transmitted separately) Addressing the commemoration, Li Moan, vice president of the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association, said: In the past we joined the whole nation in fighting the big powers and eliminating the warlords. Earthshaking changes have now taken place in our great motherland, and people throughout the country are advancing triumphantly under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Since its founding 10 years ago, the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association has been making unswerving efforts to foster the academy's spirit, establish ties with alumni, promote the motherland's reunification, and to dedicate itself to revitalizing China. Our association has already established contacts with nearly 1,000 alumni in Taiwan as well as alumni in more than 10 countries and regions. When contacting alumni in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and overseas areas, our association has seized every opportunity to expound the nation's policy toward Taiwan -- a policy characterized by "peaceful reunification; and one country, two systems." We have also done many things useful for the introduction of capital, technology, and proficient personnel; and for promoting the development of relations and exchanges between the two sides of the strait. Zhou Lejun, a Huangpu alumnus from Taiwan, also addressed the occasion. He said: The meritorious services which Huangpu alumni performed during the eastern and northern expeditions and the War of Resistance Against Japan have gone down in history. We are pleased to note the exchanges between alumni on the two sides of the strait today. We should broaden our vision and, as brothers, we should by no means be engaged in quarrel. We are absolutely against separation; and even more so are we against intervention by foreign forces and the obstruction of our great motherland's reunification. I hope Huangpu alumni will work hard together so that the great cause of reunification can be achieved at an early date. The commemoration meeting was called by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee. Ye Xuanping, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, chaired the meeting, which was attended by Huangpu alumni at home and from abroad and people of all walks of life in Beijing -- more than 500 in total. In the evening, the CPPCC National Committee and the CPC Central Committee United Front Department hosted a banquet at the Great Hall of the People to mark the 70th founding anniversary of the Huangpu Military Academy and the 10th anniversary of the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association. Wang Zhaoguo delivered a toast at the banquet.
