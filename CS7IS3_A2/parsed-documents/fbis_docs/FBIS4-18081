Following his statements about Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, the Munich public prosecutor's office must examine whether or not Schoenhuber committed the crime of incitement. The statements by the former television journalist are "indeed apt to disturb public peace," Vogel said in an interview on Saarland Radio on Thursday [24 March]. Yesterday SPD Deputy Chairwoman Herta Daeubler-Gmelin and Christian Democratic Union Secretary General Peter Hintze demanded criminal sanctions. Leading Free Democratic Party of Germany politicians were outraged about Schoenhuber's "shameless language and insulting comments." The right-wing extremist had accused Bubis of "instigating people," because Bubis had said that right-wing extremists were the "intellectual arsonists" of the attack on the synagogue in Luebeck. Even though Bubis does not want to file a complaint against Schoenhuber, if investigations are carried out for the crime of incitement, as Vogel demands, the public prosecutor's office could act even without a formal complaint.
