He said that only much smaller crystals for scientific experiments have so far been made. He said the 1 square-centimeter, single-crystal 15 nanometer-thin (one nanometer equals one-billionth of a meter) film, made by using the so-called ionized cluster beam (icb) method, is highly resistant to heat and radioactivity and has the potential for integration. Details of the discovery will be announced at an academic meeting on fullerene to be held Thursday in Tokyo. Mitsubishi Electric found in early 1992 that the next generation of carbon materials could be used for semiconductors. The spokesman said the company will now try to develop a transistor device using the fullerene thin film. Analysts say the material may also be applied to optical materials and catalysts, he said.
