Statistics show that in the latter half of last year, five sets of local regulations governing the operation of the Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone were established and promulgated. Officials said the new regulations are expected to give an impetus to the growth of overseas investment. Other local laws and regulations include the Tianjin Commodity Market regulations, the Tianjin Technical Market regulations, the social security regulations and the management law governing religious sites in Tianjin City. Legislative officials said it still remained a hard task for them to make laws and regulations urgently needed by a growing socialist market economy. "They were so urgently needed that we cannot wait and must redouble our efforts to do our job well," said an official with the Standing Committee of the Tianjin Municipal People's Congress. With support from the municipal government, they have investigated current conditions and consulted with many departments concerned. They also listened to opinions of different parties and experts before the laws and regulations were passed.
