Interested in increasing its commercial ties with Asian countries, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry has included Vietnam among the countries with which it intends to step up trade. Situated in a region showing the highest commercial growth rate in the world, Vietnam, from Itamarati's viewpoint, may also become an important Brazilian partner in the oil field. Cats In the next few months the first Brazilian commercial mission will travel to Vietnam to seek new markets for the Brazilian exporters. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said: "Brazil does not want to remain behind. This is why we want to approach the Asian tigers while they are still cats." He explained that the government wants to step up commercial relations with the remaining countries of the region, as is already the case with China. Currently, trade with Asia represents only 16 percent of the total volume of Brazilian imports and exports. Amorin said: "Those countries' potential is enormous, and we want to secure a good portion of that market." The minister revealed that the Brazilian mission will also have a political nature. The Brazilian Government wants to establish an embassy in Hanoi to show that it intends to tighten diplomatic relations between the two countries. Currently, the Brazilian Embassy in Singapore is in charge of the diplomatic contacts with Vietnam. A diplomat in charge of arranging the visit to Vietnam commented: "Above all, the Brazilian mission has an exploratory nature. We know little about that country and want to open new commercial fronts." According to the diplomat, by opening its economy, Vietnam will offer Brazilian businessmen new opportunities, especially in the foodstuff and heavy machinery fields. He added: "During the first talks we had regarding the trip, local authorities recalled that Vietnam has already purchased Brazilian-made tractors, but that they lack spare parts for them." Last year Brazilian exports to that country amounted to $4.2 million, while imports amounted to approximately $13.5 million. During the first three months of 1993, Brazil imported some $2.7 million worth of rice which is equivalent to 11,900 tonnes of rice. The chemical and industrial equipment industries were responsible for most of the Brazilian exports to Vietnam. Petroleum Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], Braspetro [Petrobras International, Inc.], and Furnas [Furnas Electric Power Plant, Inc.] have expressed interest in the mission due to Vietnam's oil reserves. Representatives of the three companies will comprise the mission that will leave for Vietnam during the second half of April. Petrobras has already informed the Brazilian diplomats that it wants to contact Vietnamese enterprises of the lubricant industry. Brazilian construction companies are also interested in Vietnam, with a population of some 70 million inhabitants, that is in the process of consolidating the adoption of a market economy. The Andrade Gutierrez, Camargo Correia, and Norberto Odebrecht companies will also be represented in the commercial mission. Andrade Gutierrez Director General Ildeu Olyntho de Freitas asserted: "We are closely watching the opening of the Vietnamese economy and want more information on the fields in which we can work." He admitted the possibility of the company participating in the construction of infrastructure projects in that Asian country. The businessman said: "Right now, we know little about Vietnam but we want to work in that region."
