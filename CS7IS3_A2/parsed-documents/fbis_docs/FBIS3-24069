Kosterev, first deputy chairman of the Primorgeolkom (Maritime Kray Geological Committee): "Stores of Mineral Resources Are Being Depleted Rapidly; Geological Service Today Is on the Brink of Collapse; Urgent Measures Are Needed To Retain Highly Qualified Personnel"] [Text] Does Russia need a geological service? This question is being asked more and more often by specialists who have dedicated their entire life to a difficult profession. The economic crisis has dealt a powerful blow to very important industries. But only time-servers can be indifferent to the curtailment in prospecting work. Because geology is fundamental to the mineral-raw material base of any industrial power. Therefore, it has always enjoyed the support of the state. Let us look at history. In the period of the origin of capitalism in Russia, the tsarist government organized a central geological institution--the Geological Committee--to supply developing industry with mineral raw materials. The committee was instructed to conduct general geological study of the territory all the way to the Pacific Ocean. The work of the Geolkom [Geological Committee] was participated in by prominent geologist-scientists A.P. Karpinskiy and V.A. Obruchev, and E.E. Anert, a mineral prospector of the Far East, especially Maritime Kray. By 1914 the principles of knowledge of the geological structure of Russia had been laid and many deposits of mineral resources discovered. After the civil war, in order to restore the destroyed economy, once again it was mineral fuels (coal, peat, oil) that were needed most of all, but also iron, nonferrous metals, and precious metals. Life raised the question of creating a multicomponent mineral-raw material base for the country. But there were not enough specialists. Geological VUZ's [higher educational institutions] and faculties began to be established in many cities of Russia, including Vladivostok. The network of industrial geological organizations was expanding. Numerous trusts were established in place of the geological committee. One of them appeared in Vladivostok. As a result, in two decades of development of geological work, the powerful mineral-raw materials base of the Soviet Union was established. It provided the industry of our country with all that was necessary by the start of the Great Patriotic War. During the war years geological exploration, although cut back, did not stop. Many specialists, despite the enormous human losses at the front, were not drafted into the regular army for the sake of new discoveries of minerals. Immediately after the war prospecting work began to gather even more steam--especially in Siberia and the Far East. Practically in the postwar period a mineral base was created in the Far East and Transbaykal region for the mining of tin, tungsten, polymetals, fluor-spar, boron, uranium, rare metals, gold, and building materials. On the whole in the country thousands of deposits of minerals needed by industry and agriculture were discovered and prospected. But only dilettantes could have been complacent when they decided that the large backlog of stores of all minerals was more than they could cope with and, consequently, searches and prospecting for new deposits could be cut back for many years (or entirely stopped). It must not be forgotten that after the October Revolution we used discoveries acquired at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. At the present time we are using the results of geological prospecting of recent decades. It must be remembered that mineral resources are not limitless and that they are being irretrievably depleted. New discoveries of deposits are being made more and more frequently at great depths and in sparsely populated rayons. Often decades are spent prospecting and assimilating deposits. It is necessary to know that approximately 75 percent of the raw materials for the national economy are taken from the earth's depths. That is why it is necessary to have systematic and continuous production of all types of geological prospecting operations. It should not be forgotten that with the dissolution of the Union, Russia was left without chromium, manganese, uranium, and titanium. The current generation is obliged to create a mineral-raw material reserve in mineral resources for subsequent generations, as was done for us by our fathers and grandfathers. Central television recently reported the information that revealed reserves of gold in the interior of Russia were enough for 35 years of exploitation. As a specialist, I will say something else--gold-mining will come to a halt within three to five years if gold prospecting operations are stopped. Nevertheless, Russia's powerful geological service has been virtually destroyed. At the present time about 10 percent of the volume of work it had 10 years ago remains. Hundreds of qualified geologists, drilling technicians, and geophysicists in Maritime Kray, like in all of Russia, are being forced to look for other work. A further reduction is expected this year in centralized appropriations. The state is planning to finance geological work in a small volume on the scale of 1:200000, monitoring of the geological environment, and predicting earthquakes. A geological service is being established for this. It is planned to conduct search and prospecting for deposits at the expense of the resources of the mineral users. At the present time a federal tax is collected from enterprises that are exploiting deposits for supplying the mineral-raw material base. More specifically, for the conduct of geological prospecting work. In the next year or two this tax will in all probability be eliminated, which will lead to a further cut in the volume of exploring and prospecting for minerals. We are already planning not to go into the field this year. Available resources are being directed at curtailing and eliminating labor collectives of geological prospectors. The state has practically abandoned financing the geology industry. Therefore, several ways of reorganizing state geological organizations in the future are being examined: The shift of former expeditions to the staff of mining enterprises, the establishment of integrated geological exploitation enterprises, fully reprofiled geological organizations, or their elimination. The remaining enterprises will be converted into joint-stock companies and privatized. But geological personnel will be cut under any reorganization. The mining enterprises of Russia that need the work of geologists cannot finance them in full measure, because they themselves are living through great difficulties. Even gold mining has been reduced. Counting on foreign investments in the Russian mining industry is very illusory. After all, the world mineral raw material market was formed without taking the potential of the former USSR and Russia into account, and is saturated with raw materials at the present time, as indicated by the continuous drop in prices. Only diamonds, gold, oil, and gas are enjoying increased demand. In addition, many foreign deposits surpass ours in quality of ores and mining conditions for geological exploitation. The cost of the development of a number of deposits in Russia is more expensive than in countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Foreign investors are also frightened off by our economic disarray and political instability. Inasmuch as Russian, including Maritime, geologists have high qualifications and a lot of practical experience, they could work effectively in any foreign country. In previous years Soviet geologists (including Maritime geologists) were used successfully in dozens of countries of the world and on all continents except Australia. Under conditions of a developing market, geology in Russia has been placed in a situation of having to fight for its own survival. That is, not waiting for encouraging decisions and handouts from the top, but determining its own fate independently. The main thing for us now is to preserve the qualified pool of personnel. For we have no doubt: The country's need to intensify geological work will rise in the next few years.
