FBIS4-54057 "dreas101_a_94024" FBIS-EAS-94-101 Daily Report 25 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Hata Cabinet Registers 54 Percent Support Rate Hata Cabinet Registers 54 Percent Support Rate OW2505085194 Tokyo KYODO in English 0823 GMT 25 May 94 OW2505085194 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- Some 54.3 percent of the Japanese polled support Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's minority government one month after its inauguration, but 37.4 percent voiced disapproval, a KYODO NEWS SERVICE opinion poll showed Wednesday [25 May]. Hata's cabinet, which could be toppled by an opposition no-confidence vote at any time, came in fourth place concerning public support for new governments since the first poll in 1974 but is still far ahead of most Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) governments in the past. Higher support directly after assuming power had the cabinets of former Prime Ministers Morihiro Hosokawa with 79.0 percent, Noboru Takeshita with 58.6 percent and Zenko Suzuki reaching 58.3 percent. Hata's disapproval rate, though, exceeds by 5.5 percent the worst results for the administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata's predecessor, last March. KYODO's regular poll on political attitudes was taken in personal interviews nationwide last Saturday and Sunday covering 3,000 men and women aged 20 or more. Respondents came to 2,055 or 68.5 percent, with 47.5 percent of them being male. Taking a closer look, support for Hata as prime minister appears rather shaky as more than one-third of his supporters, 33.9 percent, said they backed him "for lack of another suitable personality." Another 31.7 percent said, though, they trust the prime minister. Of Hata opponents, 27.8 percent criticized the instability of his minority government, and another 26 percent said the prime minister lacks leadership qualities apparently reflecting the widespread notion that Shinseito policy maker Ichiro Ozawa pulls the coalition strings. But while 16.6 percent had no confidence in Hosokawa's economic policy in the last poll in March, only 6.0 percent believe Hata's economic policies are no good. Satisfaction with the economic performance of the new cabinet has obviously been boosted by Hata's freeze on unpopular hikes for public service charges. Despite Hata's experience as finance and foreign ministers, voters' expectancies in these areas are only slightly higher than for the Hosokawa government. Only 8.4 percent expect Hata to carry out political reform, down more than 10 percentage points from Hosokawa times when crucial reform bills were under deliberation in the Diet. As for party support, the largest opposition LDP and the coalition defector Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] have been able to turn around their downward trend in public support. The LDP rose from 25.4 percent to 29.7 percent and the SDPJ recovered from 8.5 percent to 12.3 percent. But while Hata's Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) made a 2.2-point gain to 14.3 percent, Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) has lost three in four supporters who opted for the party during its prime last September shortly after Hosokawa's coalition ousted the LDP after four decades in power. The JNP now stands at 4.6 percent, down 8.6 points from the previous KYODO poll, and seems doomed to play only a minor government role. Support eroded also for coalition members Komeito, backed by the Buddhist lay organization Sokka Gakkai, and the small Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). Komeito's support declined by 1.7 points to 2.7 percent, while the DSP has lost 0.6 point to a 1.3 percent support rate. Two newcomers founded by LDP defectors, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa's Jiyuto (Liberals) and New Party Mirai mustered 0.8 percent and 0.2 percent in support, respectively. New Party Sakigake [Harbinger], led by former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, which supports the Hata government but refused to join the cabinet, slipped from 7.2 percent to 6.9 percent. The opposition Japanese Communist Party (JCP) registered a slight 0.1 point decline to 2 percent. The portion of those who do not support any political party increased from 19.4 percent to 21.5 percent.
