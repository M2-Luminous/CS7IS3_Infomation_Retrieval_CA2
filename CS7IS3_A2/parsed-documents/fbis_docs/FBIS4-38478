He repeated that Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton had reached an agreement to this effect on January 14, 1994. Great Britain joined this document on February 15. By May 30 the U.S. and Great Britain must also change the flight task of their strategic nuclear missiles formerly aimed at Russian territory. However, the Strategic Missile Troops Chief Headquarter has not as yet received any confirmation that this has been carried out, Sergeyev said. Sergeyev emphasized that now Russian nuclear missiles had no particular target. He added that these measures had increased the level of nuclear safety. Even if someone tries to carry out a non- authorized launch, strategic missiles will not fly since they have no flight program, Sergeyev stated.
