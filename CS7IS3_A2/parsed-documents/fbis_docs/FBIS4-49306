These policies are mainly devoted to encouraging construction enterprises to seek contracts for foreign construction projects, to conduct labor service cooperation, and to engage in real estate business beyond the limitations of the countries and trade. Under these policies, enterprises that have appropriate conditions are encouraged to set up branch agencies and sales service centers abroad. For the staff and workers of these enterprises who have independently sought out foreign traders in an effort to work abroad, in accordance with employment contracts, their enterprises should keep them on the roster with no pay and should conduct exit formalities on their behalf by collecting a certain amount of expenses from them. For the staff and workers who engage in foreign labor or management service abroad with the approval of their original units and who have paid the old-age cash deposit to their units or to domestic labor insurance companies, their service abroad can be included in their length of service, and their wages on file can also be raised in accordance with the state unified wage readjustment. When these staff members and workers retire, they can enjoy the same treatment enjoyed by other staff members and workers. For personnel residing abroad, their spouses may also be sent abroad for employment or to accompany them. If responsible enterprise personnel located outside the territory have worked abroad for over a year, their spouses are allowed to accompany them and corresponding jobs for spouses should be arranged in line with the demands or spouse allowances should be given. The personnel residing abroad may enjoy one-month home leave every year. The policies also stipulate: Enterprises should be vigorously encouraged to absorb foreign funds and to initiate Chinese-foreign joint ventures or cooperative enterprises. Enterprises should also be encouraged to use their existing sites, plant houses, equipment, property rights, and the self-owned funds to run joint ventures and cooperative enterprises and to carry out technological transformation of enterprises and to build urban infrastructure. Great efforts should be made to attract foreign investors to engage in real estate development. If it is demanded, enterprises are allowed to invite foreign specialists and scholars with high salaries. Those who have been able to bring in funds, projects, technologies, and professionals for their units and those who have offered good advice and suggestions for opening their units to the outside world should all be given cash awards, and those whose contributions are outstanding should be given handsome rewards. Those who are able to assist their units by obtaining project or scientific research results and well-trained, specialized personnel, including those studying abroad, can be transferred to construction units. Preferential treatment should be given to them in line with the regulations by cadre management authority.
