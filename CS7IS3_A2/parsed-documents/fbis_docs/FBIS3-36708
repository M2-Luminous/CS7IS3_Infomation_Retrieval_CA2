Unfortunately, Ukraine belongs to those states where the Constitution is ignored by many political parties and authorities. The guarantor of the Constitution -- the president of Ukraine -- while following the course of this process, constantly resorts to self-vindicating statements. The election of the president of the Crimean autonomous region was a blatant violation of Ukrainian laws, including the Constitution. The elections were held in an atmosphere of acute Ukrainophobia and had an obvious backing from the "ruble zone" patrons. By that time, the Ukrainian state leadership had traditionally occupied a temporizing and so-called balanced position. These circumstances and the economic situation in the state have brought the leader of the Crimean Republican Movement [RDK], Meshkov, and the political bloc "Rossiya" [Russia] to executive power. The Russian Federation has acquired yet another lever for putting pressure upon Ukraine. This concerns, in particular, the Black Sea Fleet and the deployment of the Russian Armed Forces on the territory of the Ukrainian state. The Russian mass media, first and foremost "Ostankino" television and the VESTI news agency, stated, one after the other, that the Crimea is adopting a new political course. The RDK leader received almost half the votes of the adult population. Therefore, the results of the voting have shown that the Crimean population has really taken a new course oriented toward Russia, the economic transformations promised by it, and the financial injections. That is why the results of the Crimean presidential elections must also become a basis for a fundamental revision of Ukraine's economic policy. The success achieved by the separatist Meshkov is also a consequence of the absence in Ukraine of a clear information policy aimed at strengthening statehood. Even before the second round of the elections, Meshkov announced that, on 27 March, he would hold a referendum on independence. We believe that the policy of temporizing has turned out to be the worst for Ukraine. The events of recent months have shown that Ukraine's state leadership has no proper influence upon the regions. How can the executive represented by the RDK be loyal to Kiev, if one of its proclaimed tasks is the achievement of the peninsula's full independence...?
