"My reaction parallels that of the Mexican people," Zedillo told the Monitor radio newscast when he rejected Camacho Solis' insinuations that Zedillo's criticisms prevented him from continuing as peace commissioner. On Sunday, Zedillo said the Zapatist guerrillas' rejection of the government's offers to solve their demands showed that the negotiations had been a failure and not a success, as Camacho Solis had led the Mexican people to believe. The rebel Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) decided to reject the proposal the government presented between 23 February and 3 March in the dialogue in San Cristobal de las Casas, 700 km southeast of Mexico City. Camacho Solis resigned last night, considering that Zedillo's opinions were a vote of censure against his actions as peace commissioner. After announcing his resignation, Camacho Solis indicated he will withdraw from politics during the rest of the Carlos Salinas de Gortari administration. Zedillo said Camacho Solis' decision to resign was "personal," indicating he does not know the "political objective" of involving him because days before, Camacho Solis had said he would soon end his role as commissioner. "It is incomprehensible that suddenly, he turns around and does what he said he would do, linking it to my remarks," Zedillo said. Regarding the Chiapas insurrection, Zedillo said that in his opinion, "the important thing at this time is to continue urging the government of the Republic and those who are discontent in Chiapas to spare no efforts to reach a permanent and just peace for all sides." According to the PRI presidential candidate, the Chiapas conflict deserves "political and social attention." Zedillo added: "The only way to resolve the problem is through a social policy that will deal with the people's demands." The Indian insurrection broke out on 1 January when the EZLN violently seized four cities in Chiapas, in a conflict that left more than 200 dead in 12 days of fighting prior to a cease-fire to negotiate a political solution which, after the EZLN's rejection, has slowed down.
