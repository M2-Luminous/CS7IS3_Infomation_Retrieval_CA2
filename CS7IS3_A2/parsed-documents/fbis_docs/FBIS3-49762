The paper reports that the map, disclosing an offensive plan of the Bosnian Army, was obtained by Croatian Defense Council (HVO) "intelligence circles." Based on the map, SLOBODNA DALMAC1JA states, "it is obvious that the Muslim leadership of Sarajevo headed by Alija Izetbegovic has decided to destroy and expel the Croats from the Lasva Valley in central Bosnia," after which the Muslim forces would push through the Neretva Valley to the sea near Neum. The paper states that in order to carry out this plan, scheduled to begin on 3 January, the Muslims have concentrated in central Bosnia almost every corps of the Bosnian Army. The 303d Mountain Brigade of the 3rd Corps has been tasked with the first attack, directed against Vitez, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA states, adding that 5,000 soldiers of the 1st Corps from Sarajevo have already been sent toward Kiseljak, after which attacks on other Croatian enclaves are planned.
