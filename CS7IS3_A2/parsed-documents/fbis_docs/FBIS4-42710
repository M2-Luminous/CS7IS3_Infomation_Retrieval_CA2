The following are described as "probable" candidates: --Socialist Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard, 63, who had to set aside his ambitions in 1981 and 1988 for Francois Mitterrand's sake. The article notes that he will surely not renounce the race this time. His "mediocre" popularity scores are a disadvantage. Despite his success in "marginalizing" his most serious PS opponent, Laurent Fabius, Rocard is not "immune to a Delors operation." --Valery Giscard d'Estaing, 68, who will only announce his candidacy if he is "almost" sure of success. His low popularity scores "do not overly worry him," for he is convinced he could recoup in a few months. While no French Democratic Union (UDF) official would counter his plans, part of the party's younger wing would hesitate to support him. --Edouard Balladur, 65, whose popularity soared after the GATT negotiations were concluded but who has "piled up errors and missteps since." To oppose Rally for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac and appear as a "unifier" and not a "divider," Balladur should delay his presidential race as much as possible, the article notes. --Jacques Chirac, 61, the RPR's "natural" candidate, is "not quite sure" of how to distance himself from Balladur, but is "breathing easier" now that the prime minister has dropped in the polls. Announcing his candidacy too early may be risky, and doing so too late may make it impossible to overtake Balladur. --National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, 65, who will present himself as an "outsider." While he obtained 14.39 percent of the vote when he first ran in 1988, his position is not as favorable today, and even the Left deprives him of publicity by not disrupting his meetings. The following are listed by the article as "possible" candidates: --Raymond Barre, 70, considered a "statesman" by UDF leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Insisting he is a "free man," Barre will decide alone whether to run for the 1995 presidential elections. Having "obstinately" avoided the parties, it is probable he will not actively support a candidate. --Minister of Defense Francois Leotard, 52, has long thought that the 1995 presidential elections will afford him the opportunity to "test the waters." After some initial hesitation, Leotard and his Republican Party (PR) have decided to support Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's "unifying" candidacy if he runs. Should Balladur stay out of the race, Leotard will become a candidate if he can obtain the support of UDF "heavyweights" such as Giscard and Senate President Rene Monory. --Rene Monory, who "suggests nothing, excludes nothing, denies nothing." He would be Giscard's candidate if the UDF leader decided not to run. --Generation Ecologie's Brice Lalonde, 48, expected to run in the first round to "better negotiate" a ministerial post in the second. Some of his old friends contend he is waiting for the results of initial public opinion polls to decide whether he should run. --The Greens' Dominique Voynet, 35, who does not hide her desire to run since she wrested power from Antoine Waechter. She would perhaps support the Left's candidate in the second round to facilitate alliances for the municipal elections. --PS luminary Bernard Tapie, 51. Tapie hopes that good results in the forthcoming European Parliament elections will support his ambitions and make him the Socialists' "inevitable" candidate. --European Union (EU) Commission President Jacques Delors, 68, has consistently said that he will not run against PS leader Michel Rocard. This would not prevent his supporters from relaunching the idea of his candidacy if Rocard, down in the polls, loses in the Euroelections. --PS dissident and Citizens' Movement leader Jean-Pierre Chevenement, 53, whose candidacy hangs on his Euroelections score. --Communist Party (PCF) leader Robert Hue, 47, whose primary aim is to come out of isolation to facilitate leftist alliances for the municipal elections. Balladur' s Losses Explained According to Denis Jeambar writing in the 23 April Paris weekly LE POINT, Balladur's initial "state of grace" may well have been an "illusion" whose impact was overestimated. "In mourning" after the crumbling of Socialism and the suicide of the late Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy and "in shock" over the recession and unemployment, the country at the time of the elections only wished for "calm and the kind of political silence that Balladur ideally embodied," Jeambar explains. Balladur changed this situation with his "very political" law on secular education and the attempt by Social Affairs Minister Simone Veil and Minister of Defense Francois Leotard to "presidentialize" him. These developments "broke the implicit code linking [Balladur] to the French people." Balladur's decline has boosted the chances of Chirac, now seen as equally "competitive" with the prime minister for a second round presidential victory, even if Balladur still seems more favored in the first round. However, the "ambivalence" of Balladur's past popularity makes the presidential race "much more uncertain than figures can tell," Jeambar concludes. Possible Challenger The results of a SOFRES poll conducted according to the quota method from 1 to 6 April among 1,000 individuals over 18 are reported in the 21-27 April Paris weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. Respondents were asked their opinion of prominent political leaders as candidates for president of the Republic. On the Right, Balladur led with 47 percent of favorable opinions--a drop of 11 points since February--versus 42 percent negative. He was followed by RPR leader Chirac (33 percent positive, 61 percent negative), Raymond Barre (30 percent positive, 64 percent negative), Interior Minister Charles Pasqua (26 percent positive, 68 percent negative), Minister of Social Affairs Simone Veil (25 percent positive, 68 percent negative), Defense Minister Francois Leotard (23 percent positive, 68 percent negative), UDF leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing (22 percent positive, 74 percent negative), and a number of other personalities with lesser scores. On the Left, Jacques Delors led with 47 percent positive versus 42 percent negative, an improvement of 4 percent since January. Socialist Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard followed with 30 percent positive versus 64 percent negative (an improvement of 3 percent). The greatest improvement (11 percent) was registered by PS luminary Bernard Tapie, despite his score of 23 percent positive versus 71 percent negative. Poll results, according to Bazin, underscore "the end of the exceptional case represented by Balladur and the rise of the Tapie phenomenon." An analysis of the distribution of the two men's popularity reveals that Balladur is rejected by the least affluent classes--the young and the workers--among whom Tapie registers the most gains. This indicates a new cleavage between "the people above and the people below," superimposed on the old cleavage between the Right and the Left, Bazin comments.
