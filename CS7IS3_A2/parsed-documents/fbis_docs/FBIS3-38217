Some people say this is too little, too late. Shouldn't one take another step now both in the economic and in the political area? [Delors -- in French with superimposed Polish translation] Most certainly yes in the political area. You are worried, and so am I, about stability in Europe, not only in your countries but in the whole of Europe. That is why, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, I have always been a supporter of closer political links, which would enable us to exchange opinions and which would make proper work possible in order to eliminate everything which threatens peace, freedom, and mutual understanding between nations. However, when it comes to the economic area, I often think about this, and I do not regret the path we have chosen, that is the path of gradual rapprochement, so that your economies can adapt to modern economic management at the lowest possible cost. [Safuta] Prime Minister Pawlak is coming to Brussels [2-3 February]. What topics would you like to discuss with him? What questions would you like to ask him? [Delors] He will be my guest. I shall fit in with the agenda he chooses, naturally. Apart from that, I am eager to find out how he assesses the process of modernization of Polish economy, how he assesses the internal situation in your country and how he sees the future of Europe. Well, the list of topics will be very long and the meeting will certainly be very interesting, at least for me.
