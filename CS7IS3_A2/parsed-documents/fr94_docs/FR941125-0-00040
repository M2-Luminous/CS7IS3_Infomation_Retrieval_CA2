ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is closing the directed fishery for yellowfin sole by operators of vessels using trawl gear in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the 1994 Pacific halibut bycatch mortality allowance specified for the trawl yellowfin sole fishery. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), November 19, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The 1994 Pacific halibut bycatch mortality allowance for the trawl yellowfin sole fishery, which is defined at ยง675.21(b)(1)(iii)(B)(1), was established as 592 metric tons by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with ยง675.21(c)(1)(iii), that the 1994 Pacific halibut bycatch mortality allowance for the trawl yellowfin sole fishery has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is closing directed fishing for yellowfin sole by operators of vessels using trawl gear in the BSAI from 12 noon, A.l.t., November 19, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h).
