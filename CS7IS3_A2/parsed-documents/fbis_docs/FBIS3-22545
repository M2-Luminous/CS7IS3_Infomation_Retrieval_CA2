This is an increase of 12 persons, compared with the total at the end of October 1993, when 175 persons were listed by the Department of Health as suffering from the disease. Of the 187 persons suffering from AIDS 43 have full-blown AIDS and 25 have died. The remaining 18 are still alive. Meanwhile, according to data from WHO [World Health Organization], the total number diagnosed as being HIV-positive throughout Indonesia is between 20,000 and 30,000. Minister of Health Sujudi made this statement in testimony before Committee VIII of Parliament in Jakarta on 7 December. He added that the most serious aspect of these figures in Indonesia is that the numbers tend to increase exponentially. According to him, the figure of those suffering from AIDS has doubled over the past two years and tripled over the past year. He also reported that his ministry has estimated that it will spend 5.0 billion rupiahs on the care of AIDS victims during fiscal year 1994/1995. This money will be used for screening blood donors, research, distributing information, laboratory equipment, training health workers, and counseling services. In answer to a question from a member of the committee about the very surprising difference between the figures from the Department of Health and WHO on AIDS victims, the minister of health said that the WHO figure of 20,000 to 30,000 was arrived at by using several models ranging from the simplest to the most complex. Meanwhile, the minister of health said that the figure of 187 is the total actually reported to the Department of Health. The Department itself makes predictions based on how sexually transmitted disease has spread in Indonesia. These predictions are calculated by extrapolating statistics. Sujudi continued that by using this kind of calculation the figures obtained by WHO and those of the Department are not very far apart: about 20,000 persons suffer from AIDS. Sujudi said that to deal with AIDS, the government has formed the National Committee for Handling AIDS, chaired by the coordinating minister for the people's welfare. This committee has developed a policy for handling AIDS on a national basis. Sujudi said: "In the near future it is hoped that a Presidential Decision Memorandum will be issued to deal with AIDS." In answer to a question from a member of the committee concerning the amount of counterfeit medicine available the minister of health said that the punishment handed out to producers and traffickers in counterfeit medicine is still too light. The fines collected until now, based on an ordinance covering medicine containing alcohol, amount to 5,000 guilders for each case. This is considered to be the equivalent of 5,000 rupiahs. However, he continued, with the enactment of Law No. 23 of 1992 on health matters, it is hoped that producers and traffickers of counterfeit medicine will be discouraged from engaging in this kind of activity. This law provides for a sentence of up to 15 years in jail and a fine of up to 300 million rupiahs. Sujudi said that another problem encountered by the department in dealing with counterfeit medicine is that frequently cases brought to court are not actually tried. Therefore, the department has asked its officials in the provinces to raise these cases with the mass media. Sujudi said: "This effort is intended to exercise a more definite social and indirect control on the production and distribution of counterfeit medicine. In this way it is hoped that there will be no more cases involving the production and distribution of counterfeit medicine which are not prosecuted." According to Sujudi, the efforts being made by the Department of Health to speed up a more even distribution of medical doctors throughout the country involve PTT assignments [the appointment of personnel on a temporary basis]. Since February 1992, 3,988 medical doctors, divided into four groups, have been given temporary appointments to the government health service. Some 2,135 doctors have been assigned to ordinarily settled areas, 1,185 of them have been assigned to isolated areas, and 668 have 3n3 been assigned to very isolated areas. These employees have been hired on a temporary basis, in anticipation of the possibility that the number of permanent state employees being trained will be reduced to "zero" in the course of 1995. The appointment of temporary employees will later be applied to other workers in the health sector, including dentists, pharmacists, and midwives assigned to the villages. Their assignments will be carefully coordinated with the needs of the provinces where they will work. It is planned that during fiscal year 1994/1995 2,200 medical doctors, 600 dentists, 300 pharmacists, and 11,000 midwives will be assigned to villages. Funds for the construction of housing, amounting to more than 5.0 million rupiahs per employee, will be provided on a special basis for village midwives, in addition to other costs and transportation facilities such as bicycles.
