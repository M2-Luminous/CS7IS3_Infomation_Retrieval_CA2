FR940902-1-00004 FR940902-1-00002 Rural Electrification Administration 7 CFR Part 1767 Accounting Requirements for REA Electric Borrowers AGENCY: Rural Electrification Administration, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) proposes to amend its regulations on accounting policies and procedures for REA electric borrowers as set forth in REA's regulation concerning Accounting Requirements for REA Electric Borrowers, Uniform System of Accounts. This proposed rule would eliminate the requirement that REA borrowers place the difference between the amount accrued for postretirement benefits during the year and the amount paid on a ``pay-as-you-go'' basis in an external, irrevocable trust to be used solely for postretirement benefits. REA borrowers may, however, elect to voluntarily fund their postretirement benefit obligations. This proposed rule would set forth new accounting interpretations that address the requirements of recently issued pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board concerning the accounting for postemployment benefits and the accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. In addition, this proposed rule would also set forth a new accounting for storm damage costs and the associated funds received from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA). It would also clarify the accounting prescribed for computer software costs by specifying the accounts to which generalized software costs should be amortized and to which the costs of maintaining, updating, and converting files should be expensed. In addition, this proposal would identify the organizational unit within REA to which borrower requests for departures from or interpretations of the REA Uniform System of Accounts (USoA) should be submitted. DATES: Written comments must be received by REA or carry a postmark or equivalent no later than November 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to Ms. Roberta E. Detwiler, Chief, Technical Accounting and Auditing Staff, Borrower Accounting Division, Rural Electrification Administration, room 2222, South Building, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, telephone number (202) 720&hyph;5227. REA requires a signed original and three copies of all comments (7 CFR part 1700). All comments received will be made available for inspection at room 2234 South Building during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27 (b)). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Roberta E. Detwiler, Chief, Technical Accounting and Auditing Staff, Borrower Accounting Division, Rural Electrification Administration, room 2222, South Building, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, telephone number (202) 720&hyph;5227. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by OMB. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Administrator, REA, has determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) does not apply to this proposed rule. Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements In compliance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR Part 1320) which implements the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) and section 3504 of that Act, the information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in this proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Comments regarding these requirements may be sent to the United States Department of Agriculture, Clearance Office, OIRM, Room 404&hyph;W, Washington, DC 20250 or to the Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, room 10102, Washington, DC 20503. National Environmental Policy Act Certification The Administrator, REA, has determined that this proposed rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance
