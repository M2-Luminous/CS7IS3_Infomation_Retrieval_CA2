The latest poll conducted by the National Consulting Center and reported today by Caracol shows that presidential hopeful Ernesto Samper Pizano has a five-point advantage over Andres Pastrana in the first president election and a seven-point advantage in the runoff election. This poll, conducted between 3 and 8 February, days before the official announcement of the Pastrana candidacy, also includes other candidates. Some 38 percent of those polled said they would vote for Ernesto Samper, 33 percent said they would vote for Pastrana, 11 percent for Antonio Navarro Wolff, 4 percent for Miguel Maza Marquez, 3 percent for Enrique Parejo, 3 percent for Regina 11, 1 percent for Rodrigo Marin, and 1 percent for Juan Diego Jaramillo. In the runoff election, 50 percent of those polled said they would vote for Ernesto Samper and 43 percent favored Andres Pastrana. In the poll, interviewees were also asked about the Liberal Party [PL] consultation. Samper came in first with 59 percent, while De La Calle came in second with 12 percent. Amid this myriad of figures, candidates, polls, surveys, and elections, some people remain confused. To better inform the public, five elections will be held this year. The election to select congressional and presidential candidates for the PL will be held on 13 March. The first round of presidential elections will be held on 8 May; the runoff presidential election is scheduled for 29 May. The elections for governors, deputies, councilmembers, and local administrative boards will be held on 30 October. This will be the end of a long political year.
