We saw the winning side--the ANC and its leader Nelson Mandela--being extremely flexible and inviting others--although there were already previous agreements among themselves, including the extreme right like the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] and all the other political forces--to be part of the national unity government. [Correspondent] Do you believe that such solutions would work in Angola? [Oliveira] Well, we believe that the South African experience is extremely positive and, at the end of the day, what has happened in South Africa is what we have been negotiating and trying to make the Luanda government understand--which is a greater flexibility on the part of the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]. We want, in real terms, an administrative decentralization. Angola cannot be ruled from Luanda. Therefore, we have been asking right from the beginning for governing bodies in those provinces where we won the elections. Apart from everything else, it is not possible for the ruling body of those provinces to include members of a party that shelled for a year and a half--and keeps on shelling heavily with all types of weapons and from the air, particularly with MiGs and Sukhoys--the people of cities where there is no war. That is the case in Huambo, Andulo, Vila Nova, and other cities that are not on the front line and which the Luanda government has been shelling for a year and a half. As I have said, it continues shelling those cities. The people living in those cities will find it hard to be ruled by those same people. [Correspondent] What is preventing further progress at the talks in Lusaka and us from seeing concrete results? [Oliveira] As far as we are concerned, we have been waiting to adopt the same measure since we declared a cease-fire for the Luanda government. If the Luanda government were to give the same response to our cease-fire with a cease-fire command to its troops, the Lusaka agreement might have been signed by now. [Correspondent] One last question: Can you see it possible for an Eduardo dos Santos-Jonas Savimbi meeting to take place through Portuguese mediation, through the mediation of President Soares? Do you believe that is possible? [Oliveira] Well, as you know, there have been other proposals previously. For example, I can remember initiatives by King Hassan II, Nelson Mandela, and the deceased President Boigny, who proposed and offered to mediate in the peace process in Angola and to promote a meeting between Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi. We responded positively but the MPLA, through its president, refused the meeting. We are totally available at present for a meeting at the highest level. Dr. Savimbi has already said that it has been the MPLA, the Luanda government, that has refused the meeting. [Correspondent] Is Savimbi, therefore, available for a meeting with Jose Eduardo dos Santos? [Oliveira] Yes, we are willing to do everything for peace to return to Angola. If that initiative comes from someone who really wants peace in Angola, be it Dr. Mario Soares, Nelson Mandela, King Hassan II, or anyone else, we will respond positively at any time. We have already stated this previously.
