Completed the Omsk Tank Technical School and the Armor Academy with distinction, and then the faculty of the command and engineering personnel of the same academy with a gold medal. He has served both in the field and in production--in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, in the Far East and Carpathian military districts, and in various command and engineering posts. He has been chief of the Directorate for Industrial Orders and Liaison of the armaments staff of the armed forces of Ukraine since November of 1993. He is married, with a son who is a senior lieutenant following in his father's footsteps, serving at a repair enterprise. [Vachayev] Viktor Petrovych, a map of Ukraine takes up a good half of the wall in your office, with the enterprises that make up the defense industry marked on it. I have heard that the production potential of the VPK [military-industrial complex] here is quite strong, but it turns out that I did not imagine the true scope of it. Quite a `domain' for just your directorate... [Vashchylin] It is indeed still a novelty that a unified directorate for orders of weaponry and military hardware has been created here. Another two structures actually exist that perform some of these tasks, but the principal burden falls on us. I would say for comparison that there were 39 directorates that placed orders in the former Union, with personnel numbering some 3,900. They did not make it to a unified structure then, even though they tried... I would thus like to emphasize that we are not only new people in the system of procurement of weapons and hardware that are series-produced, but that we do not even have the opportunity of making use of experience in that work. True, such a system exists in the highly developed countries--the United States and France, among others--but there the unified body is subordinate to a specially assigned deputy secretary or minister of defense. This emphasizes the importance of the development and ordering of weaponry and military hardware, which should be under unified supervision. If we take the life cycle of an item as a whole, then there are the stages of development, the production itself and operation... Those stages were concentrated in the same hands, but in different directorates, in the former Union. So the items were created, so to speak, nearby. Though the departmental barriers were not always helpful... I thus feel that the unification of orders for industry in a directorate is the most expedient. Moreover, under conditions where military acceptance offices monitor the development and production at the design bureaus and we have information pertaining to operation through complaint work and trips to the field, we come to encompass the whole cycle in general. [Vachayev] I know that discussions have been underway for a long time with regard to where the orders to industry should originate. If this work is concentrated in the directorate, does that signify that the question has been removed from the agenda? [Vashchylin] This is quite a difficult problem. The viewpoint used to exist that money for procurements had to be given only to us and no one else. But life has shown that the supply directorate should have some procurement functions. There has to be a lead or general customer who fills orders for the armed forces as a whole, with regard to scientific developments, a large range of items and so on. Certain spare parts and materials should be partially procured by the supply structures as well. Why? Because the regiment needs funds, and little gets to the units under centralized procedure, as life has shown. They are, moreover, linked with local industry; it is easier for them to acquire everything they need. The regiments, divisions and districts must be given that money, but supply services, which are above them, are able to obtain funds for procurements. But the chiefs of the directorates to which the units are subordinate have to designate and ascertain the range of what is needed by the troops. Experience shows that all of these tasks are accomplished faster through local capabilities and knowledge of their own requirements. Territorial supply bodies exist as well. The directorates themselves, concluding the corresponding agreements, should obtain what goes through them. Otherwise, there would be an unjustified rolling of mat√©riel and money across all of Ukraine. And, on the contrary, what comes from the plants, from heavy industry, has to be received by a unified body. The security measures, transport, distribution and other issues are adhered to in that case. If we are to speak of the long term, then there should be bodies, albeit small, within the concerned directorates that place orders in the local areas. This is because there are issues that need to be resolved in the interests of one's own branch of the service or subordinate units. But all of this can happen provided that we become, so to speak, richer. [Vachayev] The question arises of interaction between you and other bodies. Is there understanding? [Vashchylin] Work has become considerably easier since those directorates delegated to us some functions pertaining first and foremost to large orders, the major items. Moreover, the chiefs of departments and groups in our directorate visit the chiefs of other directorates every week, where they have an exchange of information and seek out opportunities for the common resolution of their problems. We are actively involving the directorate in checking the field offices at enterprises on the pursuit of cadre policy. We already have a Statute on Interaction that has been approved by the deputy minister of defense for armaments and chief of armaments for the armed forces of Ukraine and coordinated with the chief of every directorate and legal scholars. It clearly defines where our work and where the work of the directorates begins. This work procedure will also ease the signing and coordination of all the necessary documents at various levels. Imagine if every directorate chief would have to run around from office to ministry with his questions, wasting time in vain and repeating the same work. And there will be no order then at all... [Vachayev] The next question, no less important, is what the directorate is engaged in. I have in mind the field or acceptance offices. I know that when the problem of the co-existence of your structure and the supply directorates was being debated, the latter wanted them to be left with them... [Vashchylin] The number of personnel at the acceptance offices was reduced by 37 percent through combinations and the existence of a unified directorate for placing orders. There used to be four or five offices operating at each plant, with each branch of the service performing their own acceptance. Now that is gone. But unified acceptance at the enterprises, after all, works in the interests of the tankers, the engineers and the truckers. We have a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on the procedure for the organization and interaction of field offices and industry and a document on acceptance that has been coordinated with all of the directorates, in which we have assumed all of the contemporary requirements for that body, questions pertaining to monitoring and product quality. A uniform approach has been devised for the organization of complaint and claim work as well, but it still requires refinement from a legal standpoint. [Vachayev] Viktor Petrovych, whatever issues I may raise with you, it all comes down to questions of financing and money. I know that these problems exist with you as well, as with all of the defense industry as a whole. I would like to clarify a thing or two in that area as well. I'll start with our own sore spots. It happened that we in the directorates that place the orders do not have a single one of our own business accounts. All of the transactions are performed through the Financial Directorate of the MO [Ministry of Defense]; that is, it takes all of the responsibility upon itself. And that deprives us of the right to lodge any complaints against suppliers. We do not have the opportunity of having any direct influence on the matter in which we are engaged from the economic and legal standpoints. What a paradox! Another problem consists of the fact that the absence of our own business account leads to our financing according to the whatever's-left-over principle. The money that is allocated only to the Financial Directorate (and we are not able to have any influence on the Ministry of Finance) goes to maintain the armed forces, and some of the leftovers to the things we do. True, it is not just a matter of the lack of a business account here, but rather the need for a budget as such. The experience of many countries, however, shows that the funds that are required just for the development and procurement of armaments and hardware are from three to seven percent of the gross national product. Here, the minimum value of that indicator goes to maintain the armed forces as a whole. However, if you take my own question of procurements, then last year we procured 12 percent of the new weaponry and hardware, and the rest went for spare parts. Talking about the budget, meanwhile, we received half of the minimum we were planning on. The situation this year is even worse. They did not want to leave even a line on financing a series of matters, including procurements, when they were formulating the budget; even though we are planning to obtain a little more than 20 percent of the new models of weaponry and hardware... It is not just a matter of the fact that the armed forces require new hardware and weaponry. There are more than 700 enterprises in the defense industry standing behind these figures that do not have enough work. And that, as they say, is threatening unforeseen consequences. If the question of creating a national program of shipbuilding and financing for it is not resolved in the next couple of years, for example, the slipways will be engaged in just so-called dollar projects, and we will not be able to place a single order there. Whereas they used to feel in the defense industry that getting work from the MO was a guarantee of stability, the opposite idea prevails today: Have as little as possible to do with defense orders as quickly as possible, because there are no guarantees of payments. And that could lead to the disappearance of the defense industry, as such. [Vachayev] Stock offerings and privatization, which could affect the former enterprises of the defense industry, are beginning nonetheless... [Vashchylin] I am convinced that the basic enterprises of the defense sector must be subordinate to the state, and perhaps to the Ministry of Defense. We could perhaps go the way of acquiring 51 percent of the shares of stock in those enterprises. Turning to the experience of the developed countries, it must be pointed out that a state sector remains in the defense industry in them. And we should spare no funds in this, since no owner will accept an order if it does not satisfy him ahead of time on a financial plane. The very acute question of organization within the framework of a reasonable cycle of production of weaponry and hardware of our own also arises here. It is considered expedient when that cycle is 40-60 percent self-contained; that is, it is virtually nowhere self-contained within the framework of a single state. When resolving this issue we should decide, figuratively speaking, who we are. Keeping in mind that we have 100 percent weaponry and hardware from the former Union, and almost a quarter of the entire defense output was made by Ukraine, it is not hard to find the answer. I am convinced that full-fledged and mutually advantageous ties with Russia will provide work for our enterprises, will provide the necessary funds and will facilitate the maintenance of combat readiness in the armed forces of Ukraine at a suitable level. There is another reserve that we are able to utilize -- the arms trade on the world market. Recall that the USSR received 29 billion dollars a year from sales. There is no more Union, but a vacuum has not been created in the arms market, since the developed countries have instantly taken its place. They felt this in Russia, and they began thinking about their own weapons program and access to trade somewhere around a year and a half ago. The corresponding structure, along the lines of a defense export organization, has appeared. So why are we marching in place? We have a thing or two to sell, believe me. There is another problem that exists that I would put in first place -- the preservation of scientific potential. The lack of funds and orders is leading to the fact that the smart ones are leaving for commercial structures. The scientists and designers, in my opinion, must be paid -- and paid good money -- even when there is no work. If work should appear, and I am sure it will, and there is no one to do it, enormous amounts of money will not help. In summing up our discussion, I would like to say that I see a threefold task, on which both our directorate and the defense industry as a whole are working, namely to preserve scientific potential, industry and the output of defense products, both in peacetime and during special periods. [Vachayev] Thank you for the interesting conversation.
