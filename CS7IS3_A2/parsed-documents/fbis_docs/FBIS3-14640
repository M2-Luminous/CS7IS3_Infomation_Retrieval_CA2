It also stressed the need to stand firmly against U.S. positions, which are biased in favor of the Israeli party. This demand, which is the first of its kind since the Madrid conference was convened about 20 months ago, came in an urgent telegram by the council following its meeting yesterday morning in Jerusalem. In the meeting, the council discussed the assault against Islamic sanctities and the Palestinian people, especially the recent massacre perpetrated by Israeli settlers in Hebron's al-Ibrahimi Mosque. The council criticized remarks by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Israeli officials on the fate of holy Jerusalem, as well as the U.S. Administration's stance on UN Security Council Resolution 904. It called on Arab and Islamic countries to clearly determine their stance on the U.S. Administration in light of its biased positions toward the Israeli side. [passage omitted]
