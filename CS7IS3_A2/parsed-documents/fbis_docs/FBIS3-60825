The IDF later released him as a gesture to Fatah in view of the fact that Muhammad's brother, who was a Fatah activist, was shot dead last week. To date the IDF had only released Fatah members who turned themselves in." The report goes on to quote official IDF sources as saying that "Muhammad Abu-al-Rish is a Fatah activist and not a member of Islamic Jihad." Army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David reports that "a large rally was staged at noon today in Khan Yunus by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] to celebrate the return of the deportees from Lebanon to their homes in the Gaza Strip."
