The economic situation is desperate and the political consequences are unpredictable, says Petrus Stefanov, economics minister in Skopje. [Begin Stefanov recording, in Macedonian with superimposed translation into German] The blockade is seriously endangering our economy, but it also affects the overall political situation. It is a direct attack on the stability of the whole region. [end recording] The nationalist opposition in Macedonia sees all its fears confirmed. Ljupco Georgijevksi from the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization says: [Begin Georgijevski recording, in Macedonian with superimposed translation into German] The decision of the Greek Government has not surprised me very much. It is the logical consequence of the Greek policies of the past three years. I would not be surprised either if Athens were to resort to military means. This is a cold war against Macedonia, a cold war which is aggravating the conflicts in the whole of the Balkans and also has consequences for Europe. Accordingly, we deplore that the European Community is not doing enough. [end recording] [passage omitted]
