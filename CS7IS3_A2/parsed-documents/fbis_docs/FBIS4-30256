The government decided to allow Hyundai to issue Deposit Receipts (DR) abroad and to receive loans for the expansion of production facilities from the Korea Development Bank (KDB) as soon as possible, the sources said. The government had already accepted applications Tuesday from three Hyundai subsidiaries -- Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai Housing and Industrial Development and Hyundai Elevator -- for registration on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Five Hyundai subsidiaries, including Hyundai Merchant Shipping and Koryo Industrial Development, that have already applied for OTC registration will be treated the same as other firms if they seek listing on the stock market, said the sources. Hyundai will be allowed to float deposit receipts abroad during the fourth quarter because the Korea Securities Dealers' Association has already given the go-ahead to companies issuing DRs in the third quarter, they said. Hyundai will also be entitled to receive KDB loans during the year because the KDB accepts loan applications at any time, they said. President Kim had announced at a meeting of businessmen Wednesday that no business should be subjected to favors or disadvantages for political reasons, hinting at the lifting of all restrictions on Hyundai. Hyundai has reportedly faced great difficulty in proceeding with various projects after the government imposed financial sanctions on the nation's largest business group in the aftermath of honorary Chairman Chong Chu-yong's run for the presidency in the 1992 election.
