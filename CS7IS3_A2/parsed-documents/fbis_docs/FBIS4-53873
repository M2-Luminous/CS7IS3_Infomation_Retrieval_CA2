Aichi Steel Works will advise Louisville Forge on the layout, equipment specifications, and final manufacturing processes for a new forging plant which the latter plans to build. President J. Payton of Louisville Forge visited Japan on 5 April to sign the contract. Louisville Forge supplies the three major automakers and Japanese automakers with North American plants with forged components. Louisville Forge has maintained a technical assistance agreement with Aichi Steel Works since July 1990 and in August of last year it had reached a technical assistance agreement on the manufacture of crankshafts using "nontempered steel" which does not involve heat processing. Louisville Forge is formulating plans for relocation and construction of a new plant, but the timing and location are still undetermined.
