In his words, Kiev was holding the negotiations "constructively," however, it confronted "inadequate actions of the Russian party." Tarasyuk said that probably it is necessary to listen to the proposal of Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy and to draw "a third party" to the negotiations, which would help to find a way out. During a press conference on Friday in Kiev, Ivan Plyushch, speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, also spoke about possible solution of the Fleet's problem with the participation of the US president on analogy with the January tripartite statement on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. Vyacheslav Kostikov, press secretary of the Russian president, was critical of this point of view and declared that Russia would not tolerate any outer interference on the Black Sea Fleet issue. In any case, Tarasyuk said, the major results of the meeting in Sevastopol is "Russia's return to the concept of the Black Sea Fleet division about which it "forgot" late last year." He pointed out that Ukraine and Russia "have found consent regarding the starting point while counting the Fleet's ships." Russia and Ukraine also reached a consent concerning the issue what part of the Black Sea fleet would be transferred to Ukraine's Navy. Unfortunately, Plyushch noted, "we cannot regard as an achievement the unclear departure of the Russian delegation from the meeting and the fact that we have failed to reach an agreement on separate basing of the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's Navy." An unexpected departure of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev from the negotiations in Sevastopol arouses only regret, Tarasyuk stressed.
