Papoulias made his statement before leaving for Ioannina, where the European Union's General Affairs Council will meet on 26 March. Kostas Papadhakis has the following report. [Begin Papadhakis recording] Before leaving, Papoulias said that in addition to other topics, the Yugoslav and Bosnian issues will also be discussed at the meeting and that Greece will brief the delegates on its positions. No decisions will be made. The foreign minister described as an unpleasant development for the Turks the UN decision on the dispatch of Turkish blue helmets to Bosnia. He also noted that this decision was dictated by logistics without considering any historic foundations [katavoles] or psychology; instead of helping peace it might ultimately make things worse. Referring to the Greek positions, Papoulias said that Greece's principle is that no blue helmets be sent to Bosnia. [end recording] Papoulias described the UN Security Council's decision as wrong. [Begin Papoulias recording] They made a mistake. We pointed this out. Often, I think, the historic foundation of problems is ignored and while we aim to satisfy the needs of logistics, we ignore a very significant element in human psychology, especially when it comes to the framework in which the Turkish troops will move in Bosnia. Instead of helping peace, I believe we are harming the peace process. [end recording]
