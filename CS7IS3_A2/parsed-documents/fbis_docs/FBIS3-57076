Yesterday morning at the request of Deputy Marychev (from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia), the question of resuming the ill-fated "Parliamentary Hour" was included on the agenda. Apart from this, the faction comprising the Communists, Agrarians, Zhirinovskiy-ites, and "Russian Way" deputies' group and the "Women of Russia" affiliated to it issued a statement which says: "ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and YURIDICHESKAYA GAZETA ROSSII should once again become parliamentary publications of the State Duma." "Trying to revive such a program is not the way to go. It was devised in order to wage the war between the two branches of power more successfully," Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the mass media committee, told your KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent. [Stremidlovskiy] "Mikhail Nikiforovich, if the State Duma does nevertheless adopt a resolution to revive `Parliamentary Hour,' how will you implement it?" [Poltoranin] "But it is impossible to implement. `Parliamentary Hour' cannot return in its previous form." Mikhail Poltoranin said that his committee was elaborating a draft law on the provision of information on state organs. The basic thesis is that the state organs should collaborate with the mass media on a voluntary basis. It is easier with state television: It will be instructed to allocate some airtime for relaying parliamentary, government, or presidential news.
