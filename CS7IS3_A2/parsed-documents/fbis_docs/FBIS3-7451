They declared that they would launch a widespread signature campaign against "parliamentary ratification" of the farm market opening. The Citizens' Federation for Economic Justice on the same day published a statement condemning the Kim Yong-sam group for widening the scope of the farm market opening. That day, Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the opposition Democratic Party, said they would fight in concert with broad dissident forces against the expansion of the scope of the farm market opening. Meanwhile, an opinion poll conducted by the General Student Council of Korea University in Seoul among nearly 8,000 students on March 25 and 26, showed that nearly 90 percent of the respondents opposed the rice market opening.
