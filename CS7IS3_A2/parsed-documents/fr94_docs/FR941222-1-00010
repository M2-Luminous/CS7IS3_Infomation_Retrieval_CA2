ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the purpose of correcting deficiencies and adding requirements for the control of volatile organic compounds from surface coating, pneumatic rubber tire manufacturing, graphic arts, and synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry equipment leaks. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial SIP revision and anticipates no adverse comments.

If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule.
