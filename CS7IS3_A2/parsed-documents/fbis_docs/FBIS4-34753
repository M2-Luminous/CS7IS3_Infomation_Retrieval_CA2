This summit of Kims could take place anytime and anywhere -- presumably in Pyongyang, Seoul, or, if this is not possible, then Beijing -- with no preconditions, as expressed in the invitation extended by the DPRK president to the ROK president and delivered in Seoul by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. This would be the first time in history that the leaders of both parts of Korea have met since the country was divided in 1948, when the North and the South declared themselves republics. An attempt at reunification, which failed to crystallize, was made in 1991 after several official contacts between the two prime ministers. Asian diplomatic sources do not rule out the PRC as the site of the negotiations, considering this country's good relations with the two neighboring states, and the desire to spare the octogenarian DPRK leader a long trip. The sources base their assertions on the fact that Beijing is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and that, since the beginning of the problem in February 1993, the PRC has rejected pressure tactics and threats and favored a conciliatory solution. Beijing's veto power could cancel any UN resolution. In addition, Kim Il-song always uses a special train in his short trips abroad, both to Europe and in Asia. This has been interpreted as a sign that he cannot travel by air. Carter, rector of a democratic foundation, traveled on a private mission to Seoul and Pyongyang in mid-June with the goal of finding a peaceful resolution to the complex and critical nuclear controversy, which has kept the world on tenterhooks because of the disturbing political and military maneuvers over the past 16 months. In addition, the mediation of the former White House occupant (1976-1980) took place at a time when the United States had presented to the UN Security Council a draft resolution that considers six punitive measures against the DPRK for its reluctance to authorize a complete and thorough inspection of its nine nuclear plants following an alleged diversion of nuclear fuel. Madeline Albright, Washington's delegate to the United Nations, outlined the draft resolution's contents, which include severe measures leading to a tight embargo if Pyongyang does not change its position. The document, which has been endorsed by Japan, the ROK, France, Great Britain, and other Washington allies, proposes temporarily isolating the DPRK diplomatically, beginning at the time when the measures are adopted. All technical cooperation, particularly that involving nuclear energy, and economic aid by the United Nations and its agencies would likewise be cut off. In an apparently concerted action, the Board of Directors of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] anticipated this punitive plan and on 10 June suspended a yearly allocation of $270,000 in technical assistance for the DPRK, which had been a member since 1985 but has announced its decision to leave the organization. The draft resolution also calls for limiting Pyongyang's activities in international organizations and establishing controls on all scientific, economic, and educational exchanges with the DPRK. The document bans the import and export of arms and weapon components and all unscheduled air traffic to and from DPRK. This draft, prepared by Washington, which is expected to be vetoed by the PRC and Russia -- Pyongyang's most important trade partners -- gives the DPRK a 30-day grace period to unconditionally fulfill the Nuclear Safeguards Agreement and the inter-Korean accord on the denuclearization of the peninsula signed in October 1991. In this agreement, which was hailed by the world, the DPRK and ROK heads of government pledged to refrain from developing, manufacturing, or storing nuclear weapons. In direct reference to the United States, the two countries supported the removal of all nuclear arms from this northwest Asian region. Since it was signed, however, the agreement has been a paper tiger. According to unofficial reports, Pyongyang possesses nine nuclear plants, Seoul has four, and the Pentagon has installed more than 1,000 nuclear devices, including rockets and bombs of various types, in U.S. military bases throughout the ROK, where more than 40,000 soldiers are stationed. Nevertheless, the U.S. efforts to implement punitive measures have virtually come to a standstill and appear unlikely to succeed in light of Russia's and the PRC's refusal to support the proposal and pressure from U.S. public sectors that favor a negotiated solution. Meanwhile, the leaders of Russia, who maintain a friendship and cooperation agreement with Pyongyang and sell weapons to the DPRK, have accused Washington of not consulting with them, and they have called for an international conference among China, Japan, the two Koreas, and the UN in an attempt to end the conflict. The Chinese, Pyongyang's powerful allies from the Korean war (1950-1953), who firmly oppose any coercive measures and are summoning the parties in the conflict to a dialogue and to settle their differences, warn that sanctions will only engender negative results. China says its goal is to denuclearize the peninsula and to preserve peace and stability. North Korea has warned, meanwhile, that sanctions would constitute a declaration of war. It also argues that the country does not intend to or have the capability to produce a nuclear weapon, and it is claiming that there is a plot which, it says, is aimed at suppressing the country's socialist political system. Encouraged by Washington, Seoul voiced its support for the sanctions and consequently decreed a state of emergency for its troops and civilian population, thereby sowing a climate of war south of the 38th parallel. The heated dispute has naturally created concern among U.S. citizens, who in the long run are the ones who suffer casualties (dead, wounded, and missing) in conflicts in which their government gets involved. In the past, they have been traumatized by defeats in Korea (1953) and Vietnam (1975). This fear was reflected in a survey published by influential NEWSWEEK magazine in its 18 June edition, the results of which showed that the majority of U.S. citizens favor a negotiated solution through the resumption of a high-level dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang. So far, there have been meetings in New York (June) and Geneva (July) in 1993. There is a possibility that a third meeting could take place within the next few months as a result of Jimmy Carter's mediation. The figures published by NEWSWEEK reveal the general feeling on the subject: 68 percent of those consulted favor a negotiated solution, while only 25 percent prefer a hard-line solution. In the same survey, 42 percent disapproved of President William Clinton's policy toward Korea, which was only supported by 31 percent. A careful analysis of the true nature of the conflict will take us back to 15 February 1993, when a special IAEA team tried to carry out a special inspection of two military installations. North Korean authorities turned back the inspection, which they viewed as a violation of the country's sovereignty and national independence. Pyongyang accused the IAEA of plotting with the United States to conduct an espionage mission within its military centers, and on 12 March the DPRK announced its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which would have gone into effect three months later, on 12 June, as stipulated in its regulations. At the same time, the DPRK demanded talks with Washington. The DPRK joined the NPT in 1985 and signed the Nuclear Safeguards Agreement in 1992. Since then, inspectors visited the seven atomic energy plants subject to verification on six occasions and certified that they were being used for peaceful purposes. Since then, a bitter dispute developed between the parties involved, which were followed by intensive political efforts conducted by several countries and the UN Security Council in an attempt to find a satisfactory formula to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula. A UN Security Council resolution, approved with the abstentions of China and Pakistan, urged the DPRK to reconsider its withdrawal from the NPT and its refusal to permit IAEA inspections. A refusal from the DPRK would be subject to economic sanctions. Washington agreed to negotiate as demanded by Pyongyang. U.S. and DPRK representatives met at UN Headquarters in New York. On 12 June, the DPRK temporarily delayed its withdrawal from the NPT. The representatives again met in Geneva in July that same year. Since then, contact at the Foreign Ministry-level was interrupted, and there have only been brief working sessions by officials in Beijing and New York whenever the situation warrants. As specific results of those ministerial meetings, the United States committed itself to suspend its Team Spirit annual military exercises in South Korea and help Pyongyang change its graphite reactors for light water reactors, which would prevent the fabrication of nuclear weapons. In addition, it offered to consider the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations, and give its economic and technical support. The DPRK agreed to resume its contacts with South Korea to exchange ambassadors and let IAEA inspectors do their work to guarantee safeguards. Everything seemed to be moving along normally until April 1994, when a series of proposals, counterproposals, pressures, and threats of sanctions again increased tension in the Korean peninsula. This time, it was because the United States and the IAEA suspected that the DPRK was storing plutonium extracted from nuclear rods from its plants. From all of this we can conclude that the next high-level meeting between the North and South Koreas, together with Pyongyang's offer to freeze its nuclear program and its invitation to inspect its installations, should contribute to reduce the current pressure and threats on the peninsula.
