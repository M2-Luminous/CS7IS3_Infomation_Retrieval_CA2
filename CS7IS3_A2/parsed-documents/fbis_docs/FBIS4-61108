According to the spokesman, the South Korean president will visit the Russian port city of Vladivostok on his way back home. Kim plans to hold talks with Yeltsin during the visit, at which the sides will exchange opinions on the situation on the Korean peninsula and the situation in the world as a whole. They will also discuss ways of strengthening bilateral relations. "The visit by President Kim Yong-sam to Russia will help to strengthen further relations between the two countries for the sake of preserving peace on the Korean peninsula and will step up bilateral cooperation in joint development of natural resources and technological development for the sake of mutual prosperity of the two countries," stressed the spokesman. He added that "the coming visit will have great importance for building the foundations of foreign policy by which the Korean civil government abides, focusing on the development of relations with the four neighbouring powers". In accordance with this diplomacy, Kim visited the United States last November as well as Japan and China last March. He will go to Russia this time. In June 1989, Kim was in Moscow as the leader of the opposition Democratic Party for Reunification. He met Yeltsin in Seoul in the capacity of a candidate for the highest state post from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party during the Russian president's visit to South Korea in November 1992. Presidents Kim and Karimov will discuss chances for developing relations between the two countries. Incidentally, the largest community of Koreans in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) lives in Uzbekistan. The South Korean-Uzbek summit "will help to establish relations in the economic and other spheres also with other CIS members which recently gained independence", the spokesman noted.
