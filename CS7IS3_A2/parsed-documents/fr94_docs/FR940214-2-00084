FR940214-2-00084 FR940214-2-00051 In its previous orders, 11 the Commission asked the Amex to analyze the difference in executions between using the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') consolidated best bid or offer as compared with the Amex quote without the differential. Specifically, the Commission expressed interest in whether customers are receiving the best execution, both in terms of price and time, using the new Amex system. The Commission was also interested in the feasibility of implementing an odd-lot pricing system using the ITS best bid or offer and no differential. 12 11 See supra, note 5. 12 The Commission has approved amendments to the New York Stock Exchange's (``NYSE'') rules which incorporate the ITS quote into the NYSE odd-lot pricing procedures through the use of the Best Pricing Quote (``BPQ''). See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27981 (May 2, 1990), 55 FR 19409 (May 9, 1990) (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;06). In response, the Amex submitted the requested information with respect to the difference in executions between the ITS best bid or offer and the Amex quote to the Commission on January 9, 1991, April 22, 1991, October 25, 1991, February 4, 1993, August 3, 1993 and November 16, 1993. 13 The Amex data indicated that the pilot procedures provide a superior execution for a substantial majority of odd-lot executions. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is reasonable to extend the pilot for an additional six months to enable the Commission to review fully the Amex reports and to enable the pilot to continue without interruption during the Commission's review. The Commission, however, remains concerned that some odd-lot orders could receive executions at less than the best available price since the Exchange's pricing formula does not include quotations from other markets. 14 Nevertheless, due to the relatively low number of odd-lot market orders on the Amex, 15 the percentage of Amex quotes that are worse than the ITS best bid or offer, and the benefits to customers under the pilot program procedures as compared to the former pricing procedures, the Commission believes that it is acceptable to continue the pilot's current pricing procedures for an additional six months. During that period, the Commission requests that the Exchange continue to monitor the pilot and provide data on the number of Amex quotes executed that are worse than the ITS consolidated best bid and offer and on the number of odd-lots as a percentage of total Exchange share volume and of the total number of trades. Moreover, the Commission remains interested in the feasibility of implementing an odd-lot pricing system using the ITS best bid and offer and no differential. Accordingly, the Commission requests that the Amex include in its monitoring report the feasibility and cost of developing such a plan, along with a projected time frame for potential implementation. The Commission requests that the Amex submit its report on these matters by May 8, 1994. 13 See letters from Arne G. Michelson, Senior Vice President, Total Quality- Floor Members, Amex, to Beth A. Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated November 16, 1993, and to Sharon M. Lawson, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated August 3, 1993; letter from Michael Cavalier, Assistant General Counsel, Regulatory, Legal & Regulatory Policy Division, Amex, to Diana Luka-Hopson, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated February 3, 1993; letters from Jules L. Winters, Executive Vice President, Operations, Amex, to Howard L. Kramer, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated January 8, 1991, April 19, 1991 and October 23, 1991. 14 See supra, note 12. 15 See footnote 9 of Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29922 (November 8, 1991), 56 FR 58409. The Commission finds good cause for granting partial temporary approval of the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof. This will permit the pilot program to continue on an uninterrupted basis. In addition, the procedures the Exchange proposes to continue using are the identical procedures that were published in the Federal Register for the full comment period and were approved by the Commission. 16 16 No comments were received in connection with the proposed rule change which implemented these procedures. See supra note 4. It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) 17 of the Act, that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;45) is approved for a six month period ending on August 8, 1994. 17 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 18 18 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1991). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
