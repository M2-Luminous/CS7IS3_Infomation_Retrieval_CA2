The decree states that the president of the Crimean Republic adopted, on 10 March 1994, Decree No. 05 on conducting a poll of citizens of the Republic of Crimea on 27 March 1994 on issues of renewing the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea, dated 6 May 1992, that determined the regulation of mutual relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of a treaty, and agreements and renewing the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea, dated 6 May 1992, which declared the right of citizens of the Republic of Crimea to dual citizenship. The mentioned provisions of the decree of the president of the Republic of Crimea contravene Ukraine's Constitution and the law of Ukraine on an all-Ukrainian and local referendums. The president of the Republic of Crimea has virtually made a decision to hold a [words indistinct] poll of citizens of a consultative referendum under the guise of a poll of citizens that is being conducted only in order to ascertain public opinion that is specified by Article 47 of the law of Ukraine on an all-Ukrainian and local referendums. According to the legislation of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea, the results of such a referendum are to be considered, and must be taken into account when decisions are made by relevant state bodies. Such a conclusion is based, first of all, on the preamble of the decree. In it, the president of the Republic of Crimea noted firstly, that in adopting the decision he is relying on the principle of sovereignty of the people, [narodovladdya] in accordance with which the single source of state power of the Republic of Crimea are the people; secondly, the aim of the decree is to take into account more fully the will of the citizens of the Republic of Crimea when deciding important state issues; thirdly, it is guided by Article 2 and 34 of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea where it speaks about the implementation of state power by the people and its participation in managing the affairs of society and state. (?In accordance with) Article 46 of the Ukrainian law on an all-Ukrainian and local referendums, the manifestation of the will of citizens when deciding important issues of a general state and local significance is a consultative poll of citizens through a consultative referendum. According to Points 1 and 2 of Article 2 of the decree, citizens of the Republic of Crimea are recommended to reply to a question on the constitutional bases of mutual relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine, and the rights of citizens of the Republic of Crimea to dual citizenship, that is to say, to questions that are exclusively under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, [according to] Articles 31 Points 2 and 15, and Article 97 of Ukraine's Constitution that are, therefore, subject to an all-Ukrainian referendum according to Article Three of the Ukrainian law on an all-Ukrainian and local referendums. In accordance with Article 6-1 of the Ukrainian law on an all-Ukrainian and local referendums, the holding of referendums on issues that are not under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Crimea is not permitted. An adoption, a change, or a cancellation of a decision on issues that have been referred to the jurisdiction of the Republic of Crimea by Ukrainian legislation may be the subject of a republican and local referendums in the Republic of Crimea (Article 3-1 of the Ukrainian law on an all-Ukrainian and local referendums). In addition, it must be taken into account that the provisions of Article 9 and Part 2 of Article 17 of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea in the version dated 6 May 1992, whose renewal has been touched upon in the decree of the president of the Republic of Crimea, were changed by the Supreme Council of the Republic of Crimea on 25 September 1992, insofar as they did not conform to the Constitution of Ukraine. In addition, the fact that certain provisions of the decree of the president of the Republic of Crimea do not conform to Crimean legislation is also mentioned in a resolution from the Central Electoral Commission on the election of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Crimea, dated 12 March 1994, concerning the aforementioned decree. Proceeding from this, and in accordance with Point 7-2 of Article 114-5 of the Constitution of Ukraine, I resolve: 1. To cancel Points 1 and 2 of Article 2 of the decree of the president of the Republic of Crimea dated 10 March 1994 No. 05 on conducting a poll of citizens of the Republic of Crimea on 27 March 1994, insofar as it does not conform with the Constitution of Ukraine and the law of Ukraine on an all-Ukrainian and local referendums; 2. The decree acquires validity from the date of signing.
