In his opinion, upon signing the GATT Uruguay Round accord, Brazil assumed international commitments "that now must be reflected in the country's laws on intellectual property." Pratini said: The draft law, which has been in the Senate for almost a year now, must now be approved so Brazilian commercial interests on the international front "will not again become the target of threats of protectionist or retaliatory measures as a result of the isolated Brazilian position in the patents area." Pratini reported that the executive branch has just submitted to the Senate new suggestions for amendments relating to the GATT agreements signed by the country and criticized the delay in resolving the issue. Because of this, he said, "in 10 years, China has already tripled its exports compared to those of Brazil." He added that, because of inadequate legislation, Brazil is already losing trade opportunities in the area of high technology, in addition to leaving itself open to trade sanctions, such as the case of newsprint from 1989 to 1991. These sanctions provoked a $300 million loss for Brazilian exports and the loss of markets, like that of the United States, which have never been regained." [quotation marks as received]. Pratini added that the AEB also is alerting the government about the problems a fixed exchange rate will cause for exporters. He said: "We pointed out the need to reduce some taxes bearing on exports as a way to compensate the Brazilian foreign trade sector for the losses it may sustain as a result of the freeze in the exchange rate during the initial stage of the real." In his opinion, the market recognizes that it is essential to have a fixed exchange rate during the first stage, but "the problems experienced with the Cruzuado Plan, which provoked a sharp drop in exports and a large increase in imports, must be avoided." Pratini added: "Both exports and imports must increase." AEB, which consists of 900 companies, accounts for 98 percent of Brazilian exports.
