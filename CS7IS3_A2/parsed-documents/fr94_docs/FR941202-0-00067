FR941202-0-00067 FR941202-0-00010 The economic impact analysis done at proposal showed that the economic impacts from the proposed standard would be insignificant. The economic impact analysis has not been revised for promulgation because the changes in costs are not expected to have any effect on the results of the analysis. While the estimated annual costs for the regulation have increased since proposal, there are still cost savings for most affected entities. Only entities with small or medium-sized cleaning machines will not have cost savings, and the costs for the selected regulatory alternatives for these entities have changed very little since proposal. Since those entities that do not have cost savings were the only ones analyzed in the proposal, and these costs have changed little, the results from the economic impact analysis at proposal should still hold for promulgation. III. Significant Changes to the Proposed Standards A. Public Participation Prior to proposal of the standards, interested parties were advised by public notice in the Federal Register (57 FR 46854), of a meeting of the National Air Pollution Control Techniques Advisory Committee to discuss the halogenated solvent cleaner source recommended for proposal. This meeting was held on November 17 and 18, 1992. The meeting was open to the public and each attendee was given an opportunity to comment on the standards recommended for proposal. The standards were proposed and published in the Federal Register on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62566). The preamble to the proposed standards discussed the availability of the BID, which described the regulatory alternatives considered and the impacts of those alternatives. Public comments were solicited at the time of proposal, and copies of the BID were distributed to interested parties. To provide interested persons the opportunity for oral presentation of data, views, or arguments concerning the proposed standards, a public hearing was offered at proposal; however, one was not requested. The public comment period was from November 29, 1993 to January 28, 1994. Fifty-seven comment letters were received. The comments have been carefully considered, and changes have been made in the proposed standards when determined by the Administrator to be appropriate. B. Comments on the Proposed Standards Comments on the proposed standards were received from 57 commenters composed mainly of States, solvent cleaning machine users, solvent cleaning machine vendors, industry and industry trade associations. A detailed discussion of these comments and responses can be found in the promulgation BID, which is referenced in the ADDRESSES section of this preamble. The summary of comments and response in the BID serve as the basis for the revisions that have been made to the standards between proposal and promulgation. Most of the comment letters contained multiple comments. The comments have been divided into the following areas: •Selection of pollutants and source categories for regulation. •Emission control options. •Regulatory alternatives. •Benefits analysis/economics. •Equipment, idling, work practice and overall solvent emission limit standards. •Modification and reconstruction considerations. •Monitoring requirements. •Recordkeeping and reporting requirements. •Operating permit program. •Clarifications. •Miscellaneous. C. Significant Changes Several changes have been made since the proposal of these standards. The majority of the changes have been made to clarify portions of the rule that were unclear to the commenters. Other changes include adding additional control combinations and an equation that allows cleaning machines that do not have a solvent vapor/air interface area to comply with the standard by meeting a solvent emission limit based on cleaning capacity. A summary of the major changes is presented below.
