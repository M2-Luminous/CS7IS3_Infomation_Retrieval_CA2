There was nothing wrong with this, he said. In fact he welcomed it. "Let's not get overly squeamish about it. They (parties) are in a power game with one another, and if they want to settle on the basis that they withdraw objections there's nothing wrong with it, ethically or legally," he said. The IEC would "certainly not stand in the way" and, if asked, would assist. He wanted to make one thing clear: "We (IEC) have never been asked to certify that the result is accurate. We have been asked to certify that the particular political process is substantially free and fair." There would be "verneukery" (crookery), but what mattered was its effect on the outcome of the elections. "You can't work in a brothel and remain chaste." With only 10 days in which to certify the elections, and mindful that the presidential inauguration was scheduled for Tuesday, the ordinary process for hearing complaints was "quite clearly not available." "We have to make an assessment on available data," Kriegler said. IEC commissioner Dikgang Moseneke said if complaints were not resolved between parties, the IEC would make the final judgment. "We have vast powers ... to make some adjustments." The political horse trading to save the elections -- to ensure they could be declared free and fair -- began last Friday. A source in the President's office said that at a crisis meeting attended by President F.W. de Klerk and ANC president Nelson Mandela, Kriegler was offered access to state resources to help the IEC complete its task. Kriegler than met TEC [Transitional Executive Committee] management committee members Cyril Ramaphosa, Roelf Meyer and Joe Slovo. Slovo said this week that in the end it had been decided not to assist the IEC "because it may have been construed as the TEC taking over the IEC." At Friday's meeting, De Klerk and Mandela initially accused the judge of not doing his job properly, the source said. But they decided to do everything possible to rescue the process. "The judge admitted that the elections were a shambles," the source said. "The meeting ended up as an exercise in damage control." A government source said: "They decided free and fair elections had to be declared, come hell or high water." De Klerk said he was worried Inkatha Freedom Party president Mangosuthu Buthelezi would feel left out, and asked Kriegler to call the KwaZulu leader to reassure him that the meeting had been part of the process to keep various leaders informed. After the meeting, Kriegler said there was no reason to doubt that the elections would not be free and fair. De Klerk acted swiftly too, when, at a news conference two hours later and broadcast live to the nation, he put beyond question any doubts that the elections would be anything but free and fair. Ramaphosa also poured oil on trouble waters, telling a news conference on Saturday: "Despite all the problems that were experienced during the election campaign we believe that the election itself has been run on a free and fair basis, and we would like to applaud the IEC which was charged with Mission Impossible."
