Witnesses said they heard gunfire, and that RPF soldiers, who are predominantly Tutsi, were fighting residents of the majority Hutu tribe in Kigali. A spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda said however that its troops always accompanied RPF men, and he could not confirm that former rebels were involved in armed incidents. Humanitarian agency sources said there had probably been casualties in what they described as "very localised" clashes, but most of the capital was calm, they added. [passage omitted]
