FR941019-2-00121 FR941019-2-00080 Pursuant to Title VII.B of the Tariff Act, 34 parties designated in the statute may petition for antidumping duties, which must be imposed on foreign merchandise that is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at ``less than fair value'' (``LTFV''), if the U.S. industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by imports of the foreign merchandise. The ITA makes the LTFV determination, and the ITC is responsible for the injury decision. 34 See 19 U.S.C. 1673 et seq. (1988 & Supp. 1993). 2.833␣Section 337 Section 337 of the Tariff Act, 19 U.S.C. 1337, prohibits ``unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in the importation of articles into the United States,'' if the effect is to destroy or substantially injure a U.S. industry, or where the acts relate to importation of articles infringing U.S. patents, copyrights, trademarks, or registered mask works. 35 Complaints are filed with ITC. The principal remedies under Section 337 are an exclusion order directing that any offending goods be excluded from entry into the United States, and a cease and desist order directed toward any offending U.S. firms and individuals. 36 The ITC is required to give the Agencies an opportunity to comment before making a final determination. 37 In addition, the Department participates in the interagency group that prepares recommendations for the President to approve, disapprove, or allow to take effect the import relief proposed by the ITC. 35 19 U.S.C. 1337 (1988 & Supp. 1993). 36 19 U.S.C. 1337 (d), (f) (1988 & Supp. 1993). 37 19 U.S.C. 1337(b)(2) (1988). 2.84␣Trade Act of 1974 2.841␣Section 201 Section 201 of this Act, 19 U.S.C. 2251 et seq., provides that American businesses claiming serious injury due to significant increases in imports may petition the ITC for relief or modification under the so-called ``escape clause.'' If the ITC makes a determination that ``an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article,'' and formulates its recommendation for appropriate relief, the Department participates in the interagency committee that conducts the investigations and advises the President whether to adopt, modify, or reject the import relief recommended by the ITC. 2.842␣Section 301 Section 301 of this Act, 19 U.S.C. 2411, provides that the U.S. Trade Representative (``USTR''), subject to the specific direction, if any, of the President, may take action, including restricting imports, to enforce rights of the United States under any trade agreement, to address acts inconsistent with the international legal rights of the United States, or to respond to unjustifiable, unreasonable or discriminatory practices of foreign governments that burden or restrict U.S. commerce. Interested parties may initiate such actions through petitions to the USTR, or the USTR may itself initiate proceedings. 38 Of particular interest to antitrust enforcement is Section 301(d)(3)(B)(III), which includes among the ``unreasonable'' practices of foreign governments that might justify a proceeding the ``toleration by a foreign government of systematic anticompetitive activities by private firms or among enterprises in the foreign country that have the effect of restricting *␣*␣* access of United States goods [or services] to purchasing by such firms.'' 39 The Department participates in the interagency committee that makes recommendations to the President on what actions, if any, should be taken. 38 19 U.S.C. 2412(a), (b) (1988); see also Identification of Trade Expansion Priorities, Exec. Order No. 12, 901, 59 Fed. Reg. 10,727 (1994). 39 19 U.S.C. 2411(d)(3)(B)(i)(III)(1988). 2.9␣Relevant International Agreements To further the twin goals of promoting enforcement cooperation between the United States and foreign governments and of reducing any tensions that may arise in particular proceedings, the Agencies have developed close bilateral relationships with antitrust and competition policy officials of many different countries. In some instances, understandings have been reached with respect to notifications, consultations, and cooperation in antitrust matters. In other instances, more general rules endorsed by multilateral organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (``OECD'') provide the basis for the Agencies' cooperative policies. Finally, even in the absence of specific or general international understandings or recommendations, the Agencies often seek cooperation with foreign authorities. 2.91␣Bilateral Cooperation Agreements Formal written bilateral arrangements exist between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany, Australia, and Canada. 40 International antitrust cooperation can also occur through mutual legal assistance treaties (``MLATs''), which are treaties of general application pursuant to which the United States and a foreign country agree to assist one another in criminal law enforcement matters. MLATs currently are in force with nearly 20 foreign countries, and many more are in the process of ratification or negotiation. However, only the MLAT with Canada has been used to date to cover antitrust offenses. 41 The Agencies also hold regular consultations with the antitrust officials of Canada, the European Commission, and Japan, and have close, informal ties with the antitrust authorities of many other countries. Since 1990, they have cooperated closely with countries in the process of establishing competition agencies, assisted by funding provided by the Agency for International Development. 40 See Agreement Relating to Mutual Cooperation Regarding Restrictive Business Practices, June 23, 1976, U.S.&hyph;F.R.G., 27 U.S.T. 1956, T.I.S.

Rep. (CCH) ¶13,503. The Agencies also signed a similar agreement with the Commission of the European Communities in 1991. See Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Commission of the European Communities Regarding the Application of Their Competition Laws, Sept. 23, 1991, 30 ILM 1491 (Nov. 1991), reprinted in 4 Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) ¶13,504. However, on August 9, 1994, the European Court of Justice ruled that the Agreement did not comply with institutional requirements of the law of the European Union (``EU''). Under the Court's decision, action by the EU Council of Ministers is necessary for this type of agreement. See French Republic v. Commission of European Communities (No. C&hyph;327/91) (Aug. 9, 1994). 41 Treaty with Canada on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, S. Exec. Rep. No. 100&hyph;114, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. (1989). During the week of October 3, 1994, Congress passed H.R. 4781, the International Antitrust Enforcement Assistance Act of 1994, see n.95 infra, which authorizes the Agencies to enter into antitrust mutual assistance agreements in accordance with the legislation. 2.92␣International Guidelines and Recommendations The Agencies have agreed with respect to member countries of the OECD to consider the legitimate interests of other nations in accordance with relevant OECD recommendations. 42 Under the terms of a 1986 recommendation, the United States agency with responsibility for a particular case notifies a member country whenever an antitrust enforcement action may affect important interests of that country or its nationals. 43 Examples of potentially notifiable actions include requests for documents located outside the United States, attempts to obtain information from potential witnesses located outside the United States, and cases or investigations with significant foreign conduct or involvement of foreign persons. 42 See Revised Recommendations of the OECD Council Concerning Cooperation Between Member Countries on Restrictive Business Practices Affecting International Trade, OECD Doc. No. C(86)44 (Final) (May 21, 1986). The Recommendation also calls for countries to consult with each other in appropriate situations, with the aim of promoting enforcement cooperation and minimizing differences that may arise. 43 The OECD has 25 member countries and the European Union is represented as an observer. The OECD's membership includes many of the most advanced market economies in the world. The OECD also has several observer nations, who have rapid progress toward open market economies. The Agencies follow recommended OECD practices with respect to all member countries.
