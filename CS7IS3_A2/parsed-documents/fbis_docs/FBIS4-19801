The cabinet agreed to set spending at a total 613 billion francs (105.6 billion dollars) for the years 1995 to 2000, an "annual increase of 0.5 percent in volume," Government Spokesman Nicholas Sarkozy said. This "could go up to 1.5 percent if the economic situation permits" when the government's five-year spending plan comes up for revision in 1997, he added. According to analysts, state spending in other sectors has been cut by around 0.5 percent per year under the plan, launched by the centre-right government to contain the public deficit. The defence proposals must still be approved by both houses of parliament. The government's priorities are to maintain the nuclear deterrent, strengthen conventional forces "to prevent crises and contain conflicts, reaffirm the link between defence and the nation (through) the national service and maintaining a strong arms industry on a European scale," Sarkozy said. The number of people in the Army would come down gradually, however, from 606,000 in 1995 to 579,000 in the year 2000, he added. Development of the new M5 nuclear missile will also be delayed, along with the Rafale combat aircraft, and a cost-cutting exercise has begun for the European transport helicopter NH-90, a Ministry official said. President Francois Mitterrand made lengthy remarks in the cabinet's deliberations, his spokesman Jean Musitelli said Wednesday without giving details of his contribution. A well informed source, who did not wish to be identified, said Mitterrand had underlined his agreement with the spending programme and shown understanding of the financial restraints which led to the M5 delay. The share of spending on nuclear weapons will continue to fall by about a quarter despite development of a land-based version of the M4/M45 nuclear submarine missile, to be used from 2005 at the ballistic missile base on the Albion plateau in south-east France, the Ministry official said. If its European partners agree, the Ministry also plans to develop a modular armoured personnel carrier with Germany and the new Horizon frigate with Italy and Britain, the official said.
