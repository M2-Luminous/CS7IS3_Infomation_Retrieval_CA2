Germany's share in the development costs alone will at least be 300 million German marks [DM] more than planned. An expert in the Federal Audit Court even expects the costs to increase by DM700 million. The reason is that, on the instructions of Defense Minister Volker Ruehe of the Christian Democratic Union, the industry must make the controversial Eurofighter less powerful and thus cheaper. In view of Ruehe's request to force the unit price of the European fighter aircraft below DM100 million, the additional costs have become inevitable, the German general contractor, German Aerospace (Dasa) has stated. The DM300 million are made up of DM145 million caused by the longer duration of the project, DM100 million in inflation compensation, and a remainder resulting from a change in the guidelines for the calculation of profits. All in all, Dasa has requested DM570 million from the German defense budget for the development of the Eurofighter 2000. A government decision on the procurement of the fighter aircraft has been announced for 1995.
