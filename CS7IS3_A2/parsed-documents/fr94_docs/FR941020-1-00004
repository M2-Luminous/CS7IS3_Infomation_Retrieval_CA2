FR941020-1-00004 FR941020-1-00001 Probationary Period OPM proposes to clarify basic requirements of the probationary period for new appointments, and for new supervisors and managers. The following changes are proposed: Section 315.801 would clarify that family members appointed under Executive Order 12721 are required to serve probation and that Postal Career employees who transfer to the competitive service, without having completed 1 year of service, serve the remainder of the 1 year in their new agencies as probationers. Section 315.802 would clarify that agencies may not extend the probationary period beyond 1 year and specify how prior and other service is credited towards the completion of probation. OPM may not permit agencies to extend probation beyond 1 year or impose it at agency discretion because the OPM General Counsel has advised that such an extension would be inconsistent with the adverse action protections and procedures under current law that are afforded to employees who have completed 1 year of current continuous service. Legislation is needed for longer probationary periods. Section 315.804 would clarify when the probationary period ends and when a separation must be effected. Section 315.902 refers the reader to the FPM, which referenced the Supervisory Grade Evaluation Guide (SGEG). The SGEG was replaced by General Schedule Supervisory Guide in April 1993. Section 315.906 would clarify the crediting of various service toward completion of probation for new supervisors and managers. Section 315.907 would clarify what happens when an employee takes a downgrade to enter a supervisory or managerial position and fails to complete probation. Reinstatement Eligibility Currently, 5 CFR 315.401 places a 3-year limit on the reinstatement eligibility of a nonpreference eligible who previously served under a career-conditional appointment. (Reinstatement eligibility permits an individual to be re-hired without competing in a competitive civil service examination.) Subchapter 3 of the provisionally retained FPM Chapter 315 authorizes agencies to extend this limit based on any of 14 different activities of a former employee, such as excepted employment or education which gave the individual valuable training for the job to be filled. (Career employees and preference eligible career-conditional employees already have unlimited reinstatement eligibility.) To simplify the appointment system, OPM proposes to drop the time limit on reinstatement eligibility so that any individual who served under career-conditional appointment could be rehired at any time. This change also recognizes the difficulties encountered by spouses subject to relocation (such as spouses of members of the Armed Forces) due to the current 3-year limit and that, in the future, individuals may have fewer opportunities to exercise a reinstatement eligibility in a shrinking Federal Government. Dropping the time limit will enable them to exercise their eligibility at any time. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it pertains only to Federal employees and agencies. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Review This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with Executive Order 12866.
