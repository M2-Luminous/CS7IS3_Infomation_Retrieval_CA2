FBIS3-5081 "dreas043__a94009" FBIS-EAS-94-043-A Document Type:Daily Report 4 March 1994 ANNEX Japan Motorola Reaches Tentative Phone Agreement OW0303005794 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 2 Mar 94 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0303005794 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] In connection with the issue of opening the Japanese cellular phone market, Japan Mobile Communications Company [JMCC] and Motorola are believed to have tentatively reached an agreement. While JMCC provides its cellular phone service in the capital and central Japan, Motorola has complained of difficulties in providing service in those parts of the country. JMCC will agree with Motorola to settle the issue by making investments in Motorola mobile phone facilities earlier than planned. In response, the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry will urge the U.S. Trade Representative to stop taking procedures to slap sanctions on Japan. JMCC proposed in late January raising the level of the current Motorola-type mobile service to that of its NTT-type mobile phone service by constructing 323 radio ground stations for the Motorola-type mobile phone service in the capital, and the central part of Japan by March 1997. In response, Motorola asked JMCC in mid-February to construct the radio ground stations two years ahead of schedule -- by March 1995 -- and for JMCC to purchase 225,000 sets of Motorola-made cellular phones. In hitherto informal negotiations, JMCC had expressed a willingness to invest in Motorola cellular phone facilities earlier than planned. JMCC is saddled with borrowings that are 20 times the value of its capital, and the raising of funds holds the key to implementing its side of the agreement. Toyota Motor Corporation has expressed willingness to go along with JMCC's request for increasing its capital. The Japanese car maker has also promised to do everything it can to expand the Motorola-type mobile phone service in Japan. Meanwhile, Motorola will withdraw its request for the purchase of its cellular phones. Motorola has concluded that it would be a plus for it to compromise with JMCC at this stage where it has prospects for real profits, rather than push ahead with sanctions. A senior Motorola official is due to visit Japan this weekend. While in Japan, he will meet with the Japanese side to discuss ways for JMCC to invest in Motorola mobile phone facilities earlier than planned. The U.S. trade representative is believed unlikely to slap sanctions on Japan if JMCC and Motorola conclude their negotiations successfully. There is a possibility, however, that the U.S. trade representative will not immediately halt procedures for slapping sanctions on Japan with the aim of wringing concessions from Japan in Japan-U.S. framework talks that broke down at the most recent Japan-U.S. summit talks in February, and therefore an intergovernmental agreement is likely to be deferred until later.
