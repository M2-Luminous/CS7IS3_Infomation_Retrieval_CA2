All interested parties must participate in an information seminar prior to selection. dates: The training will run from August through December 31, 1994. An information seminar will be held at CET's headquarters in San Jose, California, on June 29 through July 1, 1994. All interested service providers must: (1) Contact CET to arrange to attend the information seminar scheduled (or make alternative informal arrangements) if the organization has not previously attended one, and by July 15, the organization must submit in writing to the Department of Labor at the address below, the organization's intent to apply for this technical assistance award; (2) if the organization has previously attended a CET information seminar, it need not attend another information seminar, but, by July 15, the organization must submit in writing to the Department of Labor at the address below the organization's intent to apply for this technical assistance award; and (3) by July 19, to apply for the technical assistance, the organization must submit an original and four copies of a brief, but thorough, application to the Department of Labor at the address below, discussing the criteria as required below. Packages shall be postmarked by the dates established above. addresses: Notices of intent to attend an information seminar and to apply for this technical assistance award shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to Lisa Stuart, Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., room N&hyph;4666, Washington, DC 20210. for further information contact: Lisa Stuart or James Aaron, Employment and Training Administration, Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., room N&hyph;4666, Washington, DC 20210.

Max Martinez, CET Replication Project Training Director, Center for Employment Training, 701 Vine Street, San Jose, CA 95110. The telephone number is (408) 287&hyph;7924. This is not a toll-free number. supplementary information: The Center for Employment Training (CET) offers a unique training program which challenges standard notions of training the disadvantaged. It is a holistic approach to train the hardest-to-serve through an integrated program of contextual learning. CET focuses on job training, but combines basic education and related services in context with this core training. This method of learning was endorsed by the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills. Further, CET's program is unique in that it is accessible to all, with no entry tests or creaming. This represents the direction of the 1992 JTPA amendments, which stress targeting of services to those most in need and intensifying and improving the quality of services offered. The CET design, as implemented through this replication, will reflect the key provisions of the new program design such as assessment and individual service strategy. In addition, CET is widely recognized as one of the most effective job training programs in the country. CET's program serving minority single mothers was credited with the most positive outcomes in a comprehensive study funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. Additionally, recent research with school dropouts, in the JOBSTART study conducted by Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation (MDRC), also came up with strong positive impacts and provides growing evidence of the effectiveness of CET's program. Technical assistance will be provided to up to 7 sites to replicate the CET job training model. This technical assistance award will provide for the training and technical assistance for local entities which are selected to operate the CET model program. This award is made as a modification to an existing DOL&hyph;CET agreement that presently provides for training and technical assistance to 10 sites. Technical assistance is being provided to develop a CET-model base within the JTPA system that could provide for: A technical assistance capacity within the JTPA system; opportunity to uncover obstacles in implementing CET-model programs under JTPA; and the opportunity to delineate aspects of the model which provide the greatest benefit to JTPA participants. Selected organizations would enter into agreements with the Center for Employment Training to receive the technical assistance required for the development and start-up of the local CET model program. This is a non-monetary award. The technical assistance award includes the local and CET on-site training to enable an organization to start its own CET model program. Training would be provided during the months of August through December. The award covers the cost of CET's services and most traveling that will be required of CET and of the service providers. However, start-up costs, including site development and preliminary staffing, will be the responsibility of the selected service providers. Operation costs of the model program also are not included and are expected to come from the organizations' regular JTPA and other funding. Additional resources may be necessary and may be obtainable from local foundations. CET will assist selected sites in finding additional funding sources, if necessary. This award is to provide services to the JTPA community. Eligible applicants are limited to service delivery area (SDA) administrative entities who run their own training programs, consortiums of service providers, not-for-profit organizations, community-based organizations as defined under Section 4 of JTPA and local education organizations. Two types of applications will be accepted: (1) Applications from SDA administrative entities, and (2) joint applications with one party being the SDA administrative entity and the other being an organization listed above. Applications that do not include the local SDA administrative entity will not be accepted. This process is to ensure that all service providers have coordinated with their JTPA funding stream and that the SDA administrative entity has committed to funding the program the service provider is being trained to operate.
