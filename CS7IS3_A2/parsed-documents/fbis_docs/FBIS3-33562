The streets most affected by these demonstrations are La Reforma, Juarez, Higaldo, Insurgentes, Puente de Alvarado, (?Tlalpan), Fray Cervando, and the entire first block [cuadro], among other major areas. The General Safety and Roads Secretariat as well as the Federal District Attorney General's Office have reported despite the large number of people participating in the demonstrations, there have been no incidents so far. The Neighborhood Assemblies comprised the largest group seen on Thursday. The demonstrators tried to reach Los Pino's official residence but only got to (?Chivatito) Plaza. Presidential residence officials met with a delegation of this group. Despite the intense heat, demonstrators at one point marched on the sidewalks but then took to the streets, congesting traffic, mainly in the historic midtown area. Demonstrators are gathering there after concluding their marches. The situation has grown worse, because most of the people who came from Toluca, Mexico State, and had been gathering at the Guadalupe Basilica since yesterday have begun to return to their homes by buses, bicycles, or on foot. Some people are walking on the sidewalks, while others are walking on the asphalt roads; that is, on avenues and streets. The Relief and Medical Emergency Squad and the Red Cross have reported during the course of these demonstrations they cared for 37 people who succumbed to insolation or fatigue. None of them had to be hospitalized and were simply cared for on the spot. Bearing placards and shouting, the demonstrators have demanded housing and, by the same token, better wages and a better administration of justice or respect for human rights; others marched to support peace via dialogue in Chiapas. Private and public offices closed their doors to keep demonstrators out. The same thing happened in certain political offices in the Federal District Department, Chamber of Deputies, and the Mexico City Attorney General's Office. I repeat: There have been no major incidents, according to the information provided by the Federal District authorities. That is what we have so far, but we will continue to follow the situation, because several groups are moving toward Zocalo, causing serious problems and traffic chaos, primarily in Mexico City's first block. Although the General Safety and Roads Secretariat deployed 3,000 agents, I would describe the situation as chaotic. I would say it is impossible to control the traffic chaos, which, I repeat, is mainly taking place in the historic area.
