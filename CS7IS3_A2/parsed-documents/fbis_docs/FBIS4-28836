For one thing, Pyongyang is not exempted from IAEA nuclear inspections even if it withdraws from the agency because such checks are obligatory under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), not under IAEA membership rules. North Korea is apparently saving NPT withdrawal, a much more drastic action that would sever all inspection obligations, for the future when the UN Security Council starts implementing sanctions. In order to make its IAEA withdrawal official, North Korea must notify the United States in writing since it is the depository nation for the agency's statutes. Once such notification is made, withdrawal becomes effective immediately. North Korea joined the IAEA in 1974 and will be the first country to bolt the agency. But the communist state remains in the NPT regime and it is this link with the NPT that keeps North Korea bound to inspection obligations. In 1985 Pyongyang signed the NPT, an umbrella agreement requiring its members to comply with IAEA inspections in accordance with the safeguards accord. The IAEA, in short, conducts inspections on behalf of the NPT. As long as North Korea does not leave the NPT, the inspection requirements remain. There are other nations which are non-members of the IAEA but are parties to the NPT, such as Taiwan and Latvia. This accounts for the difference in the size of membership between the two groups. The IAEA has 118 members, including North Korea, while the NPT has a membership of 162. Changes are afoot once Pyongyang leaves the IAEA. The agency paid for all inspection costs of past monitoring activities in North Korea; but if its withdrawal becomes effective, the North must bear the costs. North Korea no longer needs to pay its share of the IAEA budget, currently 0.05 percent of the annual 20 million U.S. dollars. Officials here say Pyongyang was driven to announce its IAEA withdrawal to show that its threat to leave the NPT is not merely bluster. The IAEA, for the first time ever, adopted a sanctions resolution against North Korea on June 10 canceling 560,000 dollars worth of technical aid. The pullout announcement is in retaliation for this IAEA action as well as a threat of what may come next -- NPT withdrawal, officials say.
