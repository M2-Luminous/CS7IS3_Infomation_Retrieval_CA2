Once again, casualties and arrests. In the territories residents defied the curfew in effect almost everywhere in the West Bank and Gaza, blocking roads, burning tires, and throwing stones. The most severe incident took place in Salfit, near Tulkarm, where some 60 residents surrounded an Army outpost, showering it with stones, bottles, and petrol bombs. Soldiers emerged on foot to disperse the demonstrators. They opened fire when one of the youths brandished a knife. Five demonstrators were wounded, two seriously. [passage omitted] More troubling for the authorities are the ongoing demonstrations in Arab communities within the Green Line. The focus of the unrest shifted to Galilee today, where some 50 Israeli Arabs were arrested. In Nazareth youths blocked the main road and threw stones at the bank, the post office, and government offices. Police initially refrained from entering the city in large numbers, but moved in early in the afternoon to break up the demonstrations. Thirty three people were arrested in the city. There were also large demonstrations in Kafr Kana and Baqa al-Gharbiyah. In East Jerusalem, two policemen and eight Palestinians were wounded in clashes today. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 28 February adds that "a Molotov cocktail was thrown at an Israeli car at the Armon Hanetziv neighborhood this evening. The car was not damaged. A rented car was set on fire at Wadi al-Jawz in East Jerusalem, and a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Border Police vehicle in the Old City of Jerusalem, but the vehicle was not damaged. There were no casualties in these three incidents. ["In the center of Hebron, several shots were directed at an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] patrol not far from Gross Square. There were no casualties. The patrol soldiers returned fire and began searches." [Also, "six masked people were caught in the village of Abu-Dis in East Jerusalem; two youths who threw Molotov cocktails at the security forces in Khan Yunus were detained; and five youths who were on their way to committing arson were caught at Wadi al-Jawz in East Jerusalem."]
