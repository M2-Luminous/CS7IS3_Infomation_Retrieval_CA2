They are renowned Chinese educators, scientists, and artists: Jin Kaicheng, CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee member, Jiusan Society Central Committee vice chairman, and Beijing University Chinese Language Department professor; Wu Zuqiang, CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee member and former Central Conservatory of Music president; Ye Danian, CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee member, China Democratic League Central Committee Standing Committee member, and Chinese Academy of Sciences Geology Institute member and researcher; Zhang Kaixun, CPPCC National Committee member, China Association for Promoting Democracy Central Committee member, and Beijing Machinery Industry and Automation Institute senior engineer; Zhao Yufen, CPPCC National Committee member, Chinese Academy of Sciences member, and Qinghua University professor; and Guan Dongsheng, CPPCC National Committee member, Central University of Nationalities professor, and calligrapher. [(Wen Guangwei)] (Wen Guangwei), from the Central People's Broadcasting Station. My question is directed to Standing Committee member Jin Kaicheng: Respect for knowledge and talented people is the key for developing scientific, educational, and cultural undertakings. Would you please discuss how this concept is being implemented in actual work? [Jin] Comrade Deng Xiaoping has all along advocated respect for knowledge and talented people. Through the efforts by higher and lower levels and in all sectors since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, this concept has gradually taken root in society and has been translated in various concrete actions. For example, the Teachers Law provides that the whole society shall respect teachers. This is a concrete expression of respecting knowledge and talented people in the education sphere. Therefore, in my view, some progress has indeed been made in implementing the concept in education. However, I would like to call attention to a more noteworthy phenomenon in society, that is, the demand for talented people under circumstances of a market economy. The demand for talented people has become very acute in some places, though it has not become burning yet. In the light of this, I believe that in the future, the concept of respecting knowledge and talented people will be translated as the demand for knowledge and talented people rather than the continued practice of everyone eating from the same big pot. Meanwhile, the view of talented people will be changed from a static and dynamic state. At present, the acute demand for talented people is reflected not nationwide, but only at certain points, such as the Zhongguancun Single Trade Lane and village and township enterprises in southern Jiangsu. However, I dare to predict today that so long as China continues its reform, development, and stability for a long time to come, the demand for talented people will pervade the whole country. By that time, respect for knowledge and talented people will no longer be an issue of understanding; it will be guaranteed by an irresistible force. [Reporter] Hong Kong WEN WEI PO reporter. What is the government policy regarding to Hong Kong and Taiwan singers' performance tours in the mainland this year? [Wu Zuqiang] Quite a few singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan performed in the mainland over the past few years. They exerted some good influences, strengthened exchanges in music between the two sides, and brought along new songs to the delight of mainland music lovers. However, problems also cropped up in the past two years. They were caused mainly by poor quality of some performers and their mainland agents' sheer profit-seeking approach, thus creating confusion and harmful consequences. For this reason, the culture departments, at suggestions from the masses, have recently examined the work related to Hong Kong and Taiwan singers performance tours, and will work out more effective and rational administrative measures. I believe singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan will continue to stage concerts and performance tours in the mainland in 1994, but I hope such activities will be conducted through proper channels and will exert healthy influence on music and society. [Reporter] RENMIN ZHENGXIE BAO [PEOPLE'S POLITICAL CONSULTATIVE NEWS]. My question is directed to member Guan Dongsheng. As I understand it, in the current session, CPPCC members have attached great importance to the development of ethnic minority regions. As a University of Nationalities professor, do you have any suggestions or opinions for developing culture and education in ethnic minority regions? [Guan] As is known to all, due to historical, social, and geographical reasons, the overwhelming majority of China's ethnic minority regions are lagging far behind the coastal regions in terms of the overall development of economy, education, and culture. The party and government have always paid keen attention to the development of minority nationalities regions. The 1990 CPC Central Committee Proposal Concerning the Formulation of the 10-Year Program for National Economic and Social Development and the Eighth Five- Year Plan stressed the need to bring into full play the ethnic regions' advantages and to appropriately combine the exploitation of their resources with their social and economic development to gradually change the relative economic backwardness of ethnic regions. Facts have proved that the party's policy toward minority nationalities implemented since the PRC's founding is entirely correct and has withstood the tests of time. Premier Li Peng's government work report to the current National People's Congress [NPC] session further emphasized the need to put education in a strategic position for priority development and to increase funds for educational undertakings. Premier Li Peng also suggested that governments at various levels cut back expenditures in other areas and do everything possible to achieve concrete results in developing education. All NPC deputies and CPPCC members attending the current sessions believe Premier Li Peng's suggestion reflects the fervent hope of the Chinese people of all nationalities. They have called upon leaders at all levels to guard against formalism and to earnestly implement the suggestion to the letter. They have also urged leaders to thoroughly understand the great significance of developing education in ethnic regions and to make an effort at training ethnic talented people and raising the quality of ethnic work force. This is the only way for invigorating ethnic regions' economy, and the cardinal principle for safeguarding national unity and the motherland's unification and for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Moreover, it is necessary to proceed from reality in all things and fully consider the minority nationalities regions' ethnic characteristics in increasing funds for basic education in ethnic regions and continuing to adopt feasible and flexible methods in running schools -- such as bilingual education, technical schools, and schools run by the coastal regions -- so as to keep up with the demand for development in ethnic regions. In my view, to achieve initial prosperity in ethnic regions, it is necessary to first promote education. [Reporter] ZHONGGUO RIBAO correspondent. My question is directed to Ms. Zhao Yufen. The government has drawn up a new program for developing higher education. Would you explain the program's contents and your assessment? [Zhao] The most formidable task facing the Education Commission is called Project 211, a project for training talented people. As you know, the world contest for national strength today will ultimately be a contest for talented people. China is aware of the great importance of training talented people. Project 211 aims at building 100 key universities that will reach the world's most advanced level in a number of subjects within a short period of time. At present, many schools of higher learning, including famous national and provincial universities, are vying with each other to become one of the 100 key universities. In view of the fierce competition to be included in the project, many local governments have financed various universities to set up joint campuses so that each can best utilize its strong points to become a key university. As a result, we have seen a trend for joint management of schools of higher learning. The Chinese nation is now endeavoring to build a great wall of talented people. Project 211 is as significant as the Three Gorges Project. This is the largest-scale project to train talented people in Chinese history. [Reporter] Hong Kong SING TAO DAILY correspondent. My question is directed to Mr. Zhang Kaixun. How do you raise funds for popularizing technological innovations? Were any illicit means ever used in fund raising, such as in the Shen Taifu case? [Zhang] If the topic of a scientific research project is directly related to the development of production or a common need of the people's everyday lives, such as medicine and health care, disaster prevention and control, and new scientific instruments, the project can find manufacturers of related fields as sponsors. We have recently developed a new medical device which can accurately detect possible infant suffocation during sleep. The need for such a device already existed before we started planning the project. After we disclosed our idea to relevant enterprises and organizations, they were certain that their sponsorship for the project would succeed because it was a demand of society for scientific innovation and they had the responsibility to meet this demand. In this way, we have effectively combined the wealth, enthusiasm, and wisdom of society to jointly carry out the project. Therefore, it is not difficult for us to raise funds for developing new technology. We do not use Shen Taifu's method. [Reporter] KEJI RIBAO [SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DAILY] correspondent. My question is directed to member Ye Danian. While deliberating the government work report, what is the issue of utmost concern to CPPCC National Committee members? [Ye] My experience from attending the past seven CPPCC sessions shows that inadequate input is the issue of most concern to members from science and technology circles, and it has been discussed time and again. Members are encouraged by the Scientific and Technological Progress Law, which will become effective soon. However, they deplore the absence of provisions in the law for a fixed input in science and technology during a given period of time. They feel that even though funds for science and technology have increased numerically, the increase is off-set by price rises and the funds are insignificant. Another issue is the policy of holding fast to one end and leaving the whole field open. Members support this policy, but hope it will be more specific and easy to be implemented. [Reporter] China International Broadcasting Station correspondent. As we understand it, there are many cultural relics around the Three Gorges Dam area. The CPPCC National Committee last year organized members for a tour of the area. As I know, Wu Zuqiang was one of the members. Would member Wu Zuqiang explain measures to protect cultural relics in the Three Gorges Dam area? [Wu] We visited many places with cultural relics. It was our general impression that vigorous efforts should be made to promptly preserve cultural relics while building the dam. We are pleased that our findings have provided a positive impact to the efforts to preserve cultural relics. For example, the Three Gorges Construction Committee has set an unprecedented rule that requires companies and organizations bidding for any project to include provisions for protecting cultural relics into the terms of contracts. [Moderator] This is the end of the news conference. Thank you.
