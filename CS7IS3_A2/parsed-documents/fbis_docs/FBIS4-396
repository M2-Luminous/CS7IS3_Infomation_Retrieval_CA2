This means that we are able to land planes and bring in units, which we will be continuing to do in the afternoon. We will then proceed to transfer expatriates from their homes in the city to the airport. You must realize that there are great difficulties at the moment. There is fighting between the town and the airport, so we need extra forces, which are on their way, in order to ensure the security of this transfer. [Boussie] What are you most afraid of in the coming hours? [Lanzade] We fear an extension of the trouble in Kigali. In the slightly longer term, we are very worried about a possible resumption of fighting between Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] forces in the north of the country and the Rwandan armed forces. We are worried that this fighting might take place near or even in the city itself, and with a much higher level of fighting than we are currently seeing. [end recording]
