FR940505-1-00094 FR940505-1-00012 The declining facility-wide emission caps will have a monthly compliance period (i.e., a single monthly emissions limit for the entire facility that declines annually as opposed to emission limits on single emission points), an annual reduction rate (4 to 9 percent for VOC, 6 to 9 percent for NO X ), and initial baseline emission caps (caps for the first 12 months of the program) established using anticipated implementation-year inventories (year 2001 projected inventories) for the universe of facilities included in the FIP cap program. The facilities subject to the FIP cap program will be those facilities that generate emissions of NO X or VOC greater than or equal to 4 tpy in the FIP areas. The universe of facilities included in the FIP cap program is based on process lists or emission categories that make up a significant portion of the emissions necessary to be reduced to ensure attainment in the FIP areas. In developing its proposal, EPA has drawn on its experience and involvement in other emission cap programs such as the CAA Title IV program (Acid Rain), the South Coast Air Quality Management District's Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM), and the general guidance provided by the proposed Economic Incentive Program (EIP) rules and guidance (58 FR 11110, February 23, 1993). Discussed below are the source categories for which rules have been developed. These measures would be promulgated as complete regulations in the FIP but would not require emissions reductions until 2001 in order to allow the FIP areas time to develop measures which obtain the necessary reductions and to allow EPA adequate time to implement these measures to ensure attainment and progress towards attainment by the statutory attainment dates. The measures for stationary and areas sources would mandate a linear annual reduction of emissions from individual facilities with emissions greater than or equal to 4 tpy in order to accomplish necessary reductions not achieved through other FIP measures and federally approved SIP rules (facilities with emissions greater than or equal to 2 tons per year will be subject to exemption verification reporting requirements). Because EPA has chosen not to develop conventional control measures at this time for a portion of the VOC and NO X inventory, the level of control for the FIP cap measures must be sufficient to make up for at least a 20 percent VOC and at least a 30 percent NO X emission reduction shortfall. (2) Reduction Rate. Assuming that the creditable State rules and FIP rules will meet minimum progress requirements (particularly in the South Coast FIP area) for the period up to 2000, the proposed FIP cap rules are designed to go into effect beginning in 2001 and to achieve reductions from each category of between 4 and 9 percent per year for VOC and between 6 and 9 percent per year for NO X until the year 2005. 62 This design, for example, means that in 2001 a VOC-emitting facility would reduce its emissions at least 4 percent from its baseline emissions; in 2002 the same facility would reduce its emissions by at least 8 percent of its baseline emissions. By 2005, the facility's emissions would be reduced by at least 20 percent of its baseline (or year 2000) emissions. 62 This design assumes that the Sacramento area's ozone nonattainment classification is changed to allow for a year 2005 attainment date. If a 1999 attainment date for Sacramento is assumed, then the cap program in the Sacramento area would start with compliance plan submittal in 1998 and full reductions required in 1999, in order to achieve the earlier attainment date. The Ventura area's ozone nonattainment classification allows for a year 2005 attainment date. (3) Withdrawal of Rules Based on SIP Progress. These proposed FIP cap measures serve as a strong incentive for State efforts, since they could be rescinded before their scheduled implementation dates if areawide emissions are reduced to the prescribed levels through the adoption and implementation of future SIP rules. In addition, any of these measures could be rescinded upon EPA approval of State or local measures that obtain the necessary reductions and which would not interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further progress, or any other applicable requirement of the CAA. EPA strongly encourages the State to adopt measures quickly and in a manner that will minimize adverse economic impacts. (4) Relationship to Other Applicable FIP Provisions. Given the overlap between the source categories in the proposed FIP cap program (see section III.C.5.b.(2)) and those source categories regulated by traditional means, EPA is proposing to include the reductions achieved by the other regulations (i.e., the other FIP and/or SIP measures which are effective at the time of the FIP cap program's implementation) in the FIP cap program baseline setting procedures. This design means that EPA is assuming that all reductions required by other portions of the regulatory framework are achieved by the year 2001. EPA believes this design to be a necessity given the emission reduction shortfalls and attainment dates faced in the FIP areas. However, EPA seeks comment on this design and potential alternatives that will ensure attainment and progress prior to a given FIP area's attainment date. This design also assumes that facilities after 2001 would not be operating under two regulatory frameworks; rather, the traditional regulations are assumed to have achieved their associated reductions and the FIP cap regulations would make up for shortfalls necessary in the FIP areas. This issue will be examined periodically to determine the impacts of the interface and the ultimate reduction rate for the FIP cap program in the FIP areas. In the proposed FIP cap regulations EPA assumed no participation of new sources in the program. EPA's design assumes that new sources will be subject to federally approved new source review rules and emission limits. However, EPA seeks comment on means for including new sources in the FIP cap program and alternatives to the current design. (5) Implementation and Enforcement Issues. The emission reduction requirements derive from the areawide emission reduction requirements of the FIP, rather than from the normal Agency assessments of available technologies. As such, they may be costly and disruptive, and the prospect of their federal implementation, in the case of inadequate State progress, should inspire successful adoption of the SIP. Over time, the State and local agencies can develop carefully tailored economic incentive programs or traditional rules based upon the most recent technologies and regulatory approaches. For example, the SCAQMD has recently adopted the RECLAIM program and also has a multi-million dollar technology development program to assist industry to identify and successfully apply the latest scientific approaches that can be employed to reduce pollutant emissions. With these types of resources and, most importantly, with additional time to develop the most feasible control approaches, the State and local agencies are in a superior position to construct regulations that avoid social and economic dislocation. (a) Compliance mechanisms. As designed, the FIP cap program requires affected sources to submit facility compliance plans to the Agency for review by 1999. These plans must outline the facility's means to achieve the specific annual reductions from 2001 to 2005. The options for meeting the annual reductions include, but are not limited to, product reformulation, product substitution, control equipment, and, if necessary, production curtailments. 63 63 See section (i) for a discussion of the option of trading credits as a possible means of meeting reduction requirements.
