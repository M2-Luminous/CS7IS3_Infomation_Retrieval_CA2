FR940803-2-00066 FR940803-2-00055 PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION Request for Extension of Approval Under the Paperwork Reduction Act; Collection of Information Under 29 CFR Part 2674, Notice of Insolvency AGENCY: Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. ACTION: Notice of request for extension of OMB approval. SUMMARY: This notice advises the public that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has requested extension of approval by the Office of Management and Budget for a currently approved collection of information (1212&hyph;0033) contained in its regulation on Notice of Insolvency (29 CFR Part 2674). The collection of information involves notices that must be given by the plan sponsor of a multiyear pension plan under certain adverse financial circumstances described in the regulation. Current approval of the collection of information expires on September 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: All written comments (at least three copies) should be addressed to: Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1212&hyph;0031), Washington, DC 20503. The request for extension will be available for public inspection at the PBGC Communications and Public Affairs Department, Suite 240, 1200 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20006, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on business days. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Harold J. Ashner or Deborah C. Murphy, Attorney, Office of the General Counsel, Suite 340, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 1200 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20006, 202&hyph;326&hyph;4024 (202&hyph;326&hyph;4179 for TTY and TDD). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This collection of information is contained in the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's (``PBGC's'') regulation on Notice of Insolvency (29 CFR 2674). Section 4245(e) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA'') requires that the sponsor of a multiemployer pension plan that is in reorganization notify the Secretary of the Treasury, the PBGC, and certain third parties ( i.e., contributing employers, employee organizations representing participants, and plan participants and beneficiaries) whenever the plan is or may become ``insolvent'' for a plan year (that is, unable to pay full benefits when due during that plan year). The plan sponsor must also notify the same parties of the level of benefits that will be paid during each insolvency year. Section 4245(e)(4) provides that these notices (except for the notices to the Secretary of the Treasury) are to be given in accordance with rules promulgated by the PBGC. Section 4245(e) requires two types of notice to the PBGC: a ``notice of insolvency,'' stating the plan sponsor's determination that the plan is or may become insolvent, and a ``notice of insolvency benefit level,'' stating the level of benefits that will be paid during an insolvency year. (The notices also go to certain third parties.) The Notice of Insolvency regulation prescribes the contents of these notices, the manner in which they must be given, and the time limits for their issuance. The PBGC uses the information it receives to estimate cash needs for financial assistance to troubled plans. Without this regulation, the notices required by ERISA section 4245 would be inconsistently given and of varying quality, as plan sponsors applied their individual interpretations to the law. Further, PBGC financial assistance to troubled plans would likely be delayed by delays in notification. The PBGC has requested extension of approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for this collection of information (1212&hyph;033), which is currently approved by OMB through September 30, 1994. The PBGC estimates that three plans will be affected by this regulation each year and that each of these plans will spend 6 hours preparing the required notices. This amounts to an annual burden on the public of 18 hours. Issued at Washington, DC, this 28th day of July 1994. Martin Slate, Executive Director, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
