He pointed out that the two countries' central banks, finance and external economic relations ministries had already signed the corresponding agreements. The first deputy prime minister also told the journalists of the results of the working meeting of experts of the Russian-Belarusian interstate commission on the unification of the two countries' monetary systems which ended in Minsk recently. Myasnikovich said the experts agreed that, firstly, it is necessary to equalize prices to ensure the two countries' successful trade. In particular, the prices of fuel sold to Belarus must be equal to Russia's internal prices. In addition, it is necessary to lift all customs duties in bilateral trade. Secondly, the two countries will not merge their budget systems since they agreed that the shares of deficit in their GDP must be proportional. (In 1993, Russia's budget deficit was 10.5% of GDP, while it was 6% in Belarus - Interfax's note.) Thirdly, Myasnikovich said that cash Belarusian rubles will be exchanged for Russian ones at the rate of 1:1. Belarus needs to put in its circulation about 700 billion Russian rubles, while the republic's aggregate money supply at the moment is 2.1 trillion rubles, according to Myasnikovich. The rate for non-cash exchange will be set according to statistical data on the purchasing strength of the two countries' monetary units at the moment of unification. Judged by this parameter, the Russian ruble was stronger than the Belarusian one by 2.19 times on January 1, 1994, according to the Russian and Belarussian statistics committees. Experts of the International Monetary Fund say the ratio will be 1:2.5 by March 1. Fourthly, Belarusian wages should be roughly equal to Russian wages. At present, the gap between them is by about 3 times, that is why the experts agreed that the salaries of employees of state bodies will be re-calculated within three months of the beginning of the unification. Finally, the two countries' correspondent accounts with the counterpart central bank will play a passive role as they will only keep the payments register. Myasnikovich said the experts were finalizing disputable issues related to the unification in Moscow.
