[passage omitted] In its declaration, the convention stresses that no political goals can justify the suffering of innocent population, genocide and ethnic cleansing, particularly suffered by the Bosniak people. It stresses that the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina lies in its independence and sovereignty within the internationally recognized borders. Both the declaration and the proclamation on the convocation of a convention of trust energetically urge the strictest punishment by the international tribunal of all war criminals. The convocation of the convention of trust itself is necessary because interethnic trust will not be restored easily and quickly, while the convention can contribute to this hard and painstaking process. [passage omitted] Let us just add in conclusion that the convention of the citizens of Serb nationality ended with the election of the Serb Civic Forum [Srpski gradjanski forum]. Mirko Pejanovic was elected president of the 32-member forum.
