INTERFAX learned this from sources close to the Kyrgyz Government. This document was supported by all political parties, public, cultural and national centers. The memorandum was expected to be signed by Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev, parliament's Chairman Medetkan Sherimkulov, Premier Abbas Dzhumagulov, the Assembly of Kyrgyz Peoples and nine registered political parties. The signatories were meant to undertake to refrain from actions which could deteriorate the political situation and trigger off public disorder, to back the policy of the republic's leadership and to hold consultations on all major issues of interior policy. INTERFAX learned that some connection had been suggested to exist between non-signing of the memorandum and the president's press service's statement circulated on 11 May accusing the government of failure in taxation and budget policy. The government considered this as quite unexpected actions, which might lead to negative consequences. According to some sources, Dzhumagulov had intended to sign the memorandum but postponed the signing when the situation mentioned above emerged and went on a working visit to a Kyrgyz region.
