Good morning, Mr. Kinkel. [Kinkel] Good morning. [Wiese] Mr. Kinkel, your party is regarded as the major loser of this election. How do you explain the defeat? [Kinkel] Undoubtedly, this is a disappointing result for us. Unfortunately, we do not have such thick cushions as the other big parties, so that a relatively small loss immediately leads us into turbulence. Yet it would have been so important for us if the FDP had been represented again in the European Parliament. Well, what is the reason? I feel that we simply did not succeed in convincing a sufficient number of voters of the need for liberals in the European Parliament. Of course, we will have to examine whether we have made mistakes. We will do this in the committees today. The course that we have taken will be continued. We will not change it. We never achieved phenomenal results in European elections. Unfortunately, I add. Sometimes we got in, sometimes we had to get out -- the changes were rather abrupt. This time, we are out again. We have to look forward and primarily concentrate on the Bundestag election, but also on the Landtag and municipal elections that lie ahead of us. I am sure that we will be successful again. [Wiese] How do you assess the interpretation of the bad result for your party that the FDP simply does not have a sharp profile or a liberal profile, but leans too much on the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], the big coalition partner? [Kinkel] I think that it is not right because we conducted a Europe-oriented election campaign. Apparently -- I noticed this in my numerous meetings -- the people are not very interested in this Europe. Perhaps it was wrong that we concentrated too much on it. At our party congress in Rostock last weekend, we developed a program with a sharp profile, with which we will also enter the Bundestag election campaign. As for the rest, we have a coalition with the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] and we said -- which, in my opinion, is still right -- that we will continue this coalition because we have done a good job. We will do this. I say it once again: As far as the last results are concerned, we always gained twice as much as in the European elections or even more than that. Nevertheless, matters must not be minced. Just for my first anniversary as party chairman, I would have wished for better results. [Wiese] FDP Deputy Chairwoman Irmgard Schwaetzer said that the reasons for the FDP losses are the discussion on people with higher incomes and the fact that the FDP's clear coalition statement for the CDU/CSU in the government has not been used to present the FDP as an independent force. [Kinkel] Well, what slipped into the draft of our election program regarding the people with higher incomes was not good. We corrected it. We are a party that also admits mistakes. This certainly did not help us. However, I do not believe that it greatly harmed us in the European election. Nevertheless, we have to examine, of course, whether this may happen again in the future. It will not be possible to rule this out completely, just as in other parties. Regarding the other reasons that Mrs. Schwaetzer mentioned, I would not take the same point of view. We have -- I must repeat it -- our own profile; we will continue our own election campaign. In the past, we were also often in turbulence and difficult situations. The FDP always recovered from it. I am not trying to mince matters, but I am sure that we will preserve the necessary motivation thrust for the Bundestag election. Then we will see. Personally, I learned to lose in sports. One also has to live with ups and downs in politics. I say it once again: We do not have such a thick cushion as the big parties. Our existence is always threatened. I hope that we will overcome this low. At any rate, we will stick to the course that we have taken. [Wiese] Keyword Bundestag election, Mr. Kinkel. If you were to make a forecast for this election result, what would it be like? [Kinkel] For my party? [Wiese] Yes. [Kinkel] I have just said it. As a prelude to the Bundestag election, I would have wished for a better result in this European election, which is something else but, of course, noteworthy. However, things are added up in the end. It is encouraging for me that the extreme Right did not have a chance. I think that the results of the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism] are very alarming. Of course, one also has to see the European Parliament in its overall make-up. If I see things correctly, not much has changed. It is, of course, pleasing that the CDU/CSU, our potential partner, has achieved very good results. We, as the FDP, will have to get going. [Wiese] Mr. Kinkel, perhaps a word about the referendum in Austria, which ended with a surprisingly high degree of agreement to Austria's entry. How do you assess this as foreign minister? [Kinkel] Well, this is extremely pleasing. I won a major bet. Austrian Foreign Minister Mock called me yesterday. My contribution to this result was not insignificant. This is something that makes one somewhat bitter. Regarding Europe's development in the postwar period, we Free Democrats have done much: Scheel, Genscher, Kinkel in the past two years. Apparently, the people have not paid tribute to it. At any rate, we were not able to translate our reputation outside into good results in the European Parliament elections. This is something that makes me somewhat bitter and sad because all the efforts paid off outside, but not at all for us within the country. [Wiese] What can Austria's special contribution to the European Union be? [Kinkel] Austria will be a benefit for this union in every respect, politically, economically, and culturally. The country is a net payer, it belongs to us. It was not in vain that I struggled so much for it and I was also right about the referendum. I anticipated a high degree of agreement and I was right.
