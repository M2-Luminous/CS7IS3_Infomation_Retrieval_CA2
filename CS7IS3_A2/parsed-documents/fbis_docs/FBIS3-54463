The text of the communique is as follows: Brave and alert people of Iran; The Islamic Culture, Guidance and Art Committee, with consideration for the hasty, irrational, and unfair response of the Voice and Vision to the inquiry and investigation report of the Majles concerning the Voice and Vision, considers mention of the following as necessary. 1) After the sacred institution of the leadership of the regime of the Islamic Republic, the Majles holds the highest position. The specific interpretations of the late Imam and the grand leader in expressing the high position of the Majles is not unknown to anyone. To insult the sacred Majles is to insult the revered people of Iran and is an unforgivable sin. 2) The Majles is the most important supervisory organization of the country, and this supervision takes the form of reminders, questions and inquiry and investigation. Article 76 of the Constitution gives explicit right of inquiry and investigation in all affairs of the country to the Majles, and to ignore or discredit it is a clear contradiction of the explicit text of the Constitution. 3) The Inquiry and Investigation Committee was formed of committed, concerned, active, and scrutinizing brothers who in carrying out the duty conferred on them spent a great deal of time in regular meetings and numerous visits and carried out this task with utmost care and impartiality, for which the Islamic Culture, Art and Guidance Committee must express its appreciation. 4) The statements presented in the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Committee are based on documents and evidence obtained from the official sources in the country, including the Accounting Office and the Voice and Vision itself. 5) Since the Voice and Vision Organization is under the supervision of the grand leader, as soon as the issue of inquiry and investigation was raised in the Majles, it was presented to his honor and this task was carried out with his permission. 6) The original inquiry and investigation report is 500 pages, and in order to be brief and considerate of the Majles' time, it was summarized in 63 pages. If necessary, the entire investigation report will be presented. 7) The response of the Voice and Vision contained nonfactual statements and many problems, with which, if necessary, we will deal. 8) Unfortunately, the Voice and Vision in its response questions the honorable members of the Inquiry and Investigation Committee, especially the revered professor, Mr. Parvaresh, whose commitment, history of struggle, and distinguished personality are as bright as the sun. This improper action has strongly disturbed the scholars, clerics, and various strata of the Hezbollah nation, especially the martyr-nurturing people of Esfahan. 9) As the honorable speaker of the Majles stated in his speech on 23/08/1372 [14 November 1993] in the Majles, it is necessary to express appreciation for the round-the-clock activities of the concerned, competent Hezbollah people in the Voice and Vision and explicitly announce that these dear ones are by no means addressed by the Inquiry and Investigation Committee, but the purpose was to show the faces that essentially are in deep and open conflict with the regime, the leadership, and the Islamic revolution and who must be eliminated from the Voice and Vision in order to create the possibility for the growth and thriving of the committed, sincere, and concerned forces who believe in the path of the Imam and the grand leader of the revolution. 10) The broadcast of the next segments of the response of the Voice and Vision through this medium was stopped upon the instruction of the grand leader and this indicates very well his opinion with regard to the behavior of the Voice and Vision. 11) In conclusion, we sincerely thank the various strata of the Hezbollah nation who in various forms have expressed their support for this action by the Majles and have been kind to us and assure our dear nation that your servants in the sacred stronghold of the Majles will continue inquiry and investigation in all cases decisively and with precision and are certain that preserving and strengthening the supervisory dimension of the Majles will have a significant effect on reforming and improving the situation of the executive organizations of the country.
