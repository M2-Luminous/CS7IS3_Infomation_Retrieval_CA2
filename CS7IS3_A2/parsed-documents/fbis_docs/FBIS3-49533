It was attended by Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak, Army Commander Lieutenant General Julius Humaj, and senior members of the Army of the Slovak Republic Officers' Corps. At the outset of the rally, its participants heard a letter addressed by President Michal Kovac to the participants in the rally. The letter states, among other things, that in the security and political spheres, we are oriented unequivocally toward NATO and the West European Union (WEU). We are looking for guarantees to ensure that Slovakia will never again become a toy in the hands of the strong. As Michal Kovac went on to stress, according to ideas communicated by former U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin, participation by the Slovak Republic, along with the other states of the Visegrad Group, in the Partnership for Peace initiative should serve as an intermediary organizational link on the road toward fully fledged NATO membership. This should mean the possibility of achieving a certain type of associate membership of NATO or the WEU. According to Michal Kovac, this would not require full integration of the military components, but should at least contain guarantees that the parties will be consulted whenever the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of either party will be jeopardized, in the opinion of one of them. In another part of his letter, Michal Kovac appreciated the fact that, in defiance of complicated conditions, the division of the former Federal Army has been completed in a relatively short period of time. He assured Army members that he will see to it that all necessary conditions be established for the Army of the Slovak Republic to discharge its duties and for it to be accorded such a degree of social recognition as corresponds to the nature and significance of its work for the benefit of the Slovak Republic.
