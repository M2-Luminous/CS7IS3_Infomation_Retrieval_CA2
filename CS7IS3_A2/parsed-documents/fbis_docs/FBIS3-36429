The following report by Anca Florea details this idea of the president of the Republic of Moldova. [Begin Anca Florea recording] As reported, the congress Our Home, the Republic of Moldova is being held in Chisinau today. It has been organized by the Civic Alliance and the Government of the Republic of Moldova. This congress is being attended by almost 2,000 people from various social segments and, as the deputy Prime Minister Mihai Coscodar specified, guests from Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Greece, Switzerland, and others. The congress was opened by writer Ion Druta, after which the floor was taken by the president of the Republic of Moldova, Mircea Snegur. In a lengthy speech, the president began by responding to those who, as he put it, want to eliminate such notions as Moldova, the Moldovan language: Moldovan, and the Moldovan people from the political vocabulary. President Snegur also referred to the Dniester problem and to relations between the Republic of Moldova and Romania. Here is a passage from President Snegur's speech: He expressed his position, quote: Regarding a problem which, I can assure you, concerns all of us, unquote. And then he continued, quote: I am speaking of relations with our brethren in Romania. The first thing I want to mention is the fact that our blood brothers are living beyond the Prut and we industrious Moldovan people must first develop our relations with them. At the same time, it is my first duty and great honor to tell our blood brothers the following: Brothers, with consideration and respect, esteem and fraternal love, we want to express heartfelt thanks and deep gratitude for the support and assistance you have granted and continue to grant us during these trying times. May the Lord help us to jointly survive in this troubled world. At a time when the danger of wars is hovering above us -- from one or another direction -- we have this fraternal request to jointly step forth with honesty and courage, careful consideration and caution, wisdom and moderation, dignity and mutual respect, which have to be our guides now, when we are building our fraternal relations. The historic recollection of sacrifices and losses does not permit us to miss this opportunity to be free. Let us lend our ear to the wise voice of the people and to their desires, which are never wrong. The Moldovan people no longer want to [words indistinct] and do not want to hear that their country is coveted as a rich land as if it did not have genuine owners, the successors of our ancestors. Our people want good understanding with our brothers as befits nations, unquote. And now I will continue with another passage of President Snegur's speech: Let us preserve our origins, not in a bashful but in a dignified way, by not wasting anything that characterizes us as Moldovan. Our people want us to prosper and flourish as equal nations in this world, unquote. [end recording]
