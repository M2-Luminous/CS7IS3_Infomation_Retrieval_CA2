Castro presided over the final event organized by the FAR General Staff for the EJT's Havana division, which was created nine months ago. After analyzing the work done by the EJT, Gen. Castro praised these forces doing farm work in Havana, describing them as the pride of the country. In a brief statement during the final meeting, he supported a profound restructuring of the Ministry of Agriculture, which he said is the cause of inefficiency in state farms. Bureaucracy, he stressed, destroyed state agriculture. On this matter, he had words of praise for current Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan and added that he is certain Jordan will successfully carry out the task of bringing more products to the market. The EJT is a group within the FAR devoted to work in the agricultural and livestock sector, and since its founding 21 years ago [as heard] has became the most productive of the entire country.
