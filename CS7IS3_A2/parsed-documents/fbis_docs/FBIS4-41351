How would you describe the present condition of the Ukrainian state? [Kravchuk] First, I am able to say today that this state, Ukraine, finally exists. Throughout many centuries it did not exist, and now it is here on the world map, recognized by the world community. It is a fact. It is the result of the great effort of our people, our parliament, our president, our government and all the power structures. [passage indistinct] We have the will of the people, we have the laws reflecting this will, and we have the efforts of the president and other power structures to implement this course. It is difficult indeed. We, and the people, can see that. But we can sincerely say that nobody in the world can hope to cover this road with ease. [passage indistinct] [Correspondent] What in Ukraine's present condition worries you most? And what do you think must be done to improve that condition? [Kravchuk] The hardships are of a both objective and subjective nature. What worries me most is the hardships in the economic system and the economy in general, the decline in living standards. The first thing we must do is stabilize production. The next thing is to do all in our power to give it a boost. This is the basic and all-determining factor, because this is the basis of all our future steps, be it to safeguard social security, or, for example, to raise pay in the Army, which we must do and will do at any cost -- to provide officers with housing and raise their pay -- or to improve the financial status of the vulnerable strata -- pensioners, the disabled, and many other categories of people here who need this kind of improvement to secure them a more or less acceptable lifestyle. This is the main thing. How can it be done? There are ways to do this. There are programs both in the government and in the Supreme Council, and I hope they will be eventually approved; mechanisms will be worked out, and we will find the resources to do it and to move forward. There is also the political situation. We need to overcome the differences in the existing views of our economic and political development. This is a must. We must be united in our need to develop, to overcome the obstacles and to move forward. Regrettably, however, everything is being done to make us fall out [words indistinct] to find differences between the president, the prime minister and the chairman of the Supreme Council. I can see now how the press is attempting to do this. [passage omitted] Today, however, there is another danger, (?you know), in that a (?certain) part of the leftist forces is giving in to (?wicked malice), [words indistinct] in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts, and everything repeats itself (?once again). At the beginning, there were (?just a few people) demanding a Nuerenberg process to try the Communist Party. I had to make the greatest effort to ward this off, excuse me, legal Bacchanalia. We averted it, prevented it, and no heads rolled. Right now, it appears, yet another victimization is being called for, now of (?the other) side. I was simply terrified to listen [words indistinct] to a group present in that hall. You may have (?already) heard [words indistinct] in Donetsk oblast. [Passage indistinct]. So there is (?a danger), a threat -- (?as long as there are those forces) -- there simply is a threat of losing statehood and, most importantly, democracy. [Words indistinct] and (?those methods) have nothing in common with democracy. So I would just like to appeal to the electorate (?and all) to stop that Bacchanalia and restrain the people on either side making an attempt on the sacrosanctity of democracy and statehood, for it is the people themselves who (?in the long run) will be taken hostage of all this. We have already seen this. We already (?know) this. So (?we should avert) this danger. So, there is both some progress, there is the state, state establishments and certain basis of what has already been done, and there are forces [words indistinct] fighting for power can lead to the irreparable. So we at all costs will have to stop extremism (?in all its manifestations) on either side and prevent any, I would like to emphasize, any attempt on democracy and our state, because there is, I would like to repeat, that threat. [Correspondent] [Passage indistinct] [Kravchuk] I agree. There should be stable laws and a well- established constitution corresponding with the changes that have taken place, and a stable [word indistinct]. That is a must. For example, government is a problem for us [words indistinct] changes to parliamentary elections because there are (?some difficulties) in that the laws and the constitution do not agree with each other, a disagreement which makes it possible to initiate constant changes accordingly, that (?affect the stability) of government. I agree with that. That problem, however, is not just a matter of personalities. It once again has to do with the Constitution and the laws, i.e., the basis that was defined and supported by the people and tolerates no such changes. [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, my understanding is that today you will do without electoral promises. [Kravchuk] [Passage indistinct] Second, I will certainly do whatever I can in order to prevent a conflict between Ukraine and other states, for Ukraine never to be the first to take any action aimed at an attempt on human life, war or threat [words indistinct]. Clearly, (?quite another) matter is someone coming and trying, let us say, to suppress us. Any state and any people would protect themselves. That, however, would be protection rather than aggression by us. As for (?an empire), I have already addressed that question and would really like it never to re-emerge. To achieve that, however, we need to (?do everything we are doing), laying the foundation of our peaceful, democratic and well-considered policy, good-neighborliness and partnership for us to move forward. Life goes on. There will be new people coming to power, while that which we are doing today and the foundation we are laying today is to continue. [Passage indistinct]. I believe [words indistinct] our wealth and achievements that we have secured in the time that has passed (?since independence). (?I belive) that Ukraine will resolve any problems [words indistinct].
