FR940405-2-00012 FR940405-2-00007 Analysis of Comments Received We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. The Department received comments and rebuttal comments from both parties. Comment 1: The petitioner notes that Krupp admitted that in 1989 it destroyed all records relevant to the period of review and, therefore, was unable to respond to the Department's questionnaire issued in July 1991. Because of Krupp's actions, the petitioner contends that Krupp has significantly impeded the Department's conduct of this review in that the Department now is unable to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information submitted in Krupp's 1983 and 1984 responses to the Department's earlier questionnaires. Petitioner asserts that destruction of relevant records during an ongoing judicial proceeding where Krupp was aware that the Court might remand the case to the Department for administrative review does not, contrary to Krupp's claim, ``demonstrate [‚ê£] a willingness'' to cooperate. Given the circumstances, petitioner argues that the Department is obligated to use BIA based on an adverse inference. Department's Response: On September 12, 1991, Krupp informed the Department that in 1989 it destroyed all data relevant to the period under review, because German law does not require that records be maintained for more than five years. Because of its actions, Krupp stated that it was unable to respond to our July 1991 questionnaire. In addition, Krupp's destruction of its records prevented the Department from conducting a verification of what few written submissions of factual information remain in the Department's files from Krupp's 1983 and 1984 submissions. In reviews such as this one, involving old data, the Department may conduct a verification. See Television Receivers, Monochrome and Color from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 54 FR 13917 (Apr. 6, 1989). In 1988 we verified information covering the period April 1983 through August 1983 submitted by two companies subject to the Japanese television finding. See, also , Memorandum For the File from Laurie Lucksinger and Jim Arnold, dated May 28, 1987, regarding Large Power Transformers from Italy_Analysis for Preliminary Results of Review for Ansaldo, where we verified data in 1987 covering sales in 1982. While German law may prescribe a minimum required period for the retention of business records, it is irrelevant to the current judicial proceeding. Respondents have a responsibility to maintain documents relevant to ongoing litigation. See Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. v. United States , Slip Op. 92&hyph;72 (CIT May 15, 1992) at 19. As a consequence of its actions, Krupp explicitly acknowledges in its September 12, 1991 letter ``that the Department will be unable to complete the administrative review in the manner contemplated by the Court of International Trade'' in its remand opinion and recognizes that the Department ``will thus be forced to use the best information available'' (BIA) for this administrative review. Therefore, pursuant to 776(c) of the Tariff Act we have continued to use BIA for these final results.
