This is a great honor for me because I am familiar with Perez Balladares' background. I am a close friend of his and worked in close association with him in General Omar Torrijos' time. We were part of Gen. Torrijos' inner circle or advisers. I wish to express my appreciation for this opportunity to serve Panama. I had already retired from business and public life. Nevertheless, I accept this call to serve the homeland with great energy. To serve my country at the Foreign Ministry holds a poignant value for me. My father held the post of foreign minister and struggled hard for the same cause that I championed through the Treaties that were signed in 1977. My father succeeded in having the Panamanian flag flown for the first time at the military bases in our territory. During the independence, my grandfather served the country in the same capacity. So, three generations have served the homeland in a similar way. At this time, I wish to acknowledge publicly President Endara's honest management of the elections. President Endara made good his promise. He will go down in history as a great Panamanian. In addition, I wish to acknowledge the Electoral Tribunal's hard work. The way the vote counting was performed deserved the warmest praises from the foreign observers who witnessed the elections. The Catholic Church and the Justice and Peace Commission created by Archbishop McGrath played a significant role in persuading the Panamanian people that their votes would be carefully counted. More than anything else, these elections demonstrated the Panamanian people's lofty civic spirit. I will cooperate with Dr. Omar Jaen, who has been designated deputy foreign minister. I think I do not have much else to say about him. He is an intellectual of international prestige, a historian who has written Panama's history. Whenever he has had time, he has put it down in books, but he has always had it at hand in his personal computer. Welcome aboard, Omar. I have been talking with Dr. Perez Balladares on priorities. As you know, he has set as his administration's priority to improve the Panamanian people's standard of living. To do this, it is necessary, first of all, to create jobs. The Foreign Relations Ministry will be radically changed under the government of Ernesto Perez Balladares; that is, the Foreign Ministry will become a productive institution. Incorporating Panama into NAFTA is a similar priority we will pursue. This incorporation will let our products gain access to great markets in Mexico, the United States, Canada, and any other country that might join NAFTA. It is important for Panama to establish friendly and praiseworthy relations with the United States, relations that will allow us to obtain benefits and to gain respect. With the reorganization of the Panamanian diplomatic corps, we will turn our embassies and consulates into agencies to promote investment and tourism as well as seek markets. Ambassadors around the world will have to obtain scholarships so our young people can be improved intellectually. I think it is a priority for the Panamanian people to raise their self-esteem. We must recover our international prestige, just as we did in Gen. Torrijos' time. Under the new national and international circumstances, it is mandatory for Panama to again be included among the respected and worthy nations of the world. It is important to improve our political and economic relations with all the nations of the continent and the world. We will attach special importance to improving our relations with Mexico and Peru. These relations have been a little on the downside. We will maintain excellent relations with our neighbors Colombia and Costa Rica. President [title as heard] Perez Balladares has been invited by President Gaviria and President Figueres to pay a quick visit to those countries and familiarize himself with problems of common interest. In addition, Perez Balladares has been invited by the governor of Puerto Rico, a very close friend of his. It is important to stimulate our commercial relations with the EU, the Pacific Basin countries, and very particularly with Japan. All of those things lead us to plan the creation of a ministry of promotion. All of us Panamanians are proud when we travel abroad. We should strive so the name of Panama can be pronounced with respect. In particular, we will support President Cesar Gaviria in the reorganization of the OAS. It is important to stimulate better relations with the countries that use the Panama Canal. It is also important to inform them that the Panamanians will be capable of managing the waterway, which will soon revert to us. We should have some type of relations with the Eastern European nations that were recently liberated from the Soviet yoke. This will be done in due time, but it is also part of the list of priorities drafted in the few days that Perez Balladares and I have been working together. As I said before, it is important to recover our international prestige. This can be done only by visiting those countries and letting industry, banking, and government leaders see the human quality of the team formed by Perez Balladares. It goes without saying that the persons he has in mind to appoint to positions in his cabinet are much more capable than myself. I am proud to be able to work with the people Perez Balladares has in mind for his government. I hope they will accept when the proposal is made to them. All of us must lend a shoulder to advance the homeland. I will tell you something. I do not intend to stand with my arms crossed. I have worked hard to build my business interests through sacrifice and hard work. I have already spoken with Panamanian Ambassador to Italy Rodolfo Aleman to advise him that I will visit there during the month of June and expect to meet with all the Panamanian consuls in that country. At that meeting I plan to make them aware of what exactly we are seeking: investment promotion, Panamanian goods promotion, [word indistinct], and prestige for our country. Whoever is willing to keep up with this can be certain of my support, otherwise we will have to seek a replacement. To me, it is important for all government officials to feel secure. I plan to respect the stability of all Foreign Ministry officials. It is important for us to create a climate comfortable to work in if we expect to increase efficiency. If an employee does not feel secure in his or her position, then efficiency and productivity falls. These are some of the guidelines I have been able to formulate so far. I would like to ask for your cooperation. We must all work hard. If we all work together, then I believe we will have a Panama we will all be proud of. [Reporter] You mentioned changes within the Foreign Relations Ministry. Specifically, what type of transformations were you referring to? [Lewis Galindo] We plan to transform the Ministry into an agency of promotion. Costa Rican President [Jose] Figueres appointed a commission to carry out a study related to restructuring his country's Foreign Relations Ministry. Everything I have heard so far about that study has been positive. Costa Rica has surpassed us with regard to promoting the country's business, tourism, in everything. So, I believe it would be worthwhile to take a look at what they did. At this time I would not dare tell you what our transformation is going to be like. But one thing is for sure, we are going to have a transformation. We plan to transform the Ministry into an agency of promotion, in addition to maintaining cordial relations.... [pauses] I just cannot imagine an ambassador in Paris simply scratching his belly all year around. That man must produce, regardless of whether it is scholarships, investments in Panama, or promoting our products. How is it possible that while Japan and Korea sell us thousands of dollars worth of cars, and we have embassies over there, yet we are still trying to determine what to do with a product such as bananas because the European countries are setting up barriers? All of this is give and take. However, if the ambassadors simply sit around with their arms crossed and merely send.... [pauses] We will never accomplish anything if the ambassadors are persons who do not produce regardless of what positions they occupy, and we tend to reward them with an embassy, as we have done in the past, or simply because they are related to someone or some legislator. This is not going to be the case. Panama will be represented by its most capable officials. I cannot fathom a foreign relations ministry under my direction in which I will be receiving calls from a country's foreign ministry requesting the withdrawal of a certain ambassador because he has spent his time illegally importing cars. That simply cannot be. We must be proud anytime we travel overseas. [Reporter] What can you say about Panama's integration to the Central American Parliament [Parlacen]? [Lewis Galindo] I would rather have the minister of planning and economic policy answer that question at a later date. I personally believe that we have nothing to do with market integration in Central America. We can have cultural integration, but our business realm and wage scale do not match those of Central America. That is why I feel that what is more interesting for us is to think big -- let us associate ourselves with the three powerful northern countries. This does not mean we should hurt our relations with Central American countries; on the contrary. We have very basic economic differences. This is my personal opinion, and this topic is not my business, it is up to the planning minister. I am only giving my opinion as a businessman. [Reporter] Could it not prove politically beneficial? [Lewis Galindo] Politically? [Reporter] To have the Legislative Assembly integrate Parlacen. [Lewis Galindo] The Legislative Assembly.... [pauses] Well, the political side, fine. My disagreement is with economic integration. [Reporter] The general commentary is that your return to public life, especially to the Foreign Ministry, is basically due to the transfer of the Panama Canal. There is word that due to your success with the treaty negotiations and your close relations with former President Jimmy Carter, and all the team that works with President Clinton, there is a possibility of negotiating a new base treaty. [Lewis Galindo] President Carter is very respectful of Panama. He does not hold any official post in the U.S. Government. He has not spoken to me or anyone else about U.S. bases. This is a problem that I am sure we will discuss with the Americans in due course. But you can be sure that as long as I am foreign minister anything we do will take into account Panama's best interests and always with respect. As long as I am there and Dr. Perez Balladares is in the presidency, we will work and struggle for the recovery of our sovereignty. We will not give it away to anyone, but this does not mean that, if the study of the presence of U.S. military bases is required, I will oppose it. These then become not nationalistic issues, but cheap nationalistic issues. Countries such as Spain, Italy -- powers with plenty of tradition -- have foreign bases there. Tell me where does the United States not have bases? We belong to the group of countries that make up the Western world; these barriers no longer exist. Perhaps one could argue whether the presence of U.S. bases is justified; up to now they have not done anything. I for one do not believe that we should make the first move and say: stay here, stay here. If the United States seriously needs the bases and is willing to talk to us, Dr. Perez Balladares has already said on several occasions he is willing to sit down and talk about the issue. [Reporter] How do you feel about Cuba returning to the OAS? [Lewis Galindo] Cuba is a very complex issue. Dr. Perez Balladares has issued statements in this regard, so I would not dare comment on this topic right now because it is a controversial topic. I would prefer to discuss this further along the line. This is a topic.... [pauses] We must wait for Dr. Perez Balladares to take office and then he can decide. For the time being I cannot say anything further on this because I am unaware of his opinion. [Reporter] When will the elected president meet with Presidents Gaviria and Figueres? [Lewis Galindo] In the next 15 days. In fact, we are about to send emissaries to coordinate the details of the visits. We will send them to both countries. [Reporter] Mr. Lewis Galindo, going back to NAFTA. Could a renegotiation of the military bases give Panama an opportunity to reach Mexico's level regarding the renegotiation of the Treaties? [Lewis Galindo] Well, that is part of a negotiation. We will open the negotiations. When one negotiates, ones does so with the cards on the table. They have their cards, we have ours. Let us see what they propose. We will open the negotiations and then see. But first we must get the three countries to negotiate with us. For this reason, it is very important to resume very friendly relations with Mexico and create a better climate between Canada and Panama. We must increase the degree of our relations with Panama if Canada and Panama are to be economic partners. First of all, however, we have to win over three countries before entering NAFTA. [Reporter] Several Panamanians are in exile. At the Attorney General's Office several cases are pending. The extraditions of several individuals have been requested from several countries. Such requests have not been processed. Do you intend to follow up these cases? [Lewis Galindo] Well, I do not know what it is all about. First of all, I must familiarize myself with these things. The government of President Perez Balladares is persecuting no one, however. I suppose that the legal procedures against people who have cases pending with the administration of justice by reasons of their offenses or crimes will have to continue. Nevertheless, this does not fall under my authority but rather that of the administration of justice. [Reporter] Regarding the EU and the division of the countries [words indistinct]? [Lewis Galindo] I think Spain owes us an opinion poll. We should talk with President Gonzalez and ask him to admit that the existing ties between the United Kingdom and its colonies and between Spain and its former colonies, such as the Central American countries, should be similar. The fact that we obtained our independence in the 19th century and that Jamaica and the other English colonies obtained theirs in the 20th century does not justify Spain neglecting its relations with us. We must have a powerful sponsor, such as Spain. We will eventually talk with our friend President Gonzalez and the Spanish authorities. I am sure that in this way we can strike some kind of arrangement favorable to Panama. [Reporter] What can be done to have the U.S. Senate ratify the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty? [Lewis Galindo] We must trust the Panamanian officials. U.S. senators do not trust Panamanian officials because we have given proof of scant seriousness and, in this case, they say: Since this is a two-way thing, we can give Panama certain information and it may end in the drug traffickers' hands. However, that can change and I think that with the attention that Perez Balladares will give all those problems we will recover the trust in Panama -- not only with the United States but also with the rest of the world. You tune in a radio or television station in Paris speaking about Panama and the stations say Panama has just held elections and the country is one of the largest drug trafficking centers. This was told to me by a French banker who indignantly phoned me this morning. This government has done a number of good things but has overlooked reporting them. Consequently, Panama's prestige has dropped down low. As I said before, we must restore Panama's name to the level it had during Torrijos' time. [Reporter] Do you belong to any one political party? [Lewis Galindo] I do not actively participate in any one political party. Nevertheless, I joined and voted for the Solidarity Movement out of solidarity with my brother. He is the politician. I am a businessman and a retired one at that. I have been taken out of retirement to be put to work again. I wish to say something else. The door to the Foreign Ministry, headed by myself and Jaen, will remain open. Sometimes I am too frank and stick my foot in certain things. So help me not to because I am not too much of a diplomat.
