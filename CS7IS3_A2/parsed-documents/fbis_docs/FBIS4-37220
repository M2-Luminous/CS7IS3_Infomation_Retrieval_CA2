FBIS4-37220 "drnes118dd_94017" FBIS-NES-94-118 Daily Report 19 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Loyalist on Future Policy, Ties With Authority Hamas Loyalist on Future Policy, Ties With Authority NC1906142694 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1217 GMT 19 Jun 94 NC1906142694 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Gaza, 19 Jun (MENA) -- Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, professor at Gaza's Islamic University and a Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] sympathizer, has explained the rules that will govern the movement's actions in the coming stage, that is when the National Palestinian Authority assumes power in Gaza and Jericho. Al-Zahhar, a leader of the former Palestinian deportees in Marj al-Zuhur in south Lebanon, said that the rules pertain first to Hamas' relationship with the Palestinian Authority and secondly with the Israeli occupation the status of which, as he put it, "has not changed." In remarks to MENA's correspondent in Gaza, al-Zahhar said relations with the new Palestinian Authority are governed by several rules. First of all, there will be no infighting, but Hamas opposes curtailing the privileges of any Palestinian faction, especially those who made the intifadah bear fruit through their efforts, blood, and years in jail or exile. Al-Zahhar continued: "We are not seeking power. I do not expect Hamas to vie for power because if it had really wanted power, it would have joined the plan from the beginning and acquired a respectable number of posts." Asked whether Hamas will participate in the coming Palestinian elections, Dr. al-Zahhar said: "We will not participate in the Autonomy Authority at all. As we have always done, our participation will be through student councils, local councils, and professional associations. This will be our natural service to the Palestinian citizens." Al-Zahhar concluded his remarks by declaring that Hamas will not lay down its arms until all Palestinian soil [kamil al-turab al-filastini] is liberated from the occupation and, as he put it, from the occupation's supporters.
