The efforts of Russian diplomacy are directed at this. We are in contact with all the sides. The heat of passion should be lowered. Russia is firmly pursuing the line of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, including on the Korean peninsula. Replying to a question regarding the possibility of economic sanctions by the international community against the DPRK, which is suspected of developing nuclear weaponry, the Russian diplomat noted that the problem of sanctions did not yet stand on a practical plane. Sanctions are an extreme measure after all political possibilities have been exhausted, he stressed in conclusion. [passage omitted]
