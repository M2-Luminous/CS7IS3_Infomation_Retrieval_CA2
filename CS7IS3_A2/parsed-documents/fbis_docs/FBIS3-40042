The meeting was part of the second phase of the proximity talks on the confidence-building measures, which began today. Speaking afterward, Feissel repeated that the reports of the UN experts on the confidence-building measures are not part of the measures package. The situation, he added, is very clear. He said the negotiations only concern the confidence-building measures package and that anything beyond this is material that each uses according to his will. Asked if he thinks the situation is clear in [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas' mind, Feissel said: Absolutely. Feissel also said that the goal of the current phase of the proximity talks is to move swiftly to common positions on various points that are included in the confidence-building measures package. He also noted that he does not think he need state his evaluation after each meeting. Feissel refrained from making any reference to the substance of the talks and added that there should be more meetings before we make an evaluation. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the United Nations asked the two sides not to comment at this stage. He said the United Nations believes that this will make the negotiations easier.
