FR941220-2-00075 FR941220-2-00045 [Docket No. 94&hyph;80; Notice 2] Ford Motor Company; Decision of Inconsequential Noncompliance Ford Motor Company (Ford) of Dearborn, Michigan decided that some of its windows failed to comply with the labeling requirements of 49 CFR 571.205, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 205, ``Glazing Materials,'' and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Ford also applied to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. Notice of receipt of the application was published on October 3, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 50329). This notice exempts Ford from the notification and remedy requirements of the statute. Standard No. 205, which incorporates, by reference, the American National Standards Institute's ``Safety Code for Safety Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor Vehicles Operating on Land Highways'' Z&hyph;26.1&hyph;1977, January 26, 1977, as supplemented by Z26.1a, July 3, 1980 (ANS Z26.1), specifies that typical automotive tempered glass with a luminous transmittance of less than 70 percent shall be labeled ``AS3.'' Ford manufactured approximately 1,820,000 quarter windows with a luminous transmittance of less than 70 percent for use in 1986 through 1994 model year Ranger Supercab and Mazda B-series Cab Plus vehicles. These windows were labeled ``AS2'' instead of ``AS3.'' Approximately 7,900 were located and scrapped. The remaining windows were used in vehicle production or provided to aftermarket distributors for service replacement. Ford supported its application for inconsequential noncompliance with the following: [Ford believes that t]he incorrect marking presents no risk of accident or injury. The windows can be installed only as rear quarter windows in Ranger Supercab trucks; AS2 and AS3 glazing are both appropriate for these applications in accordance with Standard 205. In Ford's judgement, the mismarking is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. The stated purposes of FMVSS No. 205 are to reduce injuries resulting from impact to glazing surfaces, to ensure a necessary degree of transparency in motor vehicle windows for driver visibility, and to minimize the possibility of occupants being thrown through vehicle windows in collisions. As previously noted the affected quarter windows fully comply with the performance requirements of FMVSS No. 205. Because all performance requirements are met, the incorrect marking of the quarter windows has no effect upon the ability of the glazing to perform in the manner intended by the standard. Ford is not aware of any complaints, accidents, or injuries related to this condition. The mismarking should not cause confusion in glass replacement in vehicles in service. Aftermarket distributors do not use the marking to determine which glazing is used for replacement. Rather, replacement parts are determined by service part numbers which are obtained from cataloged listings. Further, we are not aware of any confusion in aftermarket servicing of vehicles as a result of this mismarking. No comments were received on the petition. NHTSA has considered these arguments and has found them persuasive. Because FMVSS No. 205 permits either AS2 or AS3 glazing to be used in the rear quarter location, the use of mislabeled glazing in those areas will have no safety impact. The fact that the windows can be used only in that location and not in other locations where use of AS3 glazing would be inappropriate confirms this conclusion. Accordingly, for the reasons expressed above, the applicant has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety, and Ford Motor Company is hereby exempted from providing notification and remedy with respect thereto.
