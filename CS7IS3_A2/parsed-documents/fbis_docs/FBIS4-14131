The Hamas official said the agreement was signed to resolve some of the differences on outstanding issues between the military wings of the two movements and to lay the foundations of dialogue to resolve possible future problems and prevent a resort to arms and starting an internecine Palestinian fighting. Abu-Muhammad Mustafa pointed out that this is not the first time that such an agreement has been signed between the Fatah hawks and the al-Qassam battalions, adding that the political stands and the basic differences on the Oslo-Cairo agreement and the stands on the occupation and the Palestinian cause are still the same between Hamas and Fatah. As for the reported joint seminar between Hamas and Fatah, which was held at the Islamic University in Gaza recently, Mustafa said that the seminar was just an open debate among students and that differences between the two debating sides continued unabated. He added: This has nothing to do with allegations that Hamas has begun to retreat from its principled stands.
