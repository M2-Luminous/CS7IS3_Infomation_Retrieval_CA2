All this is increasing pressure on the personnel of internal affairs agencies".

"We hope that the necessary decisions will be taken in the very near future, with the help of people's deputies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea, to stabilize the situation in Crimea." The minister's appeal makes the following requests: "To convey to members of staff our certainty that the bodies of internal affairs in Crimea will further remain within the single structure of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine; "To remain calm, confident, and loyal to their oath, to prevent the illegal use of arms, to treat citizens with respect, to strictly abide by laws when detaining citizens and making them answerable, and to prevent violations of the administrative legislation; "To step up the struggle against crime and its most organized forms, to restore order in the streets and in public places, and in so doing to pay special attention to instructing special duty squads at a high professional level; "To establish efficient interaction with the Main Directorate of the Security Service of Ukraine in Crimea, the procurator's office, the subunits of the National Guard and military units, and with other departments with the aim of improving adherence to law and order and legality in Crimea. "Today peace and accord and citizens' security in Crimea are in your hands. Do not let yourselves get involved in political games."
