Please tell us if such a thing happened or not. [Nateq-Nuri] No, I have no news of any high-level contacts between Iran and the United States. Essentially the eminent leader has closed the door to contacts, negotiations, or relations with the Americans and he has graciously said that that path is a dead end. No one can do anything without his permission and that has not taken place. [passage omitted] [Unidentified KEYHAN correspondent] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. Mr. Nateq-Nuri, King Fahd has called for the handover of the Iranian islands to the United Arab Emirates [UAE] in a message on the occasion of the 'Id al-Adha. Although our country's authorities have expressly stated their view on the issue on numerous occasions we would like to know your views on this and King Fahd's new statements. [passage omitted] [Nateq-Nuri] This is the issue: Regarding the islands -- the three islands of Abu Musa, the Greater and the Lesser Tonbs -- there is no problem at all regarding the Greater and Lesser Tonb Islands. Recently, when the Abu Musa issue was raised, our neighbors prefer to raise the issue of the three islands together now. We wonder what incident in recent years has caused our neighbors to think of that issue. We have an agreement from 1971 which was accepted by the ruler of al-Shariqah at that time on al-Shariqah television and confirmed by him. The agreement, I should say was about Abu Musa. The issue mainly concerned Abu Musa. Now they say one issue is not enough and they have added the other two to it as well, otherwise it would not amount to much. We have an agreement according to which Iran is there as well as al-Shariqah. There are some Arabs from al-Shariqah living there. We have acted according to that agreement up to now and we are still acting on it. Nothing new has happened. We have always said that an incident did occur. We saw a spy near there and apprehended him -- in the past two or three years -- then we enhanced the security factor there. Someone comes from the other end of the world in a boat, having put ammunition in hidden compartments in the boat, and begins sailing around Abu Musa, and when he is apprehended he says he came here to fish. Now what thinking person would accept that someone should come fishing with ammunition in the boat? Well, we enhanced the security factor and as soon as we did that our neighbors' sensitivity was increased and they raised the issues of Abu Musa, the Greater and Lesser Tonbs. We have told them up to now, and truly believe, that the issue must be between us and the UAE. There is no problem. We have been and still are ready for negotiation. We sent delegations there. They should have come but they didn't. I did tell the Kuwaiti brothers who came here, the Qatari brothers who came here, that your problem is that when an issue arises in the region you fail to research it before making a decision on it. Because of the mere fact that one side is Arab and the other non-Arab, you convene the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council and your Arab prejudice blossoms. [passage omitted] [ASAI correspondent, in English, followed by Persian translation] Mr. Speaker, I am a Japanese news correspondent. I have one question: relationship between Iran and Egypt. Foreign Minister Velayati will go soon to Cairo for NAM [Nonaligned Movement] meeting. Dr. Velayati will meet with Egyptian counterpart in that time for talking resuming two countries' relationship. Can we expect two countries will make good relationship in near future? [Nateq-Nuri] We pay much attention to the NAM and regard it as valuable. Because we consider the NAM important we consider our presence there to be useful and effective. We consider the strengthening of the NAM to be a principle. The more it becomes strengthened the more its members will benefit. Therefore we believe participation in the session -- even though it is in Egypt -- to be appropriate, as you have pointed out. There is nothing to prevent the honorable foreign minister from seeking to talk with his counterparts or others on the sidelines of the gathering. But as to what the results of those discussions will be, perforce we must wait until he goes there and has those talks on the sidelines. He will then bring back his report to Iran so that we can see what we must do on the basis of that. [Unidentified foreign correspondent] [passage omitted] There has been much talk about Iran's foreign debts in recent months. It has been a very hot topic. I would like to ask the president...[pauses] the Majles speaker about his views on this issue. In other words, what are the prospects for this matter, this debt? [Nateq-Nuri] [passage omitted] The debt poses no particular problem for a country that has so many Godgiven resources, natural capital, power, and equipment. [passage omitted] Let me add a sentence that I personally believe that of course, regarding those very debts, if the state economic authorities had acted more meticulously and gracefully we would have had fewer problems. That point must be worth considering. [Moderator] After a visit by a group of U.S. journalists and editors to Iran a hue and cry was begun about it in some of the press and that is when the group had meetings with Iranian authorities, including yourself. Taking into consideration the fact that on the whole the American people have no animosity toward us and -- reciprocally -- we have no animosity toward them, do you agree with the stances that were taken by the press? [Nateq-Nuri] Everyone is responsible for his own actions, after all. A paper assumes a particular stance because its analysis and understanding of an issue is such. I also have read those stances in those papers. It was unclear to them who they were, what objectives they were pursuing, where they had come from, and who had invited them to Iran -- since that is not clear to us. Apparently the papers had agreed on a meeting with them somewhere and -- perhaps because of the same problems -- they later cancelled the meeting. Since it was clear to me -- and I was in contact with Mr. Kharrazi, our permanent envoy to the United Nations -- it was coordinated and what they were coming for was specified. They had been invited. Mr. Kharrazi pursued the affair. Consequently I had a session -- or, properly, an interview -- with them just like the one that I am having with you. They posed questions. I also believe that when correspondents come -- wherever they come from -- we will not lose anything. I myself told them how good it was that they had come because the U.S. Administration tells many lies about us. You should come here to see the issues, to hear them and then go back and tell the truth about things to the American people. If you are man enough, tell the truth. But do come. We have things to say, and we do not have any apprehensions either about their coming here to see Iran at close range. We have done many things that can be presented. As you noted, we really have no quarrel with the people of the United States. We believe their governments to be hegemonist and believe that they are being unkind even to the people of the United States themselves. I told the U.S. journalists that we have a friendly complaint against the people of the United States for allowing such governments to rule over them. [passage omitted]
