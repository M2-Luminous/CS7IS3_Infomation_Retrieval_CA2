The plan is based on an aid of 5 millions German marks from the German Government to the Royal Government of Cambodia to develop telecommunications in rural areas. The plan is for a wireless telecommunications network linking the provincial seat and a number of districts. The modern network will be set up in densely populated townships for use by the public for an appropriate fee. If everything proceeds according to plans, this network can be expanded by early 1995 to Mongkolborei District in Banteay Meanchey Province. The minister also said that this plan will be implemented by the end of this year at the latest. Studies by German technicians and those from the ministry were completed a few months ago.
