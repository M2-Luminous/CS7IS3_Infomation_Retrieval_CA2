In Canada on a tour of North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) members, Han said he expects North Korea to come forward with a positive response soon. "Chances are high that North Korea will reopen contact with the United States this week in New York and reveal its position," said Han. Han's optimism follows a statement last Saturday by the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman claiming Washington has told Pyongyang it wants to solve the nuclear problem through dialogue and that North Korea also wants such a solution. He called the statement "a meaningful change" on North Korea's part and predicted a meeting with the United States before the IAEA negotiations. South Korean sources explained that North Korea and the United States have had opportunities to exchange views, although not in official surroundings like the New York contact. [passage omitted] U.S. congressmen and the press have been pressing the administration to take punitive action against North Korea for refusing to submit to IAEA inspections. Han, however, emphasized a diplomatic solution in his talks with U.S. officials last week. Washington had left the inspection issue to be solved by North Korea and the IAEA, refusing to negotiate on behalf of the Agency or to meddle in details. But the United States decided to reopen contact with North Korea this week at South Korea's urging for another try at a diplomatic solution, according to the sources. [passage omitted]
