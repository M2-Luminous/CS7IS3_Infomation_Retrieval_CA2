Could you please tell us the objective of the delegation's visit? [Nguyen Khanh] The objective of the government delegation's recent visit to the Syrian Arab Republic, the Arab Republic of Egypt, and the Republic of Tunisia was to consolidate the longstanding friendship and cooperation between our country and these countries. It was also to thank our friends for their past warm support for our people's struggle for national independence and unification and in our current cause of national construction. The visit was also aimed at obtaining more practical results from the economic and cultural cooperation between our country and those friendly nations than in previous years when conditions were not as ripe. We also called on the Palestinian state leaders at the Palestine Liberation Organization's headquarters in Tunis. We reiterated our people's unswerving support for the Arab and Palestinian peoples' just struggle for their basic national rights. [Correspondent] Dear Comrade, what were the results of the government delegation's visit? [Nguyen Khanh] The government delegation's visit to these three countries brought about very fine results. The leaders of the host countries gave us a very warm and solemn reception. The presidents, prime ministers, and general secretaries of the ruling parties of the host countries received our delegation. They all maintained that the Vietnamese Government delegation's official visit was a new indication of the solidarity and friendship between Vietnam and their countries. They all expressed the desire to broaden economic and cultural cooperation with Vietnam soon to coincide with Vietnam's good political relations with Syria, Egypt, and Tunisia. During the visit, our government delegation signed trade agreements with the governments of Syria, Egypt, and Tunisia, thus creating more favorable conditions for promoting trade ties between Vietnam and the host countries. As we see it, there are very bright prospects for our country and the host countries to exchange goods and enter into joint ventures to manufacture products in which one country has an advantage. There are also very bright prospects for our country and the host countries to cooperate in culture, information, tourism, cadre training, archaeology, and scientific and technological research. Each of the host countries has famous historical relics from ancient civilizations in addition to such world wonders as the pyramids of ancient Egypt and the ancient city of Balmyra in Syria. We reached agreement with our friends on exchanging visits between business, cultural, artistic, and scientific research delegations in the future. Thus, our visit consolidated our friendship and cooperation with these traditionally friendly countries and contributed to promoting mutual understanding as well as economic, trade, cultural, and scientific cooperation. [Correspondent] Based on your contacts with the leaders of the host countries, could you please tell us about their impressions of our country and people? [Nguyen Khanh] I think that the Syrian, Egyptian, and Tunisian state leaders nurture profound feelings and show great respect and love for Vietnam and its people. When they were university students, the prime ministers and other state officials of Syria and Egypt actively participated in the struggle against the wars of aggression in Vietnam. They praised Vietnam for its achievements and spoke highly of the Dien Bien Phu victory. In their words, the Vietnamese people deserve the respect and admiration of the whole world because we struggled and made sacrifices not only for Vietnam, but for all oppressed peoples. I also think the state leaders, government officials, and people of the host countries highly value the achievements made in Vietnam's renovation process. They are all hopeful that Vietnam can make quick progress in every field and become an economically and culturally developed country within Southeast Asia. [Correspondent] Thank you comrade.
