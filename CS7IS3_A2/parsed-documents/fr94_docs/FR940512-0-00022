ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action approves the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the state of Kansas for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (SBAP). The revision was submitted by the state to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in section 507 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with the CAA. DATES: This final rule will be effective July 11, 1994 unless notice is received by June 13, 1994 that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the: Environmental Protection Agency, Air Branch, 726 Minnesota Avenue, Kansas City, Kansas 66101; and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE), Bureau of Air and Radiation, Forbes Field, Building 283, Topeka, Kansas 66620&hyph;0001. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Wayne A. Kaiser at (913) 551&hyph;7603. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Implementation of the provisions of the CAA, as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (SBAP), and submit this program as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs EPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing an SBAP are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments , in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions, and as a tool to provide further guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. The state of Kansas has submitted an SIP revision to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the following program elements: (1) The establishment of an SBAP to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. II. Analysis 1. Small Business Assistance Program Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements (a seventh requirement, establishment of an Ombudsman office, is discussed in the next section) that the state must meet to have an approvable SBAP. Specifically, these elements are: (1) Developing, collecting, and coordinating information exchange on compliance methods and control technologies; (2) providing assistance to small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and detection; (3) providing assistance for determining applicable requirements under the Act and permit issuance; (4) determining adequate mechanisms for notifying small business stationary sources of their right under the Act on a timely basis; (5) determining adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their obligations under the Act, including a program for referring sources to qualified auditors, or for the state to provide for such audits to determine compliance with this Act; and (6) procedures for considering requests from small business stationary sources for modifications of work practices, or technological methods of compliance or compliance procedures. The SBAP services will be provided by a consortium of three state universities: the University of Kansas' Center for Environmental Education and Training within the Division of Continuing Education; Kansas State University's Industrial Extension Service, a program of the College of Engineering and the Cooperative Extension Service; and Wichita State University's Center for Technology Application. The SBAP will provide information and/or compliance and technical assistance relevant to each of the six elements above. Additional information concerning individual responsibilities of the consortium members is contained in the technical support document, which is part of the docket for this rulemaking and which is available from the EPA office listed above. The SBAP has been operational since October 1, 1993. The SBAP consortium's contract with KDHE will be renewed yearly. 2. Ombudsman Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a state office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary sources. The Ombudsman position has been designated in the Office of Science and Support of the KDHE. This position was filled on November 18, 1993. The Ombudsman will have direct access to the Secretary (program manager) of the KDHE, to the director of the Division of the Environment of the KDHE, the manager of the air pollution control program, and other state agencies as necessary to perform the functions of its office independently of the air pollution regulatory and enforcement programs. 3. Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) Section 507(e) requires the state to establish a CAP that must include two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the state legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The state has met this requirement. All members of the CAP have been appointed in accordance with the provisions of section 507(e). The CAP held its initial meeting on December 9, 1993. In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP, the CAA delineates four responsibilities of the Panel: (1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered, and the degree and severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act; (3) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and (4) to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. The state has met these requirements by committing the CAP to perform these functions. Legislative authority for the SBAP, CAP, and ombudsman was obtained during the 1993 legislative session and is contained in the Kansas Air Quality Act, Section 15. All three programs are funded by air emissions fees, authority for which is contained in section 8 of the Kansas Air Quality Act. 4. Two Additional Provisions Which the State Submittal Must Address Include Source Eligibility and Fee Reduction Authority Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that: (a) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals, (b) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; (c) Is not a major stationary source; (d) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and (e) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. Section 507(c) allows states, after notice and opportunity for public comment, to extend the definition of eligible source to include small business stationary sources which do not meet the criteria of subparagraphs (3), (4), or (5) of section 507(c), but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants. The state submittal specifies that upon petition by a source, the Secretary, after notice and opportunity for public comment, may include as a small business stationary source, any source which does not meet the criteria of subparagraphs (3), (4), or (5) of section 507(c), but which does not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants. This conforms to the requirements of section 507(c) and is acceptable. Also, the state submittal provides that the Secretary may exclude from the small business stationary source definition any category or subcategory of sources that the Administrator of EPA determines to have sufficient technical and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the Act without the application of this program, as provided by section 507 (c)(3)(A) of the Act. The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of EPA and the Small Business Administration, and after providing notice and opportunity for public hearing, may exclude from the small business stationary source definition under this section, any category or subcategory of sources that the Secretary determines to have sufficient technical and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the Act without the application of this subsection. Section 507(b) allows states flexibility to reduce permit fees to take into account the financial resources of small business. Under state statute, the Secretary may reduce any fee required by the Act for any classification of small business source to take into account the financial resources of such classification. Summary The state has submitted an SIP revision implementing or committing to implement each of the required SBAP elements required by section 507 of the CAA. The KDHE has contracted with a consortium of state universities to implement the small business stationary source technical and environmental compliance assistance program. The Ombudsman position has been established within the KDHE and the position has been filled. The CAP has been appointed and has met. The state submittal meets in full the requirements of section 507 of the Act. EPA Action EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the state of Kansas. The state has submitted an SIP revision implementing each of the required program elements required by section 507 of the Act. EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective July 11, 1994 unless, by June 13, 1994, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective July 11, 1994. This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal/state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds ( Union Electric Co. vs. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 255&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976): 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)). Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 11, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).) Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
