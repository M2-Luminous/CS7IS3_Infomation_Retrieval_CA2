Herman made the comment at his usual Tuesday [7 June] press briefing in answer to a question on how Hungary received the fiasco of the so-called "sign bill" in Bratislava's parliament. The bill would have made it possible to use road and village signs in the Hungarian language. Herman stressed that Budapest is highly appreciative of the fact that Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik indicated his government's intention to re-submit the bill on the use of Hungarian signs to Parliament as soon as this becomes possible under the Slovak constitutional framework. Herman also said the text of the Hungarian-Slovak deportation agreement has, in effect, been completed, and now only requires an agreement on the date for signing it.
