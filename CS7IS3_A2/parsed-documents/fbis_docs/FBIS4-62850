It was organized by the Russian-American Human Rights Bureau. This was stated at a briefing in Moscow on Tuesday by official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Grigoriy Karasin. He noted the fact that one of the detained Uzbek activists was arrested on Kazakh territory. At the same time in Tashkent Uzbek interior bodies arrested one of the leaders of the human rights society and the chairman of the Association of Free Women also invited to the conference. "There is an impression that measures were taken to prevent Uzbek human rights activists from attending the conference. Russia proceeds from the fact that activities of human rights organizations are a necessary condition for the functioning of any democratic society. Russia will strictly adhere to this principle in relations with all states, including the CIS," Karasin said. In his opinion, if information about the arrest of the human rights activists is true, it is necessary to clarify to what extent actions of the Uzbek authorities comply with the Charter and the Declaration on Human Rights of the CIS, as well as corresponding documents of the UN and CSCE.
