This information was disclosed at a news conference by Foreign Minister Arturo Fajardo Maldonado, who said the offensive in question will be conducted by representatives from the Foreign Ministry, the Presidential Commission for the Coordination of Human Rights Affairs (Copredeh), and the Guatemalan Government's Peace Commission. Fajardo added that the plan has already been distributed to six specific groups and that in his own case he will be abroad for a week, during which he will visit the United States, Canada, and certain South American countries. The foreign minister explained that resources for the trips will be taken from the regular budgets of the concerned government institutions, although he added that diplomacy requires some investment to fulfill its duties. Fajardo Maldonado also announced that President De Leon Carpio will visit Mexico in January to meet with his counterpart, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, although this trip is not connected to the recent armed events on the border between the two countries. Similar circumstances surround the president's trip to Costa Rica, although this trip may be postponed until February, given that elections will be held in that country soon. Fajardo also confirmed his own and President De Leon's attendance at the inauguration of Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina, to which both have been invited; the inauguration has been scheduled for 27 January. The foreign minister also used the occasion to refute statements by Government Spokesman Felix Loarca Guzman to the effect that Guatemala has not yet decided to support any of the candidates to the OAS general secretaryship. Alleging a slip of the tongue by Loarca, the top diplomat said that Guatemala's position is clearly that it supports the candidacy of Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, which is established in a pledge made from the time of the San Salvador summit in 1991 and at subsequent summits, including the last one, which was held in Guatemala. Fajardo said that the president has full confidence in him and that he will continue in his post, due to which he has already called for specific foreign policy jobs, although he explained that he has not directly discussed this issue with de Leon Carpio. To conclude, Fajardo said that it is up to the government to grant approval to Belizean Ambassador Atly Morales, because diplomatic approvals are to be included in a general policy that will be established with the participation of all the social sectors.
