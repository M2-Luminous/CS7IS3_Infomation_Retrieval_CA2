Speaking at the sitting of the forum Towards New Accord on Saturday in Moscow, Ivashov said that "such union will solve the problem of restoration of the spirit of confidence between the peoples, will prevent possible threat to CIS states, and, in case of an aggression, will help to repulse it by joint efforts." As many as 80 representatives of 17 parties and 30 public organizations and movements of the former Soviet republics with the exception of Turkmenistan are participating in the forum. Ivashov called "creation of a security system in the Asian region with the participation of the states neighboring CIS countries" among the necessary "political and legal tasks" to be solved in the near future. In Ivashov's words, the Eastern-European system of collective security could include the armed forces of Belarus, the group of the Russian armed forces, and the Kaliningrad grouping which would subordinate "to a body like Council of Defense" headed by the Belarussian president. He proposes "to unite military systems of three Transcaucasian states in the Caucasian region" with Russian military presence and command and control center in Rostov-na-Donu. Military systems of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and "in accordance with its readiness" Turkmenistan can be united in the frameworks of one more military grouping. The system of collective security in the Urals can include the armed forces of the Ural military district and the armed forces of Kazakhstan. "Now it's time to adopt a political decision," declared Ivashov. However, as he said, despite the fact that "there exist different military threats the Russian Foreign Ministry strictly adheres to the position of a non-allied existence." In Ivashov's opinion, "when there exists one bloc (NATO - Interfax) which does not want to be disbanded, there is a real necessity in our defensive union."
