Yi Chung-hoe, president of the insurance company, said Friday that Daehan Kyoyuk will create a financial group with its main pillars being a bank, an insurance company and a securities company. "We will become the largest independent financial group (independent of industrial capital) in the nation by 2000," Yi said while unveiling his company's projects for fiscal 1994. Daehan Kyoyuk, which took over an insurance company last year, plans to take over a commercial bank this year, said another official of the insurance company. The insurance company is the first financial institution in the nation to declare that it will create a financial conglomerate after top government officials said last month that the government will foster financial groups independent of industrial capital. Pak Chae-yun, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs, said last month that the government will raise the 8 percent ceiling on the ownership of equity stakes in a commercial bank by a person, his relatives and those with certain close business relation to him. Such a measure would be the first step taken to help create financial conglomerates powerful enough to challenge foreign financial behemoths in the face of wider market opening. Pak said the government will change commercial banks from quasi public institutions to genuine private businesses and help make some of them lead companies of planned financial conglomerates. The Korea Tax Institute, which recently conducted a study on fostering financial groups at the request of the Ministry of Finance, also proposed in its report last month that commercial banks become lead companies of financial groups. While the general consensus is that financial groups should have nonbank financial institutions clustered around commercial banks, Daehan Kyoyuk would have to take over a commercial bank to create a financial group. One of the takeover targets is Citizens National Bank, which the government plans to put on the block this year. An official from Daehan Kyoyuk said his company will bid for the commercial bank. Daehan Kyoyuk, which has an investment consulting company as well as a securities company as its subsidiaries, also plans to acquire a merchant bank, a credit union and other financial institutions. Preparations by Daehan Kyoyuk are expected to set in motion mergers and acquisitions among financial institutions. In addition to Daehan Kyoyuk, Shinhan Bank and Korea Long Term Credit Bank are expected to unveil their plans to form financial groups soon. The two banks, many government officials said, are strong candidates to become lead companies of financial groups.
