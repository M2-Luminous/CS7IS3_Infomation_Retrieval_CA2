Major tasks of this conference are, taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide, to conscientiously implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and the national economic work conference, to study the important issues on current economic development in line with the guidelines of the second plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee, to unify understanding of the situation and tasks, to make overall arrangements for this year's economic work, and to mobilize people across the municipality to raise spirit, make concerted efforts, and strive to accelerate Tianjin's development. Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave an important speech at the conference. Mayor Zhang Lichang delivered an important report entitled "Uplift Spirit, Work With All-Out Efforts, and Create a New Situation in Accelerating Development." Municipal leading comrades Liu Fengyan, Li Huifen, Song Pingshun, Zheng Zhiying, Ye Disheng, Zhang Haosheng, Zhuang Gonghui, Wang Dehui, Zhu Liankang, and Zhang Guanwen attended the opening ceremony. Gao Dezhan said in his speech: After the second plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee concluded, people throughout the municipality have swung into action to relay and implement its guidelines. Based on their specific conditions, many units have explored new ideas, studied and formulated major measures, assigned the responsibility for attaining defined targets, and notably quickened the pace of their work. Through this conference, we should make conscientious efforts to fulfill the various tasks and targets of economic work, further develop the good trend, and accomplish the tasks as put forward in the work priorities of the municipal party committee. Regarding Tianjin's economic work for this year, Gao Dezhan emphasized five issues. --It is imperative to persistently take economic construction as the central task and seize the opportunity to accelerate reform, opening up, and economic development. As far as Tianjin is concerned, economic development decides on the public interests and the entire situation of the municipality and affects the development of various undertakings and the improvement of living standard. Therefore, we should firmly take economic construction as the central task. The most important thing for the present is to seize the opportunity to accelerate reform, opening up, and economic development. This is the theme of this year's economic work. To accelerate economic development, all work should be made successful, and major efforts should be devoted to the following tasks. First, Tianjin's growth rates of GNP and other major economic indicators and all its important work should be made better than in 1993; large breakthroughs should be achieved in key work and some weak links; and some aspects of work should continue to be ranked among the best in the country or should strive to become so. Second, development of the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries should be accelerated in an all-round manner. In particular, we should strengthen the fundamental position of agriculture, strive to improve large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, greatly raise economic efficiency, and expand the tertiary industry with greater efforts. Third, we should adhere to the principle of developing the various sectors of the economy simultaneously while keeping public ownership predominant and give a free hand to the faster development of township enterprises, the three types of foreign-funded enterprises, urban collective enterprises, individual enterprises, and private enterprises simultaneously while making state-owned enterprises successful. Fourth, all enterprises, all departments, and all districts and counties should improve their level and achieve major breakthroughs in work. In other words, all departments and all areas should accelerate development. Fifth, Tianjin should open to all domestic areas and foreign countries in all directions and quicken the pace in directly using foreign capital. Sixth, the principle of "developing Tianjin with science and technology" should be further implemented, scientific and technological achievements should be transformed more rapidly, and great efforts should be made to industrialize high and new technology. Party committees and governments at all levels in the municipality should devote greater efforts to accelerating reform, opening up, and economic development, conscientiously strengthen leadership over economic work, correctly analyze and estimate the situation, earnestly study new conditions and new issues, and be determined to resolve the conspicuous contradictions in economic operation so as to gain initiative in economic work. All localities, departments, and enterprises, economic or non-economic, should channel their work to the track of accelerating Tianjin's economic development and take the initiative in serving reform, opening up, and economic construction, which represent public interests. --It is imperative to accelerate economic development by deepening reform. In particular, enterprise reform should be made successful. Only when enterprises are prosperous, can Tianjin be prosperous. In conducting reform, we should promote package reform while giving prominence to key areas. Enterprise reform--the key area and central link of the reform of the entire municipality--is the most important of the reforms in all fronts. Enterprises are the foundation of the national economy, and enterprise development has a direct bearing on Tianjin's economic strength and its capacity for sustained development. Therefore, to accelerate reform, enterprise reform should be accelerated first; and accelerating enterprise development is the key to accelerate development. We should embrace the idea of pooling the efforts of all fields to conduct enterprise reform. We should adopt every means to fulfill the tasks of enterprise reform in order to improve and invigorate enterprises. We have issued a clear-cut call for doing practical work for the masses. Likewise, we should also do practical work for enterprises. This should be the major criterion for assessing the work of a department or a locality. Leaders of various committees, offices, bureaus, districts, and counties should go down to enterprises to help them address problems one by one. Departments in charge, departments with overall responsibilities, and other departments should enhance the sense of service and provide service to the endeavor of deepening enterprise reform. Meanwhile, focusing on deepening their reform, all enterprises should achieve success in deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, adjusting the structure, developing new products, strengthening management, conducting technical transformation, improving grass-roots levels, building the spiritual civilization, training staff members and workers, and improving leading bodies. Through the work, enterprises with good efficiency should pursue greater development, and those with poor efficiency should overcome difficulties and achieve a turn for the better. --It is imperative to have a good command of the orientation to ensure sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. At the second plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee, the municipal party committee called for attention to five principles concerning the guiding thought for Tianjin's work for this year. These principles are very important, and they play an important role in guiding economic work. To make economic work successful, we should particularly handle well the relationship in the following three aspects. First, we should handle well the relationship between the quantity and the quality of economic development. We should establish new ideas for economic development and truly channel economic development to the track centering on improving economic efficiency. In developing the economy, we should emphasize not only the increase of quantity but also the improvement of quality and exert greater efforts in adjusting the structure, strengthening management, and achieving scientific and technological advance. We should see to it that an increase is achieved in the revenues at all levels, in the profits of all types of enterprises (a decrease of deficits on the part of loss-making enterprises), and in the income of the vast number staff members and workers, and that the standard of living is improved continuously. Second, we should handle well the relationship between reform and development on the one hand and stability on the other. We should understand that development is the purpose, reform the motivation, and stability the condition. We should achieve faster economic development by deepening reform and opening wider to the outside world and, meanwhile, provide a more relaxed environment for reform when arranging economic work. Third, we should handle well the relationship between faster economic development and comprehensive social progress. --It is imperative to take the increase in the income of urban and rural staff members and workers as an important criterion for judging economic work. In developing reform, construction, and all other work, we should take the "three advantages" put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the fundamental criteria. To be specific, our work should be advantageous to developing Tianjin's productive forces, increasing Tianjin's economic strength, and improving the standard of living of all its people. Party committees and governments at all levels should regard the income increase of staff members, workers, and peasants and improvement in their living standard as an important criterion for judging economic work, attach great importance to it, and make it a success. We should exert utmost efforts to do practical work for the benefit of the masses and successfully fulfill all the tasks designed for this purpose. The most important practical work for the masses is to continuously increase the income of staff members, workers, and peasants, and to improve their standard of living. We should adopt every means possible and devote every effort to benefit the masses and increase their income. The issues concerning retired cadres, staff members, and workers should also be addressed well. Regarding the staff members and workers who have difficulties in their life for the time being, we should work out ways and do meticulous work to resolve the difficulties. The system of responsibility for attaining work targets will be instituted across the board this year. The income increase of staff members, workers, and peasants should be taken as an important indicator for evaluation. --It is imperative to fulfill responsibilities, improve work styles, and work hard and in a down-to-earth manner. The system of responsibility for attaining work targets should be implemented across the board. An important task of this economic work conference is to assign all departments and all enterprises with economic tasks and specific targets in line with the requirements of the plenary session of the municipal party committee so that everyone will have pressure and targets on their shoulder. It is hoped that party and government organs at all levels, especially leading cadres, will set a good example in instituting the work target responsibility system. The year-end summary of work and appraisal of leading bodies and cadres should all be based on how they have implemented the system. We should further change work styles. Leaders at all levels should take the lead in changing work styles, working hard, and making earnest efforts to do practical work. They should resolutely overcome subjectivism, bureaucracy, and formalism. They should renounce exaggeration and fraud in favor of truth, practical work, and realistic results. They should firmly rely on the masses and mobilize all positive factors. Regarding the important issues on economic work, reform, and opening up, they should give heed to the opinions, voice, and requirements of the masses and win their understanding and support. When reforming their inner managerial system and leadership system, enterprises should pay attention to protecting the interests and democratic rights of their staff members and workers. They should attach importance to the ideological and political work for their staff members and workers to soothe people's feelings. In conclusion, Gao Dezhan said: Tianjin's tasks of this year's reform and development are heavy and arduous. As long as the people across the municipality unite as one to work hard and in a down-to- earth manner, Tianjin will be able to surmount numerous difficulties, accelerate reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, regain its magnificent bearings, and score brilliant achievements again.
