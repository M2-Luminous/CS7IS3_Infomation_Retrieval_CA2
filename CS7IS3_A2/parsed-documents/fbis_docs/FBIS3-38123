However, this is a competition that will contribute to accelerating the necessary structural adjustments. Those who stop this structural change harm themselves, FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed at the opening of the 24th World Economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland. Detachment from the reform states or even the possible reduction of economic aid for these countries would also have disastrous consequences for the West, said Kohl, who particularly referred to possible immigration of workers to West Europe. Therefore, the further opening of Western markets for East European products is necessary because only in this way can these countries be enabled to earn the foreign exchange needed for their development by exports. Despite all the support from the West, the help for the reform countries continues to be only help for self-help. The reform states also have to be introduced to the market economy more slowly than before. German experiences have shown that patience is one of the most important factors in the transformation process. Moreover, political signals also have to be given, Kohl said. For example, he refused to accept the Oder-Neisse border as the future eastern border of the European Community. The process of enlargement is also indispensable in the combating of unemployment because unemployment no longer can be combated in only one country, he said. For this reason, the chancellor called for the European countries' joint efforts to combat unemployment and to ensure stability, while he gave preference to stability over the observation of the timetable in the course of European unification. In his deliberations, Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer also focused on stability policy. He urgently appealed to the industrial nations to stick to anti-inflation policy. Moreover, Tietmeyer took the view that there should be no experiments with anti-inflation policy. Rather, the industrial nations have to be careful not to endanger their successes in the curbing of inflation. Particular caution is required as far as the increase of the state expenditures is concerned. Tietmeyer commented skeptically on the possibility to boost demand by increasing the state expenditure. This would probably be more harmful than useful, he said.
