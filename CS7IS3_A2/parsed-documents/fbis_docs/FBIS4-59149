The source revealed that a scheduled visit to Moscow by Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Riyad al-Qaysi may not take place, as the Russians have told him they cannot receive him before 16 May "because his opposite number, Boris Kolokolov, will not be in Moscow." The source said that the Iraqis' "interest in the visit has subsided, because they had hoped it would be made before the [UN] Security Council discusses continuing the economic sanctions against Iraq in the middle of the month." The source pointed out that Moscow has lost hope of the Security Council changing its position, and that the council will decide to continue the sanctions, "despite the Russian-French-Chinese proposals" calling for easing the sanctions. As is known, Moscow, Beijing, Paris, and Ankara are exerting pressure to lift or ease the blockade imposed on Iraq. But the U.S.-British position is unrelenting. The Russian source added that two other factors have made Moscow more certain that lifting the blockade on Iraq is not easy: First, the U.S. Administration informed a high-level Russian official who visited Washington two weeks ago of its intention of continuing the sanctions against Baghdad. Second, the article written by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in THE NEW YORK TIMES a week ago, warning of the danger of lifting the blockade on Iraq. The sources went on to say that Moscow and Paris are studying a new draft proposal to be submitted to the Security Council, calling for transcending Resolutions 706 and 712 concerning selling Iraqi oil under UN supervision. The proposal provides for increasing the quantity Baghdad is allowed to sell, namely increasing its value from $1.6 billion to $4-5 billion. But the problem is that Baghdad is not enthusiastic about the proposal. The Russian diplomat said the reason is that 60-70 percent of the revenue would not reach Iraq, but would be transferred to the Gulf war compensation fund, a part of which would be used to finance UN operations.
