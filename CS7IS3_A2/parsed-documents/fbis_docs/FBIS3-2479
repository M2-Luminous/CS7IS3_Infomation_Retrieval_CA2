The 7th lecture, entitled "(Reform of the) Investment and Loan Accommodation System," is presented by Guo Shuyan, vice minister of the State Planning Commission. Guo begins by explaining why it is necessary to reform the investment and loan accommodation system. He says: Though it should be pointed out that profound changes have taken place in the system after 14 years of reform and opening up, the requirement raised by the 14th national party congress to establish a socialist market economy set an even higher demand on us. Three conspicuous problems exist in the system at present. They are: (1) The scale of investment and loan accommodation has expanded too rapidly. For instance, the scale of investment in fixed assets in 1993 increased nearly 49 percent from that of 1992; state enterprises carried out nearly 78,000 technical transformation projects costing a total investment amount of 450 billion yuan in 1993, up 51.8 percent from that of 1992. They caused more inflationary pressure. (2) The investment structure is irrational. Most funds were committed to low-level construction projects which produced low economic returns, to real estate development, and to development zones. (3) Investments produced low economic returns and resulted in tremendous waste. Preliminary analysis shows the above problems were caused by the following four reasons. (1) An effective investment risks supervision and restrictive mechanism has yet to be established and the system of giving equal treatment to enterprises and individuals regardless of their performances has not been really abolished. This made "some enterprises and localities blindly carry out new projects to pursue unrealistic, excessively high growth rate regardless of the availability of funds and materials." It may be said that this is a fundamental reason leading to the current expansion of our investment scale. (2) As the authority for examining and approving investment projects was delegated to localities, a system for appropriate macroeconomic regulation and control of investment still has not been established. As a result, it is hard to bring the total investment scale under effective control. (3) The market system serving investment and construction is still imperfect; protectionism barriers exists in localities and different departments. (4) Formulation of laws and regulations cannot catch up with the pace of economic development. As we are in the process of shifting from a planned economy to a socialist market economy, many old measures for management of investment are no longer applicable, while new measures have yet to be drawn up. If the above problems are to be solved once and for all, we must carry out reform to establish an investment and loan accommodation system suited to a socialist market economy. Guo then discusses the seven main points of reform of the investment and loan accommodation system. They are: (1) Reform the methods of investment and loan accommodation system for different investment projects. Guo generally divides investment projects into the following three categories: competitive projects which include mainly those investment projects that produce higher returns and are more responsive to market regulation and more competitive on the market, such as textile mills, processing industries, and so forth; basic industries and infrastructure projects which require longer construction period and bigger investments but produce lower economic returns than competitive projects; and public welfare projects which include scientific and technological, educational, cultural, public health, sports, and environmental protection projects, office buildings for government and mass organizations, and national defense facilities. Guo discusses appropriate management systems for investment and loan accommodations for the above three categories of projects. He says the establishment of these three categories constitutes a main aspect of current reform and is suited to the need of establishing a socialist market economy. He stresses: Current reform of the investment and loan accommodation system has decided that enterprises will gradually replace the governments as the major investors in the future. (2) Improve a restrictive mechanism for investment risks by accelerating the implementation of a legal person responsibility system among enterprises. Construction projects will not be approved until after the legal persons mainly responsible for them are organized. The implementation of a legal person responsibility system "converges with the PRC Company Law, which was recently promulgated." "It will expedite enterprises' transformation of operating mechanisms and accelerate the establishment of a modern enterprise system." (3) Establish and improve a macroeconomic regulation and control system for investments. The central government will be responsible for deciding on the scale of total investment in fixed assets, the total amount of shares issued nationwide, and so forth; the targets, laws, and regulations governing macroeconomic regulation and control of investments nationwide shall be decided by the State Council. The provincial people's governments will be responsible for regulation and control of the structure and total amount of investments in their respective regions, for ensuring the smooth progress of key state projects in their respective regions, and for creating a favorable investment environment. Guo also discusses measures for regulating and controlling total investment amount and for readjusting investment structure through price and taxation reforms. In this connection, efforts will be made to improve a system for examining and approving investment projects and to establish a system for the feedback of investment information. (4) The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decided to establish a national development bank to raise and guide funds from society to ensure key state projects and to facilitate loans for basic industries and infrastructure projects. "It will be conducive to readjusting our overall investment structure, to increasing investment returns, and to promoting rapid and healthy national economic development." (5) Concentrate financial and material resources on key construction projects to ensure their smooth progress. Guo says successfully carrying out the job will directly expedite rapid national economic development. (6) Expedite development of a system that serves the investment market. (7) Improve the formulation of relevant laws and regulations. The lecture concludes at 0715 GMT.
