This country has known how to successfully face adversity in the past. I am sure that as long as we don't lose confidence in our potential, we have what it takes to come out winning. Once again, I reiterate my invitation to my fellow countrymen to exercise their constitutional right to vote in tomorrow's election. It is the duty of each and every Colombian who is eligible to vote. The right to vote is free and voluntary. It is a reaffirmation of our democratic and participative vocation. He who votes must do so based on his own dictates and convictions. This is a right that makes us masters of our fate and interests. We again have before us the opportunity to participate in the presidential election; the most important political decision in our country for the next four years. The runoff mechanism is another result of the important changes introduced by the new Constitution. The National Government will once again ensure total and complete impartiality and will exert strict control to guarantee transparency in the development of these elections. We will demand that political parties, the media, and citizens fully comply with the existing norms on behavior. Any attack against the right to vote freely will be severely punished as stipulated by the law. Compatriots, we are experiencing moments of great enthusiasm and credibility in the country. We have again overwhelmingly demonstrated our solidarity when thousands of Colombians suffered the unexpected and brutal attack by nature a few days ago. Although our team lost its first game, we have faith, trust, and conviction that it will recover in the games to come. Victory alluded us today, but we are sure that our boys will know how to achieve the results we all hope for. The faith, trust, and conviction we have in them is what we must show at the elections tomorrow. I hope that the force accompanying the Colombian team will be equaled by that which is deposited in the ballot boxes in every corner of our nation. As president, I address my fellow countrymen and invite them to vote with the assurance that you will exercise your right to freedom appropriately. Thank you and good night.
