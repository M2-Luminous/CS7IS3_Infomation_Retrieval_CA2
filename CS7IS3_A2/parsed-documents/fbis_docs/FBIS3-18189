In this process, German-French partnership is more indispensable than ever, Alphandery said, according to the prereleased script of a speech he will deliver in Bonn on Tuesday evening [24 February] at an event organized by the Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, where he will speak to about 400 leading German industry representatives. The second stage of the EMU, which has been underway since January, requires even closer political cooperation so as to adjust the basic economic data for the third stage, Alphandery said. The issue is not only public finances and conditions for healthy and lasting growth. What is necessary is "solidarity and determined action with persistence so as to further develop the competitiveness of the companies and combat unemployment." The preservation of social peace also depends on solving Europe's competitive problems. Alphandery called for implementing the growth initiative of the European Union with loans of ECU8 billion (about 15 billion German marks) by the European Investment Bank. This is a path to make Europe resistance to trade protectionism and to keep it open for world trade. In this connection, he recalled the intensive German-French cooperation in concluding the new GATT world trade agreement. The European Monetary System must not be called into question, the French finance minister said. The extension of the exchange rate margins in 1993 was a success. Monetary policy cooperation between Germany and France and the close interlacing of the two national economies have also contributed to mastering the dangers of inflation in other European countries. According to Alphandery, there are 2,000 German companies in France and 1,000 French companies in Germany.
