Rabin's remark means Israel no longer needs to ask for such aid, because this aid has become a routine practice. Successive U.S. Administrations have never failed to extend aid to Israel. They are so generous that their aid to Israel exceeds that extended to any other U.S. ally. This aid has turned Israel into the largest military arsenal, with the most sophisticated weapon systems, including nuclear arms and weapons of mass destruction. The question asks itself: If Rabin did not go to Washington to ask for military and financial aid, what did he really want? It is not difficult for anyone following events to find the answer in the political situation created by the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre in Hebron. This situation halted the Washington peace talks segment of the peace process and stopped the continued talks between the Rabin government's delegates and representatives of the Palestinian side that signed the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The massacre in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque covered the peace process in a flagrant terrorist curtain of blood and fire. It offered one more proof of the Israeli rulers' policy to foil the peace process and prevent it from advancing one step forward after the Madrid conference more than two years ago. Justifications and hollow words meant to calm emotions could not save the Rabin government from being held responsible for this abominable massacre. Thus, Rabin went to Washington facing a real impasse as a result of his policy to defend the illegal settlements. These settlements expressed adherence to policies of regional expansion and altering the geographic and demographic nature of the Israeli-occupied territories. Israel wants to impose the illegal presence of these settlements on the whole world as an accomplished fact. The Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre has clearly and irrevocably revealed the true positions of the Rabin government. It has also revealed that this government is just an alleged dove of peace, and that it is essentially hostile to peace, just like all previous Israeli governments. However, the Rabin government, which deceitfully raised the slogan of peace with one hand while committing daily crimes and massacres with the other hand, has reaped evil results and fallen into the traps it set for the peace process. The bargaining chips of peace, which this government has used since it assumed power, have lost their value. Hence, Rabin's visit to Washington under these circumstances is proof of the deep and complicated crisis facing his government. It is also proof of the special relationship between the U.S. Administration and Israel, and of the extent of this administration's ability to convince the Israeli rulers of whatever it wishes. The new political situation -- represented by both the Rabin government's state of affairs and the power to convince the Israeli rulers that the U.S. Administration enjoys -- makes the United States assume an additional great responsibility. This is because the United States is the superpower that assumes special responsibility toward both global peace and international legitimacy, in its capacity as the country that unleashed the Middle East peace process. From this premise, the current circumstances seem very appropriate for the U.S. Administration to play its role in having Rabin comply with the U.S. peace initiative and announce his acceptance of the bases of this initiative in order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on the resolutions of international legitimacy in the region. No one can deny that the Arabs, led by Syria, contributed to unleashing and preserving this peace opportunity. Without the Syrian position in particular, doors would not have been opened for the peace process, and the peace talks would not have begun in Madrid and resumed in Washington. This is because Israel officially rejected the U.S. initiative in writing. Moreover, Israel has thus far rejected the bases of the peace process. Syria -- which showed cooperation to render the peace process a success and which really wants to achieve a just and comprehensive peace that will return territories and rights to their owners and preserve the dignity of all parties -- does not have any problem with the U.S. Administration. Likewise, the Arab side, as a whole, does not have any problem with the U.S. Administration. Syria and other Arab parties hope the U.S. Administration will manage to revive the peace process before the latter is finished off by the Israeli Government's policy and positions that obstruct this process. The only way to make the U.S. initiative a success and break the deadlock in the peace talks is the acceptance by the Israeli rulers of the bases of this process, their respect for international legitimacy, and their relinquishment of the policy of regional expansion, racist fanaticism, war crimes, and annihilation. The U.S. Administration is primarily responsible for achieving this objective. It is a problem between the U.S. Administration and Israel, and not between this administration and the Arabs. The key to resolving this problem is in Washington's hand.
