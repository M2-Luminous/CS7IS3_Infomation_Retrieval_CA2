(Hsu Ta-chun), 23, received the sentence after being convicted of air piracy. He was a salesman of the mainland's state-run China National Light Industrial Products Import and Export Corporation in the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin. Hsu used a fake bomb to hijack a Xiamen Airlines Boeing 737 to Taiwan on 12 December last year and asked for political asylum. None of the 92 passengers and crew on board were hurt. Hsu is among 12 asylum seekers who have hijacked 11 mainland airliners to Taiwan since last April. Ten have been sentenced to up to 30 years in jail while the rest are waiting trial. Taipei has so far rejected Peking's demand that hijackers be repatriated for trial on the mainland, citing judicial sovereignty over the criminals. But Taipei, trying to deter further hijacks, said hijackers will be heavily punished and deported after serving their terms.
