FBIS4-39890 "drsov113_v_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-113 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 Lithuania Russian Diplomat on Latest Round of Talks Russian Diplomat on Latest Round of Talks WS1006101994 Tallinn BNS in English 1548 GMT 9 Jun 94 WS1006101994 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Vilnius, Jun 09, BNS -- The head of the Russian delegation for talks with Lithuania confirmed that "Russia links the problem of transit and normal functioning of the Kaliningrad region to Lithuania's most favored nation trade status." Viktor Isakov noted that "this is not a trap of officials or the (Russian) Foreign Ministry," but "the line of the country's leadership." In an interview with the Vilnius-based Russian-language ECHO LITVY newspaper, Isakov commented on a round of Lithuanian-Russian talks that was held in Vilnius June 7-8. Discussing Russian military transit, the Russian diplomat said Russia "is not asking anything from Lithuania,...,and does not demand to create some uncontrolled corridor." Isakov noted, however, that Russia has some things to complain about. In his words, "entire tank-cars of fuel disappear during transit through Lithuanian territory." The Russian diplomat said "explanations that cargos are redirected and even that mafia is involved are not convincing." Commenting on accusations that Russia pressurizes Lithuania, Isakov said "not a single example of such threats and statements was presented by the Lithuanian side. On the contrary, threats to "shut in" the Kaliningrad region are already heard from the Lithuanian side." In Isakov's view, difficulties in talks on sea borders are "completely natural yet possible to overcome." Isakov said assertions that Kaliningrad poses a military threat is a fiction, "just another card in the game of those who do not want improvement of relations" between Lithuania and Russia.
