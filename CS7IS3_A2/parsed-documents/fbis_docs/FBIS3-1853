The city's 13.49 million long-term residents consume about 2,000 tons of vegetables a day. According to Meng Jianzhu, deputy mayor of the city, Shanghai will increase the area of farmland under vegetables by 2,530 ha [hectares] this year, to bring the total vegetable-growing area to 10,000 ha. According to Meng, the city plans to build a chain of vegetable and nonstaple-food markets and fairs, and encourage farmers to directly sell their products in urban areas. A survey shows that the rapid expansion of urban industry has resulted in serious encroachment on farmland in recent years, causing shortages of vegetables in the local markets.
