But When?"] [Text] Many politicians think that our democrats will unite only five minutes before their execution. However, "the roundtable" organized at the VECHERNIY KYYIV editorial office has given reasons for believing that such a prognosis is not quite true. At least, neither Levko Lukyanenko, nor Kostyantyn Morozov, nor Vitaliy Karpenko, nor Yuriy Hnatkevich, nor other participants in the discussion cast even a doubt regarding the possibility for unifying dispersed national democratic forces. On the contrary, a number of principal propositions was put forward, which can underlie the creation of a political force embracing the Ukrainian Republican Party, Rukh, the Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine, the national wing of the Party of the Democratic Revival of Ukraine, and those remaining for the time being outside political parties. These propositions include the independence of Ukraine, the safeguarding of personal freedom, as well as political and economic reforms, much discussed, but not initiated. Such a consolidation is especially necessary in view of the presidential elections planned for this year. In order to prevent a repetition of the previous elections, national democrats have to appoint a single candidate and secure his victory. Can this be done? Yes, if party leaders cast off their ambitions and give priority to a real candidate. They will have to set aside their ambitions. Naturally, if Ukraine is really dearer to them than their ego.
