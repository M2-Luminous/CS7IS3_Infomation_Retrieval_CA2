The political issue of settling the Serbian problem in Croatia was the main topic of the discussion, at which the assembly SNS deputies presented their remarks and expressed pleasure at the end of the meeting, saying that only through such meetings a solution can be found in joint work. The implementation of the constitutional law on human rights and liberties, rights of ethnic communities and national minorities, the issue of education, election of Serbian minority representatives to the Chamber of Counties of the Croatian Assembly, appointment of Serbian minority representatives to some positions in county councils, protected areas, the future of local authorities -- these are but a few questions that the assembly deputies of Serbian nationality consider decisive for the return of trust in the institutions of the system. After representatives of relevant ministries had spoken, Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic said this about the mentioned problems: [Begin Valentic recording] Without any political demagogy I can completely openly say here that Croatia must build two criteria: First, it has to build a democratic state; it is well-known that in such a state all citizens must enjoy equal rights, because a state that does not guarantee that cannot be a state in the European sense of the word. Consequently, Croatia must be a democratic state and that is the fundamental intention of our government, and second, Croatia must be an economically strong state. [end recording] [Kabok] Expressing obvious pleasure at the end of the meeting, the SNS assembly deputies once again stressed that all Serbian problems must be resolved exclusively within the Republic of Croatia.
