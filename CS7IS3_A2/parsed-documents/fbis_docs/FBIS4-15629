Tomorrow is the Second Round of Parliamentary Elections on the Peninsula"] [Text] Republic of Crimea President Yuriy Meshkov has held a press conference in Simferopol. He announced he had had to cut short his trip to Cyprus owing to a sharply worsened situation in Crimea. First and foremost, Meshkov underlined, was the appointment by Ukraine's president of a representative to the Republic of Crimea. "One can only regret," Meshkov underlined, "there is at the helm of the Ukrainian state at the moment the most dangerous government from the point of view of continued peace and stability in Europe." Yuriy Meshkov told the journalists that he had repealed the Crimean government's decree on raising the prices of bread by a factor of 2.3. Crimean Vice Premier Yevgeniy Saburov, in his turn, said to the journalists that "if the president puts spokes in our wheels, I would be obliged to relinquish the position and return to Moscow." More so, the vice premier underlined, because already "part of my team has left Crimea because working here is not a simple thing." Mykola Myhalchenko, the Ukraine president's adviser, also held a press conference in Simferopol. In particular, he said: "If Meshkov is stating that today's Ukrainian leadership is dangerous for Europe, I would like him to take a look at himself. On the contrary, he (Meshkov -- A.P.) is terribly dangerous not only for Europe but also for the entire world. His ill-advised actions may result in a situation where Crimea will become a world hot spot." Myhalchenko said that the Ukraine president's representative in the Republic of Crimea would oversee the observance of the Constitution and laws of Ukraine on the peninsula, in accordance with Ukrainian law. A meeting in support of the president of the Republic of Crimea was planned in Simferopol's Lenin Square on 8 April. It did not take place because of pouring rain. The further situation on the peninsula largely depends on the result of the second round of parliamentary elections scheduled for 10 April.
