Stange. After the meeting, the government issued a communique, which was read by the defense minister himself. Let us listen: [Begin Perez Yoma recording] The national defense minister, who is now addressing public opinion, has entrusted the Carabineros director general -- who had acquiesced with this request -- with the task of drafting a study within 30 days to streamline the institution he heads. The Defense Ministry deems that this task is of the highest national interest. Hence, the director general will have to discharge this duty by giving it precedence over all other regular duties. To this effect, he will delegate all the power that the Carabineros Organizational Law allows him to the Carabineros deputy director general. Thank you. [end recording] This is the communique released by the defense minister, who confirmed the reports that were leaked this morning at the ministry indicating there would be surprises in the way Gen. Stange would resume office. As has been heard, he will devote himself to the streamlining of the Carabineros police. The duties of director general as such will be discharged by the deputy commander, who is the current acting director general, General [Fernando] Cordero. This is all the information we have at the Defense Ministry. Thank you.
