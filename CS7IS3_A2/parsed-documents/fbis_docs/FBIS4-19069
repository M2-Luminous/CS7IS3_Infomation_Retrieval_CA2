[passage omitted] Foreign Minister Javier Solana informed the Senate about the evacuation of Spanish citizens. [Begin Solana recording] According to the latest information I have at my disposal, right now I can say that about 25 Spaniards are on the verge of leaving, a certain number have already left, and there are 25 ready to leave. I think that they will be able to leave at 1400. That is the mainly good news I can give, but as I say, overall it is a bad picture because the situation in Rwanda is still very unpleasant, very bad. [end recording] The Spanish Government is in permanent contact with France and Belgium, the countries which are coordinating the evacuation of nationals. Spain has offered two Hercules transport planes to help with the evacuation. So a unit of the Legion's special operations group is on stand-by should it be needed.
