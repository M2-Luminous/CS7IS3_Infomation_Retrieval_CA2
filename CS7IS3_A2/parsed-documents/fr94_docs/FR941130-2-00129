FR941130-2-00129 FR941130-2-00073 Charter Oak also requests authority for itself and its subsidiaries to make loans (on either a recourse or non-recourse basis) to unaffiliated developers of QFs, Exempt Projects or Qualified IPPs as part of its financing of the acquisition of interests in such projects. Such loans shall count against the overall $200 million funding authorization. Applicants seek approval for any Intermediate Company to issue equity securities and debt securities, with or without recourse to the Applicants, to persons other than the Applicants including banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, exclusively for the purpose of financing (including any refinancing of) investments in Exempt Projects through December 31, 1996. The Intermediate Companies' investments in Exempt Projects may take the form of acquisitions of common stock, capital contributions, open account advances, and/or subordinated loans, provided that such open account advances or subordinated loans will bear interest at a rate based on NU's cost of funds in effect on the date of issue, but in no case in excess of the prime rate at a bank designated by NU. It is proposed that the aggregate principal amount of recourse debt securities issued by Intermediate Companies to persons other than the Applicants will not exceed $150 million at any one time outstanding, provided that no more than $100 million principal amount of such debt securities at any time outstanding may be denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. The aggregate amount of nonrecourse debt securities, to persons other than Applicants, will not be more than $600 million outstanding at any one time and not more than $400 million denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. The recourse to the Applicants will be in the form of the guarantees and assumptions of liability and will be included within the Applicants overall investment authorization limit or $200 million. In any case in which the Applicants directly or indirectly own less than all of the equity interests of an Intermediate Company, only that portion of the recourse or non-recourse indebtedness of such Intermediate Company equal to the Applicants' equity ownership percentage shall be included for purposes of the foregoing limitations. The Applicants assert that the amount and type of such securities, and the terms thereof, including (in the case of any indebtedness) interest rate, maturity, prepayment of redemption privileges, and the forms of any collateral security granted with respect thereto, would be negotiated on a case by case basis, taking into account differences from project to project in optimum debt-equity ratios, projections of earnings and cash flow, depreciation lives, and other similar financial and performance characteristics of each project. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Applicants state that no equity security having a stated par value would be issued or sold by an Intermediate Company for a consideration that is less than such par value; and that any note, bond or other evidence of indebtedness issued or sold by any Intermediate Company will mature not later than 30 years from the date of issuance thereof, and will bear interest at a rate not to exceed the following: (1) If such note, bond or other indebtedness is U.S. dollar denominated, at a fixed rate not to exceed 6.5% over the yield to maturity on an activity traded, non-callable, U.S. Treasury note having a maturity equal to the average life of such note, bond or other indebtedness (the ``Applicable Treasury Rate''), or at a floating rate not to exceed 6.5% over the Applicable Prime Rate; and (2) if such note, bond or other indebtedness is denominated in the currency of a country other than the United States, at a fixed or floating rate which, when adjusted (i.e., reduced) for the prevailing rate of inflation in such country, as reported in official indices published by such country, would be equivalent to a rate on a U.S. dollar denominated borrowing of identical average life that does not exceed 10% over the Applicable Treasury Rate (interpolated if necessary) or Applicable Prime Rate, as the case may be. In connection with the issuance of any debt securities by any Intermediate Company, it is anticipated that such Intermediate Company may grant security in its assets. Such security interest may take the form of a pledge of the shares or other equity securities of an Exempt Project that it owns, including a security interest in any distributions from any such Exempt Project, and/or a collateral assignment of its rights under and interests in other property, including rights under contracts.
