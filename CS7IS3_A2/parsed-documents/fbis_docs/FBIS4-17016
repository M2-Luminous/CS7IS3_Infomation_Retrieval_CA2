Literally just a few days ago, financial support reached Volgograd and Saratov Oblasts. But given that a floating seed drill has yet to be invented, agricultural workers in these oblasts got the chance both to purchase seeds and also to bring in fuel before going out into the fields. Not that you would envy the Volgograders: Around 600 square kilometers of territory have been flooded, and 65,000 hectares of agricultural land are under water. According to preliminary data, flood damage in the oblast will come to over 19 billion rubles [R]. If due account is taken of the fact that the flood is only expected to peak after 25 April, the sowing campaign there will be seriously delayed, which in itself will affect the harvest. As at 15 April in Saratov Oblast, over 100 centers of population, dozens of bridges, many kilometers of road and power transmission lines, and thousands of hectares of agricultural land were flooded. Something in the region of R15 billion will be required to make good what has been affected by the flooding. Perhaps only in the Kuban did the sowing campaign begin on time. Krasnodar Kray's farmers waited expectantly for the financial support promised by the state, but it reached them when the winter crops had already been undersown and resown, and when sunflower seeds were already in the furrow -- in short, the hard graft was already virtually completed. Had it not been for the kray administration's declaring a state of emergency, ruling that agricultural enterprises be sent resources and materials essential to the sowing campaign without payment up front, it is unlikely that the grain growers would have gone out into the field. In Stavropol Kray, spring was roughly two weeks late arriving. Unlike previous years, its start according to the calendar was marked with snow and cold rains. Eventually, the weather relented, but Stavropol Kray's peasants went out into the field without any real enthusiasm, like their neighbors, and without waiting for the arrival of credits and other monies owed to them by the state for grain supplied last year. And as there were no funds, they had not prepared properly for the hardest period of work in the entire year: Machinery was overhauled less thoroughly than last year, crops were treated with half the planned amount of fertilizers. According to Yu. Ivanov, expert from the Kray Agricultural Administration, agrarians are particularly alarmed by the condition of winter crops -- some 20 percent have already perished or thinned out drastically. And although the area devoted to grain in Stavropol Kray remains unchanged, the most optimistic forecasts anticipate obtaining just over 4 million tonnes of grain here -- 1 million down on last year. Spring was also late in reaching the agricultural workers of the Don. The weather was cold, and alarming. In addition, small and large rivers alike burst their banks. But as our own correspondent A. Isayev reports, worse than any natural disaster was the shortage of fuel, fertilizers, and seed. Don villages were unable to purchase them on time for the usual reason: The state has yet to settle up for last year's grain. Over 80 percent of Russian private farmers no longer rely on the state for help. Today, one-third of them are without fuel, seed, or machinery. A few have received credits in time for the sowing campaign, but under crushing interest rates of over 200 percent. Forecasts by the leadership of the Association of Russian Peasant (Private) Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives [AKKOR], which addressed journalists a few days ago, are depressing: 30 percent of the lands belonging to private farmers will be left unsown. And in the Central Urals, this figure is even higher -- over 40 percent. As S. Teterin, chairman of the Association of Peasant Farms of this region, told us, 300 of the 3,500 Ural private farmers have declared themselves bankrupt, and very soon this number may double or even treble. Today, field work is under way in the Northern Caucasus, in southern oblasts, in the Central Chernozem Region, and in some areas of the Volga Region, where seed drills have managed to "wade out" into the furrows. But the late spring, the flooding, and the shortage of equipment, fuel, fertilizer, and seed caused by there being no money, are preventing work from progressing at last year's pace as yet. For instance, only half the amount of winter crops were top-dressed. And the sowing of spring crops is 500,000 hectares behind schedule. The Federation Council Committee for Agrarian Policy believes that "it is possible that the production of cereal crops in Russia will fall to 80 million tonnes" this year. This is 24 million tonnes fewer than the average for 1986 through 1990. At the very least, the production of sugar beet, sunflowers, and flax fiber will drop by 10 percent. Last fall, the sown area for winter crops shrank by 3.3 million hectares (21 percent) compared to fall 1992. This means that spring crops will now have to be sown over an area 21 percent larger. Only 66 percent of the necessary fallow land was plowed in the fall. Therefore, this spring the workload per tractor increases by almost half. Meanwhile, machinery has been poorly prepared. There is no farm in Russia which will have managed to purchase all the necessary spare parts, or, more especially, to renew vehicle and tractor fleets. So it is quite likely that grain production in the country will not hit even a modest 80 million tonnes. And, you know, it is not yet known how nature, which is not always generous with good weather, will behave. And it is not clear what state policy will be -- a state where to this day reform is progressing without an agrarian program.... Incidentally, today in the Don (and not only there) silos are crammed with grain from last year and even the year before. Unclaimed by anyone, it sows gloomy thoughts in the minds of the sowers themselves: Is our work required at all? This year, as we know, there will be no compulsory grain deliveries. Some 600,000 tonnes of grain will have to be surrendered to the Federal Fund of Rostov Oblast -- this is significantly less than in the recent past. And the sower, who once puzzled over where to get fuel and spare parts, is now thinking about who will buy how much of his grain this fall. Or, indeed, will it be purchased at all?
