FR940613-0-00028 FR940613-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Highway Administration 23 CFR Part 660 [FHWA Docket No. 93&hyph;16] RIN 2125&hyph;AD13 Forest Highway Portion of Public Lands Highway Program AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing revised Forest Highway (FH) Program regulations to conform to the requirements of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). Section 1032 of the ISTEA amends, among other things, 23 United States Code (U.S.C.) 202 and 204 to combine the FH category with the public lands highway category. The revised regulation will ensure expeditious and proper allocation of funds to provide public road access to the National Forest System (NFS). EFFECTIVE DATE: July 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Allen W. Burden, Chief, Program and Administration Division, Federal Lands Highway Office, (202) 366&hyph;9488, Mr. Curtis L. Page, Forest Highway Program Engineer, Federal Lands Highway Office, (202) 366&hyph;9489, or Mr. Wilbert Baccus, Office of the Chief Counsel, (202) 366&hyph;1396, FHWA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except legal Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 18, 1991, the President signed the ISTEA, Public Law 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914. Section 1032 of the ISTEA amends 23 U.S.C. 202 and 204 by, among other things, incorporating new planning provisions, including metropolitan and statewide transportation plan requirements; establishing management systems provisions, including highway safety, bridges on and off Federal-aid highways, and highway pavements; adding and revising definitions for key terms relating to the Federal Lands Highway Program; and modifying existing allocation procedures. The primary purpose of the Federal Lands Highway Program is to provide public road funding to serve the Federal lands outside State or local government responsibility. Typically, the facilities serve recreational travel and tourism, protect and enhance natural resources, provide sustained economic development in rural areas, and provide needed transportation for Native Americans. The FHWA's partnership with the Forest Service (FS) began in 1916 when the Federal-Aid Road Act appropriated funds for the construction and maintenance of roads and trails serving the national forests. There are currently over 25,000 miles of FHs, on State and local transportation systems, serving 191 million acres of national forest lands in 40 States plus Puerto Rico. These roads connect to the approximately 370,000 miles of forest development roads that are under the jurisdiction of the FS. The fiscal year 1994 (FY 94) authorization for FHs was $113 million. On October 5, 1993, the FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register (58 FR 51794). The following discussion addresses comments to the NPRM which were provided to the FHWA. Development of Regulations The final rule was developed by an interagency task force of the FHWA and the FS. The FHWA and the FS considered the comments received to the Docket for the regulation in developing the revisions to the NPRM for the final rule. Relationship to Interim Guidance Issued December 26, 1991 On December 26, 1991, the FHWA issued interim guidance to aid States and the FS in complying with the new legislative requirements. The guidance was developed in consultation with FS headquarters staff and published in the Federal Register at 57 FR 14880 on April 23, 1992. This interim guidance is superseded by this regulation. Conformance This final rule is in accordance with part 450 of this title. Written Comments Received to the Docket Six commenters submitted 29 comments to the Docket regarding the NPRM. One Federal agency and five State highway agencies (SHAs) commented on the NPRM. The majority of commenters offered specific suggestions for revisions. Some also offered minor editorial corrections and text enhancements. Most of the significant comments were directed at §660.105_Planning and route designation_and at §660.107_Allocations. All comments were considered and have been accommodated to the extent practical. In response to these comments, the FHWA has developed a final rule. A summary of the specific responses to comments raised on individual sections of the NPRM follows: Section-by-Section Analysis Section 660.101␣Purpose Comment: One commenter expressed the need to better describe the importance of the FH Program for access to and management of the NFS and its role as an integral part of the Federal Lands Highway Program. Response: This section was expanded to better describe how the FH Program enhances local, regional, and national benefits of FHs funded under the Public Lands Highway category of the coordinated Federal Lands Highway Program. The FH Program provides safe and adequate transportation access to and through National Forest System (NFS) lands for visitors, recreationists, resource users, and others which is not met by other transportation programs, assists rural and community economic development, and promotes tourism and travel. Section 660.103␣Definitions Comment: One commenter suggested that the definition of ``public authority'' be modified so that a public authority would be required to meet all authorities noted in the NPRM definition by changing the ``or'' condition to an ``and'' condition regarding the public authority's authority to finance, build, operate, ``or'' maintain toll or toll-free facilities.
