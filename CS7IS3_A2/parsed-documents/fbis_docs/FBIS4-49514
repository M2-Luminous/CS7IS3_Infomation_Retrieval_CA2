Japanese consular official Yasuyoshi Ichihashi notified Chinese Foreign Ministry official Qian Xianglin on Sunday of Nagano's resignation and the appointment of Hiroshi Nakai as new justice minister, the statement said. Ichihashi also conveyed the stance of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata concerning Japan's involvement in World War II. "Our past action, including aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable suffering and sorrow. It is essential for each one of us to face history squarely and to share in determination not to repeat it," Hata was quoted as saying. Qian was quoted as responding, "I appreciate your notification and will soon report it to my superior." Nagano resigned Saturday after causing an uproar over his comments denying Japan's aggression during World War II and calling the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Chinese in Nanjing a "fabrication."
