[Snegur] Moldova. [Mathil] Why? [Snegur] Because that is what our ancestors called it. It is the name of a river. Moldavia is more Russian. [Mathil] Is your national anthem still the same as Romania's? [Snegur] Yes. Soon we will have our own. [Mathil] Despite your historical links with Romania, in which Moldova was one of the provinces between the two world wars, your citizens ruled out unification with Romania at the first pluralist elections held in late February. Why? [Snegur] The links are clear. We speak the same language and we used to be part of Romania. However, the Moldovan conscience has never disappeared. It created for itself a geographical and demographic framework. Within this framework, the population is 65 percent Moldovan and 35 percent Ukrainian, Gagauz (Turkish-speaking orthodox), Bulgarian, etc. Today, all of this makes up a whole. During a recent national survey, 95 percent of the citizens said they supported independence. [Mathil] Can this result be interpreted as a sign of Moldova's return to Russia? [Snegur] I know that such an interpretation exists, but I am convinced that the Moldovan president and parliamentary majority will prove that it is a wrong interpretation. [Mathil] It is claimed that you have yielded before the threat of a definitive secession of "the Russian-speaking Republic of Dnestr," where the Russian 14th Army is located, which alone is capable of imposing peace. Is the approach to Moscow the price of Russian mediation in this conflict? [Snegur] Our relations with the democratic forces of Russia and President Yeltsin are completely satisfactory. Yeltsin himself has said on several occasions that he was in favor of a united Moldova. While we are fully aware that in Moscow there are currently forces that take a different turn than Yeltsin's, I hope that we will manage to maintain good relations. We therefore accept Russian mediation. [Mathil] Do you also agree to having the Russian Army stay in Transdnestr? [Snegur] No. The Army must be pulled out. Negotiations on this are currently being held. [Mathil] Can your country be compared to Georgia, which has been torn apart by the secession of Abkhazia, where the Russian Army plays a similar role? [Snegur] The situation is different. We managed to stop the conflict at the outset. The support of the population was greater, and so was the stability in the country. [Mathil] Do you not think that your country, like Georgia or Tajikistan, is the target of Moscow's new doctrine toward regions which can be called "near neighbors?" Is this not an attempt to reconstruct a sort of "imperial" entity around Moscow? [Snegur] There are obviously mutual interests, Russian interests in Moldova and Moldovan interests in Russia. It is normal after a long period of economic links and hypercentralization within the Soviet Union. [Mathil] Solely economic links? [Snegur] Yes. We are members of the CIS economic union, but not of its military structures. [Mathil] Where do Russian ambitions end? [Snegur] You should ask Moscow that question. [Mathil] What do you think of Russian pressure, mostly in the energy sector, with regard to Ukraine, your large neighbor? [Snegur] I would not like to comment on the relations between two sovereign states. On the energy front, Moldova is in a more favorable situation. [Mathil] What do you think of the secessionist aspirations of Crimea? [Snegur] I am categorically against any secession. The separatist evil must be stopped. [Mathil] Are you afraid of Zhirinovskiy? [Snegur] He should not be underestimated. Everyone from the former Soviet territory must be very vigilant and create the living conditions that prevent populism from taking root. [Mathil] You and your government are former members of the old Communist Party. Moreover, the parties openly proclaiming their Communist heritage scored well in the recent elections. Is the reform program being threatened? [Snegur] A return to Communism is neither possible nor acceptable. I am a reformer. The large majority of the new parliament was elected on a program of reform and privatization. [Mathil] Starting Wednesday, Moldova will be the 12th central and eastern European country to have signed the Partnership for Peace. What do you expect from the West? [Snegur] Help to enable us to restore both internal and external stability, and to help us find our place in Europe. [Mathil] To join the Partnership, the Russians are asking for a "special status"... [Snegur] I do not know about this issue of a "special status," but Russia is a major power. [Mathil] Do you not think that Russia's current foreign policy reflects certain expansionist tendencies? [Snegur] You are no doubt referring to certain peace missions to try and resolve conflicts in the old Soviet republics. Without Russia we could not find a solution to these conflicts.
