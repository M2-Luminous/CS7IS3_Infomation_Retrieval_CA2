The Foreign Ministry sent ratification documents to the world body last month and Japan's participation in the convention came into force on Sunday. The convention, which came into force in September 1990, addresses the individual rights of children and sets universally accepted standards for their protection. Japan is the 158th country to join the child protection treaty. Some Japanese have criticized the government for defending a part of the country's civil code which they say violates the convention by discriminating against and stigmatizing illegitimate children. Under the code an illegitimate child's inheritance is set at half that of a legitimate child. Also, legitimate children in the family registration system are listed in such manner as "eldest son" or "youngest daughter," while illegitimate children are listed only as "male" or "female."
