The national university alliance of basic science center headed by Kim Chae-wan, a physics professor at Seoul National University, hosted a two-day meeting of the preparatory committee for the Pacific theoretical physics center in Seoul Monday and agreed to set up a research base in Korea, Japan or China. Six Korean representatives from the world of physics including Kim, who chairs the committee along with Tokyo University President Arima Akito, Melbourne University Dean B. Mckellar and physics scholars from China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam attended the meeting. Korea is said to be the leading candidate for the center, but as an international institute must have the approval and support of the participating countries, the center is expected to open no sooner than in two years' time. The center will be the second international theoretical physics research body after a similar one in Italy.
