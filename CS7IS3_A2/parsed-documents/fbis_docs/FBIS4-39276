FBIS4-39276 "drsov109_e_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-109 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 UKRAINE International Affairs No Results Seen in Black Sea Fleet Talks No Results Seen in Black Sea Fleet Talks LD0606174794 Kiev UNIAN in Ukrainian 1310 GMT 6 Jun 94 LD0606174794 Kiev UNIAN Ukrainian BFN [Excerpts] Kiev -- Leonid Tupchiyenko, an expert at the International Institute of Global and Regional Security, considers that the next round of interstate talks between Ukraine and Russia on the Black Sea Fleet, to be held in Kiev on 8-9 June, could end without a result since during the working consultations in Sevastopol at the end of last week, owing to Russia's position, the sides were unable to move forward on the most principled issue -- that of the division of the Black Sea Fleet's shore infrastructure. Volodymyr Pryadko, chairman of Ukraine's State Property Fund, in an interview with UNIAN, declined to name the exact value of the property of the Black Sea Fleet's shore infrastructure. He just noted that "at issue is Ukraine property valued at several billion dollars." In an interview with UNIAN after the completion of consultations, Feliks Gromov, commander of the Russian Federation's Navy, accused Ukraine of not wishing to include, first and foremost, the Massandra protocols and by doing so, casting doubt on the validity of the remaining documents with regard to the Black Sea Fleet. In the admiral's view, the absence of a clear political decision does not offer the opportunity to continue the dialogue with regard to the shore infrastructure. Ukrainian Navy Commander Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy said: "There are at least 29 shore installations which should only be used jointly, because of their uniqueness. In my view, the Russian experts headed by Feliks Gromov were either not prepared or did not have the authority to discuss this issue during the meeting in Sevastopol as well as the aspects of the land basing of the fleet's aviation and shore troops." During the consultations on 3-4 June they finally succeeded in confirming the agreement on the conditional 50-50 division of the fleet's ships. Its conditionality lies in the fact that Kiev selects 15-20 percent of the ships from its share which are realistically required to form the basis of the Ukrainian navy. The members of the Russian delegation are interpreting this protocol of intent in the following manner: Ukraine has the right to select 15-20 percent from each ship type. The remainder of Ukraine's 35-30 percent will be compensated at the expense of inter- state economic agreements. Ukrainian experts consider that Russia's position leaves Ukraine without the possibility of maneuver and therefore without the possibility of independently choosing the required number of ships within the limits of the 50 percent of the floating means owed to it. According to unofficial information, in practice, during the latest consultations it was not permitted to coordinate the division of 11 fighting ships. Ukraine Deputy Premier Valeriy Shmarov, who met experts from both sides, local authorities, and personnel of the Ukrainian naval command in Sevastopol, said in an interview with UNIAN: "A concrete approach to the division of ships according to the number and type gives the hope that this issue will be resolved soon." Valeriy Shmarov, together with members of the governmental delegation that accompanied him in Sevastopol, examined, from a helicopter, the bays of Sevastopol and Balaklava and also Donuzlav which are increasingly being described as the probable main base for the Ukrainian navy. [passage omitted] Independent experts note that Ukraine's desire to split the fleet in such a way that would enable both parts to cooperate operationally by defending the Black Sea basin and Ukraine's southern borders with Russia does not suit the Russian side. All efforts are being made in Moscow so that the fleet, after its division, remains a striking power in Russia's hands. Experts do not exclude the possibility that at the next round of talks in Kiev on 8 June, Russia's ambassador at large, Yuriy Dubinin, who heads the Russian delegation, will suggest preparing for the signing of two documents: a separate document on the ships and a separate one on the shore infrastructure. This will, in general, make reaching a principled decision on the division of the Black Sea Fleet in the near future a problem.
