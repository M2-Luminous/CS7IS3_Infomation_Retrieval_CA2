FBIS4-53500 "dreas097_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 South Korea Ex-Opposition Leader Cited on DPRK Nuclear Issue Ex-Opposition Leader Cited on DPRK Nuclear Issue SK1905024394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0042 GMT 19 May 94 SK1905024394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] New York, May 18 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, former South Korean opposition leader, says the North Korean nuclear row must be resolved while President Kim Il-song is still alive because he is the only person in that country who can make a major policy concession. "There is no need to respond with cynicism to Kim Il-song's recent peace gesture that included his express wish to visit the United States," said Kim, chairman of the Seoul-based Peace Foundation for the Asia and Pacific Region. Speaking at a meeting sponsored by the Korea Society here Wednesday, Kim Tae-chung predicted that if Kim Il-song could tour the United States, he would become more "moderate." The only way to settle the nuclear dispute is through the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pyongyang and Washington and American security guarantees for the communist state, including suspension of the joint South Korea-U.S. military exercise "Team Spirit," he said. Earlier Wednesday, Kim met with South Korean correspondents in New York and denied press reports that he had said it would not be a problem even if North Korea possessed two or three nuclear weapons. Kim reportedly told the WASHINGTON TIMES that if North Korea had two or three nuclear weapons, it wouldn't be much of a problem considering that the United States has more than 20,000. Kim's alleged remark, made in an interview with the times and picked up by the South Korean press, has had political repercussions back home. Calling the report groundless, Kim apparently wanted to clarify his statement. "North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons is unacceptable under any circumstances," he said. "If it already has, it (Pyongyang) has to abandon it." The United States should try and accommodate North Korea's wish to establish diplomatic ties in order to resolve the nuclear issue, Kim said. He recommended a package deal between Washington and Pyongyang to solve all problems at once, as has been proposed by North Korea. Kim Tae-chung also denied he had proposed that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter be sent to Pyongyang as a special envoy of President Bill Clinton. He said he had only suggested that an unofficial envoy be sent to Pyongyang but only after thorough consultations with the Seoul government for the efficiency of the sending. In his Korea Society speech, Kim Tae-chung said "the use of the China card" is crucial in resolving the nuclear row. If North Korea refused to accept a proposal for a package solution, China would face enormous international pressure to join in UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea, he said.
