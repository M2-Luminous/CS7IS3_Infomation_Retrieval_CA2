FR941220-1-00046 FR941220-1-00009 The Agency used Federal Reporting Data System (FRDS) data to determine how many people lived in an average system in each system size category. EPA used U.S. Census Bureau population and fertility data to estimate that 1.68% of the people were infants and 16.4% of the people were new residents. Recent census data put the average number of people per household at 2.6. The number of travelers needing Alternative Water was derived from information from the National Travel Data Center that there are approximately 1.27 billion person-trips made nationally each year. The number of traveling persons exposed is calculated by multiplying the estimated 250 million people served by all water systems with the probability that a traveler will visit a system with water containing sulfate levels exceeding the MCL. The probability that a traveler will visit such a system is calculated by dividing the resident population in a given system size category by the total resident population of all systems. This value is then multiplied by the number of person trips and divided by five (the number of person trips per year per traveler) to get the population of exposed travelers in that size category. The resulting estimate is that approximately 1 million travelers are exposed to sulfate in excess of 500 mg/L. For the public education and notification requirements, the PWS is responsible for producing and delivering pamphlets according to EPA's public notification guidelines. The number of pamphlets needed per size category is calculated based on the population served by the PWS. Larger population centers will contain more medical facilities. For example, if size category 1 (25&hyph;100 people) serves 0.03% of the total population, it is also assumed to serve 0.03% of the nation's 6,634 hospitals, 83,425 schools, and so on. The number of permanent signs per system is calculated by taking the number of hotels, campgrounds, interstate rest areas, rest rooms in restaurants and gas stations in the nation and multiplying by the percent of population served by each size category. The national annualized cost of the rule for the four options is shown in Table 8.

For costing purposes, it was assumed that all systems were community water systems, since transient systems do not have households. For Option 1, costs increase for systems serving populations greater than 3,300 due to the fact that most of those systems would choose central treatment. Costs level off and decrease for systems serving populations greater than 10,000 due to economies of scale.

On the basis of these estimated costs, EPA concludes that the options being considered would be economically feasible, and requests comment on this conclusion. 3. Assumptions Used to Estimate Benefits The Agency made assumptions for estimating the benefits of diarrhea cases avoided which included affected population, costs of medical care, and value of days lost to care givers, business travelers and vacationers.
