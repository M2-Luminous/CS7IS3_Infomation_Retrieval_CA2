Under these arrangements, a Security Council resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque that will meet the Palestinian minimum demands will be issued. This will be followed by a declaration from PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat that the PLO is ready to return to the negotiations, provided Israel will be committed to implementing the clauses of the Security Council resolution with guarantees from both the United States and Russia. The second step will be the arrival in Tunis of a quadripartite Egyptian-Norwegian-U.S.-Russian delegation. The delegation will include Egyptian Foreign Ministry under secretary Nabil Fahmi, Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Terry Larsen [name as received], U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross, and Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Ivanov. They will meet with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, fly to Tel Aviv to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, then return once again to Tunis to meet with 'Arafat to lay down the final formula for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. Following the meeting, 'Arafat will announce the PLO's approval to join the talks to be held in Washington. The Palestinian sources further disclosed that the PLO leadership in the past three days has come under enormous pressure from various parties, so much so that it was hard for 'Arafat to catch his breath in between the various calls he received from Arab and international quarters. 'Arafat received two calls from U.S. Coordinator Dennis Ross and another call from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. According to the same sources, these calls centered on the Security Council resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The United States wants the Palestinians not to insist on adding a special paragraph in the resolution referring to East Jerusalem as an occupied territory. Faced with the Palestinians' insistence on their position, the United States told the PLO that it would state reservations about this paragraph or would abstain from voting, since the Security Council members will vote on the resolution paragraph by paragraph. Washington has told the PLO that it does not object to the remaining paragraphs or clauses in the draft resolution. The third step envisages a meeting in Washington between Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], director of the PLO's Economic Department; and Uri Savir, Israeli Foreign Ministry Director General to discuss the security measures that need to be taken in the occupied territories as well as other issues related to the Palestinian police that will take over immediately after the withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Gaza and Jericho. This will be followed by a meeting in Washington between Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, PLO Executive Committee member. The fourth and last step under this scenario, as seen by observers, will be a summit meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin in Washington in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton. 'Arafat received a message from Christopher yesterday in which he proposed a timetable for resuming the self-rule talks according to what he termed a package deal under which the PLO would announce its return to the negotiations. In return, the United States would back a paragraph in the Security Council resolution on guaranteeing the protection and safety of Palestinians in the occupied territories and abstain from voting on a paragraph related to the status of East Jerusalem. Christopher proposed to send U.S. Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross and his team to both Tunis and Israel soon to consult with 'Arafat and the Israeli officials, provided the two sides pledge not to raise any new conditions regarding the resumption of talks. Christopher also proposed that the PLO send a high-level representative to Washington to meet with Israeli representatives to hold negotiations, provided these representatives are authorized to negotiate over the security matters that surfaced following the Hebron massacre. Christopher proposed a meeting between Abu-Mazin and Peres in Washington on 18 March to resume the talks and reach an agreement on the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. Such an agreement would be signed by 'Arafat and Rabin. In his reply to Christopher, 'Arafat accepted his proposals in principle so as to expedite a Security Council resolution and reach an understanding between the two sides over measures for protecting the Palestinians in the occupied territories. 'Arafat accepted Christopher's invitation to Palestinian negotiators to meet with their Israeli counterparts in Washington the day after tomorrow, Monday, to endorse the understanding that the Palestinians will reach with Ross during his forthcoming trip to Tunis. 'Arafat stressed that these measures must precede the resumption of the talks, which would begin with a meeting between Peres and Abu-Mazin. 'Arafat also hoped that the United States would not abstain from voting on some clauses of the Security Council resolutions, since this would conflict with the policy of the United States, which has previously recognized East Jerusalem as part of the occupied territories.
