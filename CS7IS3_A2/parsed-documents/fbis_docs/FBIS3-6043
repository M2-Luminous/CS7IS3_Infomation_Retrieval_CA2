The farmers expect to seek approval soon from the Hokkaido Prefectural Government on the proposed establishment of a regional cooperative, separate from an existing national network of agricultural cooperatives. More than 100 farmers are likely to join the new cooperative. Under present plans, the cooperative will sell South Korean fertilizers at 900 yen per 20-kilogram bag, instead of the 1,500 yen charged by existing cooperatives, the farmers said. Some farmers have complained about the allegedly high prices existing cooperatives charge for animal feed and fertilizers.
