The government will continue to support this vital industry, he said during the weekend. The Trust Agency is making good progress in its effort to find a buyer. The point is now to find new markets for Eko-Stahl's products and guarantee it a secure future. Rexrodt said his ministry was in close touch with the European Commission in Brussels to enable Eko-Stahl to be modernized and privatized as quickly as possible. The Economics Ministry will answer all European Commission questions regarding the Italian Riva Group's abandonment of its bid to take over Eko-Stahl, and other questions regarding privatization. Trust Agency spokesman Wolf Schoede said that the Trust Agency will continue efforts toward a rapid privatization, thus contradicting earlier statements whereby the government would not put Eko-Stahl up for sale during the next parliamentary term of office. According to Schode, Eko-Stahl is "on the way to modernization." With a private investor, the steel plant could be led toward a new economic growth. Eko-Stahl must not be condemned to a situation where, as a state enterprise, it is forced to compete ever more harshly against private industry. Unless it gains strategic partners, Eko-Stahl is doomed in any case, said Scvhoede. The European Union will hardly grant funds for Eko-Stahl's modernization if the government maintains its grasp on the firm for the next four years. Following the Riva pullout, the Trust Agency is seeking a new investor for Eko-Stahl. Of the German steel plants, Krupp/Hoesch and Preussag have already said no. Only Thyssen continues to be interested in a share in Eko-Stahl, provided other investors also take out a share. As a result, French steel producers are also being approached to see if they are interested a in a share in Eko-Stahl. A particularly controversial project is the planned construction of a rolling mill costing 1 billion German marks for the purpose of converting Eko-Stahl into a self-contained steel plant. In order to fulfill the requirements of the European Commission, a buyer would probably have to purchase Riva's production quotas, because the Italian steel producer, at its Hennigsdorf plant, is the only steel facility in eastern Germany with the appropriate warm-production capacity. Apparently, other steel plants are only prepared to continue the cold-steel rolling process in Eko-Stahl, whereby 1,000 of the present 3,000 jobs could be preserved.
