[Mock] As far as I know, Germany is the only founding country that has been a net payer right from the beginning. However, the Germans recognize that they benefit most. I am often asked: "If we are net payers now, we will hopefully also be net receivers at some time in the future." I always answer to that: "Yes, when we are poor." [Unterberger] Why do net payers benefit most? [Mock] The net payers have a very dynamic economy and, therefore, they can get the maximum out of the large market. [Unterberger] The Greens say that it will be the end of neutrality if we join the EU. [Mock] Of course, this is wrong. Neutrality derives from what is set down in our neutrality law. This law is fully compatible with the rights and duties that we take over as a result of membership. This is the opinion of the government, it is the opinion of all experts, with the exception of one, who has registered doubts regarding the issue of economic sanctions. This is also the view of Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland. [Unterberger] And how will the special problem of economic sanctions be solved? [Mock] I am of the view that the issue of sanctions was only part of neutrality policy (which is not settled by the Constitution -- the editor). Neutrality is reflected in certain regulations, from the penal code to the Military Materiel Law. [Unterberger] Thus, these application laws must be amended? [Mock] Yes, either one amends these laws or one clarifies matters from a constitutional perspective. However, in case of doubt I prefer the former, which means that things would be done similarly to what was done in the case of Iraq and Kuwait. [Unterberger] When we permitted overflights on the basis of UN decisions in January 1991? [Mock] Yes. [Unterberger] If all goes well, you will sit at a table with 12 or 15 other ministers on 2 January 1995 What is your priority, what are our goals with regard to a common foreign and security policy? [Mock] My priority is to contribute to making a common foreign and security policy a reality in the first place, because the more quickly it is established, the more effective it will be. In terms of content, it is certainly the issue of the former Yugoslavia that is a priority, where it is important to bring about at least a cease-fire. Then there is the issue of a coherent policy toward Central and Eastern Europe and of partnership with the United States and Canada. These are the priorities. Even though it is not a priority, it is also important to show through relations with the developing countries that we are not just an egotistical association. And then there is, of course, the East Asia-Pacific area, which is already a focal area in international economic relations. [Unterberger] Will you be able to vote freely in a common foreign and security policy and in the EU Council of Foreign Ministers, which is the most important body of the EU, or are you bound by a mandate from Vienna? [Mock] In my view, if things are not settled differently, I am politically responsible to the Austrian parliament, just as I am obligated to turn to the Austrian Government, if the matter at hand is something that has to be discussed by the government.
