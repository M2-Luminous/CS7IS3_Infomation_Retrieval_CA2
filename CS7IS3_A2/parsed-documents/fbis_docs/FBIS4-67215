However, the police are still looking for 11 tons of hashish and three suspects. With their massive raid Sunday [3 April] morning the police and custom officials had hoped to crush one of the best-organized hashish organizations in Denmark once and for all. Having monitored the gang's activities in their rooms, the police knew that the gang members were going to try to smuggle 12.5 tons of Moroccan hashish into Denmark, but when the police raided the container ship Hela at Helnas Bay the morning of Easter Sunday, only 1.5 tons of hashish was found. The police do not know what happened to the rest of the huge shipment beyond the fact that some of it was dumped at sea. Some of it might have been smuggled ashore before the ship reached shallow waters in southwestern Fyn bay during the night before Sunday. [passage omitted] Over the next few days the police will search the bottom of Helnas Bay with a fine-tooth comb looking for the hashish which had been tossed overboard, and they are urging everybody in the area to keep an eye out for summerhouses that have unusual visitors.
