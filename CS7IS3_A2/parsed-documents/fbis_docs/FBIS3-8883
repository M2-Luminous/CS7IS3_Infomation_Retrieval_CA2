[Correspondent Anna Samelova] President Michal Kovac has just finished his address to the new Slovak Government. I shall acquaint you with the most important ideas in his speech. At the beginning, President Michal Kovac said that, even if governmental changes were a natural part of the political life of democratic countries, the Slovak Republic was still too young a state not to experience every such change with particular sensitivity and tension. He told the new Cabinet ministers that, apart from fulfilling the duties deriving from their offices, they would have to calm a population that had been made to feel insecure, and they would have to conciliate the incomprehensible and dangerous hostility among various groups of citizens. He went on to say--I quote: You have entered the government I am inaugurating today on the basis of the agreement made among a number of political groups. You represent a very broad spectrum of views. Within the extremes of this spectrum, there is something that you all can and must share--protecting the interests of the young Slovak state and the substantial majority of its population. You must make the Slovak Republic a recognized part and a reliable partner of democratic Europe as soon as possible. You must enable the citizens to provide a comfortable life as soon as possible, without worrying about the bare necessities of life. In the next part of his speech, President Kovac asked the members of the government not to think of their inauguration as starting from zero. Rather, they should preserve the continuity of the government and the state and become the guarantee of this continuity. They should become a government that does not want to abolish but, rather, create, one that wants to continue everything worthwhile done by the previous government. In this connection, Kovac went on to say that the Slovak parliament disagreed with the autocratic style of the prime minister and some members of the previous government, refuted the significant trend toward the concentration of power, and made a stand for the protection of democracy and morality in political life. This, however, does not mean, President Kovac said, that the good results of the previous government and its prime minister and everything useful that they did for the Slovak citizens should be discredited. The president then thanked Vladimir Meciar and his government for every positive step of his Cabinet and praised, in particular, the merits of Vladimir Meciar for the creation of the Slovak Republic's state sovereignty. He also said it was a good sign that the political representatives of our Hungarian fellow citizens had also expressed support for the new government and, in this way, had declared their loyalty to the Slovak Republic. This makes it possible to implement a political line that would enable all groups among the citizens of Slovakia to see the new government as their own. The circumstances in which this government has been formed and the current political reality, President Kovac went on to say, establishes as one of the government's most important tasks the securing of a dignified and calm run-up to the elections in such a way as to remove any possible doubts about democracy in the Slovak Republic. President Michal Kovac then described three conditions for creating a favorable--i.e., peaceful--atmosphere in our society. One of them is the cooperation of all constitutional institutions--the president, the government, and the parliament. The second is proper relations between the government and the opposition and their mutual respect. The third is the cooperation of the government with the state administration on lower levels, without insensitive and directive interference from above. Of equal importance are proper relations with the institutions of local self-administration. According to Kovac, the first condition for creating a positive image about Slovakia at home and abroad, as an attractive state with good prospects, is to put public life at home in order. The president said he believed that the new government would recognize its great opportunity to send an important and long-awaited signal abroad that Slovakia was a consolidated and stable country, that its democratic character could create a good foundation for all-round, useful cooperation with every serious political or commercial partner. The president said at the end--I quote: The citizens of the Slovak Republic deserve a good government that gives preference to their interests over the interests of influential egoists. They deserve a government that caters for a peaceful life for all citizens without any preference, whichever political camp they belong to or even if they belong to no political camp. You have the opportunity and also the duty to become such a government. With this trust, I have given you today the letters of appointment as members of the Slovak Government, and, with this trust, I wish you professional and personal happiness, that citizens understand all of your decisions, and that, in the shortest time possible, the population name you the government of successful cooperation. With these words President Michal Kovac ended his speech.
