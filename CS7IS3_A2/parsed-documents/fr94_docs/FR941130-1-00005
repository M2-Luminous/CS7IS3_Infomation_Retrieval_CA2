FR941130-1-00005 FR941130-1-00001 All of these changes are designed to enhance the administration and functioning of the marketing agreement and order to the benefit of the industry. If implemented, these amendments might impose some costs on affected handlers and producers. However, the added burden on small entities, if present at all, would not be significant because the benefits of the proposed amendments are expected to outweigh the costs. The amendments proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. They are not intended to have retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the amendments. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

Chapter 35], any additional handler reporting and recordkeeping requirements, including any new reports and the two succeeding fiscal periods record retention, that might result from the proposed amendments would be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The provisions would not be effective until receiving OMB approval.
