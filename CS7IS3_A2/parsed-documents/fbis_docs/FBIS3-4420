The mountainous southern areas are far from towns and suffer from backward transport, farming methods and education. Lacking supplies of piped water and electricity, these areas also suffer serious soil erosion and frequent natural disasters. They also have a large number of mentally retarded people and people disabled by endemic diseases. Statistics show that the residents of these areas have a per capita net income of below 300 yuan (about 30 U.S. dollars) a year, and have long depended on relief funds and grain from the central government. According to local officials, the province will earmark more money in the coming seven years for the building of farmland conservancy works, projects for providing drinking water to local residents and livestock and for the installation of more transmission lines of electricity for these areas. At the same time, they will also be urged to plant more trees, and strengthen the harnessing of small rivers, in a bid to improve the environment for agriculture and to make the local residents in these areas become self-sufficient in grain. Efforts will also be made to encourage local farmers become market-conscious and grow more cash crops. The farmers will also be encouraged to set up more rural and township enterprises near town and county seats and along highways, with the purpose of tapping natural resources in their localities. In addition, the province will implement on a trial basis the policy of letting economic entities, cadres and other individuals contract the construction of help-the-poor projects in the southern areas so as to make more residents in the poverty-hit areas get well-off as soon as possible.
