Seshan, the Government has decided to bring a Constitution amendment Bill during the current session of Parliament. The Bill is intended to make the functioning of the multi-member Election Commission well-defined and effective. The draft of the proposed Constitution amendment Bill has already been finalized by the Union Law Ministry and is expected to be circulated to leaders of all political parties soon. Besides amending the Constitution, the Union Government is also contemplating changing the Representation of People's Act [RPA], 1950, regarding the definition of the term, "ordinarily resident," which makes it mandatory for a Rajya Sabha member to belong to a State from where he is elected. The proposed Constitution amendment regarding the functioning of the Election Commission consists of three points: - Equate other Election Commissioners with the Chief Election Commissioner in the matter of their removal from office - Provide for the conduct of the business of the Election Commission - Provide for a prohibition as to the holding of office by members of the commission after ceasing to be such members. By these amendments, the Union Government wanted to equate the other Election Commissioners with the Chief Election Commissioner by making their appointments to last a full term, unless nullified by an impeachment motion in Parliament. The business of the Election Commission would provide clear-cut guidelines regarding the functioning of the Election Commissioners, who, after the amendment, could act as a check and balance against any unilateral decision taken by the CEC [Chief Election Commissioner]. The amendment to the RPA, regarding the redefining of "ordinarily resident" status for the Rajya Sabha members was necessitated as several members of the ruling party, including some Ministers, were facing inquiries by the Election Commission on the basis of this clause in the RPA. That the Government has taken a decision on a Constitution amendment Bill regarding the functioning of the Election Commission was indicated today to some leaders of the Opposition parties, although informally, by the Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Mr V.C. Shukla, during an informal luncheon meeting convened by the Lok Sabha Speaker, Mr Shivraj Patil. The Opposition members, specially those from the Left, objected to the Government's decision to redefine the ordinary resident status by changing the RPA. They, however, agreed to the proposed Constitution amendment Bill on the functioning of the EC, provided the Government also went in for one or more Bills to have a comprehensive electoral reform. Sources said that the Opposition parties did not want that a signal be sent that Parliament was eager to clip the wings of Mr Seshan by bringing in a Constitution amendment. The Opposition parties were also of the opinion that while a Bill pertaining to electoral reforms was welcome during the current session of Parliament, the process should involve all the major political parties in the country.
