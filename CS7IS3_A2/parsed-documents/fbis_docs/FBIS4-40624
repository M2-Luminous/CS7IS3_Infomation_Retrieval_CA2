It will be remembered that the acting prosecutor-general claims in his representation that Zhirinovskiy's book "The Last Leap to the South" is liable to criminal prosecution. The report by Kovalev provoked a lively response from legislators. For instance, Deputy Andrey Dorovskiy from the LDPR group insisted that lawmakers should vote to return the representation by Ilyushenko who, in the deputy's opinion, had no powers to sign such a document, since he "was not approved as prosecutor-general". Another proposal -- to put the item on the representation on the session's agenda -- did not pass either: The motion was short of 20 votes.
