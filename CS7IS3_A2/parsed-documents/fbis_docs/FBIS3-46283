MAC said that even if the talks do not result in any agreement, they will not be considered a failure. Under the circumstances, MAC officials said they found no reasons for Chiao to meet with high-ranking Communist Chinese officials. MAC noted that there are varied opinions whether Chiao should meet with the head of the mainland's Office of Taiwan Affairs. However, many opinions on Taiwan indicate that Chiao could face a backlash from the opposition party on Taiwan if such a meeting were held.
