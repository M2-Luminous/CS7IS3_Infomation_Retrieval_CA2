During yesterday's working-level contact with the United States, North Korea proposed a peace agreement in exchange of the conditional acceptance of additional inspections. The United States did not accept the proposal. The following is a report by Chon Yo-ok: [Begin recording] [Chon] In its attempt to provide a breakthrough in the relations with the United States blocked by the nuclear issue, North Korea suddenly proposed to replace the current Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement at yesterday's working-level contact. The U.S. State Department plainly refused North Korea's proposal judging that it was intended to directly deal with the U.S. military representatives instead of the Military Armistice Commission. After the contact, North Korea invited all foreign correspondents based in the PRC, except the ROK press corps, and held a news conference at the North Korean Embassy in China today strongly denouncing the United States. [Pae Yong-chae, acting North Korean ambassador to China, identified by caption] The United States has unilaterally abrogated what was agreed upon in the Korean Armistice Agreement since it was signed in July 1953, and has introduced modern weapons, including over 1,000 nuclear weapons, into South Korea. [Chon] [passage omitted] The appeasement gesture made by Pak Kil-yon, North Korean ambassador to the United Nations, saying that Pyongyang is ready to exceptionally allow additional inspections, was aimed at having a direct dialogue with the United States by proposing a peace agreement. North Korea's sudden change of attitude clearly reflects the limit of its unreasonable diplomatic policy in trying to solve everything with the only card -- the nuclear issue. [end recording]
