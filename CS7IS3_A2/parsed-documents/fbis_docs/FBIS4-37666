In his opinion, the Rwandan agreement is a "botched job." Explanations. [Smith] Everyone is expressing satisfaction with the cease-fire proclaimed in Rwanda. Is it not a success for Africa? [Bongo] Frankly, I say no. Because the resolution which has been adopted is void of meaning. It does not say when the cease-fire will come into effect, nor when the extra Blue Helmets will arrive in Kigali. Nor does it specify when political negotiations will begin and, finally, it says nothing concrete about picking up the Arusha accords again, signed by the late President Habyarimana and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebels. In fact, it contains nothing more than recommendations. It is not enough. Africa should have stated, very explicitly, what it was demanding and should have given itself the resources to impose this on the warring parties. [Smith] So you did not vote for the resolution? [Bongo] No, it was adopted without my vote and in my absence. With the support of other heads of state, I then made a counterproposal. But apparently it was to late. [Smith] A year ago, at the previous African summit, a "mechanism to prevent, manage, and settle regional conflicts" was set up. What has become of it? [Bongo] In practice, alas, this settlement instrument does not intervene. Perhaps if our new acting chairman (Tunisian President Ben Ali) goes at it with his customary determination, it will become operational. But if not, it will be yet something else which will not work. [Smith] Is there not a problem of the changing of the guard in French-speaking Africa? Whenever there is a serious crisis, there are only the old hands, like you, General Eyadema, or Marshal Mobutu, who are present? What about the "La Baule generation" of new African leaders? [Bongo] They are only just coming on board. They have to learn. One cannot intervene, here or there, without knowing how. Give them time. I am sure that, in two or three years' time, they will know. Then it is going to be very tough for... [Smith] ...The West? [Bongo] ...For our interlocutors. There is not just the West. [Smith] South Africa, the big hope, on the one hand, and Rwanda, the drama, on the other. Between these two poles, where is Africa going? [Bongo] I believe that Africa will move toward the South African model. Because what we have there -- from Mandela's freeing by De Klerk to the election of a former prisoner as president -- is a democratic lesson which many of us ought to have applied a long time ago, in particular in the way we treat our opposition. In Rwanda, the logic of coup d'etats still reigns. It is always "Get out of there, so I take your place..." President Habyarimana did not die in an accident. He was assassinated. But if the cease-fire holds, we must deploy a peacekeeping force, evacuate the children, and begin negotiations for an interim government, until elections can be held.
