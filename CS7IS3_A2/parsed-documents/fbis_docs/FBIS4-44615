JPRS-CST-93-018, 16 Nov 93 p 20] [Summary] The JHW-I concealed laser [active] IR night-vision system, with applications in public security, defense, banking, and industry, was developed by the CAS Institute of Semiconductors' State Optoelectronic Devices Engineering Research Center. It consists of the center's own high-power laser diode light source, an IR camera, a remote-controlled power supply, and B&W monitoring equipment. This system, which eliminates red exposure, has a light-source power consumption of 3 W and an effective range of over 100 meters. For firms wishing to begin production of this system, equipment investment costs are 200,000 yuan, annual output is 100 units, annual output value is 3 million yuan, and annual profit should be between 500,000 and 1 million yuan.
