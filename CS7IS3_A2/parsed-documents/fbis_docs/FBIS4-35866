The new government has yet to receive Israel's blessing. Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin is demanding that Israel cool its ties with Italy in the wake of the appointments. Italy's Jewish community is opposed to such a move. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen reports on the controversy: [Begin recording] [Rosen] Today the world should hear Israel loud and clear, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin said. He suggests taking resolute steps toward chillier relations with Italy following the appointment of neofascist ministers to the Berlusconi cabinet. Israel did not applaud Italy's political upheaval, and Rabin has deliberately refrained from congratulating the new prime minister. Beilin has already ordered a freeze on the departure of a delegation to a cultural conference. [Beilin] Obviously, we cannot take a light view of this. It is the first time a party with neofascist elements is participating in a European government. [Rosen] Beilin's adamant position is opposed by many Italian Jews, as well as members of the professional Foreign Ministry echelons who believe Israel should wait and judge the neofascist ministers on the basis of their actions and pronouncements as of now.
