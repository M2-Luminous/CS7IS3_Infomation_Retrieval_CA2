FR940603-2-00162 FR940603-2-00092 Title III projects have been directed toward educating owners and operators of restaurants and bars, hotels and motels, retail stores, grocery stores, professional offices, recreation and fitness centers, museums and other places of collection, travel and tour agents, hospitals and health care providers, service providers for elderly persons, day care centers, small shops and stores, and large commercial properties. Title II projects have worked toward educating mayors and governing bodies of U.S. cities with populations over 30,000 and towns with populations under 10,000, law enforcement agencies, 911/emergency response operators, state courts, state social service agencies, public libraries, and persons involved in testing for licensure and certification purposes. While some projects have focused on educating people with disabilities about their rights under titles II and III of the ADA, others have educated covered entities with responsibilities under the ADA on how to accommodate people with different kinds of disabilities, such as people with mobility impairments, manual impairments, hearing impairments, speech impairments, vision impairments, seizure disorders, mental retardation, mental illness, and people with cognitive, developmental, or learning disabilities. Other projects have been directed toward persons who can assist others in complying with the ADA, including professors and students in architecture, interior design, industrial design, and landscape architecture schools and programs; state and local building code officials; disability advocates; librarians; and community mediators. Several grant recipients have directed technical assistance toward persons who speak Spanish and other non-English languages. Some effective strategies used by grantees have been to integrate ADA Technical Assistance materials into established programs and the creation of an innovative project conducted on a statewide basis, that can be studied and replicated by others nationally. For example, the Police Executive Research Forum is creating a set of materials, with some material specifically developed to be integrated into police academy training and others for use in on-the-job roll-call training. The set of materials includes a series of modules on protecting the rights of persons with seizure disorders, speech and hearing impairments, and mental illness. The Chief Officers of State Library Agencies is creating a single source collection of ADA materials that will be available to the public nationwide through their local libraries. The National Association of Towns and Townships is producing ADA materials to train regional and state ADA technical assistance providers to assist them in educating officials from small towns with fewer than 10,000 residents on how to comply with the ADA. The American Association of Retired Persons will create materials and conduct training sessions throughout the country to educate older persons with disabilities about their rights under the ADA. The results of a South Carolina project, which partners different State agencies and a state-based advocacy organization for persons with mental illness to examine and correct ways in which social service and public benefit programs discriminate against persons with mental illness, will be disseminated nationwide. A description of all projects, including a list of materials that have been or are being produced by grant recipients, may be obtained by calling 1&hyph;800&hyph;514&hyph;0301 (Voice) or 1&hyph;800&hyph;514&hyph;0383 (TTY) or the electronic bulletin board at (202) 514&hyph;6193. Applicants should be aware that the Department does not fund projects to research or resolve issues that are outside the scope of the Department's current ADA regulations and court interpretations. For example, the Department would not fund a project concerning the design of accessible physical environments for children because standards have not yet been adopted by the Department in this area. Only proposals to conduct projects of national scope or significance will be considered. For example, a professional or trade association at the national level that proposes to target educational information to its membership nationwide might be funded. A local or state trade association with no national affiliation or reach would not be funded, unless the local or state group could adequately demonstrate its ability to draw national attention to, and participation in, its project. The Department is particularly interested in receiving proposals that: specifically address how members of minority communities will be included within the population targeted by the applicant for receipt of technical assistance; reflect an ability to begin project activities in an expedited manner; utilize materials already developed by Federal agencies and their grantees or contractors; represent joint ventures between organizations that represent persons with disabilities and organizations that provide services that may assist covered entities in their compliance efforts; and engage national membership organizations in supporting the project's objectives. Eligible Applicants. This grant competition is open to individuals and to non-profit organizations, including trade and professional associations or their subsidiaries, organizations representing State and local governments or their employees, other organizations representing entities covered by the ADA, State and local government agencies, and national and local organizations representing persons with disabilities.
