Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said the investigations will continue. [Begin recording] [de Greiff] We are studying that. Msgr. Paolo Romeo argues his point, and the Attorney General's Office says the Concordat is not in effect. We must study these things in detail and make a decision at the proper time. [Unidentified reporter] Will the investigations against the bishops continue? [De Greiff] Yes. [end recording] Regarding the drug legalization issue, the prosecutor general said: [Begin de Greiff recording] That is not the government's position. It is my position in light of the failure of the methods being used to fight drug trafficking by which the producing and trading counties carry all the weight, while consumer nations do very little. I think this is the only solution, but it is something that must be studied. [end recording] Regarding possible U.S. reactions to his position, de Greiff said: [Begin de Greiff recording] I do not think they would be as imperialistic as to do that. Nevertheless, if they did it, we would judge them. [end recording]
