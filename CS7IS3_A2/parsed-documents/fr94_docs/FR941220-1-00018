Part 4 covers submittal of timely reports and investigation by the Coast Guard. In addition, under the current regulations, U.S. flag vessels are required to report a marine casualty, to the Coast Guard, regardless of the jurisdiction in which the casualty occurs. However, current Coast Guard regulations do not require foreign flag vessels to report any marine casualty, such as a non-operational discharge of oil, when operating in waters beyond the navigable waters of the United States.
