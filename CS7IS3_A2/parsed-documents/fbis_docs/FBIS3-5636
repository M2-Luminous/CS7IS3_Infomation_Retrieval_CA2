After the contact, the head of our side's delegation gave a news conference to domestic and foreign reporters on the spot and explained the details of the contact. Our side stressed a need to break at all cost the deadlock [kyochak sangtae] of the working-level contact and conclude the discussions on the agenda items at this time. It once again urged the South side to manifest first its clear position on the demand -- raised by our side at the fourth contact -- that it discontinue all large-scale nuclear war exercises against the dialogue partner, an obstacle to the exchange of special envoys; abandon the antinational international cooperation system; withdraw the plan to introduce Patriot missiles and other new types of weapons; and cancel the South's remarks that it cannot shake hands with the dialogue partner. Our side pointed out that the North-South exchange of special envoys will not be able to proceed in a favorable atmosphere if the South does not manifest its clear position on this four-point demand and that even if special envoys are exchanged, just like the previous dialogues which underwent twists and turns, the dialogue will become a nominal [yumyongmusil] dialogue that will results in its discontinuation, resumption, and breakup [kyollyol] and that this would disappoint all fellow countrymen. Out of a desire to immediately conclude discussions on procedural matters for the exchange of special envoys and exchange special envoys at the earliest possible date, it presented a new momentous amendment to the Agreement on the Exchange of Top-Level Envoys Between the North and the South, an amendment that takes the South side's view into full consideration. Our side's amendment proposal includes detailed matters such as the rank of the special envoys of both sides, their accompanying personnel [tonghaeng inwon], the tasks of special envoys and the mode of their exchange, the date of their exchange and the timetable of their stay, procedures of their travels and security arrangements, reporters' news coverage and the provision of conveniences to reporters. He proposed that special envoys of the two sides be authoritative and responsible high-ranking officials appointed by the top authorities of the North and the South and be accompanied by about 10 aides and six reporters, that the South side's envoy visit Pyongyang within 15 days from the date an agreement is reached, and our side's envoy visit Seoul within 15 days from the last day of the South side's envoy's Pyongyang visit, and that each side's envoy visit the other side for three nights and four days. Duties of the envoys presented in our side's draft of agreement that was revised and supplemented include discussions on the implementation of the Joint Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, joint measures to be taken immediately to implement the North-South agreement, pending issues of mutual interest, and a meeting between the top authorities of the North and the South. In addition to these, issues on the easing of tensions between the North and the South, the maintenance of national self-reliance [minjok chajusong], the promotion of the great national unity, and the method to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland are presented in detail in our side's draft. These issues are not included in that of the South side. The epochal [hoekkijogin] draft of agreement revised by our side is a fair one that was made by taking the South side's intent into consideration. It is also a reasonable one that will enable the envoy exchange to help make practical improvements to North-South relations and opening a new phase in resolving the country's reunification issue. In today's contact, our side repeatedly urged the South side to express a satisfactory [naptukhalmanhan] attitude in any form toward the four just demands we made to hasten a complete solution to problems regarding practical procedure [silmu cholcha munjerul wanjonhi kyolsokchikko] and to realize an exchange of envoys as soon as possible. In the contact, the South side, instead of expressing a clear attitude toward our principled demands before discussing practical issues, repeated absurd remarks that create obstacles and are unnecessary, creating obstacles to the discussions on issues. The South side even deliberately raised an issue that has no relation to the discussions on the practical procedure and blemish the atmosphere of the talks, assuming an extremely provocative attitude. Immediately raising such absurd remarks and acts by the South side as an issue, our side has branded them as its declaration to give up the working-level contact and sternly warned against it. The South side, which was at a loss for answers, has attempted to make an excuse for its wrong act. Regarding the South side's remarks that it has never conducted, even one time, a large-scale nuclear war exercise, our side maintained that this is a preposterous sophistry, and that this is not an attitude of dialogue, but rather an attitude of continuously pursuing a position of confrontation. Our side said that the South side's attempt to not accept our side's just demand that it give up the international cooperation system shows that the South side gives priority to outside forces over the nation, and that it admits itself to the nature of its dependency upon outside forces and anti-national position. Also, our side stressed that if the South side continues pursuing the international cooperation system with the backing of outside forces, it will raise the grave consequence in which our nation can fall a victim of great powers. Our side said: In its character, the exchange of the North-South special envoys must succeed if it is prepared. It must also satisfy the expectation of our nation as a sincere and fruitful dialogue. If the exchange of special envoys is either suspended or broken once again -- like other dialogues in the past -- by the nuclear war exercise or any other factors after it began, it will be difficult to hold the North-South dialogue again. Although the South side regrets its act at a time when the North-South dialogue is not held, an opportunity would never come again. Based on the sincere position to overcome, by any means, the prevailing obstacles and to conclude the working-level contact, our side has proposed a tete-a-tete contact between the heads of the two side. Following this, the contact between the heads of the two sides was held. The North and South side have agreed to hold the next sixth round of their working-level contact at the South side's area of Panmunjom on 12 March.
