In the operation, four hijackers took over a Ghana Airways plane carrying about 80 passengers and a crew of four at the Accra Airport. The hijackers made certain demands, including the stepping down of the government. THE PIONEER says the operation was ill-conceived and ill-motivated because apart from causing fear and panic, it amounted to putting bad ideas in the minds of certain sections of the society.
