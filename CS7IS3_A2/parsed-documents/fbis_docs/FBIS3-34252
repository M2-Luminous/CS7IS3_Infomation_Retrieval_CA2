Are you satisfied with the results of this visit? [Husayn] Praise be to God. Personally, my medical results are very satisfactory, according to what doctors told me. I need another checkup after six months, and then an annual checkup, as is the case with anybody. Praise be to God, the results are good. On the official level, my meetings with the U.S. President and the U.S. Administration were useful and addressed all important issues in this region. I felt, indeed, that there is resolve and determination to crystallize the concept of participation and turn it into joint action to reach the required results and achieve a just and comprehensive peace in this region. In our visit to Croatia, naturally, I was very happy to meet with the youth of the homeland while performing a great duty of peacekeeping as part of the international peacekeeping forces there. They have won the respect, love, and appreciation of everybody, all the parties for which they are providing security and a decent life. I believe it is a source of pride for us to know that we are the second largest force in the peacekeeping troops there, after France. This is a major role played by Jordan. This is not strange for this good country, in terms of its aspirations and objectives to see people live in freedom, dignity, and security, wherever they are. [Samawi] Your Majesty, we observed that during your talks with the U.S. Administration, there was a focus on bilateral relations. To what degree has the United States shown understanding of Jordan's needs, in terms of foreign indebtedness and inspection at al-'Aqabah Port? [Husayn] As a matter of fact, the results were satisfactory, and I felt that there is understanding and resolve to see warm relations once again. The word warm has been overused, but I mean to have good, strong relations, as they were one day, and perhaps stronger than in the past. There is a sure desire for support and backing on the part of the President and the Administration. It might take some time, but I believe the results will be satisfactory, God willing. [Samawi] After the Arab-American summit meetings and in light of this flurry of activity on the peace process, are we close to achieving peace? [Husayn] I cannot say for sure that we are that close to achieving peace, but I believe that the process is serious and I hope that we will see progress on all tracks in the coming phase. Naturally, I do not know everything about what happened in Davos, but we have to learn about all the details. There could be difficulties or obstacles from time to time, but I believe these could be overcome if everybody wants to achieve a peace that future generations accept.
