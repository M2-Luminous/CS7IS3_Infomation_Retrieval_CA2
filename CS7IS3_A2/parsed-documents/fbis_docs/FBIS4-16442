Anpilov said he feared that exercises by the Moscow OMON (special purpose police units) held a few days ago were connected with the coming May rallies organized by the opposition. In Anpilov's opinion, President Yeltsin is "morally interested in finally removing the issue of early presidential elections" in June 1994 and "needs to provoke disorders, any conflict on the streets of Moscow," in order to be able to blame the opposition. Anpilov said he was ready to discuss all aspects of the May 1 march with the Moscow authorities. The organizers of the march intend to start from Kaluzhskaya (formerly Oktyabrskaya) square at 11:00 via Yakimanka (formerly Dimitrova street), Bolshoy Kamenny Bridge, the Kremlin Embankment to Vasiliyevskiy Spusk where a festive concert is planned to be held. If the Moscow authorities do not permit this route, the organizers of the march will propose another one, from the Kaluzhskaya square to the viewing site on the Vorobiyovy (Lenin) Hills along Leninskiy Prospekt, Anpilov said. When the demonstrators disobeyed to the Moscow authorities in May 1 1993 and moved along this very route, they clashed with regular and special purpose police units. As a result of clashes, one policeman was killed, while dozens of people were injured. A criminal case was filed following the incident, but the State Duma's decision of February 23 1994 declared an amnesty for all participants. According to Anpilov, this time up to 100,000 people will attend to the demonstration. He told Interfax that Working Russia had formed an unarmed squad of its supporters to maintain order. No less than 300 members of this squad will stand by, while another thousand will be dispersed among the demonstrators. The May 1 rally will be carried out under the slogans "All Power To Workers!" and "No To The Colonization Of Russia!" In Anpilov's opinion, the May 1 rallies which will be held in all cities will be a rehearsal for a general political strike in Russia. He believes that only wide workers movement is capable of changing the political and economic course within the framework of the Constitution. However, Anpilov declined to indicate any possible dates of the general political strike.
