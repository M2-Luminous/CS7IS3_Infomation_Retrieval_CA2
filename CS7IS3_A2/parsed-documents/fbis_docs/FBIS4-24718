FBIS4-24718 "drchi105_w_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-105 Daily Report 31 May 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Lu Ping Signals Interest in Progress on Airport Lu Ping Signals Interest in Progress on Airport HK3105064494 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 31 May 94 p 1 HK3105064494 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [Text] Lu Ping, the director of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, last night signalled China's willingness to make progress on the much-delayed talks over the building of the territory's ninth container terminal and the new airport. Lu's remarks indicate a significant gesture by China to improve the atmosphere surrounding talks on economic matters. However, Lu's seeming desire for progress in talks has in the past been followed by serious backtracking. Lu told a Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce delegation in Beijing that the issue of Container Terminal 9 (CT9) should be approached "from the commercial perspective" rather than "mixing it up with political factors." Lu said, however, that China could not proceed to discussions with the British side before the Hong Kong Government had finalised arrangements with developers. He said that "economic rules", rather than "political trading" should be the guideline for building CT9. Anson Chan, the Chief Secretary, last night welcomed Lu's remarks. "We accept Lu's comment with delight but the government has never mixed the CT9 issue with any political factors. The government is now discussing development rights with consortia," she said, adding Hong Kong hoped to settle the matter as soon as possible as container terminals were very busy. Lu also said Beijing "genuinely wished" to maintain its cooperation with Britain in other areas, citing the progress made during the latest talks on the financial arrangements for the new airport project. Both sides had agreed to discuss the Airport Corporation Bill and hoped to reach a general agreement on financial arrangements. John Meredith, managing director of Hong Kong International Terminals (HIT), has said that construction costs have increased by about 20 percent as a result of the lengthy delay. Interested developers include a consortium formed by Modern Terminals Ltd (MTL), HIT, the state-owned China Ocean Shipping Corporation, and the Jardine Pacific-led Tsing Yi Container Terminal group. Turning to other matters, Lu called for an increase in the number of meetings of experts from both sides under the Joint Liaison Group (JLG). He urged the speeding up of work on localizing Hong Kong's laws, only some of which could be left until after 1997. He invited Hong Kong's "business friends" to suggest which laws had to be adapted and approved (by the JLG) as soon as possible. On the issue of permanent right of abode for returning Hong Kong emigrants, Lu said China welcomed Hong Kong returnees. He promised that China would formulate a "lenient policy" and "more simple approaches" to enable them to continue to live and work in Hong Kong.
