FR940728-0-00057 FR940728-0-00019 Nor is today's action inconsistent with AMC I's statements regarding the scope of petroleum refining activities that are outside the scope of Subtitle C. That opinion indicated that in petroleum refining operations ``(a)ny hydrocarbons that are not usable in a particular form or state are returned to an appropriate stage in the refining process so they can eventually be used. Likewise, the hydrocarbons and materials which escape from a refinery's production vessels are gathered and, by a complex retrieval system, returned to appropriate parts of the refining process.'' 824 F. 2d at 1181. Today's rule does not assert RCRA jurisdiction over any refining operations that process hydrocarbons into products, nor over hydrocarbons that are lost from process vessels and are gathered for return to refining. Rather, the Agency is stating that up to and including primary wastewater treatment, plant wastewaters are just that, and their management is potentially subject to Subtitle C controls. Oil that is recovered from wastewater, however, is no longer a solid waste, and recovered oil systems that do engage in retrieval of hydrocarbons for eventual refining are not subject to RCRA controls. 13 13 The Agency also views its action as consistent with its rulemaking involving residues from coke by-product operations that are returned to the coking process, or related processes. 57 FR 27880 (June 22, 1992). The Agency stated that such materials were not solid wastes provided they were not land disposed before reinsertion. See 40 CFR 261.4(a)(10). However, unlike the petroleum wastewaters containing small amounts of oil at issue here, the coke byproduct residues were found to be very similar to the raw material being replaced, and required no further purification to be usable. They could be inserted more or less directly into the coking or related tar-refining processes. Such residues are conceptually analogous to the purified oil coming from a petroleum slop oil facility. C. Rationale for Excluding Recovered Oil From Off-Site Sources Today's final rule, in defining the scope of recovered oil subject to the exclusion, excludes recovered oil from both off-site and on-site sources. EPA believes that recovered oil from petroleum refining, exploration and production, and transportation incident thereto, whether generated from these off-site or on-site sources, is essentially the same raw material (i.e., ``oil'') as that which is normally and routinely transported to, and inserted into, petroleum refining processes. Therefore, recovered oil from off-site sources should also be excluded when it is going to be recycled in this manner. 14 Examples of off-site sources of recovered oil include oil recovered from other petroleum refineries, and from oil and gas drilling operations. 15 14 Certain wastes from petroleum exploration, development and production are currently exempt from Subtitle C regulation under ยง261.4(b)(5). There may be a degree of overlap between the materials excluded by today's action, and materials currently exempt under ยง261.4(b)(5). See 53 FR at 25446 (July 6, 1988), 58 FR 15284 (Mar. 22, 1993), and Report to Congress, Management of Wastes from the Exploration, Development, and Production of Crude Oil, Natural Gas, and Geothermal Energy, Volumes 1&hyph;3 and Executive Summaries , December 1987, EPA/530&hyph;SW&hyph;88&hyph;003, for descriptions and clarifications of exempt and non-exempt wastes from oil and gas exploration, development, and production. 15 As noted above, recovered oil does not include ``used oil'' (as defined in 40 CFR 279.1) brought to a refinery from off-site sources. ( De minimis quantities of used oil that are incidentally captured by refinery wastewater treatment systems and subsequently recovered with other oil are not considered used oil.) See 57 FR 41566 (September 10, 1992) and 59 FR 1994 (March 4, 1994) for discussion on the scope of the definition of used oil. See also Section X.C.2 ``Used Oil'' later in this preamble. This exclusion is somewhat broader than that proposed in the January 8, 1988 notice, which would have limited the exclusion to materials generated on-site. 53 FR 525. However, the 1988 proposal would not have been limited to recovered oil, but rather would have included all oil-bearing secondary materials, so that the Agency was particularly concerned with limiting the exclusion's scope because such materials as listed sludges, tank bottoms and contaminated media could be excluded. Id . In addition, if the exclusion was to cover oil-bearing hazardous secondary materials, EPA was concerned that RCRA Section 3004(r)(2) would be rendered meaningless. Id . These concerns are no longer present when the exclusion is limited to recovered oil. The main reason for extending the exclusion to recovered oil generated at locations other than a refinery (when such oil is ultimately returned to a refinery) is that the oil is essentially the same (in terms of physical composition and potential risk) as recovered oil generated on-site. (The only significant difference is that recovered oil generated off-site is transported_in the same manner as crude oil. EPA does not regard this distinction as significant enough to warrant different regulatory status for off-site recovered oil.) The Agency thus is responding to comments received from industry, urging the Agency to extend the scope of the exclusion to certain off-site activities. However, these commenters argued further that refineries comprise but one segment of a large, integrated industry, extending from the production field, through the pipeline, to the refinery, to the marketing terminal, to tank trucks, and, ultimately, to the customer. EPA does not necessarily accept this argument, which is unnecessary to justify today's rule. Again, EPA will continue its broader policy review of the Definition of Solid Waste. EPA notes as well that the action in today's rule is not precedential for other industries. Determining what activities are a part of on-going production activities and not part of the waste disposal problem necessarily entails fact-specific evaluation. The Agency's conclusions regarding secondary materials generated by particular industries thus need not be germane to the regulatory status of secondary materials generated by other industries. V. Rationale for Conditioning the Exclusion on Recovered Oil Not Being Placed on the Land and Not Being Accumulated Speculatively This rule does not exclude land-based hazardous waste management units from which oil may be recovered. Thus, if recovered oil, or material containing oil, is placed in land-based units such as surface impoundments or land treatment units, those units remain subject to Subtitle C requirements (provided the material being placed is hazardous under RCRA). The Agency considers material placed in such units to be discarded, and hence solid wastes. See also AMC I , 824 F. 2d at n.20. These are classic disposal practices (see RCRA Section 1002(b)(7)), and placement of oily materials in such units (whether for storage, treatment, or disposal) is inconsistent with the use of the material as a valued product. In addition, the D.C. Circuit held in AMC II that materials destined for recycling were still solid wastes if held in surface impoundments before being recycled (907 F. 2d at 1186). The final condition for the exclusion to apply is that recovered oil not be accumulated speculatively (as defined in ยง261.1(c)(8)) before it is recycled back into a petroleum refining process. This is a standard condition that the Agency applies to otherwise excluded secondary materials (see, e.g., ยง261.2(e)(2)(iii)) to prevent the materials being held for prolonged periods without being recycled, with attendant increased environmental risk. See 50 FR at 634&hyph;635, 658&hyph;661 (Jan. 4, 1985). No commenter seriously questioned applying this condition. Thus, recovered oil that would otherwise be excluded that is accumulated speculatively is considered to be discarded and hence a solid waste.
