David Kyd, a spokesman of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the inspection this time would be "very important" for the UN agency to clear up allegations that the DPRK was developing nuclear weapons. The IAEA has accepted DPRK's invitation, he added. Kyd had said earlier today that the IAEA responded positively to DPRK's new offer and, provided other elements of a fresh IAEA inspection could be agreed upon, a new expert mission would leave for DPRK "before the end of this month." It was reported that the fresh inspection would focus on DPRK's Yongbyon reactor, which was started up in 1986.
