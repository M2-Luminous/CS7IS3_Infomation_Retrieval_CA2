It will now be in force from midnight to 0530, that is from 2300 to 0430 GMT, as of tomorrow, the national radio announced today. It was in force from 2100 GMT to 0430 GMT. The curfew was imposed following the disturbances that marked the reelection of President Bongo on 5 December. The results of the poll were challenged by the opposition, and the government decreed a "state of alert" marked by the curfew and banning of gatherings. This "state of alert," which was lifted on 13 February, was reimposed a week later, because of a general strike launched by a confederation of labor unions close to the opposition. The strike engendered acts of violence which resulted in the death of nine people in four days, according to official figures.
