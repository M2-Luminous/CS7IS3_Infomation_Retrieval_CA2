Home movies "with a screen measuring in square meters, which shows even the smallest details of the picture with unimagined sharpness and the whole range of colors." It will be a few years until this happens, however. Initially, the 50-man development crew at Schneider in Allgaeu presented only a prototype of the new television generation, after five years of work and expenditures amounting to double digit millions. It works with expensive gaseous lasers and needs a cooling unit the size of an armoire. Although not ready for the market for a long time yet, the technological achievement itself is described as "considerable" by entertainment electronics giants. The industry is urgently in need of innovations in order to revive the market. In Germany, after the unification boom, sales of color televisions dropped from 5.75 million units last year to no more than 5.5 million this year. Laser TVs, although not an entirely new idea, would arrive right on time. The technology sounds simple but it is bulky: Using a red-green-blue laser beam bundle, a projector shows colored images on a screen, analogous to today's picture tubes, in which electron beams are modulated by the video signal and conducted in rows across the screen. However, precisely this control is causing problems with the laser technology. What works in the picture tube with changing magnetic fields does not work with laser light. It can be done with mechanical methods, such as mirrors, but the required speeds are extremely high. With an ordinary television picture the pixels write 25 times 625 rows per second, equalling 15,624 times across the screen. For HDTV [high-definition television] or flickerless 100-Hertz images, which are the future particularly for large-screen projection, they must be twice as fast. Schneider's R&D chief, Guenther Elster, and project leader Christhard Deter insist that they have mastered these technologies. However, the micromechanical know-how will not be revealed until all patents have been secured. It is conceivable that small polygons will be used as mirrors, which rotate or swing around their axis. This beam-deflection technique requires intermediate storage of the image information in a digital memory, which passes them on in correspondingly modified timing to the laser. A great deal must still be done, above all for the laser technology. Only semiconductor-diode lasers can offer small size and low prices per unit. They have proved themselves in large-scale technology, for example in CD systems. "For the colors red and green the light intensities obtained today are already in the range of data specified for multilaser projection technology," says Professor Gunther Krieg, Dr. of engineering. For blue-light systems, however, "solutions can only be expected in the next two years." Thus, the first projection units in video recorder format for DM 3,000 could be available three years from now, at the earliest, in the opinion of Hans-Juergen Thaus. Middle-size enterprises do not have the staying-power and, above all, the financial strength to develop laser projection until it is ripe for the market. Schneider is therefore looking for partners in the industry, but there is mostly skepticism. Many contracting parties have already been involved with similar technologies but given up. At least half a dozen other companies could also demonstrate that the idea in principle does function. But if laser TV were to break through, most would have to worry about their large capacities in the production of picture tubes or LCD displays. Nevertheless, the PR show has had a positive effect for Schneider: The value of a share, which was introduced in 1986 at a price of DM 540 and which had meanwhile plummeted to DM 112.50, in early August climbed to DM 423. Thaus is now hoping that a U.S. company with a lot of capital will step in: "After the world premiere, the bride has become a great deal more beautiful."
