NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, while noting that for 11 days Russia has had no parliament at all, points out that by the beginning of the session the deputies' factions in the State Duma have failed to reach agreement on important questions, despite numerous talkfests. "As far as the Federation Council session, opening here on Tuesday, is concerned, one can suppose that a struggle for leading positions in it will be no less tough than that in the Duma." TRUD on the Federal Assembly functioning: "The legal life of the Federal Assembly begins today. Will it be marked by an end to antagonism between branches of power and by businesslike contacts between the parliament and the government? It is only businesslike contacts that can bring reassurance and future material wellbeing to the country". PRAVDA on the first State Duma session: "The first day of the session of the State Duma will be decisive... Despite a certain played-up excitement, the general impression is that the deputies want and are prepared to work efficiently". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Yuriy Baturin who was recently appointed the first assistant to the president of Russia on national security affairs. Having pointed out that there are a lot of difficult tasks in this field, Baturin emphasised that "Russia's national security existed before and is still being elaborated". His opinion is that the concept "should be continuously modified in response to changing conditions. In our days, conditions change fast". TRUD runs an interview with Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS) which was founded by a presidential decree. Stepashin dwelt on how the newly-established service differs from the old one and singled out six main tasks of the FCIS, the first among them being "to expose, prevent and put a stop to intelligence and subversive activities of foreign secret services and organisations against Russia". PRAVDA carries notes by Former Russian Parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov. The notes, dated October 3, last year, are headlined "Notes from the `White House'". Khasbulatov analyses the situation in Russia after the August of 1991, expresses considerations about "direct motives for the anti-state coup" (as Khasbulatov describes the presidential decision to terminate the functioning of the Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's Deputies -- note by ITAR- TASS), and criticises President Boris Yeltsin's policy, the kingpin of which, as Khasbulatov maintains, is "antagonism and confrontation" NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Ramiz Rizayev, Azerbaijan's plenipotentiary representative in Russia, who denied information that Afghan mojahedin take part in combat operations on Azerbaijan's side in the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. In SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, Vladimir Isakov, former people's deputy of Russia and one of the leaders of the National Salvation Front, strongly criticises the current privatisation policy. He believes that "everything seems to indicate that privatisation in Russia will go down in history as an example of unprecedented and shocking social hypocrisy". PRAVDA on President Clinton's forthcoming visit to Moscow: "The U.S. delegation again has in its bag more pieces of advice and political declarations than specific economic programs, and, most importantly, funds for their realisation".
