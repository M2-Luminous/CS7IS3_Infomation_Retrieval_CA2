High Commessariat for Refugees (UNHCR) from entering Mostar, city in southwest Bosnia-Herzegovina. UNHCR spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said in Geneva that the convoys were unable to enter both the eastern (Muslim) and western (Croat) parts of Mostar. A mental hospital, with some 100 patients, is in the Croat part of the city and under constant sniper fire, Foa said. Thirty-seven people, including five children, were killed in Mostar in the February 1-5 period, while scores of civilians were wounded, she said. Foa confirmed that the humanitarian convoys, which left Belgrade on Monday and crossed Bosnian Serb territory without mishap, had arrived in the Muslim enclaves of Tuzla and Srebrenica (northeast and eastern Bosnia). Relief aid convoys for the Bosnian Muslims are regularly provided free and unhindered passage through Bosnian Serb territory, official UNHCR and U.N. Protection Force reports said. Foa added that the severe snowstorms in central Bosnia on Tuesday stopped seven humanitarian convoys which left Metkovici (on the Adriatic coast) for Muslim-held Zenica.
