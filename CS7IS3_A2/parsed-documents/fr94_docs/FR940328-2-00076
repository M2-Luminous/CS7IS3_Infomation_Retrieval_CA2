FR940328-2-00076 FR940328-2-00050 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33791; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;47] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Partial Temporary Accelerated Approval to Proposed Rule Change by American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to an Extension of Its Pilot Program Which Permits Specialists To Grant Stops in a Minimum Fractional Change Market March 21, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 notice is hereby given that on December 29, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Exchange requests permanent approval of the pilot program which amended Amex Rule 109 to permit a specialist, upon request, to grant stops in a minimum fractional change market. 3 In the alternative, the Exchange proposes a one-year extension of the pilot program. The complete text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission. 3 The Amex received approval to amend Rule 109, on a pilot basis, in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30603 (April 17, 1992), 57 FR 15340 (April 27, 1992) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;91&hyph;05) (``1992 Approval Order''). The Commission subsequently extended the Amex's pilot program in Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 32185 (April 21, 1993), 58 FR 25681 (April 27, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;10) (``April 1993 Approval Order''); and 32664 (July 21, 1993), 58 FR 40171 (July 27, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;22) (``July 1993 Approval Order''). Commission approval of these amendments to Rule 109 expires on March 21, 1994. The Exchange seeks accelerated approval of the proposed rule change in order to allow the pilot program to continue without interruption. See letter from Claudia Crowley, Special Counsel, Legal & Regulatory Policy Division, Amex, to Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated March 4, 1994. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose On July 21, 1993, the Commission extended its pilot approval of amendments to Exchange Rule 109 until March 21, 1994. 4 The amendments permit a specialist, upon request, to grant a stop 5 in a minimum fractional change market 6 for any order of 2,000 shares or less, up to a total of 5,000 shares for all stopped orders, provided there is an order imbalance, without obtaining prior Floor Official approval. A Floor Official, however, must authorize a greater order size or aggregate share threshold. 4 See July 1993 Approval Order, supra, note 3. 5 When a specialist agrees to a floor broker's request to ``stop'' an order, the specialist is obligated to execute the order at the best bid or offer, or better if obtainable. See Amex Rule 109(a). 6 Amex Rule 127 sets forth the minimum fractional changes for securities traded on the Exchange. During the course of the pilot program, the Exchange has closely monitored compliance with the rule's requirements; analyzed the impact on orders on the specialist's book resulting from the execution of stopped orders at a price that is better than the stop price; and reviewed market depth in a stock when a stop is granted in a minimum fractional change market. The Exchange believes that the amendments to Rule 109 have provided a benefit to investors by providing an opportunity for price improvement, while increasing market depth and continuity without adversely affecting orders on the specialist's book. The Exchange's findings in this regard have been forwarded to the Commission under separate cover.
