These figures, together with the statistics of drugs seized in Western Europe, which the smugglers evidently transported through the territory of the Czech Republic (less than 750 kg in 1992, 997 kg last year), testify to the steadily growing quantity of heroin in transit and to the important status of the Czech Republic on the so-called Balkan route. A total in excess of 8,000 kg of heroin was seized in all European states last year, which is one-half more than in 1988. Two branches of this smuggling path go through the Czech Republic. One leads from Istanbul, Turkey, through Sofia, Belgrade, Budapest, and Prague to the Waldhaus border crossing. The other branch passing through the Czech-German border begins in Constanta, Romania. In both instances, the final destination for the narcotics is Scandinavia and West Europe. According to police sources, only a marginal part of the narcotics remains in the Czech Republic. Because of the high price of heroin, its users are recruited mostly from business circles. Jiri Richter, director of the National Drug and Information Service, comments on this: "Recently, the participation of the Czech citizens in various crime organizations involved in drug smuggling has grown. It is understandable: The Czech cleverness, longing for money, and skills are rather expedient features for narcotics trade." One of the important sites for drug smuggling is the [Prague-] Ruzyne airport. Drug couriers from Asia, Africa, and South America come to Prague and then continue to Europe in cars or by train. Because of the limited technical possibilities and lack of legislation, the Prague airport is becoming a suitable transfer point for smugglers. Drug-crime specialists point out that the interest in the Czech Republic on the part of dealers is not ceasing because dirty money can be laundered here without many problems. According to them, the individual gangs will attempt to penetrate the highest political and social strata.
