ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rulemaking amends miscellaneous hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipeline safety standards to provide clarity, eliminate unnecessary or overly burdensome requirements, and foster economic growth. The changes result from the regulatory review RSPA carried out in response to the President's directive of January 28, 1992, on reducing the burden of government regulation. The changes reduce costs in the liquid pipeline industry without compromising safety. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective July 28, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: J. Willock, (202) 366&hyph;2392, regarding the subject matter of this final rulemaking, or the Dockets Unit, (202) 366&hyph;5046, regarding copies of this final rulemaking or other material that is referenced herein. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In a January 28, 1992, memorandum, the President wrote to Department and agency heads about the need to reduce the burden imposed by government regulation. The President was concerned that agencies were not doing enough to review and revise existing regulations to eliminate unnecessary and overly burdensome requirements. The President recognized that regulations that do not keep pace with new technologies and innovations impose needless costs and impede economic growth. In response to the President's memorandum, DOT published a notice requesting public comment on the Department's regulatory programs (57 FR 4745; Feb. 7, 1992). Commenters were asked to identify regulations that substantially impede economic growth, may no longer be necessary, are unnecessarily burdensome, impose needless costs or red tape, or overlap or conflict with other DOT or federal regulations. The deadline for submitting comments was March 2, 1992. RSPA received comments from six organizations about the pipeline safety regulations in part 195. Comments were from three regulated pipeline companies, a pipeline trade association, a state pipeline safety agency, and a federal agency. RSPA considered all comments in its review of the regulations, and these comments are available in the docket. Some comments will be considered in future rulemakings. Additionally, RSPA has published a separate rulemaking ``Update of Standards Incorporated by Reference'' (58 FR 14519; March 18, 1993) which updates the editions of the industry standards that are incorporated in part 195. On November 27, 1992, RSPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, NPRM, (57 FR 56304) proposing 18 changes to the regulations based on the comments received from the public and asked for further comments regarding the proposed changes. RSPA received comments from 21 organizations: 15 pipeline companies, 3 pipeline trade associations, 2 environmental organizations, and 1 county government. RSPA considered all comments in preparation of the final rulemaking and the comments are available in the Docket.
