That story preceded the appearance in Russia of weapons that were developed and are being produced under the classification of "spetsizdeliye" [special item]. Powers was armed with a silent discharge weapon -- a pistol with a barrel silencer -- that was unknown in the USSR at that time. Because lagging behind in any sphere of weapons was very severely assessed in those years, the model was urgently sent to the Central Institute of Precision Machine Building (TsNIITOChMASh), already at that time a leading scientific center, where they researched, developed and tested practically all models of firearms comprehensively, together with the round. The experience and reserves that had been accumulated at the institute, and also the talent of Engineer and Designer Anatoliy Arsenyevich Deryagin, permitted them to quite rapidly accomplish the task. Soviet "competent organs" obtained a domestically-developed silent discharge pistol system. And at TsNIITOChMASh a new direction of research was opened by this topic -- individual protection weapons and equipping special subunits. One of the results of this research was the acceptance into the inventory of a silent weapons system and a team of designers (I. Kasyanov, A. Deryagin, P. Serdyukov, V. Petrov) was awarded the Russian Federation State Prize for that. Three models are part of the system: "Vintorez" 9-mm Sniper Rifle, "Val" 9-mm Assault Rifle, and "Vul" PSS 7.62-mm Pistol. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tactical-Technical Specifications | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |"Vintorez" |"Val" |"Vul" PSS | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Caliber, mm |9 |9 |7.62 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Aimed range, m |400 |400 |50 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weight, kg |2.5 |2.6 |0.7 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Magazine round ca-|10 |20 |6 | |pacity | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- "Vintorez" Designer Petr Ivanovich Serdyukov utilized the so-called classic silencer design -- a barrel silencer -- in the development of the "Vintorez" Gas-Vented 9-mm Sniper Rifle. In the process, he dealt extraordinarily successfully with the two main enemies of silent discharge -- pressure and temperature. The gases that propel the bullet toward the barrel's end initially end up under the impact of fan-shaped drilled gas ports, through which an intensive pressure drop takes place. Then -- in the first chamber of the silencer, an expansion chamber, where the pressure drops even more simultaneously with the lowering of the temperature. And, finally, the so-called separator completely "chops up" the jet that follows the bullet, dismembering it into numerous streams with different directions. A screen completes the cooling. That is the principle. We need to point out that the round also does its part to lower the temperature and pressure. This is also specifically explained by the large caliber, 9-mm, for a rifle. "Vintorez" is distinguished from other sniper rifles by its capability to conduct not only single round fire but also bursts. To do this, it can be equipped with 20-round instead of standard 10-round magazines. The rifle is equipped with a mechanical -- front sight and notched rear sight -- and also with three optical sights, including a night vision sight. One of the optical sights is the PSO-1 four-power sight with a range finder scale. A special screen has been introduced into its design that permits detection of infrared radiation sources. The sight is equipped with a range and direction adjustment mechanism. "Vintorez's" stock has a special recess which alleviates the design and forms a pistol grip. This type of stock was "broken in" and proved itself on the famous Dragunov sniper rifle. And, finally, the rifle can be completely disassembled and carried in a briefcase. "Val" The silent assault rifle received the name "Val". The silencer type and design is the same. It has been equipped with the identical equipment as "Vintorez", including the optical sights. The differences are primarily external and they are few. Among the most visible are the metal folding stock which slightly increased the assault rifle's weight (by 100 grams) and compelled the designer to return to the traditional pistol grip. The capacity of the magazine has been increased to 20 rounds. We discussed it in the portion that concerns "Vintorez's" automatic fire. "Val" has been deprived of the briefcase which would hardly be appropriate in raids against enemy rear areas. However, there is a fundamental difference. It is in the round. "Vintorez" has the SP-5 round that was developed by Designer Nikolay Zabelin and "Val" has the SP-6 that was developed by Designer Yuriy Frolov. How do they differ? The former is a special sniper round. It is designed to destroy personnel. The assault rifle's round has heightened penetrability. It easily penetrates a 6-mm sheet of high-strength steel at a range of 100 meters. "Vul" And, finally, the last member of the TsNIITOChMASh family of silent weapons -- the "Vul" PSS 7.62-mm pistol that was developed by Yuriy Krylov and Viktor Levchenko. This model is a kind of surprise for lovers of nontraditional solutions, because suppressing the sound of the discharge occurs in it based upon an entirely different principle: By employing a special round with a powder gas cut-off in it. We need to say that the idea for the development of this type of ammunition is not new. What is more, such rounds exist and are utilized in the world. But in a very limited manner. In single-shot and double-barreled systems that are hard to call truly combat systems. The reason for that is the imperfection of the design and its low effectiveness that is caused by the inability of the round to support semi-automatic fire. Viktor Petrov, the developer of the SP-2 (the designation of the new round with the powder gas cut-off) took a fundamental step forward in this sphere when he developed a round that brought the automatic back to life. In the process, the SP-2's combat effectiveness is close to the effectiveness of the Makarov PM [Makarov Pistol] pistol's round and lags behind it only in penetrability: The bullet of the silent round does not stick into the fourth 25-mm pine board like the PM but in the third board which it enters sideways. That is caused by the ammunition's blunt tip that disrupts stability when it encounters an obstacle. If you consider that a shortcoming of the round, then it is the only one. In the remainder, the PSS is no worse than the PM. Moreover, it is equipped with a series of innovations, one of which is an adaptation for the installation of a modern collimating sight that is indispensable when firing under nighttime conditions. The shining dot on the sight, which is fed by a small battery, is compatible with night vision glasses and creates conditions for firing that are close to ideal. Based upon the big picture, sights of this type are instruments of the future. The pistol itself provides a decent advantage over its competitors. If we turn to the specifications, it exceeds even "Vintorez" in the primary one -- the level of noise suppression. Russian silent weapons are one more source of pride for the domestic small arms school that is recognized in the world.
