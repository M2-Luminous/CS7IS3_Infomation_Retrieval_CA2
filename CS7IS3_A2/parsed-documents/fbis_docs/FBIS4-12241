He said the Palestinians welcome any help to resolve the pending issues so that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles can be implemented on schedule on 12 April. Sha'th told journalists following the latest round of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations that President 'Arafat also discussed the results of the negotiations during his meeting with Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana. Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa was also briefed on the results, he added. Sha'th said: We did not achieve the progress we expected to achieve to sign the final agreement on schedule on 12 April. He accused the Israeli delegation of obstructing the negotiations. Noting that the Israeli delegation left the negotiations at this time for a long recess (three and a half days) without finalizing the issues under discussion, Sha'th said: It is difficult to blame us for this; the Israelis are entirely to blame. Sha'th said the Israeli delegation promised to continue the negotiations by fax and telephone. We are waiting to see if this will solve the remaining problems, he said. He stressed that this depends largely on the intentions of the Israelis and their readiness to end the negotiations on time. If this is the case, he said, a practical result can be reached on Sunday or Monday. Sha'th went on to say: We are working and are ready to work every minute of the remaining five and a half days before Tuesday 12 April. I firmly believe that if the Israelis have good intentions there is enough time to reaching an agreement. The Palestinian official explained that the economic talks in Paris will continue tomorrow and the day after. Had these negotiations [in Cairo] been given a similar chance, he said, they would have been completed on time. Sha'th said the Israeli delegation's ending the negotiations ahead of schedule on the pretext of marking the holocaust (the burning of Jews by the Nazis during World War II) means the Israelis have obstructed the negotiations in some way. We could celebrate the intifadah or any other dear national Palestinian occasion by observing a silence or by breaking up the negotiations for an hour, he said. Ending the negotiations before their time in this way, he added, is an obstruction. Sha'th stressed that the Palestinians still insist on the specified date for the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, that is, 13 April. He said this date is extremely important and must not be overlooked. There is enough time to achieve this, he said. Sha'th added: The Israelis know full well what we want and what is required. I do not believe it is impossible to achieve what is required. He said he tried to persuade the Israeli delegation to stay to complete the negotiations but the delegation insisted on leaving.
