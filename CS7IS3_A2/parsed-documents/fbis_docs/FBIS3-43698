According to a communique issued by the Defense Department, government troops this morning recaptured Kobu, Kokoru, Jawe, and Geleblama in the Kenema axes. Defense officials say the capture of the towns has now reopened the road from Jolu to Zimi to commuter traffic. Also this morning government troops swept through Kongoma, Bowo, Baoma, Jaluahun, and Kayima in the Kailahun District in rapid succession. At Bowo, seven rebels were killed after a two-hour battle, while two officials of the RUF [Revolutionary United Front], Lieutenant Kosia, a renegade soldier, who was the rebels' director of training, and Philip Kpulum were captured. To celebrate the triumph of government troops, the undersecretary of state for defense, Captain Komba Kambo, has dispatched a message of congratulations on behalf of the chairman of the NPRC [National Provisional Ruling Council] and head of state, Captain Valentine Strasser, to the commanders of the 3d and 4th Battalions. The message commended the gallantry, bravery, and endurance of the troops in prosecuting the rebel war.
