It is the Blockade Project. The idea is to uncover at every level the activity of drug traffickers who find the region to be a splendid home for their business. The "blockade" is subdivided into four subprojects and will utilize a vast information network involving the Armed Forces of Brazil and its bordering countries, federal agencies, petroleum distributors, aircraft monitoring systems, and a regional contingent of 200 federal police agents. The entire program has one goal: to remove Brazil from the list of cocaine transit countries by 1996. That list, which is drawn up by the United Nations, also includes Venezuela, Brazil's partner in the project. According to the United Nations, neighboring Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia form the team of producers. The Brazilian Government wants to beef up the fight in cooperation with those countries and increase the barriers to trafficking activities. "From now on, it will be very hard for drugs to reach the consuming center," says PF/AM [Amazonas Federal Police] Superintendent Mauro Sposito. The amount of money to be spent on the operation was not revealed. In Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira at the beginning of this week, Sposito participated in the Sixth Military Exchange Meeting between the Armies of Brazil and Venezuela with only one task in mind: to discuss the "blockade's" strategies and explain them to the military. In this exclusive interview with A CRITICA, Mauro Sposito said he was excited about the future. He is convinced that this time the drug traffickers will have to find new alternatives for keeping their business going. "For our part, we promise to extend the barriers and put those people out of business," he announced. Vieira: How is the Federal Police Department going to participate in the exchange between the Brazilian and Venezuelan Armies? Sposito: The problem of drug trafficking is one of the most serious problems in this region. We border on producing countries. Brazil and Venezuela are both regarded as transit countries, they are faced with the same difficulties, and, because of that, we have agreed that exchanging information is valuable in order for us to engage in uniform repressive action. Vieira: What activities are under way? Sposito: We discovered that the producing center for refined cocaine in Colombia was shipping a small part of its production down the Amazon River, whose waters are international. The traffickers were crossing Amazonas and even using Brazilian ports to export cocaine hidden inside other kinds of merchandise (black pepper, wood, cupuacu, and pineapple). We closed off the Solimoes River in September 1993. Since then, all boats using the river have been inspected. The barrier relies on the element of surprise and can be set up anywhere on the Solimoes. At the same time, we have been keeping track of repression activities in Colombia, and that has enabled us to tighten our controls. You see, all the laboratories they have discovered up to now -- over the past three years -- have been located in the Colombian Amazon Region, an area which, like our own, escapes control by the authorities. Large areas with few inhabitants and no roads facilitate activities by drug traffickers. Since November, radio operations have been monitored through the Monitinga and Monifer Project. The first of those acronyms stands for Monitoring of Radio Frequency Communications in Tabatinga, and the second stands for Monitoring of Radio Frequency Communications in Tefe. Although new, this project shows that we are on the right track because we have an advantage over the drug traffickers. Another project that is now in the process of being set up is CAPA (Aircraft Fueling and Landing Control). The traffickers use small airplanes to carry drugs. We are not in a position to police the airspace. So we have started monitoring the flying range of those aircraft as they leave Colombia for some consuming center and need to refuel. CAPA is being introduced gradually because it requires coordination with the Ministry of Aeronautics and with petroleum distributors (Petrobras, Shell, and Esso). The Brazilian Government will soon be using various means of control to neutralize the traffickers' activities. Vieira: What are the results of that range of repressive actions? Sposito: The entire operation is causing traffickers to seek alternatives for getting their drugs to the big consuming centers. In Belem, for example, which is one of our main information gathering centers, we arrested "Cerquinho" (Daniel Parada). A number of big shots were arrested that year because of the work under way. Vieira: Is exchange with Colombia complicated? Sposito: No. The institutions there are serious. There may be individuals within the institutions who are not doing their jobs, but that is normal in any area of activity. In our case, the contact is not personal; it takes place through the Federal Police in the two countries. In that connection, support by the Colombian PF [Federal Police] has been decisive in ensuring the success of operations. Vieira: How is the cocaine market divided up? Sposito: Colombia is the world's largest cocaine producer. It is said that 60 percent of its GDP [gross domestic product] comes from drug transactions. The United States is the biggest consumer, followed by Europe. Consumption in Brazil is still in its beginning stages and is concentrated mainly in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Most of the consumption in Manaus is not of cocaine but of coca base, which by the way is a bigger poison than the other poison -- it is mixed with sulfuric acid. Vieira: With the traditional corridors blockaded, what other routes would the traffickers use? Sposito: They have to get the goods to the consuming centers. We have to intercept them. They are currently using Venezuela as a camp; they may increase their shipments through Colombia's west coast. One thing is certain: the drug traffickers will seek other alternatives. I can guarantee you that they are very worried. We have even seized goods coming from Bolivia because Colombia was unable to send the product here. Vieira: What other actions does the PF intend to take to neutralize the drug traffickers? Sposito: We are discussing a project to be carried out in cooperation with Suframa [Manaus Free Trade Zone Superintendency]. To combat the smuggling that has been going on in the western Amazon Region, that agency is going to establish a number of controls. We are working with it on that. Suframa is interested in controlling the entry of goods, while the Federal Police are interested in controlling what leaves. We are combining our interests. We are providing Suframa with police power, and it, in turn, will help us financially with that activity. There are only two ways to enter this part of the country: by river, meaning the Amazon River, and by land, meaning Highway BR-364. We are going to blockade the highway at Vilhena in Roraima and Obidos in Para. Vieira: How many men are involved in that project? Sposito: We have mobilized around 60 men. That is not enough. To implement the plan in the western Amazon Region, I need 200 men combating the drug traffic. Our goal is to complete all phases of the project by 1996. Vieira: What is the Blockade Project? Sposito: We have four subdivisions within the project. They are the Blockade Project proper, which consists of a river police detachment based in Tabatinga and the river police detachment based in Manaus; Rescon, or Colombian Report, which monitors repressive operations where the problem starts -- in Colombia -- so we can decide what actions to take here; CAPA, which is in the process of being set up; and the Monifer and Monitinga Project. Besides those four components of the main Blockade Project, we have an additional project called the "closing of the Amazon Region." It will be implemented in cooperation with Suframa. This project will affect 12 localities: Obidos, Vilhena, Ananindeua, Pacaraima, the B/V-8 boundary mark, Bonfim, Cruzeiro do Sul, Epitaciolandia in Brasileia, the Abuna River, Humaita, Manaus, and Tabatinga. Vieira: How do Peru and Bolivia fit into this picture? Sposito: Action is integrated. Our intention is that the work will have comprehensive effects. Peru is the world's biggest producer of coca base. In other words, Peru produces coca base and sends it to Colombia, where the product is refined and exported to the consuming centers. Peru and Colombia are responsible for 80 percent of all the cocaine in the world, while Bolivia produces 20 percent. The Blockade Project will gradually affect all the countries along the border. It will enter Bolivia the moment we close off the Abuna and Vilhena. By closing the Abuna, we will shut off access through Madeira/Mamore. In that way, we will also put obstacles in the way of the traffic moving in the opposite direction, which carries the chemicals necessary for refining the cocaine. Those chemicals come from abroad, enter Brazilian territory, and then arrive in Colombia and Bolivia. Vieira: What is the goal behind this work by the Federal Police? Sposito: The United Nations classifies countries as producing countries, transit countries, and consuming countries. The producing countries are Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia. Ecuador is no longer included on that list. Transit countries are those which, like Brazil, have structures, road networks, river systems, and airports that make it easy for traffickers to get around inside the country and alter the goods to come up with the final product. We want to free Brazil of the stigma of being a "drug transit country." Brazil will be off that list by 1996. That is what we are working toward.
