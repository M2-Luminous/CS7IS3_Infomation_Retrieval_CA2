Qub'ah added that the Cairo agreement clearly proves the quality of the field arrangements and applications of the Oslo agreement. It is also a new submission to the Israeli conditions and the U.S.-Egyptian pressures, and includes serious concessions which undermine our people's national sovereignty over their land, and deals a blow to our people's supreme interests. These interests are linked to our people's right to self-determination and to establishing an independent national state. Qub'ah pointed out that in return for formal and marginal powers for the Palestinian authority, which will save the leadership's face a little and grant it private personal privileges, there is recognition of Israel's full control of the borders, crossing points, passages, and roads. Under the agreement, the settlements remain and Israel maintains supervision of their security as well as the security of the Israelis in the occupied territories. Also, the Israeli military orders remain valid without even a modest mention that such orders would be circumvented later. Thus, the Israeli military authorities' hegemony over both the external and internal security will be consecrated, Qub'ah added.
