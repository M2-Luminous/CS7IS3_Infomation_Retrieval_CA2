In order to commemorate the publication of this important document, I interviewed Tang Shubei, executive vice chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS]. Strategic Decision Made at Turning Point of History Tang Shubei first pointed out that the "Message to Taiwan Compatriots" was produced at an important turning point in Chinese history. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, which was convened at the end of 1978, established the strategic goal centering on economic construction, and the mainland has since entered a new period of large-scale modernization construction. At the same time as China further developed ties with various countries in the world, China established diplomatic relations in the late 1970's with the United States and realized the normalization of relations; thus, China's international status was elevated unprecedentedly. At the same time, Chinese people on both sides of the Strait, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and compatriots and overseas Chinese all hoped to see the two sides of the Strait cooperate hand in hand to invigorate the Chinese nation together. It was precisely against such a background that the CPC adjusted its Taiwan policy and, through the publication of the "Message to Taiwan Compatriots," solemnly announced to the world that the past policy of "liberating Taiwan" had been changed to solving the Taiwan question through peaceful measures in order to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Tang Shubei said that history in the past 15 years has proved that the principle of the peaceful reunification of the motherland adopted by the Chinese Government is a strategic decision, not an expedient measure. This principle has been continuously perfected and developed in the past 15 years. On 30 September 1981, NPC Chairman Ye Jianying made a speech (generally called Ye's nine-point speech) to further explain the principle and policy of solving the Taiwan question; he said that "after the reunification of the country, Taiwan will become a special administrative region, and will enjoy a high degree autonomy." He also suggested that the CPC and the Kuomintang hold talks on an equal footing. On 22 February 1984, Deng Xiaoping proposed the concept of "one country, two systems," advocating that on the major premise of realizing the reunification of the country, the mainstay of the country would practice a socialist system and Taiwan a capitalist system. On 12 October 1992, CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out: "We will unswervingly and actively promote the reunification of the motherland based on the principle of `peaceful reunification and one country, two systems.'" The "Three Links" and "Four Exchanges" Are in Accordance With the Minds of the People on Both Sides of the Strait Tang Shubei thinks that the basic significance of the "Message to Taiwan Compatriots" is "pinning hope" on two areas, that is, "pinning hope on the Taiwan authorities and pinning hope on the Taiwan people." The "three links" raised by the message, that is, direct mail links, shipping and air links, and commercial links, as well as the "four exchanges," that is, exchanges of personnel for the main purpose of visiting relatives and places of interest, cultural exchanges, arts exchanges, and sports exchanges fully reflect the urgent wishes of the people on both sides of the Strait who have been separated for several decades and conforms to the minds of people on both sides of the Strait. Tang Shubei said that after the issuance of the Message, the mainland side actively adopted positive measures, such as stopping shelling, abolishing the Fuzhou Military Region, and removing a large number of troops from the Fujian coast, markedly easing the atmosphere of military confrontation across the Strait. However, the Taiwan authorities did not respond to suggestions such as the "three links" and "four exchanges" raised by the message; on the contrary, they raised the "three no's" policy, that is, "no contacts, no negotiations, and no compromise," as a means of resistance. However, the wishes of the people are irresistible, and the historical trend cannot be blocked. The Taiwan authorities began to adopt some measures to adjust the way it handled relations between the two sides of the Strait in August 1987, and they announced the lifting of the ban on Taiwan compatriots returning to the mainland to visit relatives, thus, they eventually responded to some of the calls in the "Message to Taiwan Compatriots" issued by the mainland. Tang Shubei said that the adjustment of mainland policy by the Taiwan authorities had some positive meaning, for it is conducive to easing relations between the two sides of the Strait. It was precisely after the Taiwan authorities partly lifted the ban on Taiwan compatriots visiting relatives on the mainland that interactions between people on both sides of the Strait and exchanges in the civilian domain consistently developed and ceaselessly grew. At present, the call for expanding exchanges across the Strait in the "Message to Taiwan Compatriots" has already become a reality in the benevolent interactions between the two sides of the strait, as well as real actions by people on both sides of the strait. Tang Shubei summed up the process of the development of interactions between people on both sides of the Strait, as well as exchanges in the civil domain, as follows: This developed from Taiwan compatriots coming to the mainland to visit relatives and for tourism, from tourism and visiting relatives to indirect trade and investment, from completely spontaneous, scattered, and civilian actions, to the establishment of empowered civilian groups on both sides of the strait -- the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- to discuss problems arising from cross-strait exchanges in the civilian domain, and these two groups have found some methods to solve these problems. Tang Shubei stressed that these were historic changes which took place in the direction pointed out by the "Message to Taiwan Compatriots," whereas the strengths behind these changes were the people on both sides of the strait who promoted and brought about changes with the publication and under the guidance of the "Message to Taiwan Compatriots." Reflecting on these historic changes, we have gained important enlightenment, that is, people on both sides of the Strait should continue to play a promoting role and should urge the relevant quarters on the two sides of the Strait to continuously adjust their policies to further provide conditions for the development of civilian exchanges across the strait so as to conform to the situation of the prosperous development of civilian exchanges between both sides of the Strait. The Greatest Revelation From the Wang-Koo Talks The Wang-Koo talks were an important and notable event in the course of the development of relations between the sides of the Taiwan Strait over the past four decades or more. As ARATS' executive vice chairman, Tong Shubei has participated in the entire course of the talks, from paving the way for the talks, to holding preparatory negotiations, to holding official talks. He maintains that the fact that the Wang-Koo talks were proposed and held and that agreements were reached is a vivid reflection of an inexorable trend in the vigorous development of exchanges between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait since the message to Taiwan compatriots was published, especially since 1987. Tong Shubei said: Of the four agreements reached at the Wang-Koo talks, two are being implemented well, namely that on the use and enquiry of notary certificates and the other on enquiries into and compensation for registered mail. The other two agreements, namely the agreement on common agreements and regular contacts between the two organizations and the agreement on the institution of talks, although being implemented, the two sides have differences of understanding and implementation and need further negotiations. Tong Shubei stressed: The greatest significance of the Wang-Koo talks and its greatest revelation to mankind is that under the one- China principle, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have sat down to talk (despite the fact that they understand the meaning of "one China" differently). By doing so, it is possible to find ways to resolve differences. Tong Shubei recalled the warm welcome accorded to them by overseas Chinese in the United States and Canada when Wang Daohan and he visited there not long after the Wang-Koo talks. He said that overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent earnestly hope that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait sit down and talk and find ways of to resolve differences. Regarding this, Tong Shubei said that it was now possible to find ways to resolve differences over ordinary matters when the two sides sat down and talked, it is possible, I believe, for the two sides to ultimately find ways of resolving political problems as long as they do so in good faith. For various reasons, it takes time, of course, to resolve political differences between the two sides, and we should both be patient. Deepest Feelings About the ARATS' Work It is two years now since ARATS was set up in mid-December 1991, and Tong Shubei has been its executive vice chairman ever since. His name is well known by people on the island and by all overseas people who are concerned about the development of cross-strait relations. Asked what his deepest feelings or experiences about his work in ARATS was, Tong Shubei answered after thinking a little: I assumed diplomatic posts for a long time and had contacts with some Taiwan compatriots and some understanding of Taiwan. Since assuming the post of executive vice chairman of ARATS, some previous work experience has been useful and some has not. In the past two years, I have continuously deepened my understanding of the various aspects of Taiwan and have, given the present pattern of cross-strait relations, always explored how to do well in empowering nongovernmental bodies, strengthening cooperation with the SEF, jointly promoting contacts between the people of the two sides and various nongovernmental exchanges, and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the two sides. Tong Shubei said: The deepest work experience over the past two years has been that cooperation between the ARATS and the SEF is premised on the current political differences and unconformity between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, which is a fact, and that the foundation for cooperation is the existence of the people's aspirations, which demand the strengthening of contacts and exchanges. At present, there are differences and unconformity between the two sides over such issues as the nature of politics, laws, common rights, and jurisdiction. Despite these kind of differences, ARATS and the SEF are to cooperate and make efforts to resolve problems arising from contacts and exchanges between their people. Moreover, Tong Shubei pointed out that when they avoided such issues as politics, laws, common rights, and jurisdiction, which will be difficult to reach agreement on for some time, in the course of negotiations over ordinary matters, ARATS and the SEF had succeeded in their cooperation. He illustrated this by saying that the two sides had reached agreement on the use of notary certificates and on enquiries into and compensation for registered mail when they avoided the above questions. Prospects for Cooperation With the SEF Asked about the prospects for cooperation between the ARATS and the SEF in 1994, Tong Shubei said that the two organizations would probably continue to have difficulties in cooperation next year. If the two sides could avoid political differences, then next year could be very promising. We have note speeches made recently by some responsible persons in the SEF and the "Mainland Work Committee" and that some of their views conform with ours. If the two sides avoid political differences, then the agreements reached at the Wang-Koo talks can be implemented very well and the two organizations will probably make great strides in their cooperation. If so, it will surely be very good for contacts between the people of the two sides and for various nongovernmental exchanges. In short, hope and difficulties coexist. I personally hope that the scope of cooperation between ARATS and the SEF will be further expanded. If invited to Taiwan, I will frankly and sincerely express my views to my Taiwan friends. I am, of course, also willing to listen to their views so that we can find more common points.
