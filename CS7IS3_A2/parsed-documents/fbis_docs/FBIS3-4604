The Patriot missile under consideration for deployment in Korea are Pae-II type, the latest operated by the U.S. military that has been advanced from the weapons used in the Gulf war, Yi told the National Assembly's National Defense Committee. Considering that not only Seoul, but also as far as Suwon is within missile attack from the North, it is meaningless to operate the anti-missile weapon in the capital just to intercept North Korean Scud missile attack, he explained. Therefore, he added, Seoul and Washington are considering to use Patriots to defend airport, port, command post, and other military areas. The U.S. Forces in Korea will be in charge of maintaining and operating the missiles and Seoul does not need pay any extra, he said. The defense minister said purchasing the missiles was another matter and needed to consider more over a long time before reaching that stage.
