The ship, which sailed today from the port of Nemuro, north Hokkaido, to the Kunashir island, is bringing in 48 people, including 24 former Japanese inhabitants of the Kuril Islands, nine representatives of the national movement for the return of the "northern territories", and 15 journalists. During their stay on the Kunashir island, the Japanese guests will meet local inhabitants, will visit a secondary school and several enterprises. Like the previous groups of Japanese guests, they will live in the homes of local citizens. The delegation will return home on May 13. This year's second group of Japanese visitors will come to the Kunashir island on the next day after its arrival in Japan. The third season of visa-free exchanges began for the citizens of the Kuril Islands this April, when Hokkaido was visited by this year's first group of Russians. The same number of people is expected to take part in visa-free exchanges between the two countries this year as in 1993, that is 400 people from each side. A distinctive feature of the 1994 season is that this year's delegations will include more specialists, able to use their trips to the neighbouring country to exchange professional experience.
