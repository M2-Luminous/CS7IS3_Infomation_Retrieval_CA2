A high percentage of the $20 million that has been seized since 1988 has been a source for many people to get rich illegally. The government points at members of the Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN], trustees, and former lieutenant governors as those who are involved in corruption. Two private law consulting firms and the government have detected a framework of corruption in the country, which has been operating for a long time. The poor and criminal administration of the assets confiscated from drug traffickers has led to the appearance in Bolivian society of illegal fortunes, according to an official document. Since 1988 until 6 August 1993, millions of U.S. dollars seized from drug trafficking have disappeared due to the negligent and guilty actions of the FELCN and people who were appointed by the Attorney General's Office as trustees of the assets. Former lieutenant governors in the rural areas have also been involved.
