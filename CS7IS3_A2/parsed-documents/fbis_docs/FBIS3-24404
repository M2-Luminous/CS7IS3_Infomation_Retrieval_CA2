The local states here are being drawn into the NATO Partnership for Peace program. The news media are carrying reports each more sensational than the last: The Americans are studying the question of safeguarding Kazakhstan's Caspian Sea coast with the American Coastguard; NATO emissaries are proposing the formation in Kyrgyzstan of a mountain division; the American State Department (sic) is working out a plan for the commitment of UN "blue helmets" to the zone of the Georgia-Abkhaz conflict with the obligatory withdrawal of Russian troops beyond the River Psou, that is, beyond the Georgian-Russian border; the United States is offering to assist Georgia in the creation of a Georgian regular army. These and other facts compel the assumption that the United States (directly in places, under the "roof" of NATO and the United Nations in others) has made an emphatic turn toward the post-Soviet South, methodically supplanting the Russians in this region. Not all the enumerated facts and assessments lend themselves to swift verification, and it could be that I am mistaken in some respects, but I do not want to be overtaken by events and would like, before it is too late, to address to those who make the decisions in Washington (may they believe me!) some well-meant thoughts. Were I an American "hawk," I also, most likely, would be drawn toward the post-Soviet South. Why? The United States could peacefully or with the minimum use of military force score an unprecedented strategic win. Having penetrated the region of the post-Soviet South, it would have moved into the rear of a whole number of states against which the United States has or could have complaints of various kinds (Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, China, Pakistan, India, and, of course, Russia). Test ranges of the former Ministry of Defense of the USSR (nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological and missile and space research centers on the territory of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan) are located in the region. It cannot be ruled out that there are some in the United States who are interpreting the slogan of the Nevada-Semipalatinsk antinuclear movement as an itinerary for the transfer of test ranges. But exclusion of the possibility of use of the Baykonur complex by the Russian military and space forces (and, possibly, its use by NATO and the United States) would be of the greatest importance to the United States in a military-strategic respect. The United States could also control the raw material resources of the post-Soviet South. The detachment of Russia from the strategically important types of raw material of Central Asia which Russia either lacks, virtually, or of which it has insufficient quantities--uranium, copper-porphyritic, pyrite, and stratiform ores, manganese, chromites, strontium ores, germanium, and so forth--is possible. Naturally, use of these stocks by the United States itself and/or its allies cannot be ruled out either. And what is most important, perhaps: OIL. This requires a separate paragraph. The priority interests of the United States include control of the Caspian hydrocarbon mega-field, just about the most important in the world, whose oil and gas beds can be developed not only in Iran but also in the post-Soviet South--Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan. The United States also needs to ensure its control of the shipment of raw material and other resources both in the Central Asia-Caucasus-Europe direction and in the Central Asia-Indian Ocean direction. And, finally, stability. The United States needs this to realize the listed and other of its interests. Naturally, the stability must correspond to American criteria. To this end the United States must do its utmost to establish in the region of the post-Soviet South pro-America regimes of a liberal-democratic persuasion. It is possible that I have not mentioned everything. But even the considerations that have been noted are sufficient for recognizing the charted aims as being to the advantage of the United States. I would like to call Americans' attention to the problems that would threaten the United States in the event of their forced penetration of the post-Soviet South. The threats and dangers would grow in the proportion to the number and scale of America's successes, what is more. First, what is most obvious. Russia could not fail to respond to attempts to make it a passive observer of the processes, extremely dangerous for its very future, that are already under way on its southern borders. The specter of a new "cold war" already looms in Russian-American relations. It is obvious also that a development of events in the contemplated direction would signify a growth of the anti-American mood in Russia, the corresponding evolution of the regime (if not its replacement), and an even greater exacerbation of Russian-American relations. Second, the intrusion of a foreign element into the region and an aspiration to isolate and weaken Russia and the other regional powers with traditional interests here--all this could disrupt the stable geopolitical balance, which would inevitably lead to the unpredictable and dangerous fragmentation of the geopolitical space. In a search for military-political allies, Russia could turn to Iran, Iraq.... Third, in the Americans' place I would think long and hard before undertaking a concentrated military-political penetration of the region of the post-Soviet South. The region is characterized by an extremely high degree of conflict potential. A listing of the conflicts that have flared up and those that are ready to erupt (even more numerous and serious) could have taken up the whole of this article. The introduction into this zone of a foreign element and internationalization of the conflicts with regard to the United States would necessarily signify a growth of the conflict potential. And, naturally, destabilization--regional and, possibly, global. Fourth, were I an American, I would beware of an outbreak of Islamic fundamentalism--not that which is attributed to Iran but that which would flourish independently, without outside influence even, as a luxuriant bloom in all Muslim states of the post-Soviet South to which the United States came. Imagine, in addition, a combination of different streams of Islamic fundamentalism here--Near East and Middle East, Central Asian and Caucasian.... Imagine also a combination of Islamic fundamentalism and Russian nationalism (there have been such theoretical and practical attempts).... Fifth, no one has yet calculated what the corresponding expenditure would cost the American taxpayer. And how many American soldiers would, God forbid, lay down their lives in the mountains of the Caucasus and the deserts of Central Asia. American penetration of the post-Soviet South would be dangerous primarily for the United States itself, not to mention the likelihood of regional and global destabilization. I see the Americans in this region in the role of torch-bearers who have blundered into the powder magazine. God bless America!
