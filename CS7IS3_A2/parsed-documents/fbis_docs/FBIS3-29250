The government will continue to cooperate with friendly nations and international organizations in solving the issue, he said in a state of the administration speech delivered at a plenary session of parliament. The government expects North Korea not only to permit IAEA nuclear inspections, but also to come to the dialogue table as soon as possible to take up the inter-Korean nuclear issue, he added. He also expressed hope that a humanitarian program would be launched to ease the pain of separated Korean families by arranging for reunions. Stressing that government must be based on law and order, Yi said the administration would carry out all reform programs on this basis. Calling on parliament to enact new electoral legislation during its current session, he said the government would manage local elections slated for next year strictly according to the new law. To attain peaceful reunification of Korea, the government will pursue a foreign policy which creates an international environment conducive to that end, he said. The government's economic policy will focus on increasing the international competitiveness of Korean products to spark a new economic takeoff. To cope with the new world trade order established under the Uruguay Round accord, the government will reform Korea's trade system and practices so that they suit the new order. For price stabilization, the government will continue controlling the prices of 30 basic items, while placing under surveillance the prices of 140 monopoly and oligopoly items, he said. In addition to the 42 trillion won earmarked for investment in rural industries, 1.5 trillion won will be poured into agricultural restructuring programs every year over the next decade to revitalize the sector, which will likely suffer from farm market opening under the Uruguay Round accord, the prime minister said.
