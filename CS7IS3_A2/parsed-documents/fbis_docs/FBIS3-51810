And a commission of inquiry to examine the pros and cons of independence could be up and running soon after the House of Assembly resumes on February 4, official sources said. Premier Sir John Swan quelled most dissension over a referendum at Thursday's caucus meeting. But several United Bermuda Party caucus members were off the island, and he could face fresh opposition when the issue is canvassed again next Thursday. Tourism Minister Jim Woolridge, who returned to the island on Friday night, could lead opposition to the route favoured by the premier. One cabinet minister, Delegated Affairs Minister Ann Cartwright Decouta, has already resigned over the issue. If a commission of inquiry on independence was held, it would be conducted in public and wide input would be sought, Sir John said on Friday. Before the vote was held, legislation to allow it would have to clear the House and Senate (upper house). An August referendum could still allow a commission of inquiry to complete its work and communicate its findings to Bermudians. The most recent commission of inquiry in Bermuda reported in 1991 to examine and make recommendations for the fishing industry led to the government's controversial fish pot ban. The only previous referendum in Bermuda was on capital punishment in 1990. Less than one-third of eligible voters participated. Of those who cast ballots, 78.4 per cent favoured retention of the death penalty. The referendum cost government 50,000 dollars (US).
