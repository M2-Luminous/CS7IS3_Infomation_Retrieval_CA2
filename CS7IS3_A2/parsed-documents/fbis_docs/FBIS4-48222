This came in an Eritrean Foreign Affairs Ministry's statement distributed by the Eritrean Embassy in Kuwait. The statement, a copy of which was sent to KUNA, said that "the Eritrean stance towards the conflict in Yemen calls for ending the fighting and appealing to reason and the logic of dialogue in such a way which achieves the interest of the Yemeni people and move it away from the slides of rupture, displacement and misery". He added that "from this logic, we repeat the appeal to the two parties to the conflict to end the fighting and resort to peaceful dialogue in such a way which preserves the interest of the Yemeni people, and the security and stability in our region in general". The statement described the news which suggested a biased Eritrean stance in favor of one of parties in the Yemeni conflict against the other as being "untrue and harms Eritrea's positive role to find a peaceful solution to the crisis, and it harms Eritrea's relations with all the Yemenis alike".
