A savings in time (one hour to do a job that used to take 25 hours), a 25-percent reduction in cost, and quality close to that of the finished product. The superplastic forming of titanium sheets is well known, especially in the fields of aeronautics, aerospace, and armament. Now the same technology is being applied to the production of pipes in complex conical shapes with chimneys and connectors. And all in one operation! Prodem (turnover of 20 million francs, 50 employees), a subsidiary of Bonnans, Inc., is the company rushing into the breach opened by Aerospatiale and press manufacturer ABC. The young Toulouse firm has just filled the slot and is marketing titanium hot-air pipework for the Airbus A330 and A340. A result of research conducted by Aerospatiale, pipe forming consists of "inflating" an airtight titanium pipe. One end of the pipe is blocked shut, after which a nozzle is attached to the other end to inject argon with a pressure of about 10 bars. Upon being heated to a temperature of 900 degrees C., the alloy of superplastic titanium (enriched with six percent aluminum and four percent vanadium) expands as much as 600 percent in the press, hence its name "superplastic." The pipe expands to fit the mold in which it has been placed. The resulting surface smoothness and quality are close to that of the finished product. So much so that the forming process eliminates the traditional machining and welding operations--as well as the string of inspections accompanying them. As a result, the metallic structure of the titanium does not undergo change. Another advantage is that "a piece can be completed in less than an hour. Compared to traditional boilerwork, which would require 25 hours," explains Yves Marcel, a development engineer at Prodem. The result in the case of short runs is to make the cost of a piece 25 percent less than it would be in traditional boilermaking. Despite that, the "entry ticket" remains high: about 150,000 francs for a mold of refractory steel. In addition, the price of titanium--over 300 francs per kilogram--does not make the development of applications easy. As regards the Prodem shop's production capacity, it is limited, the reason being that "one must allow from 10 to 12 hours for heating the press to 900 degrees C. And during the rest of the day, one can form about 10 pieces," says Marcel. That rules out any mass production. The consequence is that unlike superplastic aluminum, forming titanium pipe remains limited to the aerospace industry. Despite everything, Prodem is confident that Russian titanium will soon arrive on the market. Since the Russian product costs 30 percent less than titanium from the United States, which currently has a monopoly, it may be that the process will spread to other industrial sectors.
