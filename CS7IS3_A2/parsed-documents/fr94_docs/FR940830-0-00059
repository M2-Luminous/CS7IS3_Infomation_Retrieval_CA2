FR940830-0-00059 FR940830-0-00013 §§905.601 and 968.103_Allocation of Funds Under Section 14. Set-Aside for Emergencies and Disasters Comment: Two commenters responded to the proposed change in paragraph (b) of §§905.601 and 968.103 which would allow all HAs (including smaller HAs that participate in CIAP) to apply for emergency and disaster funds from the $75 million set-aside. Both commenters were supportive of this change which provides another avenue for smaller agencies to access urgently needed resources; however, one of the commenters did not support the maintenance of the set-aside out of modernization funds and suggested other fund sources such as National Emergency Relief funds. Response: Section 14 of the Act authorizes this set-aside from modernization funds. The set-aside is part of the formula approach and makes up for funding shortfalls to address emergencies or disasters. This provision would also allow CIAP HAs to receive funding for unanticipated emergencies during the period between when CIAP funds are exhausted for the current year and when funds are available for next year, as well as for disasters at any time during the year. The requirements governing the reserve for disasters and emergencies and the procedures by which an HA may request such funds are found at §§905.667 (IHAs) and 968.312 (PHAs). HAs (including a PHA that has been designated as mod troubled under PHMAP or IHAs that are determined to be high risk under §905.135) may obtain funds at any time, for any eligible emergency work item as defined in §§905.102 or 968.305 (for HAs participating in CGP, ``CGP HAs'') or for any eligible emergency work item (described as emergency modernization in §§905.102 or 968.205) (for HAs participating in CIAP, ``CIAP HAs''), from the reserve established under §§905.601(b) or 968.103(b). However, emergency reserve funds may not be provided to a CGP HA that has the necessary funds available from any other source, including its annual formula allocation under §§905.601 (e) and (f) or 968.103 (e) and (f), other unobligated modernization funds, and its replacement reserves under §§905.666 or 968.310(a)(3). A CGP HA is not required to have an approved comprehensive plan under §§905.672 or 968.320 before it can request emergency assistance from this reserve. Emergency reserve funds may not be provided to a CIAP HA that has the necessary funds available from any other source, including unobligated CIAP, or if CIAP funding is available. A CIAP HA will not be required to repay emergency funds, because it does not have a future formula allocation of assistance with which to make this repayment. To date, the set-aside has never been depleted in any of the FFYs of CGP operation. This final rule adopts the proposed rule's provisions. However, the Department is seeking legislation which will permit the set-aside to be used for other purposes including activities related to the settlement of litigation and desegregation of public housing. Calculation of Number of Units Comment: One commenter supported the proposal to include new or converted units in formulating the amount to be awarded if they are on-line when awards are calculated. Response: HUD has retained the proposed rule's provisions on calculation of number of units. In order to treat each HA fairly, HUD will count units that have reached date of full availability (DOFA) and are under ACC amendment by the first day in the FFY in which the formula is being run. See also discussion under §§905.669 and 968.315 Allocation of assistance, Formula Characteristics Report (FCR) below. Paid-off Mutual Help Units Comment: All of the IHAs which commented provided suggestions on the treatment of paid-off units. Two commenters were in favor of modernizing paid-off units only if additional funds are made available (paid-off units being included in the calculation of units under management for formula funding allocation purposes). Response: Units which are paid-off, but not conveyed, are included in the calculation of units under management and for purposes of determining the IHA's formula share until they are conveyed. Upon conveyance, units are removed from the count of units under management and thereafter are no longer counted in the formula funding calculation. Comment: An IHA wanted to be able to work on homes that have been paid-off if the family that paid-off the home is still in possession of the home, or to work on any home that pays off after submission of the five-year plan, and recommended that paid-off units should be added to the unit count. One IHA suggested grandfathering all units that were originally submitted in the five-year plan but have subsequently been paid-off. Another IHA indicated that some Mutual Help participants are being penalized by the cut-off date, and IHAs should be allowed to work on their homes even if they are paid-off when the individual has fulfilled all of their obligations by not being delinquent (or who makes the maximum house payments) and still occupies the home. Response: The Department has decided to remove the regulatory prohibition against modernizing Mutual Help units which are paid-off but not conveyed. The Department believes that the only regulatory restrictions on the modernization of paid-off Mutual Help units should be that: title has not been conveyed to the homebuyer; where the homebuyer has a delinquency at the end of the amortization period, non-emergency modernization work shall not be done until all delinquencies are repaid; and, the units shall be identified in the Comprehensive Plan (including the Physical Needs Assessments and Five-Year Action Plan). The prohibition against performing modernization work on conveyed units is based on a determination by the Department's Office of General Counsel that statutory authority for the expenditure of modernization funds is limited to existing public housing units. Once title is conveyed and the unit is no longer covered by the ACC, the unit is no longer a public housing unit and there is no legal authority for the expenditure of modernization funds provided under section 14 of the Act. IHAs that wish to modernize conveyed Mutual Help units must obtain funding from another source; e.g., proceeds from the sale of homeownership units or Bureau of Indian Affairs Housing Improvement Program funds.
