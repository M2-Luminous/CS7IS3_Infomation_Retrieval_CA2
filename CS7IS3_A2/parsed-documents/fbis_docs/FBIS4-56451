Within the next five years, we must prepare ourselves to manage the Canal. We have already lost more than 15 years. We must also make good use of the reverted areas and goods so that these will generate opportunities for the country and its people. These areas and goods must not be used to enrich a few or to become a burden on the government. They must not become a source of shame for the Panamanians, as happened with the railroad and other installations. Likewise, we must consolidate our democratic institutions so Panamanians can live in an atmosphere of justice, have better opportunities for development, and enjoy true social peace. In the international field, we must decide on our future in the face of the large economic blocs of countries that are becoming organized worldwide. The most important aspect is we must launch a true war against poverty and malnutrition, against the lack of health and education, as well as against the lack of hope, opportunities, and future for the most important thing Panama has: our children and youth. This electoral process offers us a beautiful opportunity to solve these problems if we know how to act wisely. Fortunately, the campaign has been managed well. Fortunately, the campaign has been managed well, and it offers us an opportunity to show the world Panama's good face. Lately, Panama has been in the news only with reports on narcotics trafficking, money laundering, and gun running. This has done us great harm, and it affects the most humble Panamanians because it makes investments difficult. Therefore, this affects the creation of new sources of employment, which is what the people need. So far, this has been a clean and peaceful electoral process that will give us the opportunity to show our good face and even serve as a good example for the entire world. It will be an opportunity to begin cleaning up once again the image of Panama and of the Panamanians, and to say that we are also serious people. The only thing that has marred the electoral process has been too many polls that have apparently been made not to inform the people, but rather to misinform and to create an alleged polarization between certain candidates. It is a good idea that the Electoral Tribunal has just issued a decree regulating polls and even banning them as of tomorrow [as heard]. The good thing is that on 8 May, all polls will be at zero, and the only thing that will count will be the true will of the Panamanian people. That will be the only important and decisive poll. Therefore, when you enter the voting booth, remember that you, and only you as the voter, are responsible for choosing the next president. At that moment, as a responsible citizen, you must forget all publicity and polls and vote according to your conscience for whomever you think is the candidate best prepared to serve the country. At that moment, you have our future and that of our children in your hands. You will be responsible for the kind of ruler Panama will have. It is my duty at this time to tell you what our candidacy has to offer you. In the first place, I have the best academic and professional training of all the candidates. In addition, I am the only one who has true experience in the field of international relations, which are so important for Panama in the next five years. In the second place, I have devoted my professional life to activities that are directly related to the creation of sources of employment. This experience is important in view of the large unemployment there is in the country. I know how to create jobs, and that is what Panama needs now. No other candidate has any similar experience. In the third place, I offer the testimony of a life of over 35 years at the service of Panamanians by creating civic organizations and professional associations for solving education problems, preventing improper use of drugs, and coping with unemployment. I did not wait to become a candidate before I started working for my country. I have served my country with my work, at the service of the people, which is the most important thing our country has. That is my testimony, not just of now, but something I have done all my life. I want to do 1,000 times more from within the government of this work that I have been doing as an ordinary citizen. I also have a pact with the people which contains the answers to our country's main problems. I consider this a firm and serious commitment I have signed before a notary public. This commitment stems from my most intimate convictions. I highly regard my own signature a promise and much more. I am the only candidate who has had the courage and honesty to sign such a document. I have no personal commitments with anyone in particular, but rather with the people. There is no economic power supporting me, like those which have been supporting the governments for many decades. I am moved only by the sincere wish to serve my fatherland. The presidency of the Republic is neither a carnival nor a picnic. It is something extremely serious. In such critical moments for our future and that of our country, you must decide who you want as president of the Republic. As a fellow countryman, I ask you to think during the next five days with your conscience about the seriousness of the commitment you have on 8 May and to decide wisely. I ask that you, with your vote, you give me the opportunity to do within government what I have been doing in private throughout my life: to work for Panama and for Panamanians. Thank you very much.
