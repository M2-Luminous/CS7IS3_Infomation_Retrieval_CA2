Preliminary figures gave the advantage to the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance, ARENA, and in a news conference, ARENA candidate Armando Calderon Sol said preliminary results clearly indicate a tendency favoring his party. [Begin Calderon recording] In compliance with the agreement I signed, I cannot declare myself the winner, the victor at this time of the night. I respect the pledge I took. [end recording] Calderon Sol cautiously said TSE figures have given him the victory in the first round. [Begin Calderon recording] TSE figures, the vote tally, have accorded me the victory the first time around, but I cannot say that because I would be violating my pledge and doing what I have criticized Mr. [Ruben] Zamora for doing. He has said there will be runoff elections, and that is not so. [end recording] Meanwhile, Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the leftist coalition supported by the former Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN], said projections show the need for runoff elections. Zamora said the fact it will be necessary to hold runoff elections represents a defeat for the ruling party, ARENA. He also announced the beginning of a battle for electoral purity. [Begin Zamora recording] We are hereby beginning the battle for electoral purity in the runoff elections to make sure all the Salvadorans can vote in the runoff elections so we do not have to face what happened today. Because of TSE's critical deficiencies, thousands of Salvadorans were excluded from exercising their right to vote; thousands of them could not exercise that right because they were not included on the list; because they had a voter registration card but did not appear in the lists; or because their numbers were changed in the lists. Therefore, when they arrived to vote another person had exercised their right to vote. [end recording] If Zamora's charges are confirmed, the runoff elections should be held in April. Approximately 2.3 million Salvadorans registered to vote but the FMLN insisted there were serious irregularities in the process, for example, people who registered and failed to receive their voter registration card.
