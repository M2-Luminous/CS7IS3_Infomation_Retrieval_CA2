A survey conducted yesterday by Datafolha among party leaders and Senate and Chamber of Deputies party bloc members reveals that 35 percent of PMDB followers questioned want the party to support Britto in the presidential race. Former Governor Orestes Quercia came a distant second with barely 10 percent of the votes. The survey conducted during a PMDB leadership meeting in Brasilia confirms the supposition that Quercia dominates the party apparatus. During an interview with FOLHA last weekend, Quercia indicated his candidacy and ruled out Britto's chances: "It is too soon for him," Quercia said. The survey shows that his party does not think so. Nearly 100 PMDB leaders attended the meeting yesterday. Datafolha questioned 72 of them. The numbers reveal more bad news for Quercia: Senator Pedro Simon (RS) [Rio Grande So Sul] appears in third place with 6 percent support, only 4 points below the former Sao Paulo governor. Simon is Quercia's arch-enemy and will work better with Britto. When we add the percentages obtained by Britto and Simon, we can see that the two candidates are preferred by 41 percent of PMDB leaders. Sharing third place with Simon is Goias Governor Iris Rezende, also with 6 percent. Rezende is an old friend of Quercia but is undecided on who he will support. Next in the list (with 3 percent) is Parana Governor Roberto Requiao, another enemy of Quercia. Next, with a mere 1 percent are former President Jose Sarney, Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, and Deputy Odacir Klein -- the Congressional Investigating Committee vice president.
