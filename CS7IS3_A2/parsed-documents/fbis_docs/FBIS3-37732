On the IZVESTIYA newspaper's recent publication on the issue of part of the former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal deployed in Ukraine, he said there were certain forces in Russia who did not want to see any normalization between Kiev and Moscow. Tarasyuk also said that the article should disclose the Russian defence minister's secret letters and cables was not all random. He called for putting the issue on the agenda of the next CIS summit. IZVESTIYA referring to informed sources maintains that commander of the long range nuclear weapons general Igor Sergeyev is no longer in control of the 43rd missile army deployed in Ukraine. Sergeyev says that "Russia is in no way able to monitor the safety of nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine or guarantee their inadvertent use." However, Deputy Defence Minister of Ukraine Ivan Bizhan said that Kiev retained administrative control of the nuclear forces while Russia was still in charge of operational and management control. He said that all functions of the military planning and duty were part of the operational control something that Ukraine would never interfere with. Bizhan described as a lie the paper's allegations saying the Ukrainian nuclear force was grossly undermanned. He put the 43rd army was staffed by 85 percent in officers and 100 percent in non-commissioned officers and men. More than 80 percent of officers are Ukrainian citizens, Bizhan said. The Ukrainian official warned that the IZVESTIYA publication might strain relations between Kiev and Moscow.
