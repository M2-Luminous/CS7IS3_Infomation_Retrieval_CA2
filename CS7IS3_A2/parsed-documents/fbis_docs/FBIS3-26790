Speaking at a UN Security Council session on the situation in Bosnia, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright said that "it is only force plus diplomacy that can stop the slaughter in Sarajevo and break the stalemate in Geneva." On the ten-day deadline for the withdrawal or placement under UN control of heavy weapons of the warring parties in Bosnia, Albright said that NATO would respond in coordination with the United Nations to the artillery or mortar fire that had wreaked the havoc in Sarajevo on February 5. "These decisions are consistent with resolutions approved by this council," she said, and "they do not require further council action." Observers here noted that the statement was in sharp contrast with that of her Russian counterpart Yuriy Vorontsov, who said at the same meeting that "the Security Council should back up its demands by a proper decision." The U.S. ambassador also said that her government believed that the Bosnian conflict should be resolved at the negotiating table, not on the battlefield. "Neither NATO, nor this council," she said, "can or should impose a settlement upon the parties, for an imposed settlement will not be a lasting settlement." However, she added, by seeking to reduce the level of violence around Sarajevo, her government hoped to reinvigorate and lend substance to the negotiating process.
