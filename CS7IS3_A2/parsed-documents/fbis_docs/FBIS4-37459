Appearing before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Peres said Israel would not negotiate with the Palestinians on the next stage until it was sure that the Gaza-Jericho arrangement is working. As David Ze'ev reports from the Knesset, the meeting was dominated by a bitter verbal clash between the foreign minister and the Likud's Beni Begin. [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] The talk at the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee was not infighting within Labor, but a bitter confrontation between Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Likud committee member Beni Begin. On the heels of the recent disclosure of the letter written by the foreign minister on Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem, Begin said it was not the only time Peres had hidden the facts, and the Likud Knesset member accused the foreign minister of purposely deceiving the Knesset. Peres retorted: First you carry out terrorism in the Knesset plenum, now you want to do it in the committee. Begin called Peres a big talker. Peres later called Begin a professional slanderer. And so the personal insults went on and on. A Knesset official at the closed meeting who relayed the dialogue said most committee members were in a state of shock and that Foreign Minister Peres commented at the end of the meeting that he was shocked, saying this kind of meeting is unprecedented. On more mundane affairs, Peres acknowledged to reporters later that Israel's objection was the reason senior PLO official Nabil Sha'th was not visiting Jerusalem though Peres would not elaborate on whether Israel would stop Chairman Yasir 'Arafat from coming to the city. [Peres] I am content with the decision of Nabil Sha'th. We were not approached by 'Arafat, so there is no need to take any steps. [Ze'ev] Peres confirmed that Israel wants to ensure that the Gaza-Jericho arrangement with the Palestinians is working first before negotiations start on the next stage. On Syria, the foreign minister said the delay of the trip to the region by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher did not mean that the negotiations have stopped or failed. [Peres] I think that the secretary feels that he should have more meat in his basket from the Syrian side before he makes the next move, so it takes another few weeks, but by no means can one conclude that the negotiations have stopped or failed. [Ze'ev] They go on, he said. In every negotiation you have the ups and downs, and even interruptions. [end recording]
