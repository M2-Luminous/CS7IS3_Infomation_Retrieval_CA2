Tensions between the two economic powers have heightened, with the United States now threatening to impose sanctions in 30 days unless Japan acts to allow U.S. access to its cellular telephone market. Senator McMullan says there is still time for the two countries to sort out their differences amicably. Over the past few days, Australia has maintained its stance of not taking sides in the dispute. Camille Fennell asked the trade minister why Australia was adopting such a stance: [Begin recording] [McMullan] Well, we are saying very forthrightly that we are opposed to the idea of managed trade, but there is no reason for us to take sides. We strongly have the view that Japan should open its markets and we also strongly have the view that they should not be opened in a discriminatory way -- in a way that discriminates against Australia's interests -- and we are making representations on both those matters to Tokyo and to Washington, and we will continue to do so. [Fennell] Well, I understand you have had our ambassadors in Washington and Tokyo both assessing Australia's point of view. [McMullan] That's right. [Fennell] It appears you haven't had much of a hearing in Washington. What has been the reception in Japan? [McMullan] Well, it is not so much that we haven't had a hearing. I mean, there we are just one voice in the international community. We should not overestimate our influence. It is important that our ambassadors express our views and that we express it forthrightly, because we've got an interest in this matter. But we should not get carried away and say just because the Australian ambassador to the United States expresses a view, or the Australian Government does, that the U.S. and Japan are going to sit bolt upright and say wow, I never thought of that, and change their position. We are seeking to add our voice to the other voices who are saying it is in the international interest -- it is in the self-interest of the U.S. and Japan -- that this matter is resolved amicably, fairly, and in a way that does not particularly inhibit the economic growth in Japan, because their economic recovery is very important to the whole world. But we also know the U.S. economy is looking stronger, but we don't want to see any inhibition to its recovery either, but it is not the one that is particularly vulnerable at the moment. [Fennell] Well, some commentators have suggested that the United States is taking unfair advantage of Japan at the moment, considering it is in its worst recession since World War II. Is there any merit in that? [McMullan] Well, I don't think they are being motivated by that, but I do think that all of us -- the United States included -- have to be sensitive to the impact of any events -- any actions we might take -- on the nascent Japanese recovery, because the demand for American goods, as for Australians, is significantly influenced by how well the Japanese economy does. So it is quite clearly contrary to the self-interests of the United States to impede the Japanese recovery, because we want them to be importing our products; the Americans want them to be importing American products. The balance of the trade deficit won't change if the Japanese economy doesn't have the strength to import American products. [end recording]
