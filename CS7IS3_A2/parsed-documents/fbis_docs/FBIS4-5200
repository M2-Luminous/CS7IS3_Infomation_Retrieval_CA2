Bearain: "P. Penh's smoking photos turn out to be hot air"] [Text] Even by the usual shaky standards of Phnom Penh-Bangkok relations, Cambodia's first Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh dropped a diplomatic hydrogen bomb when he said that the notorious Khmer Rouge [KR] boss, Pol Pot, had escaped the government's recent offensive on Pailin by driving into Thailand. When faced with accusations of support or assistance to the Khmer Rouge, Bangkok's indignant response has always been to dismiss them as groundless and to challenge the accuser to provide proof. Prince Ranariddh, speaking to reporters during a break in Tuesday's first meeting of the second session of the country's parliament, didn't brandish any proof on the spot but said he had photos that Thailand would not be too happy about. The prince's photos allegedly show Pol Pot fleeing Pailin in a convoy of cars and trucks. While this did not immediately seem like damning and conclusive evidence of Thai collusion, the Prince said it was the escape route that was the giveaway -- a smooth tarmac road. "Cambodia does not have such roads," he said. Later on Tuesday, the prince denied he had photos on state-run television and jokingly tried to down-play the whole affair. The prince said that if he had such photos, he would have sold them. "The Japanese press said they would give a million dollars for photos of Pol Pot." In Thailand, meanwhile, the allegations were creating predictable fallout, but given their high-level origin, the Thai response was tempered. "Groundless," and potentially destructive to Thailand's image, said army spokesman Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsana-seni. The prince's cabinet issued a clarification stating the prince had said that he had photos of "Pol Pot's men travelling on a road that we do not have." But three of the Cambodian reporters who were present when the prince spoke told THE NATION they stood by the original translation of the prince's remarks although they added the prince was speaking quickly and digressing a lot. Listening to a tape-recording of the comments, a senior Cambodian news editor expressed his surprise: "Oh my God, he really did say it." One of the prince's advisors, however, said he used the `Pol Pot' in a commonly used generic manner. Prince Ranariddh's reference to the photos did not come in an isolated outburst. The prince strongly criticized Thailand for its repatriating Khmer Rouge refugees, who had fled into Thailand from Pailin, back into guerrilla-controlled zones. The move had already drawn angry words from Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut. Despite the joint communique signed by the prince, fellow co-premier Hun Sen, and Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai which reaffirms Thailand's recognition of the royal government, the prince once again called on Thailand to clarify whether Bangkok supported the guerrillas or the government. Referring to the photos, a government official said it may have been a genuine slip of the tongue or the prince may have been using the advance-retreat style of verbal politics, which his father King Norodom Sihanouk is famous for. The prince made the comments to perhaps put the limelight on Thai-Khmer Rouge connections and then denied the comments for diplomatic damage control, the officials said. If that was the intention it was rather poorly or strategically co-ordinated because once Prince Ranariddh backed off, Foreign Minister Prince Sirivut entered the fray. Speaking in Kuala Lumpur Wednesday, Prince Sirivut accused the Thais of playing a double game". Diplomats here said the Thai government is probably sincere in recognizing Phnom Penh and wishing to cut off links with the recalcitrant Khmer Rouge faction but he questions whether Bangkok's sway extends all the way along the border, large tracts of which are under martial law. The foreign minister reflected this attitude when he asked whether the Thai government and Thai army were "speaking the same language." One Western diplomat said he thought the Thais were not getting fair deal as the Cambodian government portrays the Khmer Rouge as outlaws and expects others to act in a similar way but at the same time the government allows the radical faction to maintain a legitimate presence in Phnom Penh -- the Khmer Rouge have an office in the grounds of the city's royal palace where officials pour through the local media looking for tales of corruption in high places which they then fax to their jungle colleagues who use the information in anti-government diatribes on the guerrillas' clandestine radio. They noted that this latest diplomatic tempest blew up just after the Thais brought the Phnom Penh press corps on a three-day all-expenses-paid visit to border areas in an attempt to lay to rest rumours and allegations of Thai support for the Khmer Rouge. The trip, however, got off to an ominous start when the army chief of the psychological operations [psy-ops] division pointed to a map to show the various posts and checkpoints on the itenerary. The Map, which was just a sketch had Thailand written on one side of the frontier and Democratic Kampuchea on the other. Democratic Kampuchea was the name given to Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge during their 1975-79 reign of terror and is still the faction's official title. Since the Khmer Rouge were ousted from power by a Vietnamese invasion, the country has been called the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the State of Cambodia and now the Kingdom of Cambodia. When a reporter queried the blunder on the map the officer looked puzzled. An official from the embassy in Phnom Penh was seen to cringe as the psy-ops officer was updated by his colleagues. The border trip itself proved inconclusive as, in keeping with a frontier, there were two sides to most of the stories told.
