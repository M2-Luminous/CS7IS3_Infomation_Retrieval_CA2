Indeed, I had intended to abandon my mission. In view of recent events, however, I think that my resignation would not be appropriate or even clearly understood or correctly interpreted at the very time when, for the first time, decisive action had just been taken in Bosnia." LE SOIR, which in an exclusive interview on 25 May 1993 announced the intention of Tadeusz Mazowiecki, former Polish prime minister, special rapporteur of the Human Rights Commission in the former Yugoslavia, to abandon his mission, questioned him again by telephone in Warsaw before the publication of his latest report in Geneva next Monday. However, although Mr. Mazowiecki is wondering about the appropriateness of his departure given the new circumstances created by the ultimatum in Sarajevo, he has not changed his opinion and continues to accuse the international community of "inertia" faced with the "large-scale violations" of human rights in Bosnia. "The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina, prove that human rights only occupy a secondary place on the international political stage," the former Polish prime minister writes. A number of "official measures which have been taken can be regarded as a substitute or an excuse for the international community's political inertia," he said. The special rapporteur then admitted that he had been unable to achieve his main objectives which were "to provide assistance to the victims and reduce the massive scale of human rights violations." It was in August 1992 that the UN Human Rights Commission gave Mr. Mazowiecki the task of drawing up periodic reports on the situation in the former Yugoslavia. Mr. Mazowiecki, who has already published five reports last year, still thinks that all his warnings have been "ignored by the international community." Meanwhile, the policy of "ethnic cleansing," started by the Bosnian Serbs has been "continued without respite," he explained. Last May, Mr. Mazowiecki was extremely critical of the international community. "Pontius Pilate's gesture does not suit me," the first prime minister of postcommunist Poland told us at the time. He is waiting for the meeting in Geneva next Monday before making a decision. The fact remains that he is wondering, as he told us on Tuesday evening, "whether the international community will be capable of continuing decisive action in the defense of human rights in the former Yugoslavia. Withdrawal or UN control of the heavy weapons around Sarajevo does not solve the terrible problems which stem from the serious human rights violations in Sarajevo and elsewhere. I hope, but unfortunately without having any certainty, that the Sarajevo action will be a turning-point and that equally decisive actions will also be taken elsewhere."
