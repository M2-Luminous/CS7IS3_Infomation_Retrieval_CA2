Western understands that the effective date is less than 30 days after the Deputy Secretary places the provisional rates into effect on an interim basis. A waiver of ยง903.21(b) was requested to avoid financial difficulties, and I concur in that waiver.

The P-DP rate schedules shall remain in effect on an interim basis, pending FERC confirmation and approval of them or substitute rates on a final basis, through January 31, 1999 or until superseded. Issued in Washington, DC, January 6, 1994. William H. White, Deputy Secretary.
