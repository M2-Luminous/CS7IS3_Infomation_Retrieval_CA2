Yesterday the results of an international tender for the modernization of the Kazan airport were announced. The winner has proven to be the BOUYGES firm (France). The modification of the airport may involve the reorientation of the network of air communications between Europe and Asia, since the path by way of Kazan saves more than an hour of flight time as compared with flights by way of Sheremetyevo-2. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already reported, it was proposed to the winners in the first stage of the tender that was held in June-August of last year -- the companies BOUYGES (France); Spie Batignolles (France, Turkey); Kodest (Italy); and Jugodrvo (Yugoslavia) -- that they modify the plans in conformity with the terms of the technical assignment. Yesterday the tender committee announced that the winner is the BOUYGES firm, which developed a plan with a total cost of $198,360,000, and which guarantees the complete handing over of the project in three years. [Editorial note] The French BOUYGES construction company was created in 1954. It has branches in 84 countries throughout the world. Its annual turnover is $13 billion and it has 150,000 employees. It is the owner of French television Channel 1. [Editorial note] The Kazan airport provides for the acceptance of 8000 passengers and 113,840 tons of freight a year. In 1992 it was accepted into the Association of International Airports. It has regular air communication with Turkey. The modernization of the Kazan airport stipulates the construction of a runway that can accommodate the operation of aircraft of all types (including the Boeing-747-400 and the IL-96-300), the air terminal building, and a hangar for the technical servicing of aircraft. Subsequently a technical service center, freight terminals, and a hotel will be built. According to BOUYGES commercial director Pierre Boiche, the modernization will make it possible to increase the airport's handling capacity to 1000 passengers an hour. The project stipulates the creation of a joint enterprise in which 51 percent of the shares will belong to Tatarstan, and 49 percent to an association of foreign firms that is headed by BOUYGES. Tatarstan's share, as viewed by the project initiators, is in the form of offering the French side the right to use the Kazan airport, including the ground on which it is located, for a period of no less than 25 years. France's investment includes monetary funds, technologies, and participation in the construction. It is planned to finance the project along two credit lines: from the French government and the YeBRR [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] at 7 percent annual interest. M. Boiche also mentioned as possible investors the French companies Thomson, Alcatel, and Total. In order to obtain credit, Tatarstan government guarantees will be required. According to Valeriy Stekolshchikov, vice-premier of Tatarstan and chairman of the tender commission, it is planned to begin implementing the project during the current year. Plans for constructing new air-transportation centers in the CIS have arisen not only in Tatarstan. People in St. Petersburg are considering the possibility of expanding the Pulkovo airport in order to convert it into a center for air shipments in the northwest region of Russia. This may also exert an influence on reducing the status of Sheremetyevo-2 as the main international airport in the CIS. [Note, signed "Business Department"] The remodeling of the Kazan airport, which does not yet meet the requirements that are made for a major world-class air-transportation center, presupposes the future competition between the Kazan airport and Sheremetyevo-2, which in the CIS today is the basic point where international air lines intersect. One cannot fail to mention the scheme that was proposed for the first time in projects of this type -- the scheme for "backup" insuring of the risk taken by the foreign partner, when, in addition to the granting of governmental guarantees, what is practically the taking of the airport under pledge is proposed. Tatarstan's agreement to this attests to the intention to construct the airport at any price. In general, similar airports are constructed abroad only after the confirmation of the intentions to use it on the part of the leading air companies. However, the representations of British Airways, Air France, and Lufthansa have not yet commented on their actions in this instance, although the possibility that Kazan can accept Boeing-747 liners, which are the basic aircraft for the long-distance lines of the leading air carriers in the world, cannot fail to attract the attention of those carriers.
