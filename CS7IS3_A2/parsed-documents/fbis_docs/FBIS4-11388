FBIS4-11388 "drlat080_o_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 Colombia Gaviria Reacts to Charges of Bowing to U.S. Gaviria Reacts to Charges of Bowing to U.S. PA2604021794 Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal A in Spanish 0003 GMT 26 Apr 94 PA2604021794 Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal A Spanish BFN [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota and immediately the hornets nest went wild. His strong statements against President Cesar Gaviria and other government officials forced the president to reply to the controversial judicial official's criticism. Gaviria spoke in terms stronger than the ones Colombians are used to hearing from him. [Begin recording] [Reporter] What is happening with Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff? [Gaviria] In terms of our relationship, we have differences of a juridical nature, and we believe some of his decisions have been inappropriate. That is all. [Reporter] Mr. President, is your government servile? [Gaviria] Yes, the prosecutor's portrayal of the president was a bit offensive. I regret his use of such brazen language. I will not answer him in similar terms at any time. Colombia is starting to experience difficulties in the United States for statements that, as the prosecutor himself has noted, the president had warned him about. [Reporter] Skeptically, it has been said that you did not give the prosecutor your full support because you were safeguarding your election to the OAS post. [Gaviria] I believe the prosecutor has secretly managed to spread this rumor. I believe it is extremely unfair. Ours is a balanced, reasonable position. Our doubts are based on the law, or simply based on what is appropriate. We are not going to abandon our position simply because this type of argument is being raised. In this specific case, I believe we are doing great harm to the country by exploiting these sentiments instead of explaining our decisions. [Reporter] Has the prosecutor's statement upset you? [Gaviria] I believe it is in Colombia's best interests that we present a clear and consistent policy on drug trafficking to the international community. This would be good for the country. We want to incorporate the country into the world economy and into world markets. It is highly desirable that this country have a good image abroad. It is very desirable for Colombians that Colombia have a good image abroad. You can be sure that, despite all the ruckus and confrontation, the country's interests, in the long run, are rooted in this. [end recording] Prosecutor Gustavo de Greiff stated in a communique issued today, that, during his stay in the United States he denied to the media that he had offered pardons to drug traffickers. Prosecutor General de Greiff also said judicial cooperation could not be accepted if it was conditioned on having to hold prior consultations on the decision to use certain evidence with a country that supplied such evidence -- in this case, the United States. The prosecutor also urged U.S. authorities to stop their unjustified attacks on Colombian officials, especially him. He called on the U.S. Government to continue cooperating by exchanging evidence to further the struggle to end the worldwide scourge of drug trafficking.
