It coincided with the arrival here of the Russian contingent. Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian Federation president's special representative for the former Yugoslavia, declared this in conversation with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent. He visited the Bosnian capital Sunday during another working tour of the region for the purpose of developing the peace trend which has become apparent in the city and extending it to the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Within the framework of the consultations in Sarajevo the Russian diplomat held talks with Alija Izetbegovic, leader of the Bosnian Muslims. In Pale he met with Nikola Kolevic, member of the leadership of the Bosnian Serb community. Ways to develop the peace process after the Croat and Muslim sides signed the plans to create a Croat-Muslim federation in Bosnia were the object of discussion. Then V. Churkin visited the Russian battalion's billet in the capital's Vraca district and went to one of the observation posts where Russian "blue helmets" are serving. In conversation with servicemen the Russian Federation president's special representative rated highly the speed with which the battalion has settled in in its new location and begun tackling very difficult peacemaking tasks. Such effectiveness, he emphasized, elicits a feeling of pride in Russia's Armed Forces. Another subject was also touched upon -- the resolution of the problems of a psychological kind which the Bosnian Muslim side experienced at first in connection with the so unexpected arrival of the Russian contingent. As is known, some representatives of the Muslim leadership have made nervous and at times even irresponsible statements about this. For example, they have called the Russian battalion an occupying battalion. In Churkin's opinion, this problem has now been eliminated. On the conclusion of his visit to "Rusbat-2," as the Russian contingent in Sarajevo is now being called, Vitaliy Churkin once again emphasized the importance of Russian participation in UN peacemaking operations. Joint service in an important cause with the French, the British, and representatives of other states, he emphasized, is far more useful for arranging cooperation between armies than organizing conferences.
