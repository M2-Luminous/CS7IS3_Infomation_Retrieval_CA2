Gulan: "We Will Open the Roads, Providing Certain Concessions Are Made"] [Text] At the start of the normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and Croatia, the possibility arises of initiating the process of dealing with the Krajina-Croat problems that need to be solved. Namely, Croatia and the republic of Serbian Krajina have things to discuss, but only peacefully and with mutual respect. The opening of a Croat office in Belgrade and a Yugoslav one in Zagreb can only help and speed things up, says Slobodan Jarcevic, interior minister in the government of the republic of Serbian Krajina. I believe that the republic of Serbian Krajina was not discussed when the agreement between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia was signed. Perhaps Croatia is hoping that Yugoslavia will help it to reintegrate the republic of Serbian Krajina into the Croatian borders as defined by AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia], but that is just an illusion. This is the fifth year that the republic of Serbian Krajina has not been a part of Croatia, and that must be accepted. Relations between the republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia will depend solely on Croatia's readiness to recognize our state, stressed Slobodan Jarcevic. The agreement between Yugoslavia and Croatia pertains only to those areas that are under Croatian control and that are not controversial. The peace process means the end of combat activity on the borders of the republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia. There can be no discussion abut the republic of Serbian Krajina's territories without the legitimate representatives of the republic of Serbian Krajina, says Jarcevic. Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are two sovereign states and, as such, they can sign agreements. The republic of Serbian Krajina never conditioned Yugoslavia's position toward Croatia. However, a similar agreement between the republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia cannot be expected, because this would mean that Croatia has recognized the republic of Serbian Krajina. And it will most certainly not be the one to do so first. On the contrary. At the moment, no one wishes to sign a similar agreement with us, because both the Croatian and Muslim sides in Bosnia -- with which we share borders -- are adhering to the conclusions of the international community according to which our right to statehood has not been recognized. One of the important elements of the Yugoslav-Croatian agreement is certainly the anticipated opening of roads, that is, the Belgrade-Zagreb highway, a part of which runs through the republic of Serbian Krajina's territory. According to Slobodan Jarcevic, it will be possible to open the highway if Croatia is willing to make certain concessions to the republic of Serbian Krajina. We primarily have in mind the transit route to Hungary through Western Slavonia. All passengers travelling through the republic of Serbian Krajina will be subject to our laws. We shall have border crossings like any other state. For allowing the Croatian railroad to run through Knin, we shall demand to be allowed to use of one of the ports on the Croatian coast. Or, for example, we can solve the problem of supplying Zadar with water from the Zrmanja River, but in return, the Croat side has to enable the production of electric power at the Obrovac hydro-electric power plant, says Jarcevic. Even before the war, some vital parts of the generator were dismantled and taken to Karlovac. The Krajina authorities understand the Croats' problems in trying to establish a traffic route connecting the north and the south, but we will demand a port in return for allowing the passage of trains from Zagreb to Split. Similar standards will be applied in the case of the highway, the oil pipeline, and telecommunications. We understand them, but we are also protecting our interests, which are unavoidable in a state whose existence has entered its fifth calendar year, stressed Slobodan Jarcevic.
