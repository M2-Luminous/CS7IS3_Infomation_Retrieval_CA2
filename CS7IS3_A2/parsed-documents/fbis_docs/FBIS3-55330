If U.S. companies see no advantages, they will not go to Russia," said Anatoliy Porokhovskiy, deputy head of the Institute of the U.S. and Canada Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in an interview with ITAR-TASS timed to coincide with the issue of the "diplomatic courier" bulletin devoted to the forthcoming visit of the U.S. President Bill Clinton to Russia. Porokhovskiy said that "cherishing hopes that the U.S. will spend money only because Russia needs help is pointless. One must take into account that whenever the U.S. allocates funds to support this or that country, primarily, it will give support to their own companies which will provide this aid, i.e. up to 80 per cent of funds will be realised trough American private business and only 20 per cent of the allocated amount will directly reach facilities on the territory of our country." "What we can hope for is the acceleration of processes which already began and the creation of a favourable atmosphere for the American business in Russia. As for the main task, we have to resolve it by ourselves. In this country, pinning hopes on the American capital to take us out of the situation in which we found ourselves will be another illusion, to put it mildly," Porokhovskiy said. "It is necessary to precisely forecast what will be advantageous to our country and not to confine ourselves to only one variant in the search for the best option. Apart from America, there are Europe, Japan and other countries. We should take a flexible and active economic position which would clearly show that we come out for the development of relations with all countries, but on a mutually advantageous basis, which is accepted in business circles of any country," Porokhovskiy said.
