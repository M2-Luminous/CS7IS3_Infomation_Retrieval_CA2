All these painful topical problems in our education system were described in an appeal to the Supreme Kenges deputies. The appeal contains a concept of the education reform on all levels. It is a matter of prestige for the new parliament to give total support for national education. It was stated that today, more than ever before, it is necessary to take legal measures to actively protect and support education. Laws should aim at establishment of a common educational space within the framework of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly. It is an open secret that economic problems have badly affected the preschool educational system. It is here that formation of new citizens begins. However, hundreds of nurseries are closed down, about 60 percent of children have no access to these institutions, and their parents do not receive reimbursement. Against the background of the overall economic trouble the most problematic issues are organization of the study process, of nourishment and every day consumer services for children and teenagers. During the previous three years enrollment to technical vocational schools decreased by one third, and the number of unemployed graduates increased by a factor of eight. Some of these youngsters are employed in commerce, and others are idle, which means they can potentially join the criminal world. The prestige and priority of education are impossible without social protection for educational establishments, their staff and students, without financial help. Hopes are pinned on local budgets. The state does not allocate sufficient money for education. Over 25,000 teachers need home improvement. They lose hope and quit -- only last year over 30,000 teachers left the education field, and today schools need over 17,000 teachers. The reform, which will help to overcome the crisis envisages a better budgeting from the state and support for nonstate budgeting of schools, vocational schools, and nurseries. Some of the vocational schools will be transformed into colleges, or technical lyceums, and their graduates will have bachelors' degrees. The reform envisages a multilevel structure, a new mechanism for giving jobs to graduates and setting up of a research institute of the higher school problems. The journalists were particularly interested in a new system of comprehensive testing prior to enrollment to universities. On 26 July for the first ever time all universities of Almaty will give tests checked by computers, so as to exclude lack of objectivity and nepotism. [passage omitted] The Importance of a new information technology, intensive methods of teaching, as well as of the trilingual principle (Kazakh, Russian, and foreign languages) and enhancement of training in social and liberal arts was stressed at the news conference. Over 3,000 Kazakhstanis are currently educated abroad. These are talented children who merit the elite-type education. In future, the network of elite-type educational institutions will be increased, and computer databases will be created to find out talented young people.
