[22 June] "It is not a redistribution budget; it's a reconstruction budget," she said. "It is only by increasing the economic pie that the underprivileged can benefit from wealth redistribution...The only way the government can sustain an increase in revenue is by growing the tax base." The one-off five per cent levy to finance the country's transition to democracy would hurt high-income individuals without curbing consumer spending because most breadwinners were not affected. The deficit before borrowing of R29.6 billion [rand] was not onerous because it included transition costs of R4 billion. Mrs de Kock said Syfrets expected a negative reaction initially from capital markets but there was potential for lower bond yields. The financial rand would not be abolished in the next six months, she said. The corporate tax rate cut would offset the transition levy. Companies with low dividend cover would most likely be adversely affected, while those with average cover would lose about four per cent in earnings per share. Beer and tobacco tax rises would not substantially affect sales volumes. The construction sector had reacted positively to pre-budget announcements on job creation and public works programmes, Mrs de Kock said.
