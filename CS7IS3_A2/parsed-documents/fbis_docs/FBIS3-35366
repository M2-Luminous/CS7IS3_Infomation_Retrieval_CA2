They were reacting to Dr. al-Tibi's remarks that a delegation of Israeli Arab Likud supporters is not welcome in Tunis, and that 'Arafat is not interested in meeting them. Ayub Qara', a member of the Likud's secretariat, told our correspondent Yo'el Dar that it was Dr. al-Tibi who approached the Druze activists and asked them to hand him names of Likud supporters in key positions who would be willing to travel to Tunis and help promote the peace process. Qara' said that Arab members of the Likud Central Committee want to be a bridge to peace and contribute to the ongoing process.
