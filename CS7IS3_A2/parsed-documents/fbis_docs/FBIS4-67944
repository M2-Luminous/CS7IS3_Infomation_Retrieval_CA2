The message said the fuel bars of the atomic reactor would be changed in a few weeks. Sources in Vienna said the proposal was North Korea's first response toward the demand by the world community for additional international inspections of their nuclear facilities. In the message, North Korea did not say whether they would accept additional inspections of six other nuclear facilities. North Korea claims that the atomic reactor has been in operation since 1986 and that they never changed its fuel bars after 1989 when some fuel bars were changed due to a mechanical trouble, during which they said they extracted 90 grams of plutonium on an experimental basis. A YONHAP report from Berlin said IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer confirmed that a contact of some sort was going on with North Korea. He said that IAEA Director-General Hans Blix would decide whether to accept the North Korean proposal probably Thursday afternoon. The IAEA had an emergency meeting Thursday morning to review the North Korean overture, the report said.
