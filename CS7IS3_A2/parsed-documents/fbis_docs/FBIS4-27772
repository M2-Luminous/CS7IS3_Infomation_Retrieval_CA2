FBIS4-27772 "dreas108__a94003" FBIS-EAS-94-108-A Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Government To Seek UNSC Warning to DPRK Government To Seek UNSC Warning to DPRK OW0306112694 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 3 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0306112694 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] A top Foreign Ministry official disclosed on 2 June that the government has decided that it will ask the UN Security Council [UNSC] to issue a warning to the DPRK (North Korea). The government decided that this is how it plans to deal with the issue of suspected development of nuclear weapons by North Korea in view of the Japan-U.S.-ROK meeting to be held in Washington on 4 June to discuss the issue. The same official indicated that the Washington meeting will be held so the three nations can act in concert, with an eye on the UNSC meeting. He also pointed out that two options were available -- a resolution to impose sanctions or a resolution of warning against North Korea. Considering that the PRC would have no choice but to veto a resolution for imposing sanctions, the official indicated the government plans to ask the UNSC to issue a warning against North Korea. So far, the UNSC has twice adopted a presidential statement asking North Korea to follow IAEA regulations on inspection of its nuclear facilities. Although a warning is different from sanctions, it is expected that this will be a firmer action than a presidential statement.
