The Action Committee for Renewal (CAR), 36 seats, and the Union for Democracy (UTD), seven seats, said in a joint statement that they expected to form a new government, given that they held an absolute majority of parliament's 81 seats. Under the Constitution, military ruler General Gnassingbe Eyadema, in power since 1967, has to pick a prime minister from the parliamentary majority. He began consultations with all party chiefs Tuesday. The Togolese People's Rally, Eyadema's mainstay for a quarter of a century as the only legal party, won 35 seats in last month's two-round poll. UTD leader Edem Kodjo, once a close associate of Eyadema until they fell out in the 1980s, caused consternation in opposition ranks when the Supreme Court issued the official results Monday. He repudiated a mid-election pact with the CAR, suspicious that the bigger movement intended turning his group into a mere appendage. Nobody could claim the 41-seat majority in Parliament without his party, which had a "pivotal" role and intended exercising it, Kodjo insisted. CAR chief Yao Agboyibor had hailed the election results as a victory for the people and said he was sure Eyadema's consultations on the appointment of new government leaders "will lead to choices in line with the voting. Any other outcome would be a scandal." Agboyibor, 51, a lawyer, is widely expected to be named as new premier.
