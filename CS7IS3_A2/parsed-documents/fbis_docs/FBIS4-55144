He is visiting at the invitation of Bulgarian Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov as head of a delegation of the Austrian Federal Ministry of National Defence. The purpose of the visit is to specify the forms of future cooperation between the Defence Ministries and the armies of the two countries proceeding from the documents which have been signed so far. "Cooperation between the military ministries of Austria and Bulgaria is very good: Their joint work is in the interest of the smaller European states. Promising achievements have been made and I am convinced that we will build a good relationship in a relatively brief period of time", Dr. Fasslabend said after his meeting with the Bulgarian defence minister. The two sides discussed the state of bilateral contacts and the political situation in the Balkans. "We tried to make a general assessment of the political situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. We established that the opinions of the two governments coincide on almost all issues," Dr. Fasslabend said. The situation in the former Yugoslavia is of great interest for both countries," Austria's defence minister told journalists today. The security of both countries depends to a great extend on finding an adequate solution to this problem, Dr. Fasslabend believes. Though the relations between Bulgaria and Austria are not burdened by complicated historical circumstances, cooperation between the armies of the two countries till the fall of the totalitarian regime in 1989 was reduced to purely symbolical contacts because of the existing bloc structures in Europe.
