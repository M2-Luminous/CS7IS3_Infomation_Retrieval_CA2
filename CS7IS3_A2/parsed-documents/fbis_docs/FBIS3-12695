A series of resignations have been noted, which is quite unfortunate. "From Mauritania, Salem Meshbour Salem reports:" [Begin Salem recording] "The UDP represents the third political force in Mauritania, after Maaouiya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya's ruling Democratic and Social Republican Party and Ahmed Ould Daddah's Union of Democratic Forces, which is the leading opposition party. The UDP was established in June 1993 by Hamdi Ould Moukniess, a former foreign minister between 1960 to 1978 under the First Republic." At the time he established the party, Moukniess, who was already very famous in his country, was joined by most of the former ministers of Mauritania's first president, Moctar Ould Dada, with the aim of initiating dialogue between the government and the opposition to resolve the serious problems confronting Mauritania. "Among these problems was national unity, since the fabric of the community had been seriously damaged in 1986, 1987, and especially 1989 during the incidents with Senegal. UDP leader Moukniess belongs to the first group of Mauritanian intellectuals, who rejected the falsification of the cultural identity of the various communities which compose the Mauritanian people." For Moukniess, Mauritania belongs to both the Arabo-Berbers and the Negro-Africans, while nationalists believe that Mauritania is simply an Arab country. "The UDP, which straightaway involved itself in the real problems confronting Mauritania, has just suffered a staggering blow with the resignation of many key personalities from its executive committee. The reason given was differences over political policy. Significant among those who have left are, Mohamed Ali Cherif, former secretary general of the presidency of the Republic under Moctar Ould Dada and chairman of the external relations committee of the party; [name indistinct], chairman of the economic committee; Yarba Ould Tayir, youth and sports officer; and [name indistinct], UDP information officer. The party leadership has not reacted yet to the founding members' resignation. Their departure, of course, weakens the ranks of the Mauritanian opposition." [end recording]
