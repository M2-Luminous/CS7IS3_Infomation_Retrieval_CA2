Grossman, director of the Hong Kong Office of Quantum Financial Services, Inc.: "Futures Industry Needs Self- Regulation"] [Text] During the past two years, the futures industry in China has grown faster than even the most ardent optimists could have anticipated. Exchanges have sprung up in major commercial centres, and brokerage firms, trading on both domestic and international markets, have multiplied. Along with this progress, however, has come concern. Most notably, business has expanded far more quickly than regulation, leaving a gap that has attracted the unwary and the unscrupulous. In response, the central government is adopting comprehensive regulations governing the futures industry. This is perhaps the right time to set up a futures industry self- regulatory organization to enhance its enforcement capabilities. The situation in China's futures industry is similar to that of the U.S. in the 1970's. At that time, this sector of the U.S. economy was loosely regulated by the Commodity Exchange Authority (CEA), an office within the Department of Agriculture. The CEA concentrated on domestic agricultural futures, while products such as coffee, sugar and metals were unregulated. In addition, there was no formal, well-enforced registration process for persons handling customers' funds and orders. This provided a breeding ground for sharp operators who took advantage of unsuspecting customers. Not surprisingly, scandals began to emerge. As a result, the U.S. Congress passed amendments to the Commodity Exchanges Act in 1974, which, among other things, created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC was set up as an independent federal regulatory agency. It was given responsibility for registering industry professionals; approving rules, regulations, and new contracts of futures exchanges; establishing minimum financial standards and adopting trading standards for futures brokers; and creating a dispute procedure. Equally important, the CFTC was assigned the responsibility of enforcing the rules it adopted. Initially, the CFTC had only 200 employees. Today it has about 700. But with such a small staff and limited resources, it was apparent that enforcement of the strict new provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act would be difficult. So the CFTC adopted regulations requiring each exchange to set up its own rules, subject to CFTC approval, and to enforce these rules on all the exchange's members. The CFTC had two reasons for requiring the exchanges to conduct self-regulation. First, it wanted to economize on its own resources which are funded by tax-payers' money. Second, by delegating auditing and enforcement responsibilities to the exchanges, the CFTC intended to take advantage of the fact that the exchanges would be in the best position to monitor the daily activities of their members and obtain relevant market information. Exchange self-regulation was successful in promoting fair markets and building confidence on the part of both domestic and international customers. However, there was a problem, not every futures broker was a member of a futures exchange. And because of the CFTC's limited resources, these brokers were able to avoid strict government scrutiny of their activities. In response, the CFTC-approved National Futures Association was set up on October 1, 1982, to audit and monitor non-exchange members. The industry endorsed the concept of self-regulation for three reasons. First, it could promote high standards of professional conduct and financial responsibility. Second, the industry believed that a private sector self- regulatory organization could operate with a high degree of efficiency and expertise. Third, it was anticipated that a private sector self-regulatory organization could operate more economically than the CFTC. In this regard, the NFA's funding, which comes from customer transaction fees of $0.20 per round turn for each futures contract and $0.12 per side for each option contract, are generally accepted to be less than the "user fees" the CFTC probably would have assessed to conduct similar activities. In the past 12 years, the combination of self-regulation by the exchanges and the NFA has provided a very efficient and cost- effective supplement to government regulation. At this critical period in the development of China's futures industry and futures regulatory system, it may be appropriate to consider setting up China's own futures industry self-regulatory organization.
