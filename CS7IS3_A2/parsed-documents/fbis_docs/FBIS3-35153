We understand from the statements made after the last round of talks that ended yesterday in Taba that there is much hope and optimism, that some points have been concluded, and that the resumption of the talks next week in Cairo will almost be a summing up of the talks. What is the picture on the evening of this Friday? [Sha'th] Undoubtedly, progress has been made. This progress stems from the fact that we have reached the last part of these talks. There was a prior understanding on numerous components of this part. Now we are at the final drafting stage. Therefore, we managed to wrap up an important part relating to the Palestinian police force, security measures, and security liaison. We also wrapped up a significant part of the transfer of civilian powers. We discussed in detail the issue of the general amnesty of prisoners and release of prisoners. We have begun the final drafting of the overall preamble, or the overall agreement. I believe that it was an important and successful week. [Isma'il] I would like to ask you about two issues. First of all, regarding the Palestinian police force -- as far as I remember you demanded 15,000 policemen and Israel gave its consent for 6,000. What are the chances of reaching a settlement on this issue? [Sha'th] In fact, I do not wish to discuss numbers. I believe that discussing such details will harm the achievement of a final result, which requires both sides to arrive at real figures that will lead to a conclusion. We want to ensure stability for the Palestinian resident. We wish to provide the security that every Palestinian and Israeli resident wants. The attainment of this security requires an efficient and capable police force apart from all economic and political safety measures, participation, and democracy. Therefore, the issue is not only one of figures. It is a comprehensive perception of the issue. [Isam'il] It seems that you are in agreement with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres who was interviewed today by Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew. He almost made the same remarks. He said that figures are not important and, ultimately, the issue must be settled. There is hope then. [Sha'th] I believe that next week we will manage to settle this matter. [Isma'il] The other issue which I wanted to ask you about is the release of prisoners, which you have been demanding from the outset. The PLO chairman raised this issue once more today in Holland. On the other hand, Israel says that in accordance with the annual custom at the 'Id al-Fitr or at festivals and other occasions, it releases prisoners. Can you tell us anything new about this issue? [Sha'th] In fact, the Israeli authorities' release on certain occasions -- during Ramadan and the 'Id al-Fitr -- of detainees whose prison terms have ended or are about to end is different from what we are talking about. We are talking about a comprehensive release as part of this agreement. We are talking about an integral timetble. Therefore, this goes beyond responding only to humanitarian and religious requirements and occasions to ending a situation that existed due to the presence of the occupation and its resistance. Now we are heading toward a new situation. Therefore, all those who were part of the previous situation of occupation and resistance should be released. [Isma'il] This is your demand, but what is the reality? What are the contacts between you and the Israeli authorities? Can we give the good news to our viewers in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip that you have received promises on the release of prisoners? [Sha'th] Yes, I believe that as soon as the agreement is signed, a few thousand will be released. However, after this there will be a timetable for a gradual release within framework of the peaceful measures that we are endeavoring to achieve and within context of the arrival of the Palestinian authority and its shouldering of responsibility. [Isma'il] Dr. Nabil, my understanding then is that during the month of Ramadan an agreement will be signed and practical work will begin. [Sha'th] I hope so. You know that such issues are not subject to negotiating considerations alone but to numerous political considerations. I believe that we can reach an agreement by the 'Id al-Fitr [on or about 13 March] at the latest so that the feast may have more than one meaning. For several reasons, however, it is difficult for one to make an accurate prediction. If not by this feast, then the agreement will be reached very close to it. I hope, however that we will sign before this feast, God willing. [passage omitted] [Isma'il] I understand that Cairo is aware of all Israeli-Palestinian contacts and of all the negotiations' secrets. Are the other parties, specially Syria, also aware of what is taking place in the talks? [Sha'th] Fraternal Syria and all Arab and international parties concerned are briefed about the results of our work. Naturally, however, not as much as the two neighboring and principal Arab parties, namely, Egypt and Jordan. The talks are being conducted in Egypt and we have a special relationship with Jordan. Therefore, the Egyptian and Jordanian Governments are provided with detailed information, but the other governments are provided with less detail and only periodically. [Isma'il] Have you heard that an Israeli Arab delegation might be visiting Damascus to offer condolences to President al-Asad on Basil's death? [Sha'th] I believe that the emotions of our sons everywhere regarding the tragedy that struck President Hafiz al-Asad are real and sincere. [Isma'il] But the significant thing is that the Syrian authorities have given their approval for such a step for the first time. Do you see any political meaning or indication by this? [Sha'th] There is no doubt that there are numerous meanings and indications in any such act. However, it is also a framework for interaction. Undoubtedly, there are also political considerations in this act. [Isma'il] Dr. Nabil, we thank you for coming to the studio in Cairo. Every viewer is now probably asking: What will be the outcome? What can you say to the viewers in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip this evening in one minute? [Sha'th] I say to them that the problem is difficult and that we are embarking on building an entity and a homeland in which there will be freedom, self-confidence, and hopes for the future. I call on them to be patient. I believe that we will be on the threshhold of this new challenge. [Isma'il] We thank Dr. Nabil Sha'th for this interview, the first one in our program via direct relay from Cairo. Our correspondents have met with you in Tunis and Taba, but it is the first time that we are meeting with Cairo and Dr. Nabil Sha'th via satellite. God willing, we will have other meetings with you. [Sha'th] Thank you.
