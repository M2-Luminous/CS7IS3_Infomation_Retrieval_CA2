FBIS4-59504 "drnes094_l_94001" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 ISRAEL Jericho Turned Over to Palestinian Control Jericho Turned Over to Palestinian Control TA1305115894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1100 GMT 13 May 94 TA1305115894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] The town of Jericho and its environs were turned over to Palestinian control approximately 30 minutes ago. Major General Ilan Biran, the commander of the Central Command, shook the head of General Hajj 'Isma'il, the commander of the Palestinian al-Aqsa Brigade, wished him success in his mission, and offered the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] cooperation. Maj. Gen. Biran said that the IDF troops had implemented the withdrawal with full success. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that 462 Palestinian policemen have entered Jericho with approximately another 1,000 expected to arrive later. Local residents enthusiastically welcomed the Palestinian policemen and flew PLO flags from their cars. Maj. Gen. Biran signed an order banning Israeli citizens from entering the Palestinian autonomous areas over the coming days. The decree went into effect as soon as the Palestinian police assumed responsibility for the area. An IDF spokesman asserted that the major general signed the order due to security considerations. The entrance of Israelis into the Jericho area will only be permitted after security conditions there make this possible. Yesterday, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq held up the entry of Palestinian policemen from Jordan and Rafah for many hours after the PLO failed to meet the conditions of the agreement and did not transfer a list with the names of the members of the Palestinian authority to Israel. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that this was a condition stipulated by the agreement signed by the PLO and Israel and Yasir 'Arafat promised to send the list by last Wednesday [11 May]. However, Israel was only given a partial list of 15 names out of the 24 members of the Palestinian authority late last night. Only then were the policemen permitted to cross the border checkpoints.
