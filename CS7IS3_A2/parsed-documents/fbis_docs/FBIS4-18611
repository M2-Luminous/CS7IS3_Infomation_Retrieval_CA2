Balladur's visit comes three months after Paris and Beijing finally made up following a row over French warplane sales to Taiwan in 1992, which cost French firms hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade with China. His three-day visit to Beijing starting Thursday -- the first by a French Government leader since 1978 -- is aimed at bringing French companies back into the Chinese market. Balladur said Tuesday it was in France's interest to have close and friendly relations with China, which he said was one of the world's great powers. But he remained cagey in the run-up to his three-day visit to Beijing about whether he would raise the issue of human rights with Chinese leaders, despite pressure from two French humanitarian groups to do so. Press rights campaign group Reporters sans Frontieres urged Balladur to intervene on behalf of 24 imprisoned Chinese journalists, and the Support Committee for the Tibetan People called for help to suffering Tibetan and Chinese people. Balladur, speaking Tuesday on French television, said France could not remain indifferent to human rights issues but when questioned he said he had no further comment on the arrest of leading dissident Wei Jingsheng. Balladur's visit is the latest in a line of visits by Western leaders renewing relations with Beijing after its violent suppression of the pro-democracy movement in 1989.
