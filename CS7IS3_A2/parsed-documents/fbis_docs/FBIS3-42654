The economic reforms that are being conducted are still not having the necessary effect either on the sphere of turnover or on the development of production in all branches of the economy. Privatization and Destatization of the Economy The most widespread method of privatization is sale by commercial competition and auction. The prevailing sale price exceeds the initial one by a factor of 15. The number of enterprises that have changed form of ownership through the auction method is growing. Twenty-eight such enterprises were counted in the oblast on 1 September; of these, 10 chose the first variant of privileges, 17--the second, and 1--the third. The size of authorized capital of joint-stock companies totals 1.44 billion rubles [R]. In the structure of privatized enterprises, enterprises in trade (46 percent), everyday services (22 percent), and public catering (9 percent) predominate. As before, the oblast center leads in the number of privatized facilities in the oblast (93 enterprises), followed by Yagodninskiy, Tenkinskiy, and Susumanskiy Rayons. According to the status on 1 October, eight enterprises were privatized in industry: the Khasynskiy Building Materials Plant, Central Lespromkhoz, the AO [joint-stock company] Idyeya, 100 NKhP [petrochemical enterprise]--Magadan, the sausage factory, the Sever-Evenskiy Fish Plant, Vtorchermet [state trust for the preparation and processing of scrap nonferrous metals], and the AO Magadanenergo [Magadan Power]. In a number of rayons, work on the establishment of peasant (farmer) units has become somewhat more brisk. By 1 October in the oblast they numbered 317, with a land area of 2,544,000 hectares, Of these, 304 farms are engaged in livestock raising and plant growing. In nine months of this year, 9,100 apartments with a total area of 410,000 square meters were privatized in the oblast at a cost of R473 million, 9 percent of these in September. In the period that has passed, more than 5,200 applications to conduct privatization were filed. In comparison with nine months of last year, the extent of privatization in the oblast increased by a factor of 2.7. This is associated with activation of the process of privatization in the city of Magadan. Finances and Monetary Circulation Enterprises and organizations of the oblast received profits of 71.9 billion rubles [R] in January-August of this year. Enterprises of the state sector get 99 percent of all profits, and its main part--R60.5 billion (84 percent) is received by industrial enterprises. The measures being undertaken to stabilize the national economy will not lead the economy of the oblast out of the spin of the "inflationary spiral." As before, a large number of unprofitable and costly enterprises are functioning. At the beginning of September their share was 39 percent on average for the national economy; however, it was significantly higher in individual branches: in everyday services for the population--75 percent, trade--57 percent, communications--46 percent. The overall total of financial losses reached R6 billion. The continuing nonpayments crisis is complicating the financial situation of enterprises. Nonpayments to suppliers in industrial and construction enterprises amounted to R47.2 billion, increasing in August by 12 percent, the indebtedness of purchasers--by R111.8 billion (38 percent). Price and Wage Rate Indices The increase in prices continued in January-September of this year. Consumer prices for goods and services in this period grew by a factor of 24.8. The rates of increase in consumer prices for the quarter on the average amounted to: January-March--21.1 percent, April-June--23.5 percent, and July-September--33.2 percent. The highest rate in price increases occurred in paid services rendered to the population. Since the beginning of the year, prices and wage rates for services requiring payment grew by a factor of 113.8, which exceeds the rate of increase of consumer prices for all goods by a factor of 16.7. The most significant increase in prices occurred in: apartment rent in buildings of the state housing fund (by a factor of 525.3), dormitory rent (by a factor of 131.9), services of a legal nature (by a factor of 377.4), public bath and shower services (by a factor of 175.7), services for the maintenance of children in preschool institutions (by a factor of 51.8), intercity telephone communications (by a factor of 31.1), and the cost of concert tickets (by a factor of 28.5). Everyday services since the beginning of the year increased in price by a factor of 25.5. Consumer prices for all consumer goods increased since the beginning of the year by a factor of 6.8, and in September, 31.8 percent. In the commodity group structure, consumer prices for food products have a higher rate of growth. The average monthly rate of price increases for foodstuffs amounted to 26 percent, and for industrial commodities--21 percent. The cost of a minimum consumer selection of 19 main food products in the oblast center in September amounted to R51,406, or, for example, more than in the city of Vladivostok by a factor of 1.8. The Social Sphere The Demographic Situation The demographic situation in the oblast remains difficult. This year for the first time the oblast became one of those oblasts with natural population loss, when the number of deaths exceeds the number of births. Regardless of the drop in the rates of migration, the balance of migration (the difference between the number of arrivals and departures) remains negative. The total population for the beginning of October, according to preliminary calculations, was 511,800 persons, falling by 4.5 percent in nine months. Labor Resources and Monetary Incomes of the Population The decrease in the number of workers in oblast enterprises (without taking commercial structures into account) continued in August of this year. In September 1993, 453 unemployed citizens applied to the oblast employment center for job placement. On 1 October the number in search of work who applied totaled 2,687 persons. There were 1,914 persons with unemployed status, of whom 71.2 percent were receiving benefit. The average wage of workers in enterprises of the oblast continues to grow. The level reached R192,800 in August, increasing with respect to the previous month by 19 percent. In spite of the recalculation of wages in organizations financed at the expense of the local budget, the gap in wages in branches of material production and the nonproduction sphere continues to be big (R217,600 and R136,400 respectively). Among the regions of the Far East, Magadan Oblast firmly occupies first place in the level of wages. However, Kamchatka Oblast leads in the rate of growth for the previous month (142.6 percent against 119.1 for Magadan Oblast). For January-September of this year, the monetary income of the population of the oblast, according to preliminary estimates, increased in comparison with the corresponding period of last year by a factor of 12, and in September to January by a factor of 6. However, inflation introduces adjustments to incomes: As a result of the limited effective demand on the part of a substantial part of the population, the share of consumer expenditures fell from 35 percent in January to 28 percent in September. Consumer Market in Goods and Services The production of consumer goods amounted to R36.1 billion, which is 11.8 percent higher than last year's level. The production of food products is increasing only in cost terms, the output of meat decreased in natural terms by 28 percent, sausage items--by 17 percent, whole milk products--by 39 percent, bread and bakery products--by 17 percent, nonalcoholic beverages--by 48 percent, and mineral water--by 72 percent. The production of nonfood consumer items in comparison with January-September of last year was cut by 35.6 percent and amounted to R2,869.1 billion. The increase in goods turnover owing to price increases amounted to R62 billion. In physical volume, 23 percent less goods were sold to the population than in the corresponding period of last year. The extent of implementation of paid services in existing prices amounted to R17.8 billion. Of this, state enterprises rendered the population of the oblast 98 percent of the volume of paid services, and private enterprises--2 percent. In comparable prices this volume was reduced compared to the level of last year by 66.1 percent, and in per capita terms, by 64.2 percent. The repeated freeing of prices for energy sources led to an increase in the cost of all types of paid services. Prices increased especially sharply for passenger and everyday services, and also for communications services and public and children's preschool institutions. Material Production Industry In nine months of 1993, state enterprises, joint-stock companies, and associations produced products in current prices worth R352.2193 billion, including in September--71.364.7 billion. In comparison with January-September of 1992 this volume increased by a factor of 9.5. It was possible in September to stabilize the work of enterprises somewhat, and the output of products increased by 1.9 percent in comparison with the same month of last year. A reduction of the output of products in natural terms is observed in more than 70 percent of the named articles taken into account in periodic reporting. Among these are electric power, steel, precast reinforced concrete, walling materials, industrial wood, lumber, trailers and semi-trailers, drilling rigs and others, including consumer goods. Since the beginning of the year, a decline in production has continued to be observed in all industrial branches. Nonferrous metallurgy enterprises and the food processing and fish industries exceeded the September levels of last year. Agriculture The reforms being conducted in rural areas have not yet been able to correct the difficult situation in the agrarian sector of the economy. Due to financial difficulties the sovkhozes were unable to acquire a sufficient amount of fuel. As a result, by 12 October about 10 hectares of potatoes and 11.5 hectares of vegetables were not harvested. Preparation of the fields for next year was going on simultaneously with harvesting. Land plowed in the autumn for spring sowing exceeded last year's level by 960 hectares, and winter crops were sown on 48 hectares. The state of affairs with the preparation of fodder causes alarm. By the beginning of October, 10,900 tonnes of hay, or 27 percent of the plan, were received, according to formal documents. The state of affairs in livestock breeding is also not improving. A substantial drop in the cattle population and a lowering in its productivity led to a slump in the production of food products. In nine months of this year, the sovkhozes of the oblast sold 7,600 tonnes for slaughter. In comparison with the very same period last year, the production of meat fell by 20 percent. The extent of the decrease in milk production amounted to 8,000 tonnes. Less eggs were produced in all poultry farms, except for the Yagodninskiy Rayon. Capital Construction Because of inflationary processes and difficulties in the transition period, the rates of capital construction in the oblast continue to decrease. In nine months of this year the introduction of fixed assets (in current prices) totaled R6.1 billion and exceeded the corresponding period of last year (owing to an increase in prices) by a factor of 4.4. Owing to all sources of financing in the oblast, 24,700 square meters of general residential buildings area, or 398 apartments, were introduced, and compared to data for nine months of 1992 the introduction of housing was reduced by 12,000 square meters (by 33 percent). The acuteness of the housing problem in the oblast is partially being removed owing to the redemption of housing from the population. Thus, for nine months of this year, owing to the resources of republic and local budgets, the administrations of the city and the rayons of the oblast acquired about 500 apartments, of which 395 apartments are in the city of Magadan. Transport and Communications The problem of freight and passenger transportation remains acute. In comparison with last year the transport of freight by general use motor vehicles was reduced by more than half (50.3 percent), and freight turnover decreased simultaneously by 36.2 percent. This reduction is explained by the incomplete delivery of national economic freight to the trading port of the city of Magadan. Transportation by general use buses fell by 10 percent, amounting to 36.3 million persons. Passenger turnover was reduced by almost half (44 percent). Income received from the main activity of communications enterprises grew by a factor of more than 12. Material-Technical Supply Preparation of enterprises for work under winter conditions proceeded over the summer period. The reserves of coal in Magadan Oblast at the beginning of the cold season totaled 693,000 tonnes, 4 percent less than last year. The reserves of solid fuel in the enterprises of the joint-stock company Magadanenergo exceed last year's by 21 percent and totaled 385,000 tonnes. Foreign Economic Relations The foreign trade turnover of the oblast for nine months of this year reached $36 million. Products in the amount of $15.5 million were exported to foreign firms, and goods totalling $20.5 million were imported. As before, imports exceeded exports, as indicated by the negative balance amounting to $5 million. The increase in export deliveries for the past month is insignificant--$1.4 million, and imports remained at the level of eight months. In the last quarter, as in the previous one, exports increased by $6 million, and revenues from abroad dropped significantly. The mass appearance on the foreign market of enterprises of new forms of economic management is observed under conditions of the formation of market relations--these are joint-stock companies and associations, joint enterprises, partnerships with limited liability, firms, companies, individual private enterprises, cooperatives, and others. They are responsible for an overwhelming proportion of exports--75 percent--and one-fifth of imports of the oblast. The share of foreign enterprises in the oblast's exports and imports is insignificant--less than 1 percent.
