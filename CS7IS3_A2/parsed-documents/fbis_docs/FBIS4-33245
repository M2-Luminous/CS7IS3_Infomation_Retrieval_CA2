This statement was made after members of the commission submitted their written resignation to the president. They believe their work is unnecessary in view of the investigations being conducted by Special Assistant Prosecutor Miguel Montes. The citizens' commission told President Salinas that all the members agree the commission must be independent. The only legal procedure that could give legitimacy to the citizens' commission is if Mrs. Diana Laura Riojas [Colosio's widow] appoints them as assistants of the public prosecutor's office and judicial authorities.
