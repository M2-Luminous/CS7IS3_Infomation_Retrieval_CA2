The FDP chairman and his party's military experts have rejected Defense Minister Volker Ruehe's plans -- the reduction of the Bundeswehr from 370,000 to a maximum 340,000, the reduction of military service to 10 months, and the option of a flexible duration of military service. FDP military expert Guenther Nolting criticized Ruehe's concept this week as "an ill-considered emergency shot." Members of the CDU Bundestag group have called this a "double game" of the FDP. Kinkel said on 27 January 1994: "We need a new concept and Volker Ruehe should present it." FDP Secretary-General Werner Hoyer said on 5 January: "An army of 370,000 men, a 12-month military service, the country's security, the need to increase investment, and a lower defense budget -- these elements of the Bundeswehr equation do not fit together. That is why new considerations are necessary." However, the concept presented by Ruehe in April was rejected by the FDP, even though it is in line with liberal demands. For instance, in the coalition agreement following the 1990 elections, the FDP called for a nine-month military service. On 20 January, FDP Secretary General Hoyer advocated a "differentiated military service." In this respect, "soldiers should be trained for use in home defense brigades...within a time that should be much shorter than 12 months." The reduction of the troop strength that the FDP is now criticizing actually was in accordance with liberal demands. FDP expert Juergen Koppelin on 5 April considered a strength of 370,000 men as "hardly suitable" for an unbiased discussion of the Bundeswehr's future. The same Hoyer, whose January demands were considered in Ruehe's planning, earlier this week mentioned the more likely reason for the FDP's contradictory attitude. He said that Ruehe's concept was an attempt to chum up with the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and a covert signal for a grand coalition. So the FDP does not primarily mean the Bundeswehr; it means election tactics.
