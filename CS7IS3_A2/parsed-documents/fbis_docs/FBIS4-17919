"I don't think it likely that I'll step down from the post of prime minister, despite claims to the contrary in the press," Laar stated. Several Estonian politicians maintain that, since the last vote of no confidence three months ago, the correlation of forces in the parliament has changed and the parliament may force Laar to resign. "When President Lennart Meri congratulated me on my birthday (April 22; Laar was on a visit to the United States last week), he said there have been writings about my resignation in the Estonian press he can't understand," Laar said. "Perhaps reporters have more information than I myself do." The premier also voiced the opinion that the press have reached a stage when they've "run out of subjects to write about and therefore engage in speculation." "I know that Tiit Vahi (chairman of the Tallinn City Council and the Assembly Party, as well as former prime minister) hankers after the post of premier, he has openly admitted it," Laar noted. "It's another thing how many members of the parliament want to see him fill that post." The prime minister also said rumors about rifts in the government are "exaggerated." "The coalition is doing good teamwork and even defections are not likely to rock the boat," Laar declared.
