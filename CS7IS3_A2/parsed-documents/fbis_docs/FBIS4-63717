This was said today by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk when he received British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd who has arrived in Ukraine on a one-day official visit. "I must stress yet again," Leonid Kravchuk noted, "that Crimea is an autonomous part of Ukraine." "We want to act within the framework of the Ukrainian Constitution, not to resort to force, and we are insisting that the authorities in the Crimea also act within its framework," he stated, having called on Russia to support Ukraine in this.
