The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class D airspace with Class E arrival extensions at Bullhead City, AZ. An airport traffic control tower was commissioned at Laughlin/Bullhead Municipal Airport. This proposal would provide adequate Class D and E airspace for IFR operations and require two-way radio communications at Laughlin/Bullhead Municipal Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published in Paragraph 5000 and Class E airspace areas designated as extensions to Class D surface areas are published in Paragraph 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in this Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 10034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). The Proposed Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 71 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1348(a), 1354(a), 1510; E.O. 10854; 24 FR 9565, 3 CFR, 1959&hyph;1963 Comp., p. 389; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); 14 CFR 11.69. ยง71.7 [Amended]
