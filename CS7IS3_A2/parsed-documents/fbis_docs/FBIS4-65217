This agreement encountered an obstacle when it came to allocating the area secretaryships and, in particular, the secretaryship for political and institutional relations, which was being demanded by Guerraists and renewalists, nearly thwarting integration. A further meeting of the two Madrid leaders was needed for agreement to be restored. The new Executive Committee, which was elected by 86.43 percent of the votes, is chaired by Jose Acosta, who, together with Joaquin Leguina and Juan Barranco, who remain as members, won the congress' loudest applause. With renewalist Jaime Lissavetzky as secretary general, the rest of the leadership was divided 50-50 between the two sectors, which had to negotiate with the the other two -- United Left [IU] and the Grassroots Renewalists -- in order to bring them into the Executive Committee. Joaquin Leguina had one of the greatest problems in ensuring that integration reached all sectors with IU, which was backing for the secretary generalship Pedro Sabando, who finally took over the deputy secretary generalship. At 0400, following a meeting of the IU delegates, these decided to join the leadership in the posts offered to them by Leguina. The agreement between Jose Acosta and the Grassroots Renewalists -- a sector that emerged from a split in the Madrid renewalists -- was easier. As a result of these agreements, the Executive Committee comprises 44 members, of whom 16 belong to the renewalist sector, 18 to the Guerraist sector, six to IU, and four to the Grassroots Renewalists. In this distribution, the Guerraists take the chairmanship and the secretaryships for organization, institutional policy, education and culture (which falls to a Grassroots Renewalists representative), relations with society, and training, while the renewalists have the secretary generalship, the deputy secretary generalship, administration and finances, studies and programs (held by IU), the secretaryship for women, and a deputy secretaryship for institutional policy. The creation of this deputy secretaryship unblocked the dispute between the two sectors, since in this way the renewalists accepted that a renewalist -- Jorge Gomez, regarded as belonging to this sector's flexible wing -- should hold the secretaryship for institutional policy, while renewalist Francisco Garrido will hold the deputy secretaryship. The various FSM sectors acknowledged after the congress the effort at integration made by everybody in order to reach an agreement that would not represent a false conclusion, as has happened at previous congresses. Achieving this solution, which through concessions by all sides has secured an Executive Committee that everybody asserts "will be able to work unitedly," was facilitated by the political crisis suffered by the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] and the latest corruption scandals, which were also the central aspect of the congress proceedings and of the secretary general's speech. The FSM acknowledges in a resolution "the damage caused by the recent scandals," although it states that "the use made of them by the right and certain news media is also very clear," and so there is a dual task: "to eliminate from our ranks all the corrupt people there may be, acting diligently and forcefully, and calling people to account where appropriate; and to defend supportively all honest comrades who are falsely accused, not allowing wholesale suspicion to set in." This is a task which Lissavetzky summed up as follows: "Neither certain corruption nor false accusation will go unpunished." Corruption was mentioned by the new FSM secretary general, who announced in his speech following the election of the new Executive Committee the setting up of an ethics committee, which will govern the Madrid Socialists' conduct "so that society will realize that it is noble to work in politics and that most of us are honest." Recalling an advertisement for a cleaning product, he asserted that "we Socialists will pass the cotton test clearly and will pass it easily." But the main thrust of Lissavetzky's speech was directed at unity and the loyal and integrative work that he believes has been achieved with the new Executive Committee -- "a reflection of the federal congress' spirit" -- and that, in his opinion, ensures that the FSM "is not the PSOE's Bronx, and if we are, we are a comfortable and habitable Bronx, but we will never be the Socialist Party's ugly duckling. I am proud to belong to the FSM."
