When he opened it, he saw a congratulatory discount card. On the left lower side of the card were printed these words: When mailing, this card must be placed in a corresponding envelope. Holding up the card, Niu Hongrui said to the reporters: This is called "compelling other people to buy the designated product." It is an act of unfair competition. [passage omitted] In the past month or so, some gratifying changes have taken place in the market order in our country. Niu Hongrui summarized these changes as follows: 1) The momentum of regional blockades has subsided somewhat. In the past, authorities from many cities used administrative means to restrict goods from other areas from entering their cities. This practice particularly occurs more often on the eve of festivals. This phenomenon has decreased now. For example, in accordance with the "Law Against Unfair Competition," the Inner Mongolian autonomous regional government has rescinded regulations restricting the sale of wool to places outside the autonomous region. 2) When administrative organs for industry and commerce were investigating unfair competition practices, fewer people would come forward to plead for mercy. 3) Once they were subject to investigation, the majority of people involved would consciously acknowledge their wrongdoing and accept punishment. What about complaints of unfair competition and their handling by administrative organs for industry and commerce? Ma Yanling, deputy director of the Economic Inspection Department, said: In the past month or so, administrative organs for industry and commerce in various localities have received many complaints, some of which have been registered, investigated, and handled. For example, on the first day of implementation of the "Law Against Unfair Competition," the Lanling Industrial Trading Company of Hainan Province placed an advertisement about its 1 million yuan lottery in HAINAN JINGJI BAO [HAINAN ECONOMIC DAILY], designating 30,000 yuan for the special prize and 10,000 yuan for the first prize. However, the "Law Against Unfair Competition" clearly stipulates that in promoting sales with lottery tickets, the highest prize for the lottery must not exceed 5,000 yuan. The Hainan Provincial Administration for Industry and Commerce immediately suspended, according to law, the company's sales with lottery tickets attached and fined it 10,000 yuan. [passage omitted] In conclusion, Liu Hongrui told reporters: In accordance with the requirements of a market economy, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce will set up a fair trade bureau, the main functions of which will be to supervise transactions by major elements of the market; to check monopoly and unfair competition; to investigate and handle, according to law or on the basis of being authorized, cases involving smuggling and selling of smuggled goods and other illegal economic activities; to protect the rights and interests of consumers according to law; to investigate and punish acts seriously harming the rights and interests of consumers; to supervise economic contracts according to law; and to guide the work of contract arbitration organizations. The Fair Trade Bureau is being organized.
