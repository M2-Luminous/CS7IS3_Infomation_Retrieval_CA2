Li Haidong, director of Shenzhen People's Congress, said the congress would speed up its work so that Shenzhen could be the first Chinese city to establish a legal framework to serve the development of the "socialist market economy". The whole legislative process should take three to five years. At least 25 new laws will be introduced this year and many are considered unprecedented in China. The director, who is in Guangzhou to attend the eighth Guangdong People's Congress, said these new legal codes would not contradict those passed by the Central and provincial authorities. They include a property transaction law, laws on partnership companies and companies with unlimited liabilities, social insurance law and a statue on state owned properties. And Lin Ruo, chairman of Guangdong People's Congress, said the Shenzhen experience would soon be spread to other cities of Guangdong. "This is natural. Cities which have the conditions can soon follow Shenzhen," Mr Lin said. Building more Hong Kongs on the mainland was first suggested by patriarch Deng Xiaoping to push ahead his quasi-capitalist reform experiment. According to Mr Li, the Shenzhen Congress will step up its supervision over the Government to make sure that all these new laws would be implemented. In addition, Shenzhen would also encourage more lawyers to set up law firms in the city to provide the necessary service to the public. While Mr Li admitted that many government officials only paid lip-service to the statue book, he said changes needed time. When asked about the industrial accidents that happened in Shenzhen last year Mr Li agreed they occurred because many city government officials lacked a "crisis consciousness". "(We've) learned a very deep lesson (last year)," he said. "This has helped our leaders to understand that on the one hand they must do a good job in reform and opening up, but on the other hand they have to do better in their management." He added the most important point was that administration should be anchored on a body of laws that is, the realisation of the rule of law. Meanwhile, Mr Li said Shenzhen had had difficulties in maintaining social order because it was an open city. He said although the majority of mobile population in Shenzhen were law-abiding, some were bad elements. Speaking on another occasion, Shenzhen Mayor, Li Youwei, indicated Shenzhen was the "best qualified" city in China to be come the second Hong Kong because it had accumulated rich experience in its experiment with the market system.
