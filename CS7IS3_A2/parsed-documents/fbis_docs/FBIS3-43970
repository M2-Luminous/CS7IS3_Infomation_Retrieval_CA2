The demonstrators carried placards and the flag of the Republic of Somalia, and chanted: "Down with Somalia's enemies" "UNOSOM leave Somalia", "may the agreement to unite Somalia succeed" and other slogans. The rally was first addressed by Awil Ahmad Abdi, from the Somali Democratic Movement and Mohamed Ahmad Nur, the USC secretary for reconstruction and rehabilitation, who greeted and congratulated the Somali citizens that UNOSOM had illegally kidnapped from their homes. They also congratulated the Somali National Alliance supporters, particularly those from Mogadishu and its surrounding environs, who had been holding non-stop demonstrations which, they said, finally forced UNOSOM to release the officials they had illegally detained. Speaking on behalf of the eight citizens, Osman Hassan Ali thanked the Somali people and said that history would not forget those people involved in the struggle against the UNOSOM troops. Osman Hassan Ali said that they had done something which had been lacking in Somalia and the African continent, and that this had sent a clear signal to foreigners that they could not do whatever they wished to an independent country and people. Referring to the agreement reached between brother Somalis and signed at the Kah Hotel in Mogadishu, he said he strongly supported it, pointing out that the agreement was the key for peace and stability to come about in Somalia. In conclusion, he appealed to the Somali people to show tolerance, fortitude, and mutual respect for each other's rights. [passage omitted]
