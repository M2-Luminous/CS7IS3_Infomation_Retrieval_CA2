The ministry does not dismiss the possibility of intervention in Rio de Janeiro if the state government requests, and the president of the Republic so determines. General Gilberto Serra, who is Army Minister Zenildo Lucena's spokesman, said: "We are following the situation, as our constitutional duties tell us to." The Army leadership believes the possibility of an Armed Forces' initiative would not have the explicit characteristics of an intervention, but of assistance. Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio Oliveira admitted the possibility of creating a numbers game Congressional Investigating Committee to look into charges being made against deputies. In Congress, the legislators did not hide their fear that the scandal will affect the institution. In Rio de Janeiro, Deputy Jorge Bittar -- Workers Party leader in the Chamber of Deputies -- announced that he will ask for Mayor Cesar Maia's impeachment [preceding word in English].
