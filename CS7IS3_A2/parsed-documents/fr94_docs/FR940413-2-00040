FR940413-2-00040 FR940413-2-00024 [OPP&hyph;180930; FRL 4771&hyph;3] Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption to use 2,4&hyph;D; Solicitation of Public Comment AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the ``Applicant'') for use of the pesticide 2,4&hyph;D (EPA Reg. No. 264&hyph;2) to control Common waterplantain on up to 20,000 acres of wild rice in Minnesota. In accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision on whether or not to grant the exemption. DATES: Comments must be received on or before April 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Three copies of written comments, bearing the identification notation ``OPP&hyph;180930,'' should be submitted by mail to: Public Response and Human Resource Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. In person, bring comments to: Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA. Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information.'' Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain Confidential Business Information must be provided by the submitter for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments filed pursuant to this notice will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Larry Fried, Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. Office location and telephone number: 6th Floor, Crystal Station I, 2800 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 308&hyph;8328. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for the use of the herbicide, 2,4&hyph;D, available as Weedar 64 (EPA Reg. No. 264&hyph;2) from Rhone-Poulenc Ag Company, to control Common waterplantain (waterplantain) which develops a dense leaf canopy in wild rice fields and can, in extreme cases, reduce wild rice yields by more than 90 percent. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. According to the Applicant, waterplantain is found in nearly all Minnesota fields which have been cropped continuously to wild rice. Established waterplantain grows from old root stocks early in the spring and plants emerge from the water two to three weeks before wild rice. The emergence of waterplantain prior to wild rice negatively impacts the early stages of the rice's development. Knowledgeable experts indicate that it is not unreasonable for fields infested with waterplantain to experience 50 percent yield losses. No herbicides are currently registered for use on wild rice because of a ruling by EPA that disallowed chemicals that are registered for use on ``rice'' to be used on wild rice because of differences in taxonomy and growing practices of the two crops. Non-chemical control by hand-weeding or mechanical cultivation is not practical due to necessary flooding of wild rice fields. Under the proposed exemption a maximum of one application could be applied, at a rate of 8.0 fl. oz. of product (0.25 lb. a.i.) per acre. A maximum of 1,375 gal. of product or 5,500 lbs. a.i. could be applied in 1994. Applications would be made between May 1 and July 31, 1994. This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18 require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the Federal Register and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption if an emergency exemption has been requested or granted for that use in any 3 previous years, and a complete application for registration of that use has not been submitted to the Agency [40 CFR 166.24 (a)(6)]. Exemptions for this use of 2,4&hyph;D on wild rice in Minnesota have been requested and granted for the past 4 years, and an application for registration of this use has not been submitted to the Agency. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.
