FBIS4-68089 "jptot020__l94011" JPRS-TOT-94-020-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 5 February 1994 EAST ASIA PHILIPPINES February Report--Police Call for Offensive on Abu-Sayyaf February Report--Police Call for Offensive on Abu-Sayyaf 94SEOO96 Cotabato City MINDANAO CROSS in English 5 Feb 94 pp 22, 21 94SEOO96 Cotabato City MINDANAO CROSS English CSO [Excerpts] Police authorities in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) have recommended to higher police headquarters the launching of an all out offensive against the extremists Abu Sayyaf group, Mindanao's most dreaded terrorist band. The recommendation was issued by ARMM Police regional director chief Supt. Magingin Magomnang after receiving reports Wednesday from Sulu Police provincial director Supt. Aukasa Handa. Magomnang called a command conference Wednesday at Camp S.K. Pendatun in Parang, Maguindanao. It was his first meeting with his subordinates this year. Both Magomnang and Handa said that the number of the fundamentalist group is increasing and a massive police action should be taken against them before they can harm people with their terroristic activities. ``I am considering Abu Sayyaf group as a threat,'' Handa told reporters. ``I am recommending to higher headquarters that police action should be taken against this group.'' The Abu Sayyaf, a fundamentalist group that originated in Basilan province, is composed of 80 to 100 fully armed members. Denying the group had just received arms shipment from nearby countries, Handa said the Abu Sayyaf, led by Abdulradjak Janjalani, is armed with several 90 recoilless rifles, B-57, mortars, M-60 and M-50 machineguns and assorted high powered firearms. The group was tagged by military and police authorities as responsible in several criminal activities such as kidnapping and bombings in Mindanao. It was also believed to be responsible in the Davao Cathedral bombing last December 26 which killed six church-goers and wounded 150 others. Authorities also identified the extremist group as responsible in the kidnapping of language researcher Charles Walton, shipyard owner Ricardo Tong of Zamboanga City, missionary priest Bernardo Blanco, Spanish nuns in Sulu and several businessmen in the Zamboanga archipelago. ``The Abu Sayyaf is really a threat in the area, particularly in Sulu, but we have some precautionary measures that can take care of this group,'' Magomnang said in a press conference. He said he will tak to PNP chief Dir. General Umberto Rodriguez and Chief of Staff Gen Lisandro Abadia for a joint police and military action against Abu Sayyaf. Magomnang also reported that he already had a talk with several Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) commanders in Sulu to cooperate with the police in pursuing the fundamentalist group. Handa stressed that the Abu Sayyaf is not yet capable of destabilizing Mindanao. Abadia, during his Mindanao visit last month, said Abu Sayyaf cannot destabilize the region but admitted that they can create trouble and terrorize people. [passage omitted] Admitting terrorism is difficult to address, Abadia vowed to neutralize the group in due time. Magomnang said the police has already identified the base of Abu Sayyaf in Sulu and will strike anytime when the ``go signal'' is issued. Aside from Basilan, Handa said the Abu Sayyaf is concentrated in Patikul, Sulu.
