Released on Sunday, the document said land would be expropriated through a land reform act and a land claims court, which would function under the constitutional court. The land would then be redistributed among "the people" by the state, which would act as curator of all property. The manifesto rejects any protection of freehold title or the acquisition of land on a "willing buyer, willing seller" basis. Every ctizen is guaranteed equal access to land for residential, agricultural and industrial purposes. Plots will be allocated to people, who will act as curators of such property. Although everyone will be free to live anywhere, agrarian land reclaimed constitutionally will be allocated to farmers practising agriculture at all levels. "In our view, the restoration and redistribution of land is a non-negotiable starting point for meaningful reparations. A PAC government will not buy our land from the settlers. The settlers bought no land from our people." On the economy, the PAC said it would not nationalise conglomerates, corporations and financial institutions controlled by the private sector, but these would be "socialised and democratised to meet the needs of the community at large". The concentration of capital in the hands of a few conglomerates and family trusts will however be addressed through anti-trust laws and deregulation of monopolies. Massive labour-intensive job schemes will be initiated to combat unemployment and a PAC government will support the creation of small business and co-operatives. The PAC also supported the introduction of a wealth tax to supplement direct taxation, which would in turn form the basis of state revenue. Indirect taxes will continue to be collected, but VAT [value-added tax] on basic necessities such as food and medicine will be abolished. The unemployed, aged and disabled will be exempt from indirect taxation. The PAC commits itself firmly to affirmative action, but says high standards of performance must be maintained. Statutory "labour tribunals" will have powers to determine whether any worker has been discriminated against. Quotas may be introduced in the workplace not only to correct racial and gender imbalances but also to create a culture of [word indistinct] among various sectors of the population. Under a PAC government, the labour movement will be guaranteed its independence. The government will recognise the right to collective bargaining for all workers, including domestic and farm workers, as well as the right to withhold labour. A minimum wage will be enacted and enforced by law and the system of payment in kind prevalent on farms will be abolished. Workers in essential services [word indistinct] teachers, policemen, nurses will be subject to special agreements, such as the provision of skeleton staff, to avoid the crippling of essential services during a strike. On housing, the manifesto promises that township houses will be given to residents who had covered infrastructural costs through their rents. The private sector will be encouraged to participate in the provision of housing through tax concessions and self-help schemes will be encouraged. Single-sex hostels will be abolished and employers such as the mining sector will be responsible for the provision of family units for employees. Ethnic mixing will be encouraged in hostels. The manifesto pledges free and compulsory education up to standard 10 for every child. The PAC is committed to a single education department, common syllabus for all pupils and an integrated education policy.
