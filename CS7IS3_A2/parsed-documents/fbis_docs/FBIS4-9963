Quintero also mentioned the names of Nicaraguan citizens Roger Arguello and Santiago Rivas Betancourt. They are reportedly in our country engaged in irregular activities related to drug trafficking and the illegal trafficking of vehicles, according to Nicaraguan officials. [Station announcer] Thank you very much. We now have another report from the Government House. Go ahead, Raul Valladares. [Valladares] Roberto Reyes is here with Carlos Calderon, press director of the Government House. Go ahead, Roberto. [Reyes] Thank you very much. We are here with Press Director Carlos Calderon at the Government House. I asked Colonel Romero if this threat could change the president's agenda. What is your opinion? [Calderon] We were with the president listening to the information broadcast by Voz de Honduras Network. Everything is absolutely quiet. I received reports that military intelligence officers had informed the president a few days ago about what was happening. The president told me he hoped this report would not cause great alarm because he knows [words indistinct] state security organizations. He added that he did not think this incident would have any political significance. As Col. Romero stated, these individuals were acting like common criminals [words indistinct]. They do not have any political connections. Therefore, the president expressed [words indistinct] with great responsibility. Despite the fact that the president learned of this situation days ago, the matter was kept secret, especially since the investigations had not concluded. Now that the information has been made public, the president is quiet. He thanked those who expressed their solidarity with him and hoped the citizens would view this as a normal thing for the president. He said he hopes the incident will not alter his working schedule. President Reina is not worried at all about this situation. He knows that the state security organizations are efficient and that he has the support of the people. He knows he is a loved and respected individual. Reina is aware that these things can happen to any president: They are part of the risk of holding such an important post as the presidency of the Republic. This will in no way affect the president's duties and everyday activities. [Reyes] Will the president increase his security now? [Calderon] State security organizations have recommended that the president take some precautions, and certain steps have been taken. For the president, this is no cause for alarm, and it will not affect his duties. He is quiet, relaxed, and will continue his normal activities. [Reyes] Has the president downplayed the information given to him? [Calderon] I wouldn't say so. I would say he has handled the information appropriately. He has given this report the attention it deserves. He has taken the recommendations made by state security agencies into account [words indistinct] but he will not change his routine and how he relates to the public. This does not involve a change in the president's behavior as head of state. [Reyes] How has the president classified these actions? You are talking about crime, but how does he see the situation? [Calderon] We have the same information supplied by state security organizations. When one talks about common crime, one implies there is no link to political groups. This is a unpremeditated action by a group of individuals who, for unknown reasons, have considered taking such actions. These actions do not reflect the political criteria or actions of any group, which would have given the problem a different look. [Reyes] Has the president received calls from presidents or foreign officials other than the Nicaraguan Government Ministry official who contacted you? [Calderon] No. The president has only received local calls. I suppose that when the news spreads, presidents of friendly countries will express their solidarity with the president. You are well aware of the enormous respect for President Reina throughout the continent. [Reyes] What have the Armed Forces told the president? [Calderon] I don't know anything about that. [Reyes] Thank you very much.
