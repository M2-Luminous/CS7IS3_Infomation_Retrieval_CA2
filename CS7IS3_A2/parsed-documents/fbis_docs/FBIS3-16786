Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation Defense Minister, Tours Kaliningrad Oblast"] [Text] Pavel Grachev arrived in Kaliningrad on the afternoon of 17 March and was "besieged" by journalists as soon as he deplaned. Their interest was entirely understandable, despite the planned nature of the defense minister's trip. The naval force withdrawal from Poland and the Baltic countries, the fact that Kaliningrad Oblast is an enclave, and, finally, the concentration there of many Russian Federation Ground Force units withdrawn from abroad all ultimately determine the region's position from a specifically defense-based viewpoint. Pavel Grachev described the aim of the trip as follows: "First, it is necessary to look in detail at the state of Ground Force and Baltic Fleet subunits. Second, we must listen to the proposals from Admiral Yegorov, the fleet commander, and from Lieutenant General Anatoliy Pimenov, commander of the 11th Separate Combined-Arms Guards Army, for the rational deployment of troops and the creation in Kaliningrad Oblast of a special defensive region. It needs to be stressed that work in this area has been under way previously. On the eve of the defense minister's visit to Kaliningrad Oblast representatives of the General Staff were already at work. On the eve of the defense minister's visit to Kaliningrad Oblast representatives of the General Staff were already at work. Army General Konstantin Kobets, chief military inspector and deputy defense minister, and the commanders in chief of the Russian Navy and Ground Forces have also been here to work out their own proposals. Such close attention to the problems of the ground and naval forces deployed in Kaliningrad Oblast has given rise to various suggestions, including some very unlikely ones. For instance, certain analysts have proposed that Russia might give up the Baltic Fleet for purely economic reasons. But Pavel Grachev stated at the airfield: "I want to see the fleet more combat capable than it is at present." He went on to note that the naval forces would most probably be based in both Leningrad and Kaliningrad Oblasts. And in the numbers necessary to safeguard security and ensure the reliable defense of our state. "The operational grouping that is being created here should ensure the defense of the territory from military threats not only from the sea, but from the land as well," Pavel Grachev said. This was also discussed during the Russian Federation defense minister's meeting with garrison officers. Army Gen. Grachev also talked about the progress in reforming the Russian Armed Forces, noting the weighty contribution made by Kaliningrad Oblast to solving the problem of the drafting of young people to the Russian Federation Armed Forces. The draft plan has been more than 40 percent overfulfilled in this area. This is the best indicator of any region. The defense minister paid particular attention to the condition of naval and Ground Forces units in Kaliningrad Oblast. By dint of its position the oblast has a special place within Russia. This makes increased demands on the system for the command and control of naval forces and Ground Forces units. On the whole, the defense minister said, the forces of the Baltic Fleet and the 11th Army are carrying out the tasks they have been set. But even higher results are expected during these checks. The defense minister briefed those present on what is currently being done in the Russian Armed Forces and talked about certain results of the start of the new training year. Army Gen. Pavel Grachev stressed that main efforts have been focused on the practical implementation of the plan for the Armed Forces' organizational development, the creation of force groupings -- above all, mobile force groupings -- the enhancement of the command and control system, the search for a fundamentally new approach toward Armed Forces utilization, and the improvement of the organizational and personnel structure. But the main task for the Russian Armed Forces in 1994 is to maintain their combat readiness and combat capability at a level that ensures that the state is defended under any circumstances, and to carry out the tasks laid down by the main provisions of Russia's military doctrine. In the first two and a half months of 1994, the defense minister said, the plans for troop and naval force training have been carried out. Two command post training sessions have been held at the strategic level and more than 10 at the operational-tactical level. It is planned to hold another training session before the end of the training year on the command and control of Strategic Nuclear Forces, and the "South '94" command post exercise. It is planned to hold the "Northwest," "Baykal," and "Vostok" regional command post exercises and the "West" operational rear services command post exercise. This, in Army Gen. Grachev's words, will make it possible to prevent any decline in the level of combat readiness. The defense minister's order on the early promotion of a number of the most outstanding Army and Navy officers was read out at a meeting at the garrison Officers House and valuable gifts were presented. A brigade of artistes under the leadership of Iosif Kobzon gave a concert. The same day Army Gen. Pavel Grachev heard reports from Adm. Yegorov, commander of the Baltic Fleet, and Lt. Gen. Pimenov, commander of the 11th Army. That night the naval forces were rallied upon the signal to assemble. On Friday the defense minister visited the fleet's alternate command post, attended a naval infantry brigade tactical exercise, and met with the crew of the destroyer Nastoychivyy.
