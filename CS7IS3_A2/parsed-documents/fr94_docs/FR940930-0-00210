FR940930-0-00210 FR940930-0-00029 In analyzing this issue, FRA is confronted with a number of differing situations based on the different nature of vehicle roadways (public and private) and differing railroad operations: freight and passenger operation on the general system; freight operations within an industrial plant; tourist railroad on the general system; and tourist railroad not part of the general system (see discussion below). Commenters generally agree that all crossings over general system railroads should be governed by this rule. We agree. Thus, active warning systems on both private and public roadways crossing general system railroads are subject to this rule. There was no consensus as to whether these rules should apply to public or private crossings over ``plant'' railroads. While some commenters urged that all crossings under all circumstances should be governed by the rule, others, such as NYS DOT and West Virginia Department of Transportation held the opinion that crossings over plant railroads should not be subject to the rule. Unfortunately, FRA did not receive specific information or data supporting the views commenters supporting either position. If FRA were to include plant railroads within the application of this rule, it would be applying a regulatory regimen over entities which have historically not been regulated by the FRA. Although FRA has authority to regulate this field of entities, it has not chosen to do so for reasons of both lack of a demonstrated safety need and the need to apply limited FRA safety resources where they can be best utilized. As has been stated, plant railroad operations typically involve low speed operations with small numbers of rail cars permitting relatively short stopping distances. These operations typically also involve roadway crossings with relatively low speed vehicular traffic. These reasons, together with the historical basis for not asserting jurisdiction in these situations leads FRA to not assert jurisdiction over public and private crossings at such plant railroads. Of course, because FRA's regulatory authority permits it to amend the applicability sections of its regulations so as to expand or contract the populations of railroads covered by a particular set of regulations, if circumstances so warrant, FRA may assert such jurisdiction in the future. As noted in the NPRM, FRA recently received a petition from the Berkshire Scenic Railway Museum, Incorporated on behalf of tourist, excursion, and scenic railroads requesting the need for legislative and regulatory action for new regulations tailored specifically to the tourist rail industry. Pursuant to FRA's response to that petition, FRA has considered the suggestions made by those parties in drafting these final regulations. There is a very wide range of operations that could be considered tourist, excursion, or scenic railroads under the broadest reading of the term ``railroad.'' In an effort to clarify the proper extent of the exercise of FRA's jurisdiction, FRA recently settled on several principles that will be used as current FRA guidelines. FRA will exercise jurisdiction over all tourist, excursion, and scenic railroads, whether or not they operate over the general railroad system, except those that are (1) less than 24 inches in gage and/or (2) insular. To determine insularity, FRA looks at various criteria that measure the likelihood that a railroad's operations might affect a member of the public. FRA has concluded that a tourist, excursion, or scenic railroad is insular if its operations are limited to a separate enclave in such a way that there is no reasonable expectation that the safety of any member of the public (except a business guest, a licensee of the tourist operation or an affiliated entity, or a trespasser) would be affected by the operation. A railroad is not considered insular if one or more of the following exists on its line: (a) A public highway-rail crossing that is in use; (b) an at-grade rail crossing that is in use; (c) a bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial navigation; or (d) a common corridor with a railroad, i.e. , its operations are within 30 feet of those of any railroad. Thus, the mere fact that the trackage of a railroad is not connected to the general system does not make the railroad insular under these criteria. While these criteria tend to sort out the insular theme parks and museums, a need to do case-by- case analysis in certain close situations still exists. Therefore, FRA has concluded that the requirements contained in this part should apply to each non-general system, non-insular passenger railroad that confines its operations to lines that are not part of the general system ( i.e. , it is a stand-alone with no freight traffic but has one or more features that preclude its being considered insular). FRA believes that application of these regulations to non-insular passenger operations off the general system is warranted by the risk to passengers associated with accidents involving heavy motor vehicles and is consistent with FRA's ability to regulate and enforce safety standards in a cost effective manner. FRA recognizes that additional crossings equipped with automated warning systems may be found on plant railroads and private freight railroads. Maintenance, inspection, and testing of these automated systems is the responsibility of entities not otherwise regulated by FRA. As to plant and private freight railroads, these functions lie outside the scope of this final rule, and state and local authorities will retain their existing authority to administer and enforce appropriate requirements for the protection of the public. If data should be developed that indicates a need for uniform national regulation of this subject matter, FRA may revisit this issue at a future time.
