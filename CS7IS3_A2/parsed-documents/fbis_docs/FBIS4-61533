European branch earlier this week. Summing up the results of his visit in an interview with TASS, Korotechnya noted that the point at issue was actually "participation by the CIS, in the capacity of observer, in all meetings of international organizations having their representative offices in Geneva." This would enable the Commonwealth to spell out its vision of certain issues at the international level and to express its position on these issues. During his trip to Geneva, Korotechnya signed on behalf of the CIS secretariat an agreement on cooperation with the secretariat of the U.N. Conference for Trade and Development (UNCTAD), held talks with executive secretary of the European Economic Commission Yves Berthelot and Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Arpad Bogsch. "The agreement with the UNCTAD defines directions for further joint work and mutual interests," the CIS executive secretary said, referring to regular consultations, exchange of information, technical assistance. The visit to the European Economic Commission laid the foundation for further cooperation. As for the WIPO, a meeting is scheduled to be held in the Belarusian capital Minsk in a month and a half, which is to draw plenipotentiary envoys of CIS member-countries and to be attended by Bogsch. The meeting is to concentrate on coordination in protection of intellectual property rights. "The recognition by the United Nations of the CIS as a regional association prompted us to approve at our latest meeting in Moscow a plan of measures aiming to develop international contacts," Korotechnya reported. The recent visit by U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to the CIS headquarters in Minsk proved to the United Nations' interest in cooperation with the CIS. "I do not rule out that in prospect a representative office of the CIS as a whole will be set up in Geneva," the executive secretary noted. "But for this, we need a decision by the council of heads of government or of heads of state," he added. At present, each of the newly-independent states is establishing ties with U.N. structures separately, and yet "we are also looked at as the Commonwealth on the whole," Korotechnya pointed out. Orienting itself for international contacts, the CIS secretariat does not intend by any means "to influence any bilateral ties": All CIS member-countries have the right to choose their partners on their own. The point at issue is just cooperation that could be profitable for the entire Commonwealth. At the latest meeting of CIS heads of state and government in Moscow, "we took a serious step towards consolidation and strengthening of the Commonwealth," the CIS executive secretary said. "We have reached the level of Commonwealth when the member-states are gathering at the table not just to sign some document," he emphasised. At the same time, all states are sovereign, therefore we should search for a consensus when solving our problems. "We should take counsel and reach agreement -- this is the main essence of the Commonwealth. This is perhaps the core of democracy and of all processes currently underway in our society," Korotechnya pointed out.
