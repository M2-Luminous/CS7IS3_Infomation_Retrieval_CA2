The classification singles out the human operator as the main component that coordinates local goals control of power unit equipment, participates in control implementation and is responsible for safe operation of the AES. It is well known that the structure of any automatic control function consists of four components:information, situation identification, control decision making and implementation of the control decision. The classification for an operator support system will include four classes of systems: information support, situation assessment support, control decision making support and support of control decision implementation. The goals of each of the above classes of an operator support system are listed and explained. There are several serious problems with practical implementation of these goals by operator support systems. The most important problem is software certification. Among other problems are the impossibility in principle to simulate all failures of automation devices and a legal problem the responsibility for recommendations of the operator support system. A less serious problem is organization of personnel training interactively with support systems.
