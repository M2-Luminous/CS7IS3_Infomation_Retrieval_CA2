The first six weeks of our difficult work are ending, the hopes people have pinned on us are great, and these hopes have been vindicated. Russia's Fifth State Duma is swiftly and confidently joining in the country's political life: motley, not entirely intelligible, with its own complex and sometimes audacious character. What do people expect of it, what are its intentions and commitments? Do they match society's mood and aspirations? What place will the State Duma occupy in the Russian system of power and what will be its fate? After all, the fate of its four prerevolutionary predecessors was not always enviable, and the same goes for its immediate predecessors -- the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's Deputies. Newspapers, the radio, television, analysts, and political scientists are edgy, voters are perturbed, and deputies themselves are suffering. Today we must provide direct, frank answers to these questions. And above all, the Duma has no intention of merely being an observer of the course of events, the Duma intends to work. Point one. The Duma is completing its organizational process and would already have completed it were it not for certain difficulties with the "Procrustean bed" of the site of its residence. It is an impermissible luxury now to lose tempo in work, to waste the time allotted to the Duma, and, most importantly of all, to waste the mighty human and intellectual potential of the deputies elected with hope and great belief by Russians 12 December last year by failing to call upon it. Nevertheless, the deputies' factions and groups and the 23 committees have joined in work on the key spheres of creative lawmaking -- the urgent problems of the economy and domestic and foreign policy -- with unhurried expert analysis, open parliamentary hearings, and pithy and turbulent debates. Point two. The State Duma publicly says today that it does not see the separation of powers as meaning alienation between them, still less rivalry, bitterness, and even hostility. It is firmly convinced that in order to emerge from the crisis our motherland Russia needs civil peace, accord, tranquillity, and creation. It is precisely this kind of accord and collaboration between the president, government, Federation Council, State Duma, and Constitutional Court that Russians expect today, and keenly expect. They are waiting for the accord and interaction, mutual support, and respectful relations announced to the whole country and the whole world and professed in everyday work. Without this our presence here, in the country's highest power structures, becomes simply meaningless. The first weeks of joint work are encouraging and inspire confidence, because this work has been supported by the common will of the president, the chairman of the government, the Federation Council, the State Duma, and the Constitutional Court. This has been noticed in Russia and beyond its borders, noticed with joy and relief, although life is still hard and complex. And this is precious. This is perhaps the main result of the small amount of work we have done over this short time. Point three. The State Duma, spoiling the fun of many observers who were ready to watch a Russian-style gladiatorial battle, firmly intends to devote itself to legislative support for intelligent political, economic, and social reforms. Not much time is allotted for our lawmaking. Unfortunately, it runs to barely 20 calendar months. The stock of social patience is small and is running out. We have made our first stab at preparing a plan of lawmaking activity. It incorporates legislative proposals from the president, the government, the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and the Superior Court of Arbitration, and also legislative initiatives from Federation components and the deputies of Russia's parliament. What are our priorities here? First of all there is the package of new federal constitutional laws based on developing Russia's new Constitution, without which election of the next, sixth Duma and the other branches of power, and also their functioning and collaboration are inconceivable. The second package is the package of economic laws along with strict control of the budget and the elaboration of a program of priority anticrisis measures in order to emerge from the all-embracing crisis. Progress along the road of significant, productive reforms understood by every Russian involving a change in ownership relations and the formation of a government for people is impossible without them. At the same time the two packages of laws create the framework of a rule-of-law federative state -- the basis for the activity of the next, sixth Duma -- and affirm the rights and freedom of the individual as the supreme value of the state and society on the basis of the unshakability and state integrity of the Russian Federation. The latter must be stipulated firmly, confidently, and calmly in order not to create the slightest illusions in all manner and caliber of Russian separatists, who have not yet received a proper political and economic caution, and it is probably now time to do so. In the same way it is time to adopt proper laws to curb the aggression of the criminal world while, however, giving even those who have once stumbled the opportunity, the chance to take part in the difficult transformations of the country by declaring an amnesty for persons convicted of economic crimes and by supporting the president's legislative initiative regarding an amnesty in connection with the adoption of the new Russian Federation Constitution. Moreover, in order to ensure civil peace and accord in society we should declare an amnesty for all participants in the events of 19-21 August 1991 and 1 May and 21 September-4 October 1993. Without this it is simply impossible to avoid suspicion and malicious, sometimes sly waiting for certain changes and a possible settling of scores -- in order to emerge from the all-embracing crisis. We are simply doomed to accord. Esteemed Deputies, the crisis being experienced by the country and society is multifaceted and all-embracing. It will be difficult to emerge from it. We need genuine consolidation of society and a kind of Russian social contract-accord with a coordinating role played by President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. A large group of young, vigorous economist deputies inside the Duma, with the support of Russia's economic schools, have completed in general outline the preparation of a consolidated program of priority measures to emerge from the grave crisis. This program is no secret to the members of the government. The program was presented in detail at parliamentary hearings and has been covered in the press. It would certainly become the basis for the future reorganization of the government as a government of people's trust and national accord, with the president playing an active coordinating role, based on a real and significant parliamentary majority possessing the requisite legitimacy, professionalism, and intellectual potential. The government's membership certainly does not necessarily have to be expanded to include deputies. The main thing is for its members to be professionals dedicated to the cause of reforms for the good of Russians. This would put a stop to the variations on the theme of what and whom the government and its chairman rely on in forming the cabinet. This would impart the desired stability to the executive branch of power while restoring the controllability of the country's economy, lowering the rate of inflation [and] carrying out a number of pressing unpopular but urgent measures while evenly distributing the burden of the crisis among regions and social groups. We have no time to waste on strife or petty arguments. We are entitled to work thoroughly and smoothly, and we must do so: the preparation of draft laws in our committees (essentially miniature parliaments proportionally representing all factions and groups), the coordination of positions in the Duma Council, where all factions and groups are also represented, the final adoption of draw laws at plenary sittings of the State Duma without cluttering up its time with petty, clever inessentials, which must be examined within the text of a law or outside it during the first two stages in preparing a draft law. Then the remaining 94 plenary sessions of the Duma will be productive and we will be able to fulfill our mission as a transitional parliament. I have one more comment. We are forming the new working apparatus of the Russian State Duma. It must be stable [malosmenyayemyy] and adequate. Then the sixth Duma will inherit it in a good, effective condition. But there is one essential condition: In the State Duma it is the deputy who counts. This must be stated without arrogance and conceit. The Duma's working apparatus must assist the deputy in his effective work. If those who are seeking to join the apparatus have anything else in mind, they had better not seek to join it. Esteemed Colleagues! In order to implement all this, which we have painfully arrived at and derived over these two and a half months, it is proposed to vote on and adopt as a package a State Duma decree on adopting a memorandum of accord on an amnesty in connection with the adoption of the Russian Federation Constitution, on an amnesty for certain crimes committed in the sphere of political and economic activity, and on deeming null and void the decision by the Russian Federation State Duma of 18 February on setting up a commission to investigate the causes and conditions of the events of 21 September-4 October 1994. Thank you, and I ask representatives of the factions to speak on this topic.
