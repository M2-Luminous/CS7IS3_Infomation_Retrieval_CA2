FR940902-0-00056 FR940902-0-00010 The Department believes that it is equitable that the State be able to use the interest it may earn on these funds towards satisfying the interest debt created by the CMIA and does not desire to cause States to both meet any interest liability under the CMIA and provide additional JTPA program services with the same interest earnings. Therefore, paragraph (a)(v) is revised in the final rule to eliminate the exception for interest earnings by States and paragraph (c), Use of program income, is revised to permit the State's use of such income to meet its CMIA liability. In addition, the application of the administrative cost limitations in paragraph (c) is also revised to exempt program income used by States to meet its CMIA liability from the administrative cost limitation. Reports Required Section 627.455 requires financial reporting to be on a quarterly basis and costs to be reported on an accrual basis by year of appropriation. A few commenters asked whether participants must also be reported by year of appropriation and several commenters asked whether costs may be charged to the oldest available appropriation, i.e., first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. As specified in ยง627.455(a), reporting instructions are to be issued by the Secretary. The statutory requirement to report by year of appropriation is limited to financial data. With regard to FIFOing of costs, the Department has no objections to an entity FIFOing costs it incurs itself as long as obligational authority exists for multiple years and the costs are for the same purposes and under the same terms and conditions that accompanied each year's obligational authority. This approach limits FIFOing to each individual JTPA entity and does not include one entity FIFOing costs incurred by another entity, even if the other entity is a subrecipient of the original one. Restated, once a JTPA cost is recorded by any subrecipient, it must be recorded against a given year of funds and remains a cost charged to that year of funds. It may not be recorded or reported by another entity against a different year of funds. No changes are made to the final rule. Requirements for Records Section 627.460(a) imposes the record retention requirements of section 165(e) of the Act on State records and provides the State two options for subrecipient records. A few commenters encouraged the Department to drop the option for subrecipient records and require all subrecipients to comply with the record retention provisions imposed on subrecipients by the Act. Since the Act is unclear about its effect on subrecipient records, it is the Department's intent, by providing an option for retention of subrecipient records, to allow each State to determine if subrecipients of the State should each have its own clock for the starting point for record retention, rather than having all records of all subrecipients throughout a State controlled by the one State clock. This option avoids requiring all subrecipients in a State to maintain records beyond the prescribed period just because a claim, audit, or litigation has started that affects only one or a few subrecipients. It also enables JTPA subrecipients to maintain and dispose of JTPA records in the same timeframes that apply to other records of the subrecipient that are covered by applicable OMB Circulars. It is expected that either approach will result in most JTPA records, other than property records, being maintained for the same total 5-year period of time. Subrecipients that are opposed to this approach should encourage their State to not adopt the option provided. Paragraph (a)(2) of this section is changed in the final rule to add the statutory requirement for property records to be retained for three years after final disposition. Section 627.460(d) of the interim final regulations authorizes the substitution of copies made by microfilming for original records. A few commenters raised questions about the allowability of retaining records in forms other than microfilming, such as computer imaging or scanning, and other types of computer generated data and electronic files. In response to these comments, the Department has revised this provision. Instead of authorizing a particular medium for record retention, the revised provision sets a standard that the method of retention must be sufficient to assure that the record is useable as evidence in an audit or any other JTPA proceeding. As before, the substitution of microfilmed or photocopied records can continue to be used since these media are generally accepted as admissible for evidentiary purposes. The Department takes no position on the use of records stored on electronic media and the revised regulation neither authorizes nor specifically forbids their use. If electronic storage media were to be considered for use, the user would have to be certain that there are sufficient security safeguards and protections against tampering so that a court would accept the record as evidence in a proceeding. As in any case where a record is maintained, the burden of producing and authenticating it is on the custodian of the record and the failure to authenticate the record will lead to the custodian's being unable to use the record for any evidentiary purpose. Thus, if an SDA maintains its participant eligibility records on computer files and is unable to show that the records were secure or were tamperproof, the records could not be used to prove that participants were eligible for JTPA services. Public Access to Records Section 165(a)(4) of the Act requires recipients to make available to the public upon request certain records which are maintained by the recipients pursuant to section 165(a)(1) of the Act. Section 637.463 of the interim final rule was intended to merely reflect the statutory requirement. A number of comments were received expressing concerns that such disclosure would result in the invasion of personal privacy and would breach basic notions of customer confidentiality. In this same regard, some comments contended that this requirement conflicts with State privacy laws and that the statement in the regulation with this requirement applied ``notwithstanding the provisions of state or local law'' goes beyond the plain meaning of section 165(a)(4) of the Act. Another comment asked for a definition of the word ``clearly'' in the term ``clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy''. One comment questioned the provision in the regulation ``excepting'' recipient and subrecipient records from the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). Several comments requested that the regulations place reasonable time and place restrictions on the right of access. Section 627.463 is revised to follow more closely the statutory language. There is no intent to modify or expand on the plain meaning of the statute.
