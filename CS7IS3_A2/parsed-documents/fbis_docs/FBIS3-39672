At his meeting with Baudys, who is currently on a three-day visit to Ankara, Golhan said that the initiative "does not reflect the current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina." The Turkish side above all rejects the assumption that the conflict was religiously motivated. "In our opinion, it is above all necessary to keep intact the territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a state recognised by the United Nations and the international community," Golhan said, adding that "Bosnia and Herzegovina must not be partitioned." He hinted that Ankara's view is that the Bosnian (mainly Muslim) Government led by President Alija Izetbegovich is the only legal party to the conflict. Handing over powers to an executive goodwill committee is seen as inadequate because it basically involves the division of the republic, Golhan said. At the same time, however, Golhan praised Baudys's initiative, saying that "similar proposals contribute to ending the war in Bosnia and that is what makes them welcome."
