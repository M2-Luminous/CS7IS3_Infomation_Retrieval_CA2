He said: They contradict the resolutions of international legitimacy and the principles of peace based on the exchange of land for peace, which were reaffirmed at the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva. Addressing a crowded ceremony in al-Yarmuk camp in Damascus yesterday on the DFLP's 25th anniversary, Hawatimah added that the Oslo-Davos agreement [as heard] is a partial and separate agreement that gives nothing in return. He noted that this agreement was concluded behind the backs of the Palestinian people and their intifadah and that it is bound to fail. 'Abu-'Ali Mustafa, deputy secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], also delivered a speech on behalf of the joint PFLP-DFLP command and the alliance of Palestinian forces. Sayf Bin-'Ali also delivered a speech on behalf of the Arab liberation parties and movements, and 'Ammar al-Musawi, deputy head of Hizballah's Political Bureau, delivered a speech on behalf of the Lebanese national and Islamic resistance. The speakers condemned the Oslo and Davos negotiations and the Gaza-Jericho agreement--which disavow the Palestinian people's rights--and called for dropping these agreements. They also praised the brave intifadah in the occupied Arab territories and the steadfastness of our kinsfolk in the occupied Golan and southern Lebanon. The rally was attended by a number of secretary generals, members of political bureaus and central committees of Palestinian factions, a number of representatives of the Lebanese national and Islamic movement and Arab liberation movements, some members of the diplomatic corps accredited to Damascus, and a crowd of citizens.
