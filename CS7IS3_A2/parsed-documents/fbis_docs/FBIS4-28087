The actions include verbal abuse and physical harassment such as knifing of clothes against students of Korean schools. Female students of schools run by the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryun) wear traditional Korean clothing for uniforms, which could make them a target. At a meeting Tuesday night of the House of Representatives Justice Committee, Yasuo Kakehi, head of the ministry's Civil Liberties Bureau, said the ministry thinks such acts violate human rights and is investigating them. Justice Minister Hiroshi Nakai told the meeting that Korean residents in Japan should have the same human rights as Japanese nationals.
