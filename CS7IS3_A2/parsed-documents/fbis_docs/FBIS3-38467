Sama had said on December 21 that the PCI had received funds from the company in return for allowing Enimont to be attributed tax advantages. The PCI has since broken up into the Refounded Communist Party and the Democratic Party of the Left. Ferruzzi, a private group and Eni, the state energy holding company, set up a joint venture called Enimont. This fell apart and revealed a huge scandal of political corruption in which 150 billion lire was siphoned into the coffers of political parties and the pockets of people elected to positions of authority. Sama has been charged with corruption in connection with this but was appearing on Wednesday as a witness in a case against a key figure, Sergio Cusani. Sama, in his earlier statement, had not put a figure on the amount of the bribe paid to the communists. The court hearings have progressively revealed that all of the parties, led by the Christian Democratic Party and the Socialist Party, received big illicit commissions in connection with the Enimont deal to finance legislative elections in April 1992. Sama was forced to leave the company as a result of the discovery of a hole in the accounts which threatened to lead to bankruptcy. He told magistrates that in 1993 he learnt that the communists had been paid. He alleged that the funds had been provided by Cusani and by Raul Gardini, the former president of Ferruzzi-Montedison, who committed suicide as the corruption came to light. The money was paid to someone whose identity he did not know, Sama said.
