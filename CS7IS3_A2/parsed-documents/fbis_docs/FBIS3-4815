Some 1,600 members of peace organizations and religious groups across the country took part in the rally held in Yaizu, Shizuoka Prefecture, to commemorate the nuclear incident, which occurred off the Bikini atoll in the South Pacific on March 1, 1954. In the so-called lucky dragon incident, the Japanese fishing boat No. 5 Fukuryu Maru ("Lucky Dragon V"), which was based in Yaizu, was showered by a cloud of radioactive ash after the United States conducted a thermonuclear bomb test some 135 kilometers to the west of where the ship was conducting fishing operations. Most of the 23 crew members suffered nausea, pain and skin inflammation and one of the crew later died. The incident sparked outcries in Japan against the U.S. testing of nuclear weapons and attracted worldwide interest in the influence of radioactivity on the human body. At the rally, the participants adopted a resolution calling for the dismantling of all nuclear arms while the radiation victims or their bereaved families are still alive. Among the participants was John Anjani, who was then mayor of a village near the atoll and was also exposed to radioactive ash, and Anthony Guarisco, chairman of an association of U.S. veterans who fell victim to radioactivity from atomic testing.
