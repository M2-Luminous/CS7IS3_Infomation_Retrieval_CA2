The council examined the current foreign-political situation in connection with the resolution of the Croatian Assembly passed on 2 February 1994, and the presidential statement of the UNSC [UN Security Council] of 3 February this year. Having heard the report of Foreign Minister Mate Granic on his return from official visits to Italy and the Vatican and diplomatic contacts with other countries, the council adopted the following conclusions after a discussion on these and other matters: 1. The council thoroughly examined the UNSC presidential statement and decided to take all necessary steps in order that all controversial issues resulting from this statement be explained to the UNSC regarding the implementation of the demand concerning the Republic of Croatia. The aim is to enable the UN secretary general -- within the fixed deadline -- to submit to the UNSC an authoritative report based on facts. 2. The Council assessed that the UNSC presidential statement was adopted on the basis of an unjust and unsubstantiated request by Haris Silajdzic, and accusations of the involvement of 30,000 members of the Croatian Army in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina supported by some Islamic countries, with the clear aim of exerting international pressure on the Republic of Croatia and on all warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in order that a political solution be found. In connection with this the council said that Croatia -- in line with its constitutional provisions and the agreement on friendship and cooperation, signed by the president of the Republic of Croatia and the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency on 12 July 1992, has supported the defense efforts of the Croatian and Muslim people in Bosnia-Herzegovina since the beginning of the Serbian aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina, thus preventing Bosnia in its entirety from becoming part of greater Serbia. Croatia also accepted over half a million refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina and is today caring for 282,000 mostly Muslim refugees. 3. The presidential Defense and National Security Council was surprised to hear both the Sarajevo Government accusations and the UNSC presidential statement -- considering that Croatia, judging by the general recognition on behalf of international factors -- showed the highest level of cooperation in its efforts aimed at ending the war and finding a political solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Council maintains that Croatia should persevere in its peace-making policy. The aim of such a policy is to ensure the integrity of the Croatian nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is threatened by both Serb and Muslim aggression, this being in the interest of both the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the security of the Croatian state. In this connection the council draws attention to the need for the international community to take effective steps toward ending the war caused by the Serbian aggression, and toward ending the offensive of Muslim Armed Forces against Croatian areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially in central Bosnia where tens of thousands of Croatian civilians are threatened in some enclaves. 4. Concerning the accusations that Croatian Army elements are involved in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The council stresses that the Croatian Army units are deployed only in the border area between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, above Dubrovnik toward Stolac and Neretva [inside Bosnia-Herzegovina's Trebinje municipality]. They are holding defense lines against the Serbs in accordance with the above-mentioned agreement on friendship and cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. The council reiterated that Croatia had allowed about 2,000 volunteer soldiers of Bosnia-Herzegovina origin to go to help their [Croat] kin in Bosnia in order to protect them from aggression and ethnic cleansing. The world is aware that the volunteers, deployed in HVO [Croatian Defense Council] units, did not engage in any operations to capture territories that belong to somebody else, but only defended their centuries-old hearths. The Croatian public has supported them in this because they and their compatriots from those areas [Herzeg-Bosna] had joined Croatian Army ranks to defend Croatia from the Yugo-Communist and Serbian aggression. In comparison to Croatian volunteers, three times more Mojahedin fundamentalists from foreign states are fighting on the Muslim side. Not only Croatia but Europe as well is worried by the growth and strengthening of fundamentalism. 5. Concerning the allegations that regular Croatian Army units are deployed in central and southern Bosnia. The Defense Ministry of the Republic of Croatia will propose necessary steps in line with the demands made in the UNSC presidential statement. Croatia once again expresses its preparedness and calls for the international community to establish the real situation and the validity of the allegations. Further conclusions of the UNSC should be based on this. If the Muslim forces do not halt the offensive in central Bosnia, the Assembly's Chamber of Deputies believes that the government and the president of the Republic of Croatia should review and reconsider current diplomatic relations between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and, in line with their assessment, take all adequate steps. The council calls for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire and the resumption of talks in order to reach an agreement between Croats and Muslims in line with the proposal of the contractual agreement -- on establishing a lasting and permanent peace between the Croat and Bosnian Muslim nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and on the basis of further coexistence -- tabled by President Tudjman at a meeting with the Bosnian [Muslim] delegation in Bonn on 10 January 1994. If these efforts yield no results, Croatia should reconsider all relations with the government in Sarajevo, and the government of the Republic of Croatia has been given the task of drawing up a list of all Bosnia-Herzegovina representative offices and organizations active in the Republic of Croatia. The council believes that it is untenable that the government in Sarajevo should use the territory of the Republic of Croatia to plan and organize logistical support for its military actions, which result in the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Croats [in Bosnia]. The council demands of the international community to proclaim the threatened Croat areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina protected areas, and help secure the survival of the Croatian nation. The council has accepted the proposal to join the NATO program Partnership for Peace, and lends its support to Croatia's intention to join the process. In connection with this, the Foreign Affairs Ministry has been charged with drawing up a final proposal on this and taking concrete steps. [passage omitted] The council was informed about the steps taken to implement the declaration on the normalization of relations between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It was noted that the declaration should be implemented immediately, without any speculation in that respect. The council put a special stress on the fact that the agreement in principle on the normalization of relations between Croats and Serbs is not directed against Muslims. On the contrary, the agreement should be seen as a contribution to the efforts to reach a speedier solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The council lends its full support to the efforts of the Croatian Government to solve all disputed issues with the neighboring Republic of Slovenia as soon as possible, and it points to the need to deal simultaneously with the problem of the Piran Bay and connecting Croatia with Europe.
