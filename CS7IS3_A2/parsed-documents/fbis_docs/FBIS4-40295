A high-ranking delegation from India's military department, headed by Air Force Vice-Marshal Krishnaswami, has already departed for Russia, ITAR-TASS learned from a reliable source. The Indian delegation intends to visit the Irkutsk aviation factory, which produces the SU-30 planes, and to hold several meetings with leaders in Russia's defence industry. Indian pilots will take the fighter out for a test flight, after which the contract negotiations will enter their final phase. According to ITAR-TASS sources, Russia is ready to give India enough credits to buy 20 SU-30 fighters and to purchase a production license for the planes. India plans to manufacture them at the aviation factories in Nasik (Maharashtra State). This order should help India take advantage of the production capabilities it built up for the MiG-27 Soviet fighters-bombers, whose production license will soon run out. Indian specialists stress that the Russian SU-30, equipped with all the latest technology, is as good as the American F-18 and the European "Tornado", and is superior to the F-16 and the French "Mirage-2000". The Russian fighter has powerful weapons: a 30-mm gun and ten rockets of various kinds. It is also equipped with the capability to refuel in mid-flight, which widens its ability to search out and destroy air and land targets.
