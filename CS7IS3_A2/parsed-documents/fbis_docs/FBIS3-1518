There ought never to have been any question about the NP Operating in Transkei. That is the democratic right of all parties," notes an editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 30 March on page 18. "The ANC [African National Congress] and its allies have been enraged by Buthelezi's resistance to allowing his opponents to organise or even to help faciliate the right to vote in the April election," but they have remained "conspicuously silent about their `favored militay dictators' Holomisa" and Ramushwana of Venda. "A similiar reticence marks their attitude to corruption in Lebowa and kwaNdebele." "The use of South African troops to help srabilise" the government in Qwaqwa "is another welcome development. It shows that the SADF [South African Defense Force] is capable pf pre-emptive stabilising action, and will not be called upon to mop up once violence has already run its course." BUSINESS DAY A Fateful Choice -- "Monday's events in Johannesburg in which more than 30 Zulu royalists were killed, must fall into the same category as the shootings at Boipatong and Bisho and the assassination of Chris Hani, as far as their impact on the transition process is concerned," an editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 30 March on page 14 states. "Each of these events had the potential to derail the process," but each also produced a "countervailing force -- prompting renewed and more determined efforts." "The same two possible scenarios lie ahead now -- intensified conflict or a new successful phase of negotiations." "It is becoming increasingly apparent that an election in Natal can be no more than a stopgap measure, if that. A comprehensive political settelemnt before the end of April is impossible." "Even though Inkatha does not have a hope of winning a `struggle to the end,' it doubtless has the ability -- like Angola's UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] or Mozambique's Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] -- to hamper or even render impossible South Africa's attempts to democratise and develop." The ANC, NP and others "might be on the point of deciding that the only way to secure a relatively free election is to neutralise Inkatha now through mass action, emergency rule and, ultimately, brute force. No one dare take that fateful step before every other action is tried." SOWETAN Postmortems -- The "finger pointing" and postmortems concerning the "spectacular" events in Johannesburg have already begun, notes an editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 30 March on page 10. "Two important things can result from the event. The first is that the security situation before the elections has got to be tightened up and made more effective. The second is the calling of the summit of major political leaders." "We are afraid the time for political point-scoring is fast becoming real" and we are "sickened by the manner in which ordinary people are used in a battle for power that has very little to do with the future of South Africa."
