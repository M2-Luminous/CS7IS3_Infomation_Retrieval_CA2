Meng Jianxiong, deputy major of this largest commercial city in China, told a local meeting that the drive will stress revising the existing management of state-owned property and forming a group of powerful corporations. Topping the list of the city's ten main tasks is standardizing the management system of the ten nationally known commercial and service companies in the city, such as the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store and the Hualian Trade Mansion. In addition, the city is to adopt a series of measures to promote the drive this year, including establishing ten large corporations through mergers and purchasing, improving its 19 existing joint-stock companies and adding 10 more to the list. In addition, initial experiments in handling bankruptcies and mergers will be carried out, and 400 small-partnership commercial enterprises and 500 chain stores will be set up.
