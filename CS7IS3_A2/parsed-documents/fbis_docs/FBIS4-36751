The cease-fire was scheduled to take effect at 1800 Yemen time. Al-Asnaj, who is accompanying Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, envoy of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, on his visit to Abu Dhabi, told a MENA correspondent in the United Arab Emirates that the areas of Darb al- 'Amr, Khormaksar, (al-Mu'lla), al-Tawahi, al-Hiswah, al-Burayqah, and al-Waht are being subjected to missile attacks and heavy artillery bombardment at the rate of three missiles per minute. He said that the bombardment is still going on. Al-Asnaj said that well over 700,000 citizens in Aden became homeless when the pumps for drinking water, power generators, ports, and residential areas came under bombardment. He said that the situation in Yemen is deteriorating due to the continuation of the war launched by the Sanaa regime. He pointed out the south is complying unconditionally with the cease-fire decision. Al-Asnaj urged the international community to provide the citizens in Aden, Lahij, and Abyan with drinking water, medication, and food. Al-Asnaj accused military experts from Iraq and Jordan of being involved in the Yemeni war, adding that the war machines of north Yemen are completely under the control of these experts. He said that seven Iraqi experts have been taken prisoner by the southern forces and that 20 Jordanian experts have been seen at the Sanaa Air Base. Al-Asnaj urged the international and Islamic worlds to support the sons of Yemen in the south and to condemn the aggression against them. He said that Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and his delegation will later leave for Hadhramaut to meet with UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi. He added that he will return to Abu Dhabi on his way to the United Nations to follow up on the report that will be submitted by Ibrahimi to the UN secretary general.
