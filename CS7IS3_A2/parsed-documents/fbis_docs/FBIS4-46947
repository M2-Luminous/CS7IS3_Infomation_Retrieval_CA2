(From a Russian song) For the first time Russian loggers will be able to break into the American market, which has so far been geared toward its own resources and deliveries from neighboring Canada. For the first time Russian timber-processing enterprises and pulp-and-paper combines will be able to obtain up-to-date technologies and equipment from a credit line guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Finally, for the first time in Russian-American relations it has become possible to seriously discuss a project of such significance at the highest level. The document whose signing means the implementation of all these "first times" in practice is called the Agreement on Cooperation in the Area of Modernizing the Timber Industry Complex of Russia. It is planned to review the draft agreement in June among other documents at a regular meeting of the intergovernmental commission for issues of Russian-American scientific-technical and economic cooperation (the "Chernomyrdin-Gore Commission"). The Russian logging company Roslesprom is currently awaiting the remarks and comments of the U.S. Department of Commerce concerning the draft agreement on the reconstruction and upgrading of the pulp-and-paper and timber-processing industry of Russia and the delivery of Russian products to the American market. Upon coordination, it is planned that the draft agreement will be reviewed within a general package of documents submitted for the June meeting of the "Chernomyrdin-Gore Commission." As a KOMMERSANT correspondent has managed to learn, a credit line guaranteed by the U.S. Government and the participation of American companies producing equipment for the pulp-and-paper and timber-processing industry in modernizing a number of key Russian enterprises in the industry will be the main aspects of the agreement for the Russian side. (As chief specialist of Roslesprom Aleksandr Lagutenkov told a KOMMERSANT correspondent, the depreciation of fixed assets at a number of combines and associations has now reached 60-70 percent.) The Russians will pay back the credit with finished products. Domestic loggers will thus be given an opportunity for the first time to enter the U.S. market, which has so far been geared mainly toward its own resources and deliveries from Canada. Judging by unofficial information from Roslesprom, the Americans are mainly interested in pulp-and-paper production facilities. At present Roslesprom is working on a list of enterprises which, in the opinion of the Russian side, may attract American partners. These are primarily combines outfitted with new equipment which are capable of substantially increasing the output of exportable products. According to information which KOMMERSANT has succeeded in obtaining at Roslesprom, this list will certainly include the joint-stock company Arkhangelsk Pulp-and-Paper Combine, Svyatogorsk (Leningrad Oblast), Solikamskbumprom (Perm Oblast), and the Tsepruss Joint Venture (the former Kaliningrad Pulp-and-Paper Plant). Strange as it may be, the project was initiated by the Americans themselves rather than the Russian loggers, who are smothered by domestic problems and depressed by a slump in the world market. As a KOMMERSANT correspondent was told at Roslesprom, two main reasons compelled American consumers to establish contacts with Russia. The appearance in 1993 of a certain beetle in the Canadian forests which turns quality timber into dust was the first reason. American consumers have tightened the quality requirements for products delivered from the north, and Canadians had to treat the forest intensively in order to destroy the beetle. So far, the insecticidal campaign has not been particularly successful. Meanwhile, the scope of activities of the malevolent insect has become so extensive that the United States, where about 300 kilograms of paper products per capita are produced annually, had to turn its sights toward Russia, where as little as 28 kilograms of such products are produced. The "Greens" movement, under pressure from which draft laws sharply restricting the cutting of forests have been recently passed in both North American states, is the second cause which prompted the Americans to offer cooperation to Russia. It is notable that Vice President Albert Gore is one of the champions of this strategic policy in the United States; in June he will meet with Prime Minister of Russia Viktor Chernomyrdin in order to discuss, among others, issues of delivering the products of Russian loggers to the United States.
