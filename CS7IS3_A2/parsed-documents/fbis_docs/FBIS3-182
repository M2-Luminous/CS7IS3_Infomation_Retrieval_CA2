He was opening the committee meetings of the Global Coalition for Africa (GCA) in the Beninois economic capital. The committees are governance and democracy chaired by Soglo and economic reform polices chaired by Ghana's finance and economic planning minister, Kwesi Botchwey. Soglo said African countries are currently facing economic and financial crises of an unprecedented dimension. He said all the political and economic reform efforts and sacrifices so far made by them have been reduced to nought. "Our countries are facing an imminent social upheaval and we are left with no choice but to unite or perish," Soglo told delegates attending the four-day GCA meeting. Launched in Kampala, Uganda, in 1990, the GCA seeks to improve the working partnership existing between African and developing countries in economic and development-related fields. Soglo said the recent devaluation of the CFA franc which was not originally on the meeting's agenda was placed at the last minute because of its obvious implications for economic reform in the countries concerned. Pegged to the French franc since 1948, the CFA franc which the common currency for 14 francophone countries in West and Central Africa and the Comoros, was devalued in January by 50 percent, seriously hurting the already fragile economies of these countries. The Beninois president said despite follow-up measures taken including debt reduction, increased investment and reasonable control of price increases, the situation remains "extremely serious." Soglo said a devaluation of this magnitude is difficult to manage and is bound to cause social tension. "We should exchange ideas and experiences to make the devaluation of the CFA a positive change and a new opportunity for economic development instead of considering it as catastrophe." Soglo said his committee will present a comprehensive study on self-evaluation of governance and democracy. The document, which will be presented to African governments, contains concrete measures to meet the challenge of effective governance and transition to democratic rule. The committee on economic reform policies is excepted to discuss structural adjustment and economic reforms and a strategy for agricultural development in Africa. More than 100 delegates are attending the committee meetings. Also in attendance are three former heads of state -- Amadou Toure of Mali, Pierre Buyoya of Burundi, and Aristides Pereira of Cape Verde.
