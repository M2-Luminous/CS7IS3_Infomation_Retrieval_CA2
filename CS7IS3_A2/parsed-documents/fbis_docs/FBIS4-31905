The cabinet of Jozef Moravcik is planning to privatise the gas and power industries without bothering about the fact that only a rich foreign entity can gain these strategic industrial branches which involve practically no profit risk, the paper stresses. It adds that the government has also approved standard-method privatisation projects for spas while it is beyond doubt who will be given priority in the sell-out of the natural wealth. The author of the commentary claims that Jan Carnogursky, Milan Knazko and other politicians "have information" that foreign countries will not support Slovakia's integration into the European Union if Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) wins the autumn early elections. All of them are warning the Slovak public -- do not vote Meciar, else Europe will not accept Slovakia. The temporary government wants to place this country again in the hands of foreign lords. "Won't we become tenants in our own country after the half a year of its rule," the paper asks. [passage omitted]
