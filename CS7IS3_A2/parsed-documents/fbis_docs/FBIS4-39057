The injured couple are widely known in the city: Yekaterina Zhabotinskaya is head of the Central Bank of Russia's chief branch in Novosibirsk Oblast. Vladimir Zhabotinskiy is deputy director of a firm. According to information from the hospital, both sustained multiple wounds. Following operations, there are no fears for their lives. Criminal proceedings have been instituted and an investigation is under way. This attempt continues the chain of crimes connected with leaders of the local branch of the Central Bank. Its former chief, Vasiliy Cheplakov, has twice found himself in the criminals' "sights." He was doused with acid, then shot, but luckily the bullet missed. "I know full well that I will be the criminals' next victim, because I am not convenient for a lot of people," Nikolay Beloslyudtsev, deputy chief of the Central Bank branch, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. He expressed strong indignation over the fact that the two attempts on Cheplakov's life remain unsolved. In his opinion, "the law-enforcement organs are dozing."
