Valeriy Zorkin: `The Most Important Question Is the Effectiveness of the Authorities Themselves'"] [Excerpts] The publication in recent days of various texts designed to raise to a formal level the idea of national accord which is now prevalent in society is in danger of turning into a regular race around Sadovoye Koltso for the National Reconciliation Prize. This idea, which has enormous constructive potential, is for some reason being deliberately steered away from broad public discussion, and because of the vagueness, formalism, and incomprehensibility -- to ordinary people -- of the proposed "memorandums," it is becoming the subject of haggling among just a small group of politicians. [passage omitted] If this or that draft agreement is not to become just another ideological one-day wonder, the following must be borne in mind. A national accord is a kind of social contract, a public agreement on certain principles or measures capable of pulling the country back from the brink of the abyss. It is not a deal made by the political elite behind the people's back, but a compromise among the main political forces expressing the people's own vital interests. And it should not be an agreement between robber and robbed, but a broad public understanding that without the immediate implementation of concrete priority measures the country cannot be prevented from drifting into national disaster. And the role of the authorities in this compromise is a distinct and, I would say, subordinate role. The authorities do not impose their own terms from above, by means of a decree, on the basis of their own selfish, narrow party interests; they face the people with an admission of their mistake in leading society into an impasse, at the same time proposing a carefully thought-out change of political course in order to implement priority anticrisis actions. If the authorities are not prerpared to take this fundamentally important step, any agreement naturally becomes, for them, a "mandate" to further plunder and ruin the country. To avoid the abyss, harsh measures are needed, but measures based on strict compliance with the law and on society's consent. This latter is no less important in that without that consent any strong-arm solutions, including a state of emergency, will be futile and ineffective in a huge country like Russia. The most important question now is the effectiveness of the authorities themselves; without this, it is impossible to restore order in the country. The first steps toward an agreement on national reconciliation and society's consent for these authorities specifically to implement anticrisis measures should be rigorous discipline in the state apparatus and a curb on corruption and arbitrary bureaucratic rule. The second key question on which an accord has already developed in society is that of halting the wave of crime involving "shoot-outs" among mafiosi groups in public places, causing mass casualties among innocent people, even children. Society itself is prepared for a redistribution of the meager resources available in the country in order to create a protective environment and curb the rampant crime which is encouraged by the chaos that prevails in the power structures. But in that case, one wonders, what use are ineffective authorities to a society that is forced to act on its own account? The third key question should be that of an accord on urgent economic measures. It is necessary to prevent the economic bankruptcy of the state, with all the ensuing economic and social problems (such as the nonpayments crisis, the shutdown of industry, the lack of resources for agricultural operations or for wages). A fourth problem on which a national accord has already formed is that of resolute actions to restore the destroyed links between the former Union republics, as well as translating to a practical plane the work of recreating a new union statehood on a strictly voluntary basis. Especially since initiatives in this direction come not only from Moscow, but also from Alma-Ata [Almaty], Minsk, and the capitals of other former republics. Naturally one can speak of the existence of a social consensus on questions of preventing the destruction of Russia's intellectual potential, support for enterprise geared to the national interest, etc. Concrete proposals have been in existence on all these matters for a long time. All that is needed is the desire on the part of the authorities and the existence of the will, the capacity to fulfill them. All in all, accord is possible only on the basis of a change in the catastrophic course imposed by the radical "democrats."
