The Need Has Arisen for Restructuring"] [Text] A resolution of the government of the Russian Federation entitled "State Support and Protection of Space Activity in the Russian Federation," dated 11 December 1993, was published in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on 11 January 1994 and thus was put into official force. The resolution was adopted against the background of developing work on construction of the joint Russian-American orbital station, the Alpha. Finally, the Russian Space Agency (RSA), it appears, has found its place amidst the giants of national rocket building. From now on it is planned that all funding of the Russian Federal Space Program be through the RSA. For this purpose it is proposed that the agency be allocated an antedated 164.8 billion rubles for 1993, and for 1994 -- 274.8 billion. Other than the RSA, only the military space forces are designated as users of space vehicles. It must be said that considerable work on the development of the juridical base of national cosmonautics was carried out in the Commission on Communications, Information Science and Space ("Adrov Commission") of the former Supreme Soviet. Without question the preparers of the new resolution made use of the accumulated experience. However, for the first time a number of interesting innovations are appearing in such a high official document. Although the situation with the Baykonur cosmodrome has been normalized for some time and agreements have been reached with the Kazakhstan side and although the funding of the principal cosmodrome of the former USSR is especially provided for, the new document proposes to interested organizations that in a month's time they present to the government proposals on the further development of Russian Plesetsk and on establishing a new cosmodrome in the Russian Far East. Thus, there has been official continuation of the "Blagoveshchensk Project." Since due to purely physical reasons it is possible to put considerably lesser loads into space from northern Plesetsk than from the lower latitudes, and since Baykonur seems none too attractive from the political point of view, the civilian and military rocket users of Russia are unified in their desire that something new be constructed. All the moreso since launchings of the heaviest (other than the stillborn Energiya) Russian rocket, the Proton, are impossible from the Plesetsk test range, making it is quite necessary to construct launch facilities. It is assumed that if they are to be built, it is better that it be done to the southeast. The spent stages in this case will fall in the ocean and the protests from Kazakh, Yakut and Nenets herders should probably cease. If two launch sites are constructed for Protons in the Blagoveshchensk region in the Far East, then naturally a duplicating center of Russian cosmonautics will take shape, taking into account the only station in Russia for the monitoring of distant space with the 70-m antenna at Ussuriysk and the reserve airfield for the Buran at Khorol. It is true that it is a long way to transport Protons from Moscow. In addition to the Far Eastern project, there is the quite exotic project of the NPO Energiya, which has been kicked around in its time, the construction, on the basis of the model and similar to the Italian San Marco, of a floating platform for the launching of rockets from equatorial waters. The payload, to be sure, is increased, but there is a corresponding increase in the load on the long-suffering space budget. It is probably necessary to forget the platform for the time being. Reading between the lines in the new documents, one can visualize the direction of further restructuring and concentration of national aerospace. Fully in accordance with market conditions an individual item provides for the allocation of preferred conversion credits for ensuring the production of technology in conformity to a specific list. If this list is comprehensive and if survival of the enterprises and organizations not included in the list is not contemplated, the fate of a number of facilities and projects becomes clear -- they will die. Reference, in particular, is to the construction of solid-fuel boosters, including those based on ballistic missiles from submarines (Machine Building Design Bureau at Miass in the Southern Ural); to the further production of the light Kosmos booster at the Omsk Polet Production Association; finally, to the Buran system and in general winged spacecraft. The Tushino NPO Molniya, building the Buran spaceplane, is not named in the list, but the Buran, together with the Energiya, on the other hand, were mentioned in a "requiem" press conference of Yuriy Koptev, RSA director, at the end of the year. The Buran is not to be. The only thing which can be recommended to the devotees of romantic spaceplanes is to await the opening of an elite restaurant in Gorkiy Park which will be placed aboard one of the Burans. However, some of the projects will probably be taken over by the military. A number of their main organizations are not mentioned in the document, but without their support the projects are unlikely to survive. With respect to the "civilian segment," it is evident that the giant established by Academician Korolev, the NPO Energiya, now bearing his name, as before has a special status in Russian space plans. Although the NPO (strictly speaking, it is unknown on whose initiative, up to now specific individuals are either dissociating themselves or whitewashing themselves after the fact) in my opinion has somewhat lost its initiative and dynamic character, in the mid-1970's getting itself involved in the venture with the Buran, the continuing cooperation with the American NASA on the orbital station is again advancing the enterprise at Podlipki into a privileged position. The several hundred million dollars to be received from the Americans is entirely comparable to the entire Russian space budget for a year or two. In addition, the NPO Energiya traditionally has carried out such functions and also has had such subdivisions which throughout the world have usually been regarded as governmental. The cosmonaut detachment, for example. Most of the directors of national cosmonautics and the military-industrial complex in general (including Aleksey Adrov, the former chairman of the Supreme Soviet commission, and Yuriy Baturin, the newly designated presidential assistant on national security) came from Podlipki. The latest resolution strengthens this special status even in details -- the next to the last item in the resolution allows the RSA to have the additional post of deputy general director. This post is set aside specially for Yuriy Semenov, the present-day general designer of the NPO Energiya. Whatever you say, the structure of the space complex in Russia has taken on a monstrous form. Bad enough that a number of enterprises of the once unified military-space complex are now located abroad, primarily in the Ukraine, but also in Kirgizia and in Uzbekistan, not to mention Baykonur. The responsibility for clear-cut implementation of the government space program has been capriciously distributed between the state RSA and industrial enterprises (Energiya) which are being privatized. The very same American NASA, unquestionably a government agency, but having in its makeup very well-developed research and planning centers, is able to turn to private enterprises of the aerospace industry only with specific government orders. This is funded by a budget approved by the congress. Therefore, the time has come for a restructuring of the Russian space infrastructure. However paradoxical it may seem, the guardians of government interests in most cases are the directors and specialists of privatized scientific-production enterprises rather than a new generation of oversight people from state offices. It must be assumed that despite all the swingings of political vanes the hand on the pulse of Russian cosmonautics will continue to be held by the chief designers and the heads of design sections, and not only by managers and administrators. Although many specialists, even at this same NPO Energiya, and particularly in the "outer circle," consider that it would be useful to establish a Russian NASA. This dream was mentioned once again during the monthlong period, but the dream evidently died on 11 January. It must be assumed that soon we will learn what direction the restructuring of national cosmonautics will take. It can be assumed that in Moscow, and probably in Krasnoyarsk (communication satellites), several federal space centers will be established, as stated in the resolution, for the concentration of efforts. The legendary Konstantin Tsiolkovskiy prophesied the arrival from space of "mountains of grain and unlimited power." Present-day rocket specialists prefer a bird in the hand to two in the bush. It is best to remind our excessively pragmatic comrades once again how at one time such pragmatism forced Isabella of Castile to finance the voyage of Columbus.
