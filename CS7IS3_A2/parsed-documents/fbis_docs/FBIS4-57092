The official GRANMA daily reports that this plan is part of an integral strategy to increase national production of pharmaceutical items. The strategy includes the implementation of a control system, strict prescriptions, and specific uses for medicine. There also will be more support for herbal medicine. Health Minister Julio Teja reported that foreign exchange has been earmarked to support a more independent and efficient import strategy. My ministry is making great efforts to ensure the supply of 352 medicines considered to be essential for the people's health, Minister Teja said. This includes 73 that are already guaranteed by means of a control card and that benefit 2 million people. The health minister said the production of Priority 2 medicines included in the pharmaceutical inventory will grow until it reaches levels similar to those of 1992. The medical-pharmaceutical industry has outlined a plan to secure materials, and much of the raw materials necessary are already in the country, GRANMA reports. The minister noted that this industry's production, which in 1993 generated 59.7 million pesos (the same amount in dollars, at the official exchange rate), will climb to approximately 84 million in 1994, a figure similar to that of 1992. One initial measure designed to control medicinal supplies and avert black market profiteering will be to make drugstores more accessible to the population. This group includes medicine freely sold whenever available. It includes aspirin, antiseptics, digestion medicine, analgesic balms, and dry lotions. The plan also calls for linking medical centers with nearby pharmacies where patients can acquire prescribed medicine. At the same time, a significant number of pediatric, gynecological, clinical, and surgical products will be included in intrahospital pharmacies where medicine prescribed at the institutions can be acquired. These control measures are designed to permit outpatients and hospital-released patients to buy the medicine prescribed by their doctors. Deadlines also will be set for purchasing antibiotics and chemotherapy medicine in light of the fact that the nonacquisition of these products within an established timeframe makes their use unnecessary because a medical reevaluation of the patient becomes necessary. The plan foresees the creation of a corps of inspectors that will function at all levels to oversee the process and guarantee its efficiency.
