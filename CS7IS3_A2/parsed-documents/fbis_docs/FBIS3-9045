According to the Bratislava press, Meciar's government at an extraordinary meeting last Friday [11 March] approved with lightening speed nine privatization projects, including one for the lucrative spa of Piestany in west Slovakia. Similarly the cabinet agreed to almost thirty privatizations through direct sale in the second half of February, when the threat of the government's fall hung in the air. "Privatization in Slovakia almost stopped in 1992, but from February 15 began to proceed very quickly," said Janicina in a radio interview, "until I got the impression that the same thing was happening as when William the Conqueror invaded Britain and handed out properties to his loyal Normans." "I have the feeling that it is a form of political corruption. It is necessary to stop these sales. Fortunately there are not so many of these cases that it isn't possible to correct them in a couple of days," he continued. During his tenure until the autumn elections the new minister intends to carry out privatization in accordance with the law in order to renew confidence both here and abroad, reconsolidate the situation at the ministry, and prepare the conditions for starting the second wave of coupon privatization. According to hitherto officially unconfirmed information, Meciar's government last Friday approved privatization projects for: Chemosvit Svit; Paliva Skalica; Slovenske liecebne kupele Priestany; part of Interhotel Bratislava; part of Zapadoslovensky ZDROJ; Polygraficke zavody Trnava, Kovohuty Krompachy, VAP Presov. It also agreed a change to the approved project concerning VSZ Kosice. At the center of attention is the Piestany spa, with assets of 1.6 billion korunas. A fifty-percent share was obtained by a limited liability company whose agent is the spa's director Gajdos, and whose silent partner is the ex-minister for health Viliam Sobona. The first instalment payment was fixed at 87 million korunas. Last year the spa made a profit of 180 million korunas.
