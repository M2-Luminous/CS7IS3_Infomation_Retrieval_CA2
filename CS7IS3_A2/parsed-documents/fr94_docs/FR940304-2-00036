FR940304-2-00036 FR940304-2-00028 Section 258.70␣Applicability and Effective Date_The State has amended their regulations to automatically remove the current financial assurance exemption for the Delaware Solid Waste Authority (DSWA), which currently manages all of Delaware's municipal solid waste. On April 9, 1995, the DSWA will be subject to the Federal financial assurance requirements adopted at Section 4.A.6.a. of the DRGSW. Section 258.73␣Financial Responsibility for Corrective Action_The State has adopted into regulation, at Sections 4.A.11.f. and 4.A.11.g. of the DRGSW, the requirements of this section. C. Decision Lacking public comment or opposition to EPA's tentative determination, I conclude that the State of Delaware's application for adequacy determination meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Delaware is granted a determination of adequacy for all portions of its municipal solid waste permit program. Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). Today's action takes effect on the date of publication. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register . All of the requirements and obligations in Delaware's program are currently in effect as a matter of State law. EPA's action today does not impose any new requirements with which the regulated community must begin to comply, nor do these requirements become enforceable by EPA as federal law. Consequently, EPA does not find it necessary to give notice prior to making its approval effective. Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This notice, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. Authority: This notice is issued under the authority of section 4005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended; 42 U.S.C. 6946. Dated: February 24, 1994. William T. Wisniewski, Acting Regional Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4993 Filed 3&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
