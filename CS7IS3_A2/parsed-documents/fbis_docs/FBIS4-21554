The hundreds of howitzer, mortar, and tank shells that have landed on parts of the defense lines and the shelling of Cazin, Bihac, and the surrounding areas this afternoon mark the 43d day of the Serbian aggressor's offensives on the Bihac region. Our defenders are heroically resisting the wolves from Mount Ozren who have again arrived on the Bihac front. The fact that they used chemical agents in attacks today sufficiently illustrates the behavior by Karadzic's terrorists. When they failed to break the defenders' resistance, they turned against city districts. Substantial material damage was caused in Cazin. Some civilians were wounded, but fortunately no one was killed. In addition, the rage by Abdic's paramilitary has continued in the border areas of the Cazin municipality. The targets of secessionists' attacks are the same ones they have been mercilessly destroying and torching since last night. They are also killing domestic animals and expelling people. A large number of refugees from these areas, especially from Krivaja, Liskovac, and (?Trzac), arrived in Cazin today. [passage omitted]
