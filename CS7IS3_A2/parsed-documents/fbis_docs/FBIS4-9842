[Parrinello] Because I am optimistic and feel certain that we can do something for Guatemala. I am aware of the responsibility I assumed and know that a difficult task awaits me. We must be realistic, however. We know we cannot fully resolve the security problem, but we can lay the groundwork for society to walk the path of justice. We must struggle to recover the values we have lost -- ethics, respect for the family, church, and homeland. We Guatemalans need a reassessment of moral values. It is a difficult process, but it must be started soon. I have been given an opportunity and I am determined to use it. [Ibanez] Why do you think you can succeed where many others have failed? [Parrinello] I trust myself and my team. Ortiz Moscoso had good intentions, but he is the one who should talk about why he failed. We will show, with short-term results, that we can provide the security Guatemalans desire. For this reason, I have outlined an emergency plan to be put into effect within the next 60 days. We will see what happens after that date. [Ibanez] What methods will you use to attain results and what experience do you have in security matters? [Parrinello] I have used my first days in office to organize a full team, which includes National Police [PN] directors, immigration officials, and Finance Police, two deputy ministers, and several advisers to outline strategies to fight crime. The team complements the plan I have already mentioned. Regarding your second question, I have prepared myself for the post of government minister, not for PN director. I have taken courses related to security issues in the United States and Brazil. [Ibanez] Security is a universal demand. How do you intend to meet this nationwide need? [Parrinello] We are aware of a great lack of security, which has created a climate of instability and led people to mistrust the authorities. My most important role at this time, however, is to restore social order. I am certain that, with the creation of the Immediate Reaction Platoon, which will be an elite PN group initially comprising 300 men, we will fight crime better. We will work vigorously and in some cases employ reasonable uses of force. Also, an investigation section will be created, which will operate independently from the PN's Criminal Investigations Department. A special remanding unit, which will try to prevent judges from releasing criminals because of police errors, will also be created. Respect for human rights and compliance with the law are part of my principles, and I intend to stick to them while in office. Nevertheless, I will also use all available resources and mechanisms to prevent crime. We are determined to raise the status of the police to one of dignity. In exchange, we will demand that the police make a commitment to the people. As for weapons, patrol cars, and other equipment, we will update these to curb crime. [Ibanez] How do you intend to carry out these plans considering there is not an adequate budget to fund programs of this kind? [Parrinello] It is true that a shortage of resources is one of our greatest problems. Nevertheless, I not only have the president of the Republic's backing, but I also have been offered economic support from private sector representatives willing to cooperate with the government. This support represents a mutual benefit. This is why we will create a kind of patronage or committee to manage the funds we will collect. In addition, we will seek advice on security matters. Meanwhile, we will do our best with whatever we have. Also, we will ask the government to allocate the necessary funds so people can have a PN that truly offers protection. [Ibanez] People do not trust the police. How will you change this image? [Parrinello] We are aware of this. For this reason, we do not intend to reorganize it but to start a program to purge it, whereby police officials involved in corruption will be fired and tried. For this purpose, I have appointed a PN director who will be responsible for initiating the appropriate proceedings. Nevertheless, we must be realistic and admit that we do not have a magical formula to purge the PN. [Ibanez] How do you explain the appointment of a military officer as deputy minister in charge of security? Does this appointment represent the establishment of a hard-line in the Government Ministry? [Parrinello] I want to be very clear on Colonel Merida's appointment. In relation to his appointment, there was no pressure and there will be none in any other appointment I might make. I nominated him because he is a very good friend of mine, because I have confirmed that he is truly a security expert, and because he will contribute all of his expertise to eradicating crime. As for the hard line, I am willing to do a good job. This means I will act with a heavy hand, but according to law so no one can violate the Guatemalan people's rights.
