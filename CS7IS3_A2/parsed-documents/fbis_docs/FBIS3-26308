Since he has revealed his desire to do this, it is worth assessing how far along the road to autonomy Hong Kong has travelled during his tenure. Ten years after the Joint Declaration was signed, the power to control Hong Kong's destiny was supposed to be firmly in the hands of Hong Kong people. Instead, it increasingly looks as if the territory will merely change from having one undemocratically chosen and unaccountable British chief executive to an equally unaccountable one under China. Patten arrived after successive British colonial governments relegated Hong Kong people to the position of powerless and almost irrelevant bystanders in decisions about our own future. He pledged to do otherwise. But in many critical ways his tenure has further entrenched the colonial establishment and concentrated all governing power in the hands of the executive. The losers are the people of Hong Kong. While the Governor has volunteered to respond to legislative councillors' queries in scheduled "question times", this is only a cosmetic change -- the first chief executive of the Special Administrative Region can simply refuse to turn up to do this. Much more relevant are the steps Patten has not taken in the Legislative Council [Legco]. For instance, of the 34 motion debates held by Legco last year, he either openly refused to, or has failed to take action on more than 40 percent of them. So while the Governor professes to want to let the people of Hong Kong drive, it is evident he will not let go of the wheel. Patten's most damaging mistake has been the decision to exclude all of Hong Kong's democratically elected representatives from the policy-making Executive Council [Exco]. Instead of using Exco as a genuine cabinet to govern in co-ordination with the local leaders who will have to manage the territory after 1997, he has taken greater personal and direct control over the body. Under Patten, not a single Exco member has been elected by, or is accountable to, anyone but Patten himself. So instead of a cabinet that can feel the pulse of Hong Kong our chief policy-making body is little more than an annex to Patten's personal fiction. The result is that all major decisions are made by a man who will leave in three years. Patten has also resisted calls to establish an independent human rights commission and opposes the Access to Information Bill which would promote a truly open and accountable government. He has announced plans to set up a Court of Final Appeal based on the secret Sino-British deal condemned by Legco, and his government has long dragged its heels in striking down colonial laws that clearly contravene the Bill of Rights. Patten enjoys a wide reputation as the champion of democracy, but there is no real evidence as yet that his government is any more democratic or any more accountable than under his colonial predecessors. Nor has there been a change in the longstanding policy of the British government of negotiating with Beijing over the heads of the people of Hong Kong. The Governor has repeatedly refused to allow a referendum on the electoral arrangements for the 1994-95 elections, in spite of his oft-stated objective of letting the people of Hong Kong have a say in their future. For Hong Kong people to rule Hong Kong with a meaningful degree of autonomy after 1997, we must be allowed to take control of our own destiny now. Patten must appoint democratically-elected local leaders to Exco and turn the Government into one that is at last managed by the people of the territory. He must allow such a locally-constituted government to stand up for itself and deal with Beijing. And Hong Kong's affairs must be decided openly by the people of the territory, not in secret by British and Chinese diplomats. If we are not ruling ourselves with autonomy under a British administration accountable to a democratic parliament, it is naive to think Beijing will allow us to rule ourselves after 1997. Patten must not only take the back seat, he must take responsibility for realizing the "one country, two systems" objective by establishing the institutions that will allow Hong Kong its promised post-1997 self-government. And on June 30, 1997, when the last Governor leaves, he must be able to say the institutions he has left behind will preserve our individual freedoms through the rule of law and provide a system of local, accountable government. He can only do this by respecting the wishes of the people of Hong Kong and those who have been democratically elected to represent them.
