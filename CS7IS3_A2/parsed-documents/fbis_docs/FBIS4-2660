A book marked for "internal circulation" was found in their luggage when security police searched their hotel room in Wenzhou in Zhejiang province on April 4. The police claimed the journalists had violated China's Law on the Protection of State Secrets, saying that as "non-mainland people" they should not possess books bearing the mark "internal circulation". The two women journalists from the Hong Kong Chinese-language daily The Express--who wish to remain anonymous in the wake of the Xi Yang case--recently went to Wenzhou to report on voluntary medical work by a team of Hong Kong doctors, nurses and therapists. The 12-person medical team were providing a free service to 500 rural patients. On April 4, the two journalists--a reporter and a photographer--visited the city's bookstores and made several purchases, for which they were given receipts. When the security police searched their hotel room they found medical documents provided by local medical officials at Wenzhou city hospital. Though the journalists proved they bought their books in a local bookstore and the documents were given to them by a local hospital for publicity purposes, they were still warned by the police. The books and other printed matter were confiscated. Chiu Sin-tsang, the chief editor of The Express, yesterday said he could not yet comment. Daisy Li, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Journalists' Association, said the Express incident posed a new threat to normal journalistic activities. "We are very concerned (about) this incident, which may cause tremendous anxiety among (the) local press," she said. "China can have a very arbitrary definition of so-called classified materials, which in this case are books and publicity materials," Li said. She said China should make clear which materials "non-mainland people" should not hold. This latest incident indicates China has not only hardened its stance when dealing with the press in the capital, but has extended its hardline policy to other provinces.
