The Russian defense minister is currently in this central Asian republic in connection with conducting exercises of the collective peacemaking forces in the south of Tajikistan. The adoption of the law on the status of the Russian peacemaking forces will allow to resolve many problems including the one concerning social benefits to servicemen and members of their families located outside Russia, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev stressed. The fate of the Russian troops in Tajikistan whose term of stay expires on December 31 this year "will depend on the political solution to the problems of this region", the minister told ITAR- TASS in an exclusive interview. At the same time, he noted, the "strategic interests of Russia and other Commonwealth countries make Russia to station its troops in the republic and on the Tajik-Afghan border". Speaking on the exercises being carried out in the south of the republic, the defense minister emphasised that this was not the "demonstration of force" but a planned event within the framework of collective security of the Commonwealth countries. According to Pavel Grachev, one of the aims of his visit is to discuss principles and terms of a political settlement of the region's problems with the leadership of the republic and the command of the peacemaking forces. "Negotiations are the main way to the peaceful settlement of the conflict," Pavel Grachev stressed. The variant of handing over the peacemaking forces from the Defense Ministry to any other department is unacceptable as other departments "have no experience of handling troops", the Russian defense minister pointed out. On Thursday morning Pavel Grachev is due to visit the area of the exercises of the peacemaking forces.
