Dear listeners, you will see a detailed report on this visit later. On our special program we bring to your attention Aliyev's news briefing in Istanbul on his visit. [Aliyev] I came to Istanbul, Turkey, for a brief working visit at the invitation of the esteemed Suleyman Demirel. I am now returning to Baku, Azerbaijan. Meetings of very great importance Azerbaijan have taken place here. One reason for my arrival here at the invitation of our esteemed friend and brother Suleyman Demirel was to hold talks and consultations and put forward certain proposals regarding accelerating the development of ties between Turkey and Azerbaijan. For this purpose, we held detailed and lengthy talks yesterday with the Turkish president, esteemed Suleyman Demirel, and we discussed all the issues of interest to Turkey and Azerbaijan. Today I met the Turkish prime minister, esteemed Tansu Ciller, and the deputy prime minister, esteemed Murat Karayalcin. We discussed the development of friendly and fraternal ties between Turkey and Azerbaijan and speeding up the solution of certain matters. We reached agreement on many issues. This was the main purpose of my visit, and as such I am very satisfied with my visit here. Of course, during our meetings with esteemed Suleyman Demirel, Tansu Ciller, and Murat Karayalcin and during our brief meeting with esteemed Hikmet Cetin we also discussed the present situation in Azerbaijan, particularly the ongoing war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan, and the ways to solve this problem. It is known to the world that the Azerbaijani side, and myself personally, favor the peaceful resolution of this problem. That is, we favor ending the war, halting the fighting, and peacefully resolving this problem. We have put forward some proposals in this direction but, regrettably, achieved nothing. The Azerbaijani side has very strict conditions for the peaceful resolution of this problem, these being: The Azerbaijani Republic's territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders must be ensured; Armenian Armed Forces must leave the occupied Azerbaijani lands; and the refugees, the Azerbaijani citizens, should be returned to their homes in these occupied lands. We favor a peaceful solution to this problem under these conditions, and to this end we are trying to make use of CSCE, of the CSCE's Minsk Group. And of course, we are also trying to make use of the good offices of the major powers--most of which are members of CSCE--and of the UN and the UN Security Council. We have taken various measures in this direction. Russia, too, is actively involved in this problem. Russia is trying to act as a mediator to peacefully resolve this problem; and recently the CSCE Minsk Group and its chairman Jan Eliasson has agreed that Russia should have a special role in this endeavor. Minsk Group also (?consented) that CIS too should get involved in this matter. We are working within these parameters. I met with the foreign ministers of a number of Western countries yesterday and today. [passage omitted] I think that our contacts were very beneficial and important. Azerbaijan once again reiterated its position at these meetings, and asked these major states, the European states, to take part in this process. In turn, the foreign ministers of these counties said that they favor the resolution of this problem exclusively within the CSCE framework--through the Minsk Group--and told me that they will be more active in this direction in the future. [passage omitted] [Agbabali] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev was seen off at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport by Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin, Istanbul Governor Hayri Kozakcioglu, and other officials. Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev was welcomed at Baku's Bina Airport by the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Rasul Guliyev, Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, and other officials.
