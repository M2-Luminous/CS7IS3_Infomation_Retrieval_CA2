FR941020-0-00070 FR941020-0-00023 Executive Order 12866 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. Regulatory Flexibility Act The DOI has determined that this final rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. The rule would affect a relatively small number of surface coal mining operations. The rule does not distinguish between small and large entities. The economic effects of the proposed rule are estimated to be minor, and no incremental economic effects are anticipated as a result of the rule. National Environmental Policy Act OSM has prepared an environmental assessment (EA), and has made a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) that this rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C 4332(2)(C). The EA and FONSI are on file in the OSM Administrative Record in Room 660, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC. Agency Approval Section 516(a) requires that, with respect to rules directed toward the surface effects of underground mining, OSM must obtain written concurrence from the head of the department which administers the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, the successor to the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. OSM has obtained the written concurrence of the Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. Author The principal author of this rule is Donald E.
