Peace and blessing be upon His noble Prophet. To the misled and helpless brother officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers: O heroes of the Armed Forces--officers, NCO's, and soldiers: You have always been a symbol of national unity and a splendid example of national cohesion. You had the honor of taking the initiative to reunite the homeland. Therefore, you categorically rejected the instructions of the gangs of apostasy and secession and sided with the constitutional legitimacy, that is, with the people and the unity of the homeland. Therefore, a decree under Law No. 1 for 1994 was issued announcing a general amnesty in appreciation of these stands. Consequently, the Defense Ministry has fixed the reception areas as follows: 1. The Aden axis. The brother officers, NCO's, and soldiers in the Aden Governorate should report to the units near their places in order to be sent to the military areas where they can perform their service. 2. The Lahij axis. The brother officers, NCO's, and soldiers should report to the units near their places in order to be sent to the military areas where they can perform their service. 3. All shall enjoy all rights and duties enjoyed by others in the Yemeni Armed Forces in accordance with the above-mentioned decree. 4. We appeal to all to respond and benefit from the sympathy and tolerance expressed by the decree toward the misled and helpless ones by joining the forces of legitimacy in order to form one unified army that fights bravely and faithfully for the sake of the people and homeland. It is God who grants us guidance and success. [Signed] Staff Brigadier General 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, minister of defense
