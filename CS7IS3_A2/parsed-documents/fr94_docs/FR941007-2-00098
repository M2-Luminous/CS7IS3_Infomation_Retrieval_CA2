FR941007-2-00098 FR941007-2-00063 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,632] Weldotron Corporation, Piscataway, NJ; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration On August 23, 1994, the company requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on August 10, 1994 and published in the Federal Register on August 25, 1994 (59 FR 23866). The company submitted additional information showing that it sells to dealers not end users and that it has lost market share. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 28th day of September 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24908 Filed 10&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
