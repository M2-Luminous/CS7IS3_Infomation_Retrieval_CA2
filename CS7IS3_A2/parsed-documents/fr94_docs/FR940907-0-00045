Summary of 2nd MO&O Introduction 1. By this action, we are amending the rules concerning the licensing of ``response channels'' in the narrowband personal communications services (PCS). Response channels are channels that are set aside to provide existing paging systems with two-way capability, including acknowledgement of a page or advanced messaging capability. Specifically, we are modifying the definition of an existing paging licensee, the requirement that an existing paging licensee operate a base station in the area for which it is applying for a response channel and the rule limiting existing paging licensees to two response channels in any given geographic area. These changes are in response to a Petition for Reconsideration of the Memorandum Opinion and Order in this matter that was filed by the National Association of Business and Educational Radio, Inc. (NABER). 1 We are also modifying the attribution standards with regard to narrowband PCS channels and revising the Basic Trading Area (BTA) service area definition to provide two local service areas in Puerto Rico. We believe these changes will improve the fairness of the licensing process for narrowband PCS and provide for more effective use of the narrowband PCS spectrum. 1 See Memorandum Opinion and Order, 59 FR 14115 (March 25, 1994). The Memorandum Opinion and Order was issued in response to petitions for reconsideration and clarification of the First Report and Order, 58 FR 42681 (August 11, 1993).
