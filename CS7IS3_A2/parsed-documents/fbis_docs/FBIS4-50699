Further progress will come around the corner as the central government sticks to an anti-inflation policy as its basic tune for the rest of the year. At the same time, however, the central government will have to pay more attention to the lukewarm market demand which is believed to be putting the brakes on rapid economic growth and leaving mounting stockpiles of commodities in its wake. "At the macroscopic level, the economy is getting onto a healthy track with declining industrial growth in the second quarter," said Li Guobin with the State Information Centre (SIC), who is in charge of short-term economic forecasting. "It is encouraging that the general retail price index for the period is predicted to drop 16.7 percent, 3.4 percentage points down from the first quarter." According to the SIC, manufacturing in the second quarter is predicted to grow at 18.0 percent, a slight drop of 0.6 percentage points against the first quarter. The growth of credit in circulation is estimated at 24.6 percent, 3.4 percentage points slower than the rate of the first quarter. According to a report released by the State Planning Commission, the gross domestic product will grow at the rate of 12 percent in the first half of this year. A slight drop in economic growth is desired by the central government, which is eager to free its hands from fighting economic overheating to focus instead on deepening reforms. China badly needs a more relaxed environment to further its reforms in 1994, the year seen as the midpoint in China's era of reforms. Although inflation is still reeling with a two-digit rate, resulting in negative interest rates, people are reluctant to open their purses in the market and choose instead to keep their money in the bank. The outstanding bank savings are expected to climb 38 percent to reach 1,770 billion yuan ($203.4 billion) in the second quarter. "This may be the best way for people to protect themselves from inflation because most consumers have drawn lessons from the buying spree in 1988 and have become more cool-headed when shopping." said Zhang Yingxiang, an analyst with the State Statistics Bureau (SSB). In 1988, when China first suffered successive months of double- digit inflation rates, people rushed into panic buying, caring little about the quality of the goods. In comparison, people now invest more carefully. And their gloomy anticipation toward the bear stock market keeps them away from securities. Prudent consumption will continue to jam the growth of retail sales. According to the SIC, the retail sales volume will likely dip 6 percentage points for a growth rate of only 19.3 percent in the April-June period. "In addition to inflation, the sluggish market demand will be another outstanding problem in the second quarter." Li said. The growing stockpiles in warehouses add to the difficulties of enterprises suffering from a lack of credit. According to the SSB, by the end of April, unsold products in State enterprises grew a disastrous 13.3 percent in value compared with the same period last year. Moreover. the increasing stockpiles are shoving more enterprises into defaulting on their debts. The SSB said that state enterprises' debts jumped 29.5 percent by the end of April compared with the same period last year. Producers of raw materials are not optimistic, since manufacturers are loathe to buy raw materials, speed up production, or try to sell their products for fear buyers will default on payment. "The central bank should consider reducing interest rates to somewhat discourage rapid bank savings and encourage buying," Li said. His view is shared by a few economists, giving two reasons. The current round of inflation is not mainly caused by credit expansion but, instead, by the rise in production costs and grain prices which raged on at the end of last year. At present, the price of producer goods is declining, which can help to reduce production costs and curb the possible further price hikes. Meanwhile, residents will not rush to pull out their savings deposits if the interest rate is cut because the existing rate is already 9 percentage points lower than the inflation rate. "Therefore, a slight cut in the interest rate will not likely cause a great decrease in bank savings," Li said. But the central government is unlikely to take such action in the coming months. However, some other economists, especially those with the central bank have suggested that the State Council should raise interest rates to slow down inflation. It is a difficult decision for the policymakers. Generally speaking, anti-inflation measures reduce consumer demand, which will choke State enterprises. However, easing credit will counteract the efforts against inflation.
