For example, first-time offenders will be sentenced to 8 year imprisonment terms, and will be stripped of their land. He explained that this was done "for a very simple reason, namely the kind of product involved. Addiction to poppy heroin is 50 times stronger than addiction to cocaine paste. In addition, trafficking in opium and poppies is the most vicious trafficking in the world. It rules southeastern Asia, and now intends to colonize us. It is estimated that there are 50 hectares of poppies in Nueva Cajamarca, in San Martin. They must be destroyed. If we do not do it now we will be unable to control it later. We still have time. And those who planted poppies should be jailed and their land should be transferred to the state." President Alberto Fujimori yesterday announced that a bill will be submitted to Congress imposing penalties of up to 20 years for poppy growers, who have begun to cultivate the plant in Cajamarca, San Martin, and Madre de Dios. Unlike coca growers, whose activity is not considered criminal, poppy growing will be strictly repressed, he said.
