The main of them are the treaty of deepening economic cooperation, the treaty of military cooperation, the agreement on terms of using and leasing the Baykonur Cosmodrome as well as the memorandum on the basic principles questions on citizenship and legal status of Russian and Kazakh citizens. The sides will also have to prepare the first official visit to Kazakhstan by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. According to information received by ITAR-TASS, its specific period has not been set and will be discussed "at a diplomatic level". On Thursday, the Kazakh side handed over several draft documents on which work will be conducted, taking into account results of the present ministerial meeting. These documents include a draft agreement on a legal status of citizens which is of special concern for the Russian side. The Russian side received on Friday draft agreements on simplified procedure of obtaining citizenship, procedure of military service and cooperation on labour migration. A working group set up today will be occupied with their final wording. In the opinion of a high-ranking official of the Russian Foreign Ministry, the present exchange of opinions "will enable the two sides to remove dissatisfaction caused by the insufficiently quick implementation of the understandings between the presidents".
