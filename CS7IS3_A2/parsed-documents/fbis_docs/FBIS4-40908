As a senior foreign ministry official has recalled in an interview with INTERFAX, the "Russia-NATO" program was submitted to NATO's Headquarters just a month ago. "This substantive document mirrors our vision of relations with NATO, Russia's role and place in Europe and elsewhere. It would certainly be lovely to sign two programs at once, but the men at NATO will apparently need time to study the Russian proposals. So, we do not dramatize the situation, nor do we intend to spur events deliberately," the diplomat said. He did not rule out that in Brussels Kozyrev and NATO leaders might sign a declaration of intent to promote cooperation and partnership. "We feel the Russia-NATO program could be the platform for that," he said.
