All of them have been registered and are continuing the preelection campaign. Despite the fact that the legislative assembly of the oblast will have very limited powers, a lot of people were found who want to become deputies. Today, 106 candidates are aspiring to 25 deputy seats, and in a district of the Volosovskiy Rayon, eight aspirants are campaigning simultaneously for one seat. Preparation for the elections to the municipality are also moving ahead at full speed. The candidates are also displaying activeness here: There are 1,031 aspirants for 430 seats in the preelection campaign. The sharpest rivalry of the candidates developed in Slantsy, where 40 persons are vying for seven seats. In addition, the voters in Shlisselburg will also have to elect a new city mayor, who will replace his predecessor, who was removed several months ago for various violations. In addition to the ballots with the names of the candidates, on the day of the forthcoming elections the residents of the oblast will receive sheets for voting in the referendum on the by-laws of Leningrad Oblast. But the elections of representatives of a new type in the localities of the oblast--elders--have already started, and 671 elders have been elected to date.
