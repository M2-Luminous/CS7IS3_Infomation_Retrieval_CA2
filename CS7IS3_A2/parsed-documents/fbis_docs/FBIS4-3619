The following is the full text of his speech: In the past two years or so, President Karimov and leaders of other Central Asian nations have visited China. Now, at the invitation of the leaders of Central Asian nations, and bringing with me the friendship of the Chinese people, I have made the first stop of my trip, in the beautiful and richly endowed land of Uzbekistan, and embarked on a tour of China's good neighbors of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan. Such frequent exchanges of visits between the leaders of China and the Central Asian nations is unprecedented, and is an important signal that the relations between China and the Central Asian nations have entered a new era. The Republic of Uzbekistan is an important country in Central Asia. It has a long history, a splendid culture, rich resources, and an industrious and ingenious people. Since it became independent, Uzbekistan, under the leadership of President Karimov, has been dedicated to maintaining stability and developing the national economy at home, and expanding friendly communication with its neighbors and other countries in the world, which has yielded positive results. The Chinese people heartily rejoice in this and sincerely hope the people of Uzbekistan will make greater achievements in building their own country. China and Uzbekistan are friendly, close neighbors. The two countries shared many similarities in the past, and continue to do so today. In the past, the ancient Silk Road once closely linked our two countries; today, we both concentrate on building our own nations, both want an international environment that enjoys long- term stability, and both are willing to develop cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and establish a long-term, stable, good-neighborly, and friendly relationship. In the past two days, President Karimov and I have exchanged views extensively and in depth on the international situation, regional situation, and bilateral relations. The meetings were pleasant, friendly, and fruitful. The government officials in charge of foreign trade and economic relations, as well as entrepreneurs, of both countries seriously discussed ways to further strengthen economic cooperation, and signed a series of agreements. Both sides took a positive attitude to cooperation and were optimistic about the prospects. I believe this visit is bound to improve our mutual understanding and strengthen our cooperation. This will undoubtedly bring further development to existing Sino-Uzbekistan relations. The friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of the Central Asian nations goes back to ancient times. The Central Asian nations, as the main corridor on the Silk Road, once made important contributions to establishing commercial enterprise and cultural exchange on the Eurasian continent. Today, the ever-expanding exchange between the Central Asian nations and the rest of the world is writing a new chapter of common development and friendly exchange between Europe and Asia. China sets great store by its relations with Central Asian nations. We are willing to work with Central Asian nations, have our eyes on the future and the next century, and do our part to help build a new Silk Road. China's basic policy for developing its relations with Central Asian nations can be summarized into the following four brief points: First, maintaining good-neighborly and friendly relations and peaceful coexistence. China and the Central Asian nations are either neighboring countries sharing common borders, or are close to each other. It is the common wish of the Chinese people and the Central Asian peoples to be friendly neighbors, for this is entirely in line with our fundamental interests. Now, as the Chinese people are concentrating on building their own country, they need a peaceful international environment of long-term stability, especially a good surrounding environment. We have always cherished good will and friendly sentiment toward the Central Asian peoples, and will forever remain your good friends and neighbors. China never seeks self-interest or sphere of influence in the world, including this region. Even when China becomes more developed economically and more powerful and prosperous in the future, it will never seek hegemony or power politics. China will always maintain equal and friendly relations with its neighbors. You can fully trust that no matter what happens in the world, China will not change this policy. We mean what we say. Second, conducting mutually beneficial cooperation and promoting common prosperity. Developing economic cooperation and trade occupies an important position in our relations. We have made a good start in this regard, but there is still a lot that we should, and can, do. In developing economic cooperation with Central Asian nations, China will strictly abide by the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and attach no political conditions to it. We would like to work with all the Central Asian countries to constantly improve the environment for cooperation, expand the scope of cooperation, and upgrade the level of cooperation; and with mutual benefit, march along the path of common development. Third, respecting the choice of the Central Asian peoples and refraining from interfering in other nations' internal affairs. As the world is diversified, the national conditions of the Central Asian nations differ from one other. There has never been, and can never be, a uniform mode of development that suits the realities of all countries. We believe that the Central Asian nations, like China and other countries in the world, are entitled to independently choose the social system, values, and path of development compatible with their national conditions. It is our conviction that the Central Asian nations have all the capabilities and wisdom necessary to handle their own affairs well. Fourth, respecting independence and sovereignty and contributing to regional stability. China sincerely hopes that Central Asia will be able to maintain long-term peace and stability. We appreciate and support all the efforts made by Central Asian countries to safeguard their national independence and sovereignty, promote regional peace and stability, and enhance friendship and cooperation among nations. The development of our relations with any Central Asian nation is not directed against any third country. We are willing to see the Central Asian countries living in harmony with each other. Also, China is ready to develop friendly relations with all countries in the world, including Russia and other CIS countries. The development of Central Asian nations needs world peace and stability, while the world needs a stable and prosperous Central Asia. Dear friends! Today's world is developing toward multipolarization. The Chinese Government sees a positive significance in this trend. Safeguarding peace, strengthening cooperation, and promoting development is a common wish cherished by all peoples. But we should also be able to see that some problems left behind by the Cold War are not thoroughly resolved, while many new conflicts and contradictions have kept emerging. The world is far from being a peaceful place. The pauperization of many developing countries is aggravating. While the issue of world peace has yet to be solved, the problem of development is more outstanding. On the whole, today's world is still locked in complicated and profound changes. Therefore, the establishment of a new international political and economic order has become an urgent wish of various peoples around the world. The new international political and economic order we advocate is different in essence from the old order characterized by hegemony and power politics. We believe such a new order may contain many aspects, but the most central aspects are as follows: In handling international relations, the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence should be strictly followed. The right of the people of each nation to choose the social system and mode of development in light of their national conditions should be respected. All nations, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are entitled to participate in international affairs, which should not be determined by one or several big countries. Disputes among nations should be settled in a fair and reasonable way through peaceful negotiations, in the spirit of equal consultation, mutual understanding, and mutual accommodation. When conditions are not ripe, disputes can be shelved temporarily, in an effort to seek common ground while reserving differences. Differences over some issues should not hamper the development of normal nation-to-nation relations. Trade and economic cooperation should be conducted in line with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and exchange of equal value. Developed nations face an unshirkable responsibility for gradually reducing the gap between the North and the South. The establishment of a new political and economic order of the world is a long-term, arduous task. We are ready to work unremittingly toward that, along with all Central Asian nations and the rest of the world. Dear friends! Here, I would also like to give you a brief account of China's domestic situation. Since the end of the 1970's, under the guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics established by Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform and opening up, China has made marked achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization. From 1979 to 1993, the average annual growth rate of China's economy was over 9 percent. As the living standards of urban and rural people significantly improved, our cause has won extensive and wholehearted support from the people. China is now enjoying economic growth, political stability, nationality solidarity, and social progress. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, the whole nation, full of confidence, is marching further ahead along the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The objective of China's economic structural reform is to establish the system of a socialist market economy. This system of a socialist market economy which we are going to establish will enable the market to play the role of a foundation for the disposition of resources under state macroregulation and control, and enable economic activities to follow the requirements of the law of value and accommodate any changes in the supply-demand pattern. To gradually realize the transition from the planned economy to the market economy, we make a point of giving play to the roles of both market and planning as two different means to our end. In other words, we will bring into full play the role of market mechanism on the one hand and, in the meantime, actively change the functions of the government in managing the economy and improve and strengthen the state macroregulation and control over the economy. The chief method is to use economic policies, economic legislation, planning orientation, and necessary administrative control to guide the national economy to develop in a healthy direction. The system of a socialist market economy is also integrated with the basic system of socialism. In terms of the structure of ownership, we adhere to the principle of letting public ownership dominate and allowing the common development of diversified economic sectors; and in terms of a distribution system, we rely primarily on the system of distribution according to work, encouraging some people in some areas to get rich first and seeking to reach the goal of common prosperity through a gradual process. Practice has proved that developing socialist market economy was a correct choice, compatible with China's realities. The economic structural reform and the political structural reform in China are conducted simultaneously and in conjunction with each other. In the course of the gradual establishment of the system of a socialist market economy, we set great store by the need to strengthen the building of a socialist democracy and legal system and strengthening the building of spiritual civilization. While we attach importance to absorbing and drawing upon other countries' advanced science and technology, experience in management, and excellent cultural achievements, we also pay close attention to rejecting decadent things. An important sign of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is to attach importance to the building of spiritual civilization while attaching importance to the building of material civilization. In the course of building spiritual civilization, we pay special attention to inheriting our fine national traditions and culture. In the process of reform in China, we pay special attention to handling the relationship among reform, development, and stability. Economic construction is the focal point of all our work; reform and opening up are the motive powers of development; and maintaining social stability is an indispensable condition for developing the economy and conducting reform smoothly. We regard the establishment of the socialist market economy as a long process of development. If counted from 1979, China's reform has been going on for over 15 years. According to our present plan, we will preliminarily set up a new economic system in the 1990's and, on the basis of this and making a further effort for about 20 years, move on to forming a more mature and established system in various fields. At present, we are moving toward this goal step by step on the basis of continuously summing up our experience gained through practice. We are full of confidence in China's future. The essential aim of China developing its economy is to upgrade the whole people's living standards in terms of material and culture. China is still a developing country and its people's livelihood is still below the level of affluence. It will take decades of arduous work for China to catch up with the living standards of medium-developed countries in the world. China's construction requires not only a domestic environment of long-term stability, but also a peaceful international environment of long- term stability, in particular, a good surrounding environment. Today, mankind is moving toward a new century. For the bright future of China and the world at large, China will make every effort to manage its own affairs well; unswervingly pursue an independent foreign policy of peace; develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries, especially neighboring nations, on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence; and strive to make due contributions to peace, stability, and development in Asia and the world. Thank you.
