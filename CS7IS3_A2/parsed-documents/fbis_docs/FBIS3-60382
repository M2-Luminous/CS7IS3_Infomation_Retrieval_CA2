The project provides for the expansion of facilities and the installation of new machines, with the aim of increasing production of buses and bus parts at the Salzgitter site. Environmentally- respectful techniques will be used to enlarge the painting workshop. The project runs from 1991 to 1994 and will cost a total of 92.2 million DM (48.1 million ECUs [European Currency Unit]), of which 89.8 million DM (45.6 mECUs [million ECU]) are eligible for regional aid. The number of people permanently employed at MAN will grow from 3,914 to 4,534 by 1994 and capacity will increase to 900 units per year. The aid proposed will take the form of a three million DM (1.6 mECUs) grant, to be disbursed in 1994 and 1995, the equivalent of an aid intensity of 2.8%. In approving this state aid, the Commission concluded that the project met regional criteria for state aid to the motor industry. The Commission has also decided not to raise any objections to a proposal by Bavarian authorities to help a pulp plant in Kelheim maintain production until December 31, 1993. This plant belongs to Bayerische Zellstoff GmbH, which is facing bankruptcy. In 1992-1993, the plant switched from a sulphite-based process to an organocellular one developed by the Technocell group, to which Bayerische Zellstoff belongs. This production method does not use sulphur or chlorine and is therefore less harmful to the environment. A planned 350 million DM investment in this plant eventually cost twice this much due to technical problems. The temporary aid offered by Bavarian authorities will take the form of a credit guarantee in the amount of 17.5 million DM and a bank loan for the same sum. The Commission feels that the form and limited duration of this aid meet its general conditions for an exemption from the EC's ban on anti-competitive state aid.
