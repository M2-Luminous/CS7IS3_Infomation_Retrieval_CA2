Minister Han explained that "after North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in March last year, some U.S. officials suggested that such a measure may be possible. However, no further discussion or exchange of propositions between the ROK and U.S. Governments have taken place." This incident is known to have developed from Minister Han's slip in a discussion held on 14 January in which he said, "Although the United States feels that the denuclearization declaration should become an international treaty, the prevailing opinion in the ROK is that there should be room left to possess nuclear reprocessing facilities." Regarding this remark, Minister Han explained with embarrassment, "I answered that way thinking that it would be too beautifying to simply say `no' when asked whether there was any difference in opinion between the ROK and the United States on the nuclear issue, and I meant that such may be a possibility."
