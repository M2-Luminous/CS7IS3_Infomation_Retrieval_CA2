With the first stage of Maastricht's "Europol" due to be formally opened in The Hague on Feb 16, disagreements have broken out over the detail of the body's convention, due to be signed this October. But as the new, powerful and secretive K4 committee of national interior ministry officials meets in Brussels, Britain is preparing to enter vehement reservations. Mr Anthony Langdon, Britain's representative, will tell his colleagues Europol should remain strictly an intelligence-swapping operation, similar to Interpol. The prospect of "federal agents" from Germany or France being deployed in Britain is likely to cause uproar among Tory Eurosceptics . British sources last night said they did not want "people in uniforms" being attached to Europol, let alone sent on missions. Since its home was agreed at last October's Brussels summit, the organisation has consisted of about 40 officers of different EC nationalities, occupying rooms in the Dutch information ministry. The total will rise to about 70 by the end of the year. At present, Europol's sole task is to pool intelligence on drug traffickers. Each of the seconded police and customs officers remains primarily loyal to his own government, with full discretion over whether to give out data to colleagues from other EC countries. The question now is whether to create a more fully federal body, allowing all Europol operatives equal access to all national data. This would especially enrage the Danish government, which has strong secrecy laws, and almost certainly the British as well. But the Germans and the EC Commission want to go further, drafting the convention so that it allows for more direct action by Europol. "If you are operating in a world where the police are not stopped at the frontier, the best way to do it is to have a Europolice force," said an EC source last night.
