Quiroga said: "These depositions have been made by convicts linked to drug trafficking." Quiroga said: "It is important not to hurt the dignity of citizens, especially those citizens who have occupied our nation's highest posts." He noted: "We must not forget the status of the people who made these depositions." Quiroga recalled that the depositions were made by criminals who had been convicted by the courts of justice for being linked to drug trafficking rings. Quiroga nevertheless reported that the depositions, videos, and photographs linked to drug trafficking crimes are part of the case portfolio sent to the courts of justice yesterday. Minister Quiroga described the evidence as open to the public. He said: "It is therefore open to review by national public opinion." Quiroga noted: "It is not fair to comment on issues that may have been brought up without carrying out an assessment, a review, and a complete investigation into these depositions." In response to questions posed by journalists accredited to Government Palace, Quiroga pointed out: "There are serious contradictions between the depositions of the two drug traffickers." He noted: "The courts will make the actual assessment and conduct the appropriate investigations."
