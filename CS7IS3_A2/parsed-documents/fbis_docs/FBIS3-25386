The union leader said the 10,500 workers wanted a 12.5 percent increase which a labor relations tribunal has said must be dated back to July 1992. Many services were not available because of today's strike but senior staff were maintaining essential operations. The corporation said the strike was illegal and the workers risked losing their jobs. The corporation has appealed to the Supreme Court against the ruling by the labor relations tribunal.
