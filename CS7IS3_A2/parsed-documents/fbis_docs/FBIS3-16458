The signed document will be valid until 31 December 1999. It stipulates that Russian servicemen may perform military service in the Kyrgyz Army on a contract basis, which means that they and their families will retain all the rights and privileges granted to Russian servicemen. On completion of service, the Kyrgyz Defense Ministry will obtain housing for each Russian serviceman (except in Moscow and St. Petersburg). If the Russian serviceman remains in Kyrgyzstan, however, the apartment he has been living in will be given to him free of charge. In addition, the two countries' ministries reached agreement on the procedure for performance of military service by officers, warrant officers, servicewomen, and those on extended service. Until the end of 1994, they have the right to transfer without hindrance to the other state's Army.
