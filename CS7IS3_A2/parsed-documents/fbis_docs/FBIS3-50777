Military sources indicated there were skirmishes in the hills which surround San Cristobal de las Casas, during the sixth day of the insurrection launched by the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), but all cities seized by the rebels are now under the control of regular forces. The Mexican Army, which has maintained an almost complete silence on the operations' development, has established roadblocks. On Thursday morning journalists were forbidden from travelling along the road to Ocosingo, north of San Cristobal, where violent clashes have occurred. The media was able to ascertain that airplanes and helicopters continue to fly over the zone and have bombarded the vicinity of San Cristobal at least once on Thursday morning. New military reinforcements, particularly light tanks, arrived on Thursday in San Cristobal (80,000 inhabitants), the second largest city in Chiapas State which was seized by the EZLN for more than 24 hours. According to a communique from the municipality, the city has returned to normalcy and fuel and food supplies have been restored. Local radio stations continue to broadcast messages from people who seek news about their relatives or who on the other hand only have this means of notifying their relatives that they are all right. Some people, particularly in the Indian communities, are afraid the Army will conduct exactions [exacciones]. "The Indians are afraid the military will not be able to tell the difference between them and the guerrillas," said Father Jesus Villalobos, who harbored 10 Indians from the Tzeltal ethnic group in his convent. Carmela Hernandez, one of the refugees, explained the Army bombarded her village, San Antonio, on Tuesday, when the guerrilla forces had already withdrawn. "A bomb fell 70 meters from my house, and I fled with my six children," she said. Her husband remained in the village so no one would steal their animals. Jorge Madrazo, chairman of the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH), arrived at San Cristobal on Wednesday and said the CNDH would increase its presence and investigate all reports "regardless of origin." "Summary executions, disappearances, illegal arrests, and any other human rights violation are unacceptable," Madrazo added in a news conference.
