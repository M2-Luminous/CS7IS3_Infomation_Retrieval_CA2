The commission met at the Bulgarian Army General Staff on 13 January. The military had requested 37 billion leva for 1994 and indicated that they would be satisfied with 22 billion; however, their draft budget only envisages 12.7 billion leva. The National Assembly members learned that the Army accumulated a debt of 1 billion leva last year. It was even necessary to use a part of the emergency rations. The amount needed for the Army's everyday operational needs in 1994 has not been ensured. If the budget is not amended, the parliament will have to bear the responsibility for the consequences, the Army leadership declared. An internal subcommission led by Dimitur Yonchev will collect data on the situation in the Army and will make specific proposals on resolving the problems.
