Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin Answers ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's Questions"] [Text] [Yelagin] Vitaliy Ivanovich, what do you see as the main cause of the difficulties in Russia's relations with the Baltic countries? [Churkin] We believe that some Baltic politicians are making a serious mistake. Namely in thinking that the Baltic states' national interests can be realized through confrontation with Russia. Hence the endless appeals to the world community aimed at eliciting a sense of pity and compassion for small countries which are supposedly being hurt by their bigger neighbors. It is evidently purely domestic considerations and an attempt to obtain something for themselves that are behind this. However, the renaissance of the Baltic peoples is only possible if they build partnership relations with the Russian Federation. I hope that a sensible approach will ultimately prevail. Positive momentum can already be glimpsed in our relations with Lithuania. [Yelagin] But how are the "sore points" in Russia's relations with the Baltic states being resolved? How justified are our northern neighbors' incessant accusations directed at us? [Churkin] There are two problems. First, the troop withdrawal. Plenty has been done in this sphere. Today there are still around 13,000 Russian servicemen in Latvia and fewer than 4,000 in Estonia. In other words, the withdrawal has been 85 percent carried out. Our partners are for some reason losing sight of this. I would remind you that the redeployment of the Russian troop contingent began at these states' request without corresponding agreements being signed. We relied on their good will. Regrettably, that did not materialize. They have not had a good word to say for Russia, even though it is continuing the troop withdrawal amid a very grave economic situation. What is more, Estonia and Latvia occasionally make tougher demands. However, we are persisting with the policy of negotiations. It is important for these to culminate in the signing of appropriate agreements. The drafts have been almost 90 percent coordinated, among them a document laying down terms for retaining the Russian strategic installation at Skrunda. The second problem is the position of the Russian and Russian-speaking population. This painful issue is the subject of our careful attention. During the interstate talks Tallinn and Riga are doggedly avoiding discussing the key subject of citizenship. And this procrastination is creating conditions for the nonindigenous population to be ousted. Despite the efforts of international rights organizations and recommendations from CSCE and Council of Europe experts, the Baltic countries' legislation still enshrines rules that discriminate against ethnic Russians. In Estonia, for instance, there are six laws of this kind pertaining to citizenship, language, and schools which are in one way or another injurious to the Russian-speaking population. And Latvia's Saeima recently adopted a law on the election of local self-government bodies robbing over 35 percent of the country's foreign inhabitants of their right to vote even at municipal level. That is tantamount to barring them from political life. We therefore reserve the right to raise this topic over and over in our bilateral contacts with Riga and Tallinn and also with international bodies. Naturally, strong-arm means of resolving the problem are precluded. The rule of law is the only option. Lately Riga and Tallinn have been constantly reproaching us, saying that Russia links this issue with the troop withdrawal. We have not done that and have no intention of doing so, but we note Baltic politicians' promises that the position of the nonindigenous population will improve once the Russian troops are withdrawn, and will remind them of this at the right time. [Yelagin] Could you comment on the Estonian side's territorial claims on a number of rayons in Pskov Oblast? [Churkin] We know that Estonian representatives with semiofficial status are active in Pskov Oblast. They are insistently canvassing the local population to take up citizenship of the Estonian Republic and promising them some land or compensation for land. At the same time they do not forget to emphasize that these territories will shortly belong to Estonia. I do not think there is any need to explain the seriousness of these actions. Via diplomatic channels we have drawn Tallinn's attention to their inadmissibility. We must not be forced to take retaliatory steps and create additional irritants in Russian-Estonian relations. The question is simple: The territories belong to Russia. [Yelagin] It is no secret that people in the Baltic display a pathological reaction to Russian politicians' use of the term "nearby foreign countries," considering it illegitimate with regard to these countries. What is your opinion? [Churkin] Perhaps this term should not be used in official statements. But should anyone get aggrieved if it crops up occasionally? I think not. We are not after all equating our relations with the CIS states and the Baltic countries. There are definite differences here. The latter left the USSR earlier. They were not among the 12 states formed after the breakup of the former Union. They have no intention of becoming members of the CIS. Consequently we have a particular relationship with them. But because we lived in the same state for many years, we still have common problems. The use of this term does not imply an encroachment on any sovereignty, and that includes the Baltic. [Yelagin] Your refusal to accept Russia's assumption of responsibility for the "Soviet occupation" of the Baltic caused a fairly stormy reaction in circles there. What is your opinion of those events from the viewpoint of international law? [Churkin] They require evaluation from many angles. The Soviet troops were brought in and stayed in accordance with treaties with these states. The assent of these countries' top leaders to the troops' being brought in was also obtained in 1940, albeit at the last minute. Thus, from the viewpoint of the international law both of that time and of the present, there are no grounds for talking about the USSR's armed incursion into the territory of the Baltic states and their subsequent occupation since, in addition, authority functions were exercised by national administrators. It is appropriate to recall that the USSR Supreme Soviet's 1940 decisions admitting Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia to the Soviet Union were preceded by corresponding political appeals from their supreme representative bodies. So we cannot talk about these countries' becoming part of the USSR as a result of the latter's unilateral actions. With this and the above arguments in mind, the entry of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia into the former Soviet federation cannot be described as annexation. What is more, a concrete legal definition of any action can only be provided in the light of the law in force at the time when the said actions were committed. In this connection the claims regarding the illegality of the USSR's threatening force against the Baltic countries in 1939-1940 are, at the very least, contentious. Unlike present-day law, where the principle of nonuse of force and threat of force is fundamental, the international law in force prior to the adoption of the UN Charter contained no provision banning the threat of force. Needless to say, a formal legal approach which is correct in terms of the past does not accord in every respect with current moral and political or in some respects even legal assessments of events. Renewed Russia condemns the actions of the Stalinist regime. Russians suffered no less than the other peoples of the former USSR as a result. We cannot and did not agree with attempts to put present-day Russia in the dock by analyzing particular events in the past. There have been many dark pages in history, but it is our common history and the problems inherited from it can only be resolved together, in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect. We urge our immediate neighbors to do this.
