A spokesman for the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said today that having detained diplomatic employees with diplomatic immunity under suspicious circumstances and on the basis of unfounded and incorrect accusations, the Lebanese Government has violated the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961, particularly Articles 29 and 31 of this convention. The Lebanese Government also rejected an Iraqi proposal to set up a joint Iraqi-Lebanese committee to supervise the investigations, the spokesman noted. The spokesman stressed that those measures also contravene the brotherly relations which should prevail between Arab countries. Iraq demands the Lebanese Government to immediately release the detained diplomats and not to molest other diplomats in any way whatsoever. Iraq also urges the Lebanese Government to show respect for its obligations in accordance with the Vienna Convention and the rules of international dealing. This would be by allowing all our embassy employees in Lebanon without exception to leave the Lebanese territory, provide protection for them and their families, and maintain the embassy building and property. The Iraqi Foreign Ministry held the Lebanese Government fully responsible for its hasty decision of severing diplomatic relations with Iraq and for its erroneous behavior toward the Iraqi diplomats. The source hoped that circumstances will prevail in Lebanon so that the Lebanese brothers will be able to express their true position toward Lebanon-loving Iraq and to rectify this grave mistake committed by their government.
