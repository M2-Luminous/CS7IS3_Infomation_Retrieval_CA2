A Shell spokesman said yesterday that the two parties have agreed in principle to team up for the proposed project, which is a part of a $4 billion plan to expand Singapore's petrochemical complex. But the joint venture agreement is to be signed only after the larger expansion plans for the petrochemical complex are finalised. Details of these plans, delayed since last year, are likely to be ironed out in the next few weeks. In essence, Shell's deal with Mitsubishi will see the two chemical giants form a joint venture -- Seraya Chemical Singapore. Shell will own 70 percent, and Mitsubishi, 30 percent, of the company which will build a styrene monomer/propylene oxide plant on Pulau Seraya. The new plant will produce 310,000 tons of styrene monomer and 140,0000 tons of propylene oxide per year. These petrochemicals are used in a wide range of products including packaging materials, toys and electrical goods. Construction is scheduled to begin next month, with completion and a trial production run slated for the second quarter of 1997. Raw materials for the proposed plant will come from the main petrochemical complex on an adjacent island, Pulau Ayer Merbau. For Mitsubishi, the tie-up with Shell will help it establish overseas production bases and avoid both rising production costs and flat petrochemical demand in Japan. The group said in a statement issued in Tokyo on Monday that its decision to take a stake in Shell's project is prompted by the need to keep tight reins on its competitive edge. Also, Mitsubishi's existing styrene monomer capacity of 480,000 tons per annum, largely exported to Southeast Asian markets, could be insufficient to meet future demand growth in these markets. Under the Shell-Mitsubishi agreement, the Japanese group will be entitled to 95,000 tons of styrene monomer and 42,000 tons of propylene oxide per year. Mitsubishi said it plans to sell the bulk of these products in Southeast Asia. On Shell's part, the latest joint venture will further deepen its ties with its Japanese partner. The Anglo-Dutch group already holds a 20 percent stake in Mitsubishi Petrochemical. A Shell spokesman said Mitsubishi could help contribute capital and additional marketing channels for the new plant's products.
