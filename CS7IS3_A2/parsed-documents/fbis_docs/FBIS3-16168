One can say that the government is not in a hurry to be involved in this discussion. If we summarize all statements, I think that probably the main claims to the adopted budget will be the absence of the mechanism of its realization. Representatives of the right- and left-wings as well as heads of administrations have been talking about this. Do we really have this mechanism of fulfillment of the budget and the plan for 1994? [Soskovets] During the week after the government session, a group of Presidium members and representatives of regions that were formed to finalize this resolution worked on changes in the nature of this document in order to elaborate those mechanisms that would allow us to realize everything that was said -- the president's message and a speech by the government chairman. These proposals that were formulated in this document, as a way to realize those critical remarks, are very specific. Undoubtedly, we believe that the mechanism of fulfillment of this document and this program of reforms that are now at a new stage, is closely connected with the strengthening of the role of the state and discipline, which is necessary for the fulfillment of some certain requests by the state and economic subjects. I believe that at this stage our citizens should consider this as the next stage and the next specific step by the government in order to form a new life in Russia. [Chernyshova] Oleg Nikolayevich, as far as I understood now, the government has determined its priorities in the development of the economy. Is this true? I mean these sectors that the state will support financially. Observers say that they are afraid that this may lead to a new round of inflation. [Soskovets] As far as the military-industrial complex is concerned, of course, we will not manage without those capital investments and budget allocations that are now necessary to carry out these reforms in our military industry which, I believe, is very important. Of course, some additional money will be needed, but we will not be able to create all the conditions that are necessary for our Armed Forces without supporting the production of the military-industrial complex. As far as agriculture is concerned, we really need a deep reform there. On the one hand, it takes time and on the other, these losses that we had last year were connected with the fact that there was not enough fuel and lubricants, as well as necessary equipment during the harvesting period. [Chernyshova] As I understand, you later widened the allocation of money both to the defense industry and agriculture, right? [Soskovets] According to the principles of budget formation for 1994 regarding these two articles of the budget, we proceeded from the level of expenditure in 1993. I think that these decisions will be justified at this stage. In order to continue with conversion and re-specializing, we need to spend money. [Chernyshova] The state, represented by the government, keeps emphasizing all the time that the social sphere will be a priority in 1994. When one starts looking at the budget, article-by-article, one realizes that not much money has been allocated to the social sphere in any of them. [Soskovets] We have not yet abandoned the old principles of management in this sphere. We will use every possibility to insure the implementation of this policy of developing the social sphere. The situation was aggravated by the fact that many social infrastructures that were supported by industrial enterprises now become municipal property, which requires additional expenditure from local budgets. Arrangements will have to be made to support them from the federal budget. All these issues are undoubtedly a weak point of this message. We are working on tidying it all up. [Chernyshova] You know, it is inconceivable that the government, having made normal and reasonable decisions, allows the situation when none of them is carried out. There is no executive or financial discipline anywhere. [Soskovets] I think that this is the result of the loss at a certain stage of the capability to manage and the state's participation in the formation of these relations. If you take countries with long-established market relations, there is no division there between the interests of the state and of some kind of economic entity. There is no such thing anywhere. Unfortunately, it happened in our country. I would like to dwell on three examples of the restoration of the necessary discipline in the state. I would, of course, put the discipline with regard to the payment of wages to employees at the top of the list. A resolution describes the degree of responsibility of managers who leave their employees without wages for several months and, of course, the mechanism of forming guarantees for compulsory payment of a certain level of wages in cases when enterprises' bank accounts are affected to a greater or lesser extent by nonpayments. With regard to financial discipline, I would like to point out that one of the main issues of the day is how to organize tax collection. At present, the system has not yet been perfected by the Finance Ministry, the Tax Inspectorate, or the Tax Police. The Currency Control Committee has put forward specific proposals, envisaging visits to the regions, to individual areas we in the government have already determined, in order to disclose all the irregularities in this matter -- this might even lead to contracts being cancelled with those heads of enterprises who had, to some extent, taken advantage of the current lack of state supervision. So, order will be restored in these relations. The State Committee for the Management of State Property was instructed to draw up a system under which contracts will simply be cancelled with hardened tax dodgers, and new managers will be recruited for those enterprises. The resolution regulates relations between commercial banks and those enterprises for which they have to provide financial guidance and backing. Numerous examples of delays and mistakes in economic relations show the lack of commitment on the part of commercial banks to the productive activity of enterprises. The Russian Central Bank was asked to draw up a system under which banks like this would lose their license to conduct specified kinds of financial activity. [Chernyshova] Now probably the final question, Oleg Nikolayevich. You have mentioned the industries the government intends to provide with additional funding. Why then do you say that by the end of the year inflation will be no higher than 10 percent?. [Soskovets] Well, you know, we... [Chernyshova, interrupting] After all, you are making the hole in the budget even larger. [Soskovets] Through our actions, through our actions, we still hope to change the situation with Gross Domestic Product. This should be the starting point. The fact is that the ratio of the budget deficit to the GDP, with such a low volume of production, when dozens of enterprises, that is potential tax-payers, are currently shut down, does not allow one to say that with a significant drop in the GDP, stabilization of the budget deficit can be achieved. Our task today is to step up production at those entities that contribute to the formation of the budget. I believe that if we tackle this task correctly, we will achieve success. For nowhere in the world of developed market economies does a state allow the enterprises that bring the state close to bankruptcy to operate. This then is our task. [Chernyshova] Thank you.
