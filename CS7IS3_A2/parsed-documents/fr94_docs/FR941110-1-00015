FR941110-1-00015 FR941110-1-00005 The processing of an application for interim patent term extension under Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;179 will not require transmission of a copy of the application to the regulatory agency. However, it is contemplated that the Office will consult with the regulatory agency, as it has been doing for the past 10 years under §156, on the question of eligibility for patent term extension. If the patent is eligible for extension but for the fact that it is still under regulatory review, the Office can extend the patent term is one-year increments not to exceed five years from the expiration date. Any such extension would terminate 60 days after market approval. Before the 60-day period expires, the patentee could submit an application for patent term extension, supplying any additional information necessary to obtain any additional extension available under §156. The interim extension of patent term available under §156(d)(5) cannot exceed the extension from the original patent term that would be available after regulatory approval. Thus, for example, a patent that was subject to the two-year extension limitation of §156(g)(6)(C), could not obtain interim extension beyond two years from the original patent term expiration date. However, after an interim extension under §156(d)(5) has been granted, the amount of patent term extension available after regulatory review is controlled by either §156(d)(5) or §156(g)(6) (A) or (B). In no case would the extension go beyond five years from the original expiration date of the patent. However, for those situations falling under §156(g)(6)(C), where regulatory approval occurs within the two-year period after the original expiration date of the patent, the extension after approval is measured from the date on which the product receives permission for commercial marketing or use. §156(d)(5)(E)(ii). Review of recent applications for patent term extension has revealed that the provisions of 37 CFR 1.785(c) may be read as being inconsistent with 35 U.S.C. 156. The statute requires that an application for patent term extension be filed by the patent owner or its agent. 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(1). The statute further requires under §156(d)(1)(D) a description of the activities undertaken by the applicant (i.e., the patent owner or its agent) during the regulatory review period, and specifies in §156(d)(2)(B)(i) that the lack of due diligence by the applicant during the regulatory review period may be taken into account. Given these statutory requirements, the Office has held that in order to be eligible for patent term extension, the patent owner or its agent must have undertaken the activities that lead to regulatory approval. If a patent owner has not been involved, either directly or indirectly, in the regulatory review process, that patent owner has not lost any effective patent life since it never invested time and resources necessary to obtain approval for commercial marketing or use. Accordingly, to the extent that §1.785 could be interpreted to permit a patent owner to obtain a patent term extension where neither the patent owner nor its agent were responsible for activities leading to regulatory approval, it was misleading and contrary to both the letter and intent of §156. Discussion of Specific Rules Section 1.750, if amended as proposed, would be changed to also provide for an eligibility determination which will be made on applications for interim extension filed in compliance with §1.790. The section is further modified to limit the mailing of a notice of a final determination to applications filed in compliance with §1.740 after the regulatory approval process is complete. Section 1.760, if amended as proposed, would have the title recite that the section is directed to requests for interim extensions of patent term under 35 U.S.C. 156(e)(2), to distinguish it from interim extensions available under Pub. Law No. 103&hyph;179, proposed to be addressed in §1.780. Section 1.765(a) if amended as proposed, would change the phrase (two occurrences) ``the Office of the Secretary'' to read ``the Office or the Secretary.'' The change provides that the applicant has a duty of disclosure to both the Patent and Trademark Office and the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Secretary of Agriculture. Section 1.780, if amended as proposed, would provide that a certificate of interim extension under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) will be issued to the applicant. Section 1.780 would also provide for notification of the issuance of the certificate of interim extension under 35 U.S.C. §156(d)(5), including the identity of the product currently under regulatory review, to be published in the Federal Register. Section 1.785, if amended as proposed, would require the applicant for extension, i.e., the patent owner or its agent, to also have been the marketing applicant who obtained regulatory approval of the product for commercial marketing or use. While regulatory approval can be obtained by a party other than the patent owner, that other party must have been an agent of the patent owner when obtaining the regulatory approval in order for the patent owner to be eligible to apply for extension of the patent term. Section 1.790, if added as proposed, would provide for one or more interim extensions for periods of up to one year for patents where the applicable regulatory review period described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii), (2)(B)(ii), (3)(B)(ii), (4)(B)(ii), or (5)(B)(ii) of section 156(g) that began for the patented product may extend beyond the expiration of the patent term in effect. Paragraph (a) of proposed §1790 defines the time periods in which the initial interim extension application and each subsequent interim extension application must be filed in the Office. In no event will interim extensions be granted under proposed §1.790 for a period of extension longer than that to which the applicant would be entitled to under 35 U.S.C. 156(c). Paragraph (b) of proposed §1.790 would establish that the content requirements of the initial interim extension applications are substantially the same as the content requirements for a formal application for extension of patent term under §1.740 and a complete application under §1.741, except that the content requirements relate to a product currently undergoing regulatory review. In other words, the interim extension applications contain information available to the patent owner or its agent at the time the application is filed. Paragraph (c) of proposed §1.790 permits each interim extension application after the initial interim extension application to be limited to a request for a subsequent interim extension along with a statement that the regulatory review period has not been completed and any materials or information required under §§1.740 and 1.741 not present in the preceding interim extension application. Section §1.795, if added as proposed, would provide that any interim extension granted under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) terminates at the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the product involved receives permission for commercial marketing or use. If within that 60-day period the patent owner or its agent files additional information required under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(1) not contained in the applications for interim extension, the patent shall be further extended in accordance with the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 156. Other Considerations The proposed rule changes are in conformity with the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., E.O. 12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The proposed rule changes have been determined to be not significant for the purposes of E.O. 12866. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that the proposed rule changes will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)), because the proposed rules would affect only a very small number of patents eligible for interim patent term extension.
