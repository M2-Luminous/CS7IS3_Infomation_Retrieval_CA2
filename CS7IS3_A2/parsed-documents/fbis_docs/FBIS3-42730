When the Presidium of the Supreme Council of Ukraine resolved to hold the present representative forum, it proceeded from working out together with you uniform approaches to the main problems of further reforms in the political systems and to preparations for and the holding of the next elections, because reforming the system without holding elections is virtually impossible. The current stage of development in Ukraine necessitates the increased role of the organs of power in managing all processes in society. As is known, the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine set forth the main principle for building state power in our country by establishing that it should be exercised on the basis of its separation into legislative, executive, and judicial authority. The attempt to follow this principle under the old Constitution, which was adopted when Ukraine still belonged to the Soviet Union, turned out to be unrealizable, although substantive amendments and additions have been made to it. You know of the contradictions that have developed not only between individual branches of power but also between the center and the local organs of power, and local self-government. All of this has influenced the status of state discipline, brought about a power imbalance, and provided grounds for abuse by certain employees and other state organizations, as well as those who were employed directly in the sphere of material production. For this reason, questions of political reform, determination of the jurisdiction of central and local state organs, as well as the organs of local self-government, and the codification of mechanisms for their interaction at the constitutional level represent the path that will help in cementing the state structure and overcoming the dual power that has actually emerged within the system of executive power. A certain step forward in this area has been taken in the draft of the new Constitution of Ukraine which was published in October of last year. It was based on a parliamentary-presidential model of government; it set forth the forms of a state and territorial system, as well as the main powers of the power structures at all levels. The issue is for the organs of power to actually influence economic and social processes and determine the nature of further development of the regions. This is first of all associated with the fact that solving the problems of economic reforms, denationalization of property, social support for the population, and economic development, as well as ensuring legal order and stability in society, is being to a considerable degree shifted to the regional level. We want to build a democratic rule-of-law state. The path toward it is long, thorny, and difficult, as the past two-year period has convinced us. The deterioration of the economic and social situation generates criticism of the power structure which, I will tell you openly, is extremely hard to bear. Some accuse the leadership of conservatism. Can radical political and economic reforms get underway in Ukraine, they say, if former "Communist Party people" who brought about the crisis in the country remain in power? Can they lead us out of the crisis? Others, especially those who were in power previously, exploit in every way possible the version that someone betrayed someone else. There also are politicians who, in pursuit of their own goals, see the breakup of the Union and the abandonment of "socialist orientation" as the cause of all adversity. I would like to repeat today what I have said repeatedly. The process now taking place in our society is a process of transformation of the administrative-command system into a democratic system, of transition to the market mode of economic development. This process develops in keeping with objective laws of development of the economy and society, and it cannot develop otherwise. This is happening not only in Ukraine but also in other countries of the former USSR and Eastern Europe, and Ukraine cannot remain some kind of island. Naturally, it may have certain national peculiarities as far as the form and content of reforms are concerned; however, in many respects it should adapt to the generally recognized rules for this process. No matter what our opponents say (they are many, and this is good), the Supreme Council of the current term has prepared many laws, but has also made a great deal of mistakes in the process. More than 350 laws and 1,030 decrees have already been adopted. However, two characteristic peculiarities should be taken into account in all of this. First, we have entered the first stage of the creation of a state in which all these acts are needed. Second, their content objectively reflects the condition of our society and the economy, as well as various approaches and the diversity of the thoughts of legislators. Under our conditions it is impossible to work out the only correct and perfect laws for a long period of time. Therefore, they should of course undergo changes in line with social processes. The following question is frequently asked: What socioeconomic and political system does the new draft Constitution of Ukraine codify? It appears to me that an answer to this question may be as follows: a civic society and a rule-of-law state. As far as the main signs of such a society and state are concerned, they are indicated quite specifically in the draft Main Law, in particular: recognition of the individual, his life, rights, and freedoms as the supreme value; proclamation that the people of Ukraine are the sole source of power, economic, political, and ideological diversity embodied in a multiparty system, guarantees for various forms of ownership and economic operations, and social orientation of the economy; recognition of the primacy of the law with regard to state power, and of the civic society with regard to the state. It is frequently asserted that this also has the marks of capitalism. What can we say to this? Perhaps so, but it is not the kind of capitalism with which they scared us for decades but rather that which has already been built in Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, and a number of other European countries with developed democracies and market economies. May God grant us the building of the social order which the aforementioned states have, because they have considerably more social protection and guarantees for the people than we had under the "developed phase of socialism." I think that few will object at present to such a model of the organization of society and the state. The draft of the new Constitution sets forth, on a conceptual basis different from the one in the Constitution in effect, the system, structure, and procedure for the formation, functions, and powers of the organs of legislative, executive, and judicial power, as well as the organs of local self-government. Many proposals to accelerate the adoption of the new Constitution of Ukraine are received by the Supreme Council. These proposals come down to several variants. First, this could be done by the current Supreme Council, having traveled with dignity the path from the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine to its new Constitution, although this variant may already be unrealistic. Second, the Constitution could be adopted by the new Supreme Council. However, for the latter, the developed draft would be a new document, and time would be needed to master and adopt it. During this period there would not be a proper legal basis for forming the organs of state power. There also were the following proposals: either convene a special Constitutional Conference (assembly) which on assignment from the Supreme Council could itself adopt this draft, or submit it to an All-Ukrainian Referendum on 27 March 1994, simultaneously with the election of people's deputies. As you know, a meeting of the Commission for the Development of the New Constitution was held in this auditorium on 12 January with the participation of the chairmen of oblast councils, city councils of the city-seats of oblasts, representatives of the president in the oblasts and in the cities of Kiev and Sevastopol, heads of political parties and trade unions, and scientists. The main principles of the construction of state organs in the center and locally were discussed, as well as prospects for the adoption of the new Constitution of Ukraine. In view of the fact that a majority of those present at that meeting expressed doubts about the possibility of the Supreme Council adopting the Constitution shortly, it was agreed to prepare the draft of a separate constitutional law or statute in which the main principles for the organization of state power and self-government in Ukraine would be codified. The adoption of such a Constitutional act is necessitated by the urgent need to precisely regulate the powers of all branches of state power and eliminate duplication and lack of coordination in their operations as early as this stage of building the state. Proposals worked out on the basis of the discussion have been incorporated in the draft that has been handed out to you. It is envisioned that this draft, with today's discussion taken into account, could be submitted to the Supreme Council so as to be placed, by its decision, on the All-Ukrainian Referendum which would be held together with the election of people's deputies on 27 March. For now, we do not see a different way. If a draft of such significance to the creation of the state is approved, it will, to our mind, make it possible to: specify stable foundations for the buildup of legislative, executive, and judicial organs and organs of local self-government of our state; lay a secure foundation which is approved by the people for the new Constitution of Ukraine; codify the jurisdictions and powers of all branches of central power, to clearly delineate the performance of their functions, as well as to delineate the powers of state organs and organs of local self-government. The adoption of this constitutional act will make it possible to reinforce the government and will open new opportunities for carrying out economic transformations and overcoming the lack of coordination which now exist. Besides, nobody will have the right to change tomorrow what is accepted today. What principles does the draft of the Main Constitutional Provisions for the organization of state power and self-government in Ukraine propose to codify? First of all, the main functions of the Supreme Council as the organ of legislative power are refined, and its influence on the government is strengthened. This document also envisions divorcing the powers of the head of state and head of the executive power. Under the Constitution in effect, the president of Ukraine is the head of state and head of the executive power, whereas the draft envisions distribution of these powers. The president of Ukraine remains the head of state. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine becomes the supreme organ of executive power. As the head of state, the president of Ukraine will have the right to veto laws adopted by the Supreme Council and return them for repeat consideration, and to call all-Ukrainian referendums on lack of confidence in the Supreme Council. His powers will include the right to act on behalf of the state, represent it in international relations, be commander in chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, resolve issues of citizenship, as well as other constitutional powers. The president will also retain certain powers as to the formation of the structures of executive power. In particular, he will nominate, for the appointment by the Supreme Council, a candidate for prime minister who, in turn, will form the membership of the Cabinet of Ministers and present it to the Supreme Council. Therefore, the executive authority as represented by the Cabinet of Ministers will become completely independent in exercising its powers. At the same time, the government continues to report and be accountable to the Supreme Council and be under the control of the president of Ukraine. The draft sets forth the main principles for the construction of a judicial system in Ukraine. It is envisioned that the administration of justice will be effected in the form of the constitutional, civil, criminal, and administrative-law court proceedings. Assertions about the need to eliminate councils at the local level may be heard frequently, even from the lips of some statesmen. I would like those who harbor such intentions to understand that, under the draft Constitution and the draft Main Constitutional Provisions on the organization of state power and self-government, it is envisioned to transform councils into organs that perform the state functions delegated to them while at the same time, most importantly, remaining organs of local self-government. Those who advocate the elimination of such councils actually come out against the democratic principles on which our state is to be built and fight for a return to the administrative-command system in one form or another. Understandably, it is impossible to agree with this. The implementation of such intentions will result in nothing but harm. You would recall that the introduction of the institution of representatives of the president was considered a temporary measure to reinforce state discipline locally. At the same time, it was a mistake to also endow them with the functions of heads of local state administrations and to deprive rayon and oblast councils of their own executive organs in conjunction with this. The "executive vertical chain" did not begin to operate effectively because of this. In general, a paradox has occurred in practice whereby the local state administration tries to negate the operation of representative organs, reducing the principle of separation of powers to the absurd. This is happening while no vertical presidential structure exists in any country of the world. On the contrary, local self-government has been generally recognized and codified in acts of international law such as the World Declaration on Local Self-Government and the European Charter of Local Self-Government. We took the requirements of these documents into account in developing the draft law. Certainly, it is necessary to reform the councils on the principles of local self-government and, first of all, make them more flexible and smaller, endow them with real rights and powers, provide an opportunity to really influence the state of affairs in their territories. Councils and similar representative organs of local self-government exist in many developed countries. They operate autonomously and independently within the confines of the law and have their own executive structures. As you know, in keeping with the provisions in the draft of the new Constitution, oblast councils and oblast executive committees which would operate on the principle of separation of powers were to become the organs of state power in oblasts. This meant that relations between them would be structured similarly to those between the Supreme Council and the Cabinet of Ministers, to be sure, with certain peculiarities. Thus, the oblast council would act as the parliament of an oblast, and the executive committee--as the oblast government. Such forms of government exist in a number of states; perhaps in the future we will come to them, too. It was proposed that oblast councils be elected for four years and consist of deputies whose number would not exceed 75. The chairman of the oblast council was to be elected by the council in question from among the deputies. The composition of the executive committee would be confirmed by the oblast council on the petition of its chairman, and the executive committee itself would be headed by the chairman who would be elected by the population of the oblast and confirmed by an edict of the president. The oblast executive committee would report to the oblast council, as well as be subordinated to the Cabinet of Ministers and the president. The above provisions met with criticism from the local councils. The triple subordination of the executive committees of oblasts, as well as the confirmation by the president of their chairmen who are elected by the people, do not meet with support. We know that many chairmen of oblast councils propose to establish a rule in keeping with which either the chairman of a council will be elected by the oblast council or this position will be combined with that of the chairman of the executive organ who will be elected by the population. The idea of statization of the councils and their executive organs at the level of oblasts and the cities of Kiev and Sevastopol failed to gain support. Taking the above and other proposals into account, the Constitutional Commission proposed a somewhat different approach to resolving the issue of power at the oblast level. The draft of the Main Constitutional Provisions envisions that the oblast power structures will also be built on the principles of self-government. It is proposed that the population of an oblast elect the head of executive power who would, at the same time, head the council. It is proposed to introduce the same model at the level of cities, rayons, settlements, and villages. The heads of executive power of oblasts, cities, rayons, settlements, and villages will report to and be under the control of the respective councils; they will be subordinated to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on issues of exercising the powers delegated to them by the state. At least some of you know that there was yet another variant at an expanded meeting of the Constitutional Commission, as well as in the course of work on the draft of the Main Constitutional Provisions--to elect the chairman of the executive committee rather than the chairman of the council, and to endow him with the functions of the head of executive power. Therefore, an exchange of ideas on this issue will certainly occur today. As far as rayon councils in the cities are concerned, this issue is regulated in the draft of the new Constitution. Taking into account practice and the need to perfect the management of city facilities, it is envisioned to transfer the resolution of the issues of territorial division of the cities into rayons and the feasibility of establishing the councils of city rayons directly to city councils. This provision has been criticized by some of you, but the majority agree with it. The draft of the Constitution envisions a substantial reduction in the number of council members. It is feasible to take into account the proposals of those who recommend that the number of their members be determined depending on the number of residents in a given territory. Many representatives of the local councils do not like the word "councilmen." Let us consult and propose a different version. Of course, it is possible to do without local self-government and introduce rigid centralization of executive power from Kiev and on down to a rural council. However, such practices are only characteristic of authoritarian regimes. Naturally, they are incompatible with the notions of a civic society and a democratic state of law, which we want to build. On the contrary, it is very important to give local organs more real power. At present, somebody will certainly raise the issue about the generation of local budgets in conjunction with this. Recently I had a long conversation with a group of council chairmen from large cities during which they made specific proposals that are well grounded. What kind of an authority is it in a city if the chairman of the council must go to Kiev to wheedle out mere kopeks for the needs of education, health care, transportation, and communal services? Why take away from them the funds which they would perhaps manage with greater dispatch and feasibility locally, usually feeling more responsible for the formation and use of the local budget? A mechanism should be found whereby it will be possible to determine which proportion of the funds should finance local and regional needs, and which--statewide needs. At present, we do not take this into account, and want to make it so that the city or rayon has to go and ask for it if not in Kiev, then at the oblast seat. Local authorities should be given more rights with regard to other issues as well. In this case, they will have more responsibility and, accordingly, more business sense and more order. Now about the issue of the next elections of people's deputies of Ukraine. Preparations for the elections, as well as the elections themselves, will take place in a complicated socioeconomic situation. However, I would like to stress from the very beginning that if we want political reforms to get underway, and elections to be held, we should take urgent measures to stabilize production, stop inflationary processes, furnish consumer staples to the people, and provide genuine assistance to the low-income strata of the population. An imperfect banking and credit system is one of the main reasons for the economic crisis we are facing. Serious mistakes and blunders were allowed to occur in the process of its assertion. Of course, we are concerned first of all about the difficult financial position of the state and inflationary processes, whose rates we have unfortunately not been able to slow down so far. All of this brings about the growth of prices and a considerable decline in the standard of living of the population. At present, the state is not in a position to ensure due social protection for even the most unfortunate strata of the population because the need for funds for these purposes is greater than the existing opportunities. Meanwhile, world practice convinces us that no country has managed to stabilize its economy until those who worked in the sphere of material production genuinely undertook to do so. Appropriate conditions should be created for this to happen. No matter how much we talk about privatization and destatization as the main goal, productivity and the desired results will not occur unless appropriate conditions are created for work at associated, cooperative, collective, private, state, and other enterprises. Regardless of the great difficulties and mistakes that were allowed to occur, the process of economic reform in Ukraine is being enhanced, albeit slowly. I will give specific numbers, too. As of the beginning of October of last year, the proportion of industrial enterprises with nonstate forms of ownership in the total number of enterprises exceeded 30 percent, and the volume of products manufactured by them--25 percent. Small-scale privatization is picking up steam, if slowly. Some reforms have taken off in rural areas. We already have more than 27,000 owner-operated farms, although the appropriate conditions for their operation do not exist. Unfortunately, many reports are now being received from localities about abuses in the process of privatization and the imperfection of our laws. People are seriously concerned about the unprecedented, and in most cases illegal, accumulation of capital by certain individuals. Most of our population will not endure such reforms. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce reforms under which the people will become owners of the means of production and will have approximately the same conditions at the outset. Only under such conditions will people be in a position to display their abilities. The experience of the Czech Republic, Poland, and other countries, which should be skillfully used, testifies to this. Two days from now the Supreme Council will consider the draft of the State Plan for Economic and Social Development and the State Budget of Ukraine for 1994. As I have already said, the situation in the country is quite difficult, and we should do everything possible together in order to overcome crisis phenomena in the economic and social areas. As is known, in September of last year the Supreme Council passed a law on early elections of the future parliament and the president of Ukraine, and made a determination on fundamental issues regarding the name of the supreme organ of legislative power of our state, its structure, procedures for its formation, and the main principles for its operations. All of this definitely necessitated speeding up the preparation of a new election law, which was passed on 18 November 1993. However, the search for an optimal model of electoral system for our state began much earlier. Favorable domestic and foreign experience in the organization of elections was taken into account in the course of development of the draft law. Issues of the electoral system were discussed at applied scientific conferences, meetings, seminars, in the press, on television and radio. As you know, the Supreme Council gave preference to a majority electoral system, although some people's deputies came out in favor of a proportional system. There also were proponents of a mixed electoral system, which I supported, too. However, a majority of the deputies voted in favor of the majority electoral system. There is nothing bad about this. After all, elections are held in keeping with this system in 76 countries of the world, including Great Britain, France, the United States, Canada, and other countries with developed democracies in which multiparty systems exist. Now that the law has been adopted, it should be strictly complied with. All talk about its advantages or drawbacks at present merely harms the cause. The election campaign has begun, and our task is to ensure its successful conduct. A revision of the norm of the law which regulates procedures for holding runoff elections is the only point we might agree to. Lately, voices have been heard to the effect that the elections will not take place, that the people, having lost faith in politicians, will not turn out for the elections. This is said by people who do not wish Ukraine well, who want to go on hampering economic reforms and the processes of the assertion of our statehood. We should explain this to the population while at the same time shaping public opinion in such a way that deputies will be elected to the new parliament who are capable of advocating general state interests and taking an active part in the process of creating legislation. You know well how elections were organized previously, and how the 100 percent turnout at polling stations and the unanimous vote in favor of candidates for deputy were ensured. At present, the situation is different: Under the law, all issues concerning the organization and conduct of the elections devolve in their entirety on electoral commissions. However, this does not at all mean that councils and executive organs should remain on the sidelines of this important political event. In the course of the election campaign, it is important to explain to each voter that the future of Ukraine depends on his personal participation in the elections. The personal composition of those who will make policy is being formed, of those who will pass laws that will facilitate the development of a democratic state and an enhancement of the welfare of the people. Notwithstanding the predicament we are now facing, we should take advantage of every opportunity to lift the spirits of the people. There should be no such thing as a trifle in this matter. I would say that the election of the parliament on the day of the elections, 27 March, and if the referendum is also held on that day, its results, too, directly depend on all of us in attendance in this auditorium. In summation, I would like to stress that it is impossible to successfully accomplish the tasks facing our state in the absence of a renewal of the form and content of the activities of all structures of power and enhancement of their role and responsibility. Thank you for your attention.
