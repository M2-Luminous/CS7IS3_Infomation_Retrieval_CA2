Japan Communist Party [JCP] member Keijin Oshiro (Nago City Assembly member) demanded on 11 May: "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] acknowledged during Diet deliberations in 1981 that a U.S. Forces unit specializing in poison gas and nuclear arms is stationed at HAS. However, the U.S. Forces have so far not answered questions on the existence or withdrawal of this unit. Now is the time to thoroughly investigate this allegation." At a session of the House of Councilors Committee on Foreign Affairs on 8 September 1981, MOFA acknowledged the deployment of a maintenance unit specializing in special weapons, including nuclear arms, at HAS. This unit is called Detachment I (DET I) of the Third Marine Amphibious Force headquartered at Camp Courtney. The then MOFA Counselor Matsuda said at the Diet session: "DET I is capable of maintaining chemical and nuclear weapons. However, it does not mean that DET I possesses nuclear arms." Oshiro pointed out: "So far, the U.S. Forces have not answered questions concerning the withdrawal of DET I at all. The secret agreement issue has further deepened suspicions."
