For the first discussion in this series, see page 52 of the 3 March China DAILY REPORT.] [Text] Leading troops is a kind of learning experience involving wide and expert knowledge. Militarists of the past and present have done a lot of expositions on management of armies and troops. In generalizing the four major functions of commanders-- leading, maintaining, training, and using troops--Mao Zedong and other revolutionaries of the older generation explicitly put forward the idea of "putting leading troops in the first place." This shows that leading troops is fundamental and essential and sometimes racks the brains more than using troops. In the new situation today, it is all the more necessary and pressing to put consummate skill at leading troops into management practice of the armed forces. In a certain sense, making efforts to study the new constantly developing and changing situations the armed forces are faced with and studying with concentration how to lead troops in keeping with the new situation are points at which to make a breakthrough in strengthening and improving troop management at present. A correct understanding of the new situation the armed forces face is the prerequisite for the study and exploration of how to lead troops in the new period. We should see that further reform and opening up and the acceleration of establishment of the socialist market economy structure have provided many favorable conditions for the building of the armed forces and have also set new and even higher demands on the management of the armed forces. For example, the composition, concept of value, and the changes and improvements of the cultural quality, of officers and soldiers have set new standards for leading troops in a scientific manner; the changes in the social environment where the troops are garrisoned have an impact on the traditional mode of management of the armed forces; and with the growth of national strength and the constant updating of weapons and equipment, many new tasks have cropped up the management of the armed forces. All this needs great enthusiasm and efforts to study and explore. In the new situation, it will not do to one-sidedly exaggerate some negative factors and to attempt nothing and accomplish nothing, and we should adopt an attitude of making full use of favorable factors to educate and manage the armed forces, skillfully changing negative factors into positive factors, and skillfully summing up the laws of activities in practice in order to lead the troops better. To explore how to lead troops in the new situation, we must further emancipate our minds, be courageous in conducting reform, and grope new paths and create new ways in practice. With the prerequisite of contributing to increasing combat effectiveness, maintaining a high degree of stability, centralization, and unity, and strengthening the adhesive force of the armed forces and of contributing to maintaining the good relationship between officers and soldiers, we should be courageous and good at learning from, and making use as reference, all advanced and useful experience and methods of management in China and abroad and within and outside the armed forces in a bid to strengthen and improve management work of our armed forces. Exploring ways of leading troops in the new situation is not contradictory to inheriting and carrying forward the glorious traditions of our armed forces in managing and leading troops, and we should never set the two against each other. A whole set of fine traditions characteristics of the people's armed forces formed in over a long period of practice in managing of troops remain to be magic weapons in managing and leading troops in the new period. Recently, Chairman Jiang Zemin stressed: It is necessary to properly study new things cropped up in the relationship between officers and men in the new situation, carry forward the fine tradition of respecting officers and cherishing soldiers and unity between officers and men, and form a close and good relationship of mutual care and mutual help between officers and men. This is the essence of the traditions of leading troops of our armed forces and is the fundamental attitude which the new generation of troop leaders must adopt. Only if we, while carrying forward fine traditions, explore new ways of leading troops in accordance with the constantly developing new situation can we deal with changes through making changes, handle matters with facility, and raise the management of the armed forces to a high level. If a qualified commander, a commander in war, can adapt himself to changing conditions, and make successful offensive and defensive, he of course should be praised. Likewise, if, in times of peace, a commander can skillfully manage the armed forces under various conditions, has good ways of leading troops so that the troops can always maintain a high combat effectiveness, his contribution should not be left unrecognized. Today, before a series of new situations and new tasks, troop leaders at all level are required to go all out to explore the art of leading troops to keep abreast of the new situation, to display their talent in the vast field of troop management, and to render meritorious services in their sacred posts of leading troops!
