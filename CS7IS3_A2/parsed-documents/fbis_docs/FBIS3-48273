The meeting, which began at 2 P.M., is to be followed by a meeting of Bentsen and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at the premier's official residence at 4 P.M. Greeting Bentsen at his office in the presence of reporters, the finance minister said he recognized that the defeat of the government's political reform bills "has caused you concern" and said he would explain the matter. The rejection of the bills Friday in the House of Councillors is expected to complicate Hosokawa's efforts to introduce economic stimulus measures in time for a February 11 summit between Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton in Washington. Bentsen stopped over in Tokyo on Saturday night on his way home from a tour of Russia and Asia. His talks with Hosokawa and Fujii are expected to focus on efforts to reach an agreement in bilateral trade talks in time for the summit.
