F-15 fighter bombers, FA-18 pursuit-assault planes and P-3 anti-submarine planes from the bases in Japan and U.S. Pacific region were deployed in the U.S. airforce bases in South Korea after a long-distance flight. On the same day, C-5 extra large strategic transport planes which load several tanks and armoured vehicles continuously flew in the U.S. airforce bases in South Korea from the overseas bases and the airlifted aggressive forces and murderous equipment were posted in operational zones. Earlier, on March 26, C-5, C-141 and C-130 transport planes flew in South Korea from the U.S. overseas bases. All the facts show that the U.S. imperialists' preparations for a war of aggression are reaching an extreme phase.
