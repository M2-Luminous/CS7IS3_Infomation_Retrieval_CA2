ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule amends the section 8 Housing Assistance Payments program regulations for new construction and substantial rehabilitation to comply with section 151 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Section 151 requires that the Secretary promulgate regulations to implement section 555 of the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, which requires that section 8 new construction and substantial rehabilitation projects assisted under section 8(b)(2) as it existed before October 1, 1983, and with a contract for assistance under such section, be reserved for occupancy by low-income and very low-income families. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James J. Tahash, Director, Planning and Procedures Division, Office of Multifamily Housing Management, room 6182, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, telephone (202) 708&hyph;3944. Hearing or speech-impaired individuals may call HUD's TDD number (202) 708&hyph;4594. (These telephone numbers are not toll-free.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Section 151 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (1992 HCD Act) requires that the Secretary promulgate regulations implementing section 555 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (NAHA). Section 555 of NAHA provides that any dwelling unit in any housing constructed or substantially rehabilitated pursuant to assistance provided under section 8(b)(2) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as that section existed before October 1, 1983, and with a contract for assistance under that section, be reserved for occupancy by low-income and very low-income families. As we stated in the proposed rule published on July 1, 1993 (58 FR 35416), the Department administers six section 8 programs that involve newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated housing: (1) The section 8 New Construction Program, 24 CFR part 880; (2) the Section 8 Substantial Rehabilitation Program, 24 CFR part 881; (3) the State Housing Agencies program (insofar as it involves new construction and substantial rehabilitation), 24 CFR part 883; (4) the New Construction Set-Aside for Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Projects Program, 24 CFR part 884; (5) the Section 202 Loans for Housing for the Elderly or Handicapped Program, 24 CFR part 885; and (6) the Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of HUD-Owned Projects (insofar as it involves substantial rehabilitation), 24 CFR part 886. Before 1981, owners could rent up to 10 percent (20 percent in the Set-Aside Program for Rural Rental Housing Projects) of assisted units to ineligible families. Moreover, before 1984, and except in the section 202 loan program, the Department's regulations did not require a reduction in assisted units under the contract until rental to ineligibles exceeded 10 percent (20 percent in the Set-Aside Program for Rural Rental Housing Projects). Section 325(l) of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1981 amended section 8(b)(2) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 by adding the following provision: Each contract to make assistance payments for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated housing assisted under this section entered into after the date of enactment of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1981 shall provide that during the term of the contract the owner shall make available for occupancy by families which are eligible for assistance under this section, at the time of their initial occupancy, the number of units for which assistance is committed under the contract. As a result of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1981, the Department implemented the existing regulations governing section 8 substantial rehabilitation or new construction (except 24 CFR part 885) which require that owners make available all assisted units for eligible families for Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Contracts entered into pursuant to an Agreement to enter into a HAP Contract (AHAP) executed on or after October 1, 1981. The existing regulations, however, exempt owners who entered into an AHAP prior to October 1, 1981, from the statutory requirement that owners make all assisted units available for leasing by eligible families. The Department believes that the purpose of section 555 of NAHA was to remove the exemption for owners who entered into an AHAP prior to October 1, 1981. Accordingly, this final rule change requires that owners make available all assisted units for eligible families for all HAP Contracts, regardless of when the Owner entered into the AHAP.
