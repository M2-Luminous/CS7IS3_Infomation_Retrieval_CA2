Slezevicius' government. How do you assess your colleagues' work? In your opinion, what did they manage or fail to accomplish? It is easier for you as a person who does not hold any office in the executive sector to notice what should be corrected immediately. [Kovsovas] A year is a short period of time, but social hostility has decreased and political tensions have subsided. A community of citizens is being created, even though with difficulty and contradictions, and quite often with mistakes and scandals. I suppose that this is a large contribution of A. Slezevicius' government. Let us not forget that this government curbed inflation, introduced the litas, hit a blow to organized crime, and had the Russian Army withdrawn. I think that many people notice other smaller or greater deeds. However, I also see things that, in my opinion, are being done improperly. First of all, the government is not only the prime minister and ministers. I have heard repeated reprimands that good deeds or plans often stall and "die" in the middle level of ministries. It is the government's task to ensure that each employee values his or her job and strives after results, and that good and unselfish work is properly rewarded. [Kniuksta] You often tour regions. How do people in the province assess the activities of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP]? Do you write a diary or like to make predictions, for example, concerning the elections to local councils, after such trips? By the way, what results do you expect from these elections? [Kovsovas] LDDP activities are assessed in different ways -- from categorical negation and politicized appraisals to moderate approval. I have the impression that most people are well aware of the difficult economic situation and possibilities, they advise us to be more courageous and resolute. [passage omitted] [Kniuksta]Regarding economic stability, some people say that the LDDP should overcome the crisis in Lithuania over 1994 and 1995. At the same time, there are people who shout that the LDDP is incapable of ruling the state and demand new elections to the Seimas [parliament]. [Kovsovas] Economic stability can be assessed from different aspects, depending on the criteria we choose. I think that the rate of economic decline is falling, which means that positive changes are inevitable. There will be many reasons responsible for the nature of the latter and the time of their emergence. One of them is stability in the political situation and government activities. Talk about LDDP's incompetence in governing the country or even its damaging rule only demonstrates the reluctance or inability of political opponents to see the real situation. The LDDP and its leaders have not discussed early elections to the Seimas. I suppose that the constant propaganda of this idea is one of the methods for trying to disseminate uncertainty, indefiniteness, and doubt. This implies that one should not communicate, help, or show effort, but must condemn and hate. Such principles are not beneficial for our small country. [Kniuksta] [Passage omitted]Currently, many political parties are inclined to accuse the LDDP for not adhering to its electoral promises. For example, Social Democrat A. Sakalas remembers in one of his interviews that after learning the results of the elections, your colleague G. Kirkilas [LDDP first deputy chairman] held his head in the hands saying: "What are we going to do now?" Are not such explanations similar to the desire to cool one's tea, although it will cool off by itself over time. [Kovsovas] I will not hide the fact that the results of the Seimas elections partly exceeded our predictions. We can only advise that those who accuse us of failing to implement the program take and read it. The program does not contain many items of which we are often accused. However, it reads that we will put an end to social opposition and instigation, and seek to stabilize the economic decline. Unfortunately, politics is not a class or a school [reference to Kovsovas' former occupation as a school teacher]. The student and sometimes also the teacher must think about the possibility of correcting the committed mistake. Political mistakes often affect thousands of people. Constituents at least authorize other people to correct mistakes committed by separate politicians and political forces. [Kniuksta]As for a coalition with other parties, the same man A. Sakalas has stated that the Social Democrats cannot form a coalition with the LDDP because the latter is not a homogeneous party today. According to Mr. Sakalas, it is a compilation of people with three or four views: Nomeklatura, the prosocial democratic university group, old functionaries, and quite a large group representing big capital. What would be your reply? [Kovsovas] One could really not reprimand the Social Democrats for a lack of attention to the LDDP. We are grateful for this. I do not know a single homogeneous party in Lithuania. Each political organization, and the press has also reported on the Social Democrats, is based on different people. Reflections about the composition of other parties only show that one assumes to know more about the party in question. The use of such words as "functionaries" and "nomenklatura" reflects the desire to belittle and humiliate someone. [passage omitted]
