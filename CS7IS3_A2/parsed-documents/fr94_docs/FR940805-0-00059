FR940805-0-00059 FR940805-0-00021 Selection Criteria (§388.20) Comments: Two commenters recommended deleting §388.20(f)(1)(ii) of the evaluation selection criteria that would judge in-service training outcomes by the extent to which training results in improved individual competency through licensure, certification, or award of academic degrees or certificates. The commenters believe in-service training to be short-term and job-based; therefore, reference to improved individual competency through degree-based programs should be dropped. Discussion: The Secretary believes that, in response to the need to increase the number of qualified rehabilitation personnel, academic outcomes must be included among the measures of in-service training programs. Changes: None. Reviewers' Qualifications Comments: Three commenters observed that reviewers for in-service proposals should be well qualified, represent diverse populations, and be identified by name and program affiliation after the review is completed. They commented that all applicants should receive reviewer comments. Discussion: The Secretary agrees that reviewers must be qualified and representative of the diverse populations and agencies assisted through in-service training. The Secretary does make summary information available on characteristics of reviewers but believes the specific reviewers of proposals should remain anonymous. All applicants are provided with the reviewer comments on their applications when the review is completed. Changes: None.
