FBIS3-51729 "drlat016__a94013" FBIS-LAT-94-016-A Document Type:Daily Report 25 January 1994 ANNEX Belize Budget CPI Pressured To Remove Names From Final Report PY2201235094 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 22 Jan 94 p 6--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY2201235094 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Language: Portuguese Article Type:BFN [From the "JB Report" column by Teodomiro Braga] [Text] Maneuvers, pressures, and last-minute conspiracies wiped out half a dozen names from the Budget CPI's [Congressional Investigating Committee] list of people who will have their political rights stripped, thus making the CPI's final report look somewhat like a pizza. The name of Deputy Jose Luis Maia, the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] leader in the Chamber of Deputies and a friend of [former Sao Paulo Governor Paulo] Maluf, was removed from the list due to pressures from the party leadership, while the Senate's corporatism saved Senator Saldanha Derzi, the Sarney administration's last leader in the Chamber of Deputies. Maia and Derzi were condemned by the subcommittees that also incriminated the dwarf [referring to the so-called `seven dwarfs' inner circle of corruption] Jose Carlos Vasconcelos, who was also helped by corporatism. PDT [Democratic Labor Party] leader Luiz Salomao credited Paes Landim's removal from the list of those indicted to an alleged agreement between the PT [Workers Party] and the Sarney group. Pressure from the Bahia State PFL [Liberal Front Party] saved Deputy Jose Carlos Aleluia from the guillotine. Aleluia was reported by the amendments subcommittee as a "forwarding agent" for construction companies in Congress. Previous arrangements had already saved a group of sure candidates for having their political rights stripped, like Senator Mansueto de Lavor and the dwarf Messias Gois. The CPI's portion of the pizza would have been much larger had it not been for the resistance from rapporteur Roberto Magalhaes, who had received strong appeals to remove other names before sending the report to the printing shop.
