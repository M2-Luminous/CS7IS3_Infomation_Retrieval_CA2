FR941212-0-00040 FR941212-0-00015 A. Sufficient Capacity to Serve Multiple Service Providers 3. We affirm our requirement that telephone companies wishing to offer video dialtone service must make available a basic common carrier platform offering sufficient capacity to serve multiple video programmers. This requirement will enable multiple video programmers to obtain access on nondiscriminatory terms to LEC video delivery capabilities, thereby fostering new and diverse sources of video programming and generating competition in the provision of such programming to end users. Such competition will be generated both among users of the video dialtone platform and among such users and video programmers that use other systems, such as cable systems, to distribute their products to end users in the same geographic area. 4. We also affirm our requirement that video dialtone common carrier platforms offer sufficient capacity to serve multiple video programmers. Without this requirement, video dialtone would not be as effective in achieving our goal of fostering a diversity of information sources to the public. This goal was and remains one of the key purposes of our video dialtone policy. 5. We reject requests that LECs be permitted to allocate all or substantially all analog capacity to a single ``anchor programmer.'' These requests appear to be premised on the assumption that only analog capacity allows a viable alternative to cable service in the short term. To grant these requests would thus be inconsistent with the common carrier model for video dialtone and our requirement that LECs offer sufficient capacity to accommodate multiple video programmers. 6. Finally, we affirm our expandability requirement, subject to the modification discussed below. This requirement, we believe, compounds the benefits of video dialtone by ensuring greater diversity in the sources of video programming and fostering infrastructure development. This requirement is also a critical factor in reducing the ability of LECs to discriminate in their provision of video dialtone service. 7. While we affirm our capacity and expandability requirements, we take this opportunity to elaborate on the scope of the expandability obligation. As critical as this obligation is to our video dialtone construct, it would not be reasonable to require LECs to expand to meet all demand, regardless of technical and economic considerations. Indeed, such a requirement might well discourage LECs from constructing and operating video dialtone systems because of the risk of excessive idle investment. We therefore clarify that, under our video dialtone requirements, LECs are required to expand whenever, and to the extent that, expansion is technically feasible and economically reasonable. A LEC may not refuse to expand simply because it does not wish to permit video programmers to offer certain types of video programming on its video dialtone system. We will address claims by LECs that expansion is not technically feasible and economically reasonable on a case-by-case basis in light of all relevant circumstances. In this review process, we will look to all relevant information and data, including the capacity offered on other video dialtone systems, data relating to demand for video delivery in the LEC's region or in comparable regions, and technical data. To monitor LEC progress in expanding capacity and to ensure that LECs expand in accordance with the standards set forth herein, we require LECs to notify the Chief of the Common Carrier Bureau of any anticipated or existing capacity shortfall and of plans for addressing such shortfall. Such notice must be provided within thirty days after the LEC becomes aware of an anticipated capacity shortfall or within five days after denying capacity to a video programmer, whichever occurs first. To the extent a LEC concludes that expansion is not technically feasible or economically reasonable at that time, the LEC must explain in detail the basis for its determination and indicate when it anticipates expansion would be technically feasible and economically reasonable. B. Acquisition of Cable Facilities 8. We substantially affirm our decision in the Second Report and Order, to prohibit telephone companies from acquiring cable facilities in their telephone service areas for the provision of video dialtone. We believe that generally retaining the ban will benefit the public by promoting greater competition in the delivery of video services, increasing the diversity of video programming, and advancing the national communications infrastructure. At the same time, however, we recognize that the ban may effectively preclude the deployment of video dialtone systems in markets that cannot support an additional wired video delivery system and could in those markets impede our goal of eliminating regulatory barriers to investment. In the Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we seek information and comment that would permit us to develop criteria for identifying those markets. We also propose to amend our rules so that these criteria serve as the basis for either an automatic exception to the ban or a presumption that the ban should not apply. 9. In general, opponents of the ban assert that it is an inefficient and counterproductive means of implementing video dialtone, and one that is likely to deter widespread deployment of video dialtone. Contrary to these assertions, we believe that retaining the ban in areas where facilities-based competition is viable will spur the development of competitive wire-based video delivery systems, thereby offering significant benefits to consumers. First, the added competition will likely provide a check on both cable and video dialtone rates. LECs that charge too much for video dialtone delivery services will face the risk that video programmers will forgo video dialtone service and rely on cable systems for distribution of their product. To the extent that competition can provide a check on video dialtone rates, video programmers will be able to lower their rates to consumers. This, in turn, would constrain cable rates. Second, competition between cable operators and LECs would give both incentives to invest in infrastructure and develop new and innovative services to increase the attractiveness of their products to consumers. Third, the availability of additional distribution systems would offer increased channel capacity, thereby fostering greater diversity of programming options for consumers. Retaining the ban could also facilitate the development of competitive local telephone networks by cable operators.
