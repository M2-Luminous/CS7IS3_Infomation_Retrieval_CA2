In his words, Buthelezi says, I have strong reservations about the deployment of the NPKF where there is still alienation between the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and ANC. He's accused members of the NPKF of being former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC Military Wing] operatives who had been killing his supporters. Buthelezi says he's told South African Police General Johan van der Merwe and SADF [South African Defense Force] chief General George Meiring he cannot spare members to serve on the NPKF while there is so much violence around. Buthelezi says there is controversy surrounding the NPKF as he had heard that 10 of its members had fired rockets at a hostel in kwaMashu outside Durban.
