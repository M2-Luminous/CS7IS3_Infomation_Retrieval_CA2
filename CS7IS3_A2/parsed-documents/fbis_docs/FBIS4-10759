During a meeting at the United Nations, alternate Argentine Ambassador Raul Alberto Ricardes said a final decision on this issue will be made soon. Negotiations are being conducted at the United Nations by which member countries specify the number of units and elements they might contribute to the United Nations, at short notice, for peace-keeping operations. Ricardes said the conditions, methods, and other specific points on Argentina's participation will be negotiated between his country and the United Nations. Ricardes said the units that might be placed at the disposal of the United Nations include two infantry battalions, a logistics battalion, an engineering company, a communications company, 40 military observers, and 35 civil police. The materiel would include a missile-launching corvette, four patrol boats, a transport plane for troops and cargo, a transport ship, a field hospital, a mobile air traffic control unit, and two terminals for airfields. Argentine diplomatic sources noted that the ceiling for the Argentine participation in peace operations is 1,500 troops, in addition to the 150 troops recently offered for participation in Bosnia at the request of the United Nations to strengthen the ceasefire agreements in Sarajevo and central Bosnia. Ricardes' statement today apparently refers to these 1,500 troops. Those responsible for UN peace-keeping operations announced today that 18 of the 184 UN member countries have so far offered a total of 28,000 people for the rapid deployment system. They hope for additional commitments in the near future that might increase this total to about 70,000 people.
