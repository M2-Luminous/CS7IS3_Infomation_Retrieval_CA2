FR940513-2-00270 FR940513-2-00098 C. Application Deadline Applications may be requested beginning May 13, 1994. Applications must be submitted no later than 4:30 p.m. (E.S.T.), by the date specified in the application kit. The application deadline will be firm as to date and hour. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, the Department will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is received after the deadline. Applicants should take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems. III. Checklist of Application Submission Requirements A. Preapplication Determination of Eligibility Before preparing an application, the applicant should carefully check the eligibility requirements described in section I.C, Eligibility, of this NOFA. Applicants that are uncertain whether the city or urban county in which they are located meets the current minimum standards of physical and economic distress (used in determining which cities and urban counties were potentially eligible applicants under the Urban Development Action Grant Program) are advised to consult the following two notices published by the Department in the Federal Register : (1) ``Urban Development Action Grant: Revised Minimum Standards for Small Cities'' (52 FR 37876, October 9, 1987); and (2) ``Urban Development Action Grant: Revised Minimum Standards for Large Cities and Urban Counties'' (52 FR 38174, October 14, 1987). Any applicant that needs additional help in determining its eligibility should contact the nearest Department of Housing and Urban Development Field Office (Community Planning and Development Division). If assistance is needed, the city or county community development office serving a neighborhood organization should be able to provide an applicant with the HUD Field Office contact number. If unable to obtain a local contact, the HUD Headquarters contact for this information is Mrs. Stella Hall, telephone number (202) 708&hyph;2186; or contact the TDD number: (202) 708&hyph;0564. (These are not toll-free numbers.) B. Application Checklist Each application must contain the following, as required by the RFGA.
