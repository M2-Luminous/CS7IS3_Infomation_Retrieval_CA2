There might have been insignificant research developments in this field which have most likely started the conflict with the International Atomic Energy Agency," a Russian top official said. Speaking at a news conference at the Russian-American press centre in Moscow on Wednesday, Lev Ryabev, first deputy minister of nuclear engineering, denounced North Korea's decision to withdraw from the IAEA. He did not rule out the possibility that this step is North Korea's response to the threat of sanctions made by other members of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Ryabev believes that the nuclear problem in North Korea could be solved by peaceful, diplomatic means. Speaking about the possibility of shutting down Russian nuclear power plants which use Chernobyl-type reactors, Ryabev noted that some of them will be modernised, others reequipped in order to increase their safety.
