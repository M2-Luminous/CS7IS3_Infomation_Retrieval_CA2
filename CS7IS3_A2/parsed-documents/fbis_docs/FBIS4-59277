Dr. Sidqi, who led the Egyptian side to the meetings of the Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee, has linked the reactivation of Egyptian-Jordanian economic cooperation with Jordan's response to the strategic U.S. policies, "which Egypt is concerned about implementing in the field of comprehensive development in the region," as Sidqi put it, and which Egypt cannot disregard. He said that his visit to Amman reflects Egypt's concern about reactivating Jordan's role in the economic plan set for the region, which will begin in the occupied territories, in which Jordan is a key player, and which will eventually lead to the creation of a Middle East economic entity, and later a political entity.
