Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Defense Agency presume that "the odds are against the outbreak of a war on the Korean peninsula," they have been conducting secret discussions on possible actions that might be taken in case of an emergency on the peninsula, as well as on legal issues relevant to the subject. However, such a stance might provoke North Korea or strike panic into the South Koreans. Before undertaking any discussion, the Defense Agency is in fact obliged to presuppose that it would be nearly impossible for the Self-Defense Forces to go into action under the existing laws and under the current political situation. This is why the Defense Agency officially refuses to admit that such discussions are under way. "No comment. Please understand why we cannot make ourselves clear whether or not we are conducting such discussions," the agency says. A high-ranking official of the Defense Agency said ironically: "Our action will depend on the government's decision. For the moment, we are just told to pursue discussions. However, as we did not receive any concrete instructions--for instance we do not know what kind of situation we have to presuppose--we are not making much progress in our discussions. It is as if we have been told to design a house without receiving such necessary information as the floor area or construction cost." If we put together the current objective circumstances surrounding the Korean peninsula, and the different remarks made by officials belonging to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or to the Defense Agency, we can obtain a picture of what would happen to Japan if war were to break out on the Korean peninsula. First, the Japan-U.S. arrangement concerning prior consultation would be called into question. This arrangement is mentioned in the notes attached to the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States. Under this arrangement, the United States should hold prior consultations with the Japanese Government if it wants to undertake military operations directly from Japan, that is to say, if it wants to use its Japan-based fighter and attack aircraft to wage war on North Korean forces intruding into the South. The decision on whether Japan would give its assent to the United States lies with the government. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Defense Agency already presume that Japan would give a green light to the United States. If a war broke out on the Korean peninsula, and if Japan remained reluctant to provide active support, Koreans and Americans with strong anti-Japanese sentiment might say: "The war was protracted because of Japan, and it cost our countries a greater sacrifice in human life." Many Japanese officials do not want Japan to become the target of such criticism. Some 160 U.S. fighter and attack aircraft are now stationed in Japan. About 50 F-15 fighters attached to the 18th Air Wing are based at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa Prefecture. At Misawa Air Base in Aomori Prefecture, there are some 50 F-16 fighters attached to the 432th Air Wing. At Iwakuni Marine Corps Air Station in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Marine Air Group 12 has some 40 F/A-18 fighter bombers and 20 AV-8B Harrier II's (vertical takeoff and landing attack aircraft). If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, these aircraft will sally forth into the Korean skies, with the support of refueling and electronic countermeasures aircraft based at Kadena Air Base or at Futenma Marine Corps Air Station in Okinawa Prefecture. Approximately three days after the sally, the Yokosuka-based USS Independence (a 79,200-ton aircraft carrier with 84 carrier-based aircraft) will arrive in the Sea of Japan or in the Yellow Sea with its escort, Destroyer Squadron 15 (comprising two cruisers, three destroyers, and four frigates). The USS Independence will remain inside Japan's air defense identification zone, for example near the Okinoshima Islands, and its carrier-based aircraft will sortie from there under the cover of E-2C airborne early warning aircraft and F-15J fighters belonging to the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force. Some 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles may also be launched as well. Four landing vessels, including the Sasebo-based 39,400-ton amphibious assault ship "Belleau Wood," will head to Okinawa to pick up some 2,500 U.S. Marines attached to the Third Marine Division. The United States will try to inhibit the North Korean forces from making their next move by showing that it is preparing for an amphibious assault in cooperation with some 25,000 South Korean Marines. As reinforcements, other fighter squadrons will immediately join the operations directly from the United States, thanks to the support of air tankers. Will Itazuke Again Become a U.S. Air Base? If we include the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard, the United States now has a total of 46 air wings. The United States Air Force is capable of immediately mobilizing eight air wings, namely some 400 military aircraft, should an emergency arise on the Korean peninsula. The only problem would be where to deploy these aircraft. One air wing per base is the general rule. If we follow the rule, only Kwangju Air Base would be available in South Korea. Therefore, the United States might use Pusan or Cheju Airports, or it might try to quickly restore abandoned airfields in the south of the country. Moreover, there is a great possibility that the United States would ask Japan for permission to use several airfields in northern Kyushu and in the Chugoku District. In addition to Tsuiki Air Base (Fukuoka Prefecture in Kyushu), Ashiya Air Base (Fukuoka Prefecture), and Miho Air Base (Tottori Prefecture in the Chugoku District), the United States might even ask for the use of the former Itazuke Air Base, which has become the current Fukuoka Airport. During the Korean war, Itazuke was the most important base for the United States Air Force. Fukuoka Airport is currently under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport and the Self-Defense Forces. It would be difficult for Japan to refuse the U.S. request because of the Japan-U.S. agreement concerning the use of facilities and areas in Japan by the U.S. Armed Forces. If the United States were granted the use of Fukuoka Airport, it would become a major problem since civil aircraft would no longer be able to use this important airport located only a short distance from the heart of Fukuoka. Moreover, Fukuoka residents would raise a hue and cry if they saw bomb-laden fighters taking off one after another, or if they saw damaged fighters flying low over the city to make emergency landings. According to the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, under the current arrangements it would be necessary to obtain concurrence from the concerned municipalities and landowners should the U.S. Armed Forces want to use a Japanese air base for military combat operations because it would correspond to a major change in the use of the facilities. "The United States might ask the Self-Defense Forces to take it upon themselves to guard major bases against a surprise attack by North Korean special forces. It might also ask us to cooperate in the transport of fuel and ammunition," a general officer of the Ground Self-Defense Force said. If North Korean special forces attacked Japanese facilities, the Self-Defense Forces would be called out for national defense. In such a case, the Japanese Government would be able to assign the Self-Defense Forces to guard facilities which present major targets for the enemy--such as U.S. military bases, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, and nuclear power plants--because Japan would be in a state of war. However, the existing Self-Defense Forces Law does not allow the Self-Defense Forces to take the field prior to the fact. In time of peace, guard duties have to be fulfilled by the police. Since special forces are professional killers and infiltrators, it would be very difficult for the Japanese police to fight them with nightsticks and guns. North Korea has developed a ballistic missile called the "Nodong I." With an estimated range of 1,000 km, the missile is capable of hitting most parts of Japan. However, the missile is not deployed yet since it is still in an experimental stage. At the end of May 1993, North Korea test-fired the Nodong I at a range of 500 km. So far, only one missile has been test-fired. If North Korean nuclear reactors are working properly, there is a possibility North Korea has already produced a certain amount of high-grade plutonium from which several nuclear bombs can be produced. However, whether North Korea's attempt to scale down the size of nuclear weapons was successful is open to doubt. Can North Korea really make a nuclear warhead or nuclear bomb? In 1974, when India conducted its first nuclear test, it was reported that its nuclear device was as large as a house. Even if North Korea has successfully manufactured a nuclear device, it has probably not yet developed a mobile nuclear weapon. Such is the dominant view among U.S., Japanese, and South Korean military experts. Chemical Weapons Are Much More Dreadful Than Nuclear Devices When he appeared on NBC on 3 April, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry said: "North Korea might have manufactured one or two nuclear weapons." This remark has attracted public attention. Even if the North Korean nuclear device is large, it might become a practical weapon if it could be carried by ship or a plane. However, in order to make a warhead, it is necessary to develop a nuclear device whose weight does not exceed one ton and whose diameter does not exceed one meter. Meanwhile, there is no reason to doubt information released by the United States and South Korea that North Korea is manufacturing several kinds of chemical weapons. The production of chemical weapons requires simple technology which was developed during World War I. Every country can easily produce chemical weapons if it has a chemical industry. Such powerful chemical weapons as yperite [mustard gas] have already been put to practical use during World War I. There is a story which illustrates the strength of the gas. An officer brought his binoculars back to his room without knowing the strap was stained with a few drops of mustard gas. During the night, the negligible amount of mustard gas escaped as vapor, blinding the officer. Nerve gas, which was developed by the Germans before World War II, is the same as agricultural chemicals and insecticides. However, if the skin is touched by a fine grain of nerve gas weighing no more than 0.002 grams, then breathing ceases as the nervous system is immediately paralyzed. According to U.S. estimates, 250 tons of chemical weapons are now stored in North Korea. This amount corresponds to tens of thousands of shells. Chemical weapons have little effect on soldiers wearing a watertight chemical warfare combat suit and gas mask. However, if chemical weapons are fired into cities in the form of rocket bombs or missiles, people will panic as they will be at a loss as to what to do. If 20 million people living in Seoul and its environs tried to escape from the city, South Korea would collapse into utter confusion, such that both the U.S. and South Korean forces would be unable to launch an effective counterattack. It Would Be Extremely Difficult To Rescue Japanese Residents in South Korea Many representatives of Japanese firms reside in South Korea with their families. Some 6,400 Japanese now live there. Moreover, on average 4,500 Japanese go to South Korea every day. If we assume these travelers spend four or five days in South Korea on average, we should consider that there are an extra 20,000 Japanese in South Korea. Many examples show that a war often starts with a sudden attack. In case of war, Kimpo International Airport in the suburbs of Seoul as well as the port of Inchon would probably be of no use since both facilities would come within range of North Korean heavy artillery and antiship missiles. The Seoul-Pusan superhighway would be used exclusively for military transport. Moreover, this freeway is designated to become an emergency runway. Meanwhile, traffic on public roads would be heavily jammed. In the midst of great confusion, Japanese citizens would probably have difficulty buying train tickets to Pusan if they could not speak fluent Korean. Since the port city of Pusan is about 450 km south of Seoul, there would be no possibility of reaching there on foot. Despite these dangers, there seems no promise that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would immediately urge Japanese to restrain themselves from traveling to South Korea should the UN Security Council decide to impose economic sanctions against North Korea. This is because Japanese travelers spend 100-odd billion yen a year in South Korea. Thus, if Japanese tourists and businessmen stopped traveling to South Korea, it would be similar to imposing severe economic sanctions on that country. "If the Maritime Self-Defense Force is allowed to use its vessels on rescue missions following amendment of the Self-Defense Forces Law, it would send its ships to Pusan to rescue those Japanese remaining in southern Korea," a flag officer of the Maritime Self-Defense Force said. Meanwhile, it will become a major problem if the United States asks the Maritime Self-Defense Force to sweep mines before the United States Marine Corps launches an amphibious assault. Neither the United States nor the South Korean Navies have enough minesweepers. Moreover, they are both less experienced in this field than the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. However, the situation would not be the same as when Japanese minesweepers cleared the Persian Gulf. The area where mines are placed to defend against the enemy's landing operations is generally covered by friendly artillery deployed along the shoreline. If minesweepers enter the area, artillery generally fires on them. Thereupon, escorting destroyers usually fight back by bombarding the shoreline from sea. If Japan wanted to dispatch its minesweepers on such a dangerous mission, it might have to use its own escort vessels for cover since it would be too impudent to ask U.S. or South Korean warships to escort Japanese minesweepers. This means that if Japan accepts the U.S. request for minesweeping, it might be drawn into direct involvement in a war outside its territory. If that is the case, Japan would be forced to ignore the Constitution and the Self-Defense Forces Law. The sea battle would probably cost Japan a sacrifice in human life and property. Despite such dangers, it seems the Maritime Self-Defense Force is somewhat eager to meet the U.S. request. According to the Maritime Self-Defense Force: "The decision lies with the government, but if the United States and South Korea complain that their troops were unable to land on enemy shores because of the nonparticipation of Japanese minesweepers, we would be mortified. Japan-U.S. relations, based on mutual confidence, would be affected." The Maritime Self-Defense Force has always examined the possibility of dispatching its ships to sweep mines along the coast of South Korea in case of an emergency. Meanwhile, Japanese minesweepers have had experience in landing operations. When the Korean war broke out in 1950, Japanese minesweepers belonging to the Maritime Safety Agency were called out under the pretext they would be assigned to clear the Straits of Tsushima, which is Japanese territory. However, they were immediately ordered by the United States Occupation Forces to head to East Korean Bay to support the U.S. landing operation in Wonsan, North Korea. A minesweeper sank as a result of an explosion in battle, killing one crew member.
