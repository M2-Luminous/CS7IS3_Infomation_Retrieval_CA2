(IHI) completed the F100-220E, an improved version of the F100-100 jet engine for the Air Self-Defense Force's (ASDF) intercept fighter F-15, and delivered the first engine to the Defense Agency on 29 October. The new engine is equipped with a digital electronics control device (DEEC), which digitally controls all functions of the engine. The new engine's main feature is that its reliability and controllability have been substantially improved over the F100 engine, which was developed in 1975. The DEEC directly controls the engine pressure ratio (EPR), using a computer to maintain the air-fuel ratio at the optimum level under all flight conditions. As a result, full engine performance is guaranteed at every instance to enable the pilot to control the throttle with complete freedom. Moreover, the DEEC contributes to the improvement of serviceability and durability, as well as life-cycle cost. IHI will deliver a total of nine engines this fiscal year to the Defense Agency, including the first one it just delivered, and 17 additional engines during the next fiscal year.
