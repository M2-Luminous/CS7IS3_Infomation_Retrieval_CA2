FR940627-2-00129 FR940627-2-00053 [Docket No. 50&hyph;029] Yankee Atomic Electric Company (Yankee Nuclear Power Station); Exemption I The Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC or the licensee), is the holder of Facility Operating License (Possession Only) No. DPR&hyph;3 which authorizes possession and maintenance of the Yankee Nuclear Power Station (YNPS or plant). The license provides, among other things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect. The facility is a permanently shutdown pressurized water reactor, currently in the process of being prepared for decommissioning, and is located at the licensee site in Franklin County, Massachusetts. II The licensee, by letter dated February 27,1992, supplemented by letter dated January 19,1 993, informed the NRC and YAEC had permanently ceased power operations, removed the fuel from the reactor to the fuel pool, and had begun to develop detailed plans to decommission the facility. The reactor was actually shut down on October 1, 1991; thus, the fuel has now undergone over two years and seven months of decay. The NRC in a license amendment dated August 5, 1992, modified License No. DPR&hyph;3 to possession only status. The license is conditioned so that YAEC is not authorized to operate the reactor and fuel may not be placed in the reactor vessel, thus formalizing the YAEC commitment to permanently cease power operations. By letter dated September 28, 1992, the licensee requested an amendment to the Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC) Indemnity Agreement No. B&hyph;17 which would reduce the primary level of financial protection maintained at the plant to $4.5 million from the current level of $200 million and provide relief from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan (secondary level). This letter was supplemented by the licensee letter to the Commission dated January 19, 1993. III The justification presented by the licensee for amendment of its indemnity agreement is that because of the permanently shutdown status of the plant, defueled condition of the reactor, and possession only license amendment (which prohibits operation), 10 CFR 140.11 no longer applies to YAEC. Given these considerations, the licensee contends that 10 CFR 140.12, which describes financial protection for reactors not covered by 10 CFR 140.11, applies to YAEC. The licensee also addressed past NRC actions with respect to relief granted to the consolidated Edison facility, Indian Point Unit 1. Consequently, the licensee has requested that its indemnity agreement be amended such that the licensee would no longer be required to participate in the secondary protection program, and that its primary financial protection be reduced to the minimum required under 10 CFR 140.12, which is $4.5 million. The staff has determined on its own initiative that an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 140.11 is required in order to implement an amendment to the licensee indemnity agreement. The bases for providing this exemption to 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) are provided herein. The NRC staff independently evaluated the legal and technical issues associated with the application of the Price-Anderson Act to permanently shut down reactors in SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, ``Financial Protection Required of Licensees of Large Nuclear Power Plants During Decommissioning,'' dated May 10, 1993. In this evaluation, the staff concluded that the Commission has discretionary authority to respond to licensee requests for a reduction in the level of primary financial protection and withdrawal from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan. Depending on the plant-specific configuration and the time since permanent shutdown, the staff also concluded that potential hazards may exist at permanently shutdown reactors for which financial protection is warranted. The staff concluded that accidents and hazards insured against under the Price-Anderson Act go beyond design basis accidents and beyond those considered ``credible'' as that term is used in 10 CFR Part 100 and cases interpreting the application of that regulation. The Commission issued a SRM in response to SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127 on July 13, 1993. In this SRM, the Commission approved a staff recommendation to permit a reduction of primary level coverage to $100 million through the exemption process after an appropriate spent fuel cooling period and after allowing withdrawal from participation in the secondary level of financial protection.
