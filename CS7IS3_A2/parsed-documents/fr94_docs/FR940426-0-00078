FR940426-0-00078 FR940426-0-00017 Finally, NHTSA decided to set the deadline for submission of information about new lines at the 15 month point instead of at the 12 month point because 15 months is necessary not only to allow NHTSA time to issue a final determination, but also to allow manufacturers enough time to submit timely petitions for exemption from marking the parts of a new line. Section 605(b) of the Theft Act specifies that petitions for exemption must be filed ``not later than 8 months before the commencement of production for the first model year covered by the petition.'' The National Truck Equipment Association (NTEA) expressed concern that NHTSA may consider some of its members (which are primarily small final stage manufacturers of incomplete vehicles, or alterers of vehicles) to be ``manufacturers'' for part 542 purposes, and thus subject to the reporting requirements. These final stage manufacturers and alterers appear to work on individual vehicles, adapting each vehicle for a special purpose or to otherwise include features that make each vehicle unique to the customer's needs. NTEA noted, however, that because ACTA's definition of light-duty trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles is limited to vehicles weighing 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating or less, NTEA expects ``very few vehicles'' completed or altered by its members to be subject to part 542. For the following reasons, NHTSA does not believe that final stage manufacturers or alterers, are ``manufacturers'' for part 542 purposes. Part 542 applies to a manufacturer that groups motor vehicle models of the same make together and assigns names to the groups, i.e., lines, or introduces new motor vehicle lines into commerce. Neither final stage manufacturers nor alterers do these things. The grouping of motor vehicle models of the same make together and assigning names to the groups, i.e., lines, is done at an earlier stage of manufacture in the case of both incomplete motor vehicles that are completed by final stage manufacturers and of completed vehicles that are modified by alterers. These circumstances are reflected in the agency's requirements concerning vehicle identification numbers. A vehicle identification number (VIN) is a seventeen character series of arabic numbers and roman letters which is assigned to a motor vehicle for identification purposes. Manufacturers must comply with Standard No. 115; Vehicle identification number-basic requirements. S4.1 of Standard No. 115 states: Each vehicle manufactured in one stage shall have a VIN that is assigned by the manufacturer. Each vehicle manufactured in more than one stage shall have a VIN assigned by the incomplete vehicle manufacturer. Vehicle alterers *␣*␣* shall utilize the VIN assigned by the original manufacturer of the vehicle. 49 CFR part 565 Vehicle identification number-content requirements, specifies the format and content for VINs. Among other VIN attributes, the first three characters uniquely identify the manufacturer, make and type of motor vehicle. (See §565.4(a)) Included as VIN attributes for passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and incomplete vehicles, are the line and series of the vehicle. (See §565.4(b), and table I) A manufacturer must, when it assigns a VIN to a motor vehicle, determine the model or ``line,'' and series of the vehicle. For these reasons, when it creates a VIN, a manufacturer is in effect, determining the ``line'' of vehicles that it introduces into commerce. The manufacturing functions of the NTEA members are performed after the VINs are assigned. As noted above, they either do final stage manufacturing of incomplete vehicles or alter completed vehicles. Standard No. 115 prohibits final stage manufacturers or alterers from making changes to the original VIN assigned to the vehicle. The final stage manufacturers or alterers cannot change any VIN attribute, including the VIN attribute that describes the ``line'' of the vehicle. Since the final stage manufacturers or alterers, in effect, cannot assign the ``name'' to a ``group'' of vehicles, i.e., the ``line'', the final stage manufacturers or alterers are not ``manufacturers'' for purposes of part 542. Finally, since there were no objections to NHTSA's proposal to remove outdated references to vehicle lines introduced before April 24, 1986, the final rule adopts those amendments.
