A Chilean military delegation arrived today in Prague to negotiate arms deals with the Omnipol company, but the arrival of Chilean Ground Forces Chief Commander Augusto Pinochet has not been confirmed although it had been notified. "However, if he got it and is here, I will not draw any conclusion as interior minister," Ruml added. The Interior Ministry will not provide protection to Pinochet because his visit is private and the Foreign Ministry has not asked for it, Ruml said.
