FBIS4-58076 "drnes084_j_94032" FBIS-NES-94-084 Daily Report 1 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Presidential Council Statement Criticized Presidential Council Statement Criticized NC0105185994 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1810 GMT 1 May 94 NC0105185994 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Aden, 1 May (MENA) -- A spokesman for the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] Political Bureau has commented on the Presidential Council statement that was released in Sanaa yesterday evening. He said that the Presidential Council has revealed its convictions and clarified the truth about its rejection of a plan to merge the armed forces that the defense minister put forward four times in the past few years. Merging the armies would have exposed the corruption and smuggling by the officers of the al-Ahmar clan, who rob the soldiers' salaries and food, torture and humiliate them, and seize funds earmarked for military supplies. The spokesman noted that merging the armed forces would have meant providing them with qualified personnel who would make them loyal not to their tribes and clans but to the homeland and its constitutional institutions so the armed forces would become the protectors of the homeland. He pointed out that the refusal to merge the armed forces exposes a plan to isolate and strike at them, as has happened in Abyan, (Harf), Safyan, and 'Imran. The spokesman criticized the Yemeni Presidential Council statement, which talks of democracy and legitimacy while it constantly tramples them. It assailed the Yemeni president and his method of reaching power and ruling the country.
