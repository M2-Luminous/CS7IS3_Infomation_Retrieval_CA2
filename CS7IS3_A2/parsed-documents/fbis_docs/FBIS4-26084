Sung in Beijing] [Text] A senior government official has said that he saw no evidence of a thaw in Sino-British relations when he met senior officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs in Beijing this week, despite recent declarations by China that its political row with Britain would not thwart cooperation. Secretary for Trade and Industry Brian Chau was in Beijing on official business, when Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Lu Ping, declared that two of the biggest obstacles to Sino-British cooperation could quickly be resolved. During his trip, Mr Chau met the affair's office Deputy Director Chen Ziying and department head Wang Fengchao. Mr Chau said while his contact with both officials was brief and friendly, their position had not changed since the political row first began. "Their attitude towards me was the same when I last saw them two years ago," he said. In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry continued to speak of conciliation, but stressed that continuing cooperation depended on Britain's attitude. "The Chinese side hopes that difficulties over the question of Hong Kong will not affect ties between the two countries in other areas," Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said. "The Chinese side is willing to have further cooperation with the British side. But whether it can be done depends on what approach and action the British side takes." The chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions Cheng Yiu-tong, who led a delegation to Beijing this week, said he was convinced that China was determined to shelve the long-running political row and resume cooperation with Britain. "Mr Qian emphasised that the deadlock over 1994-95 electoral reform was over," Mr Cheng said. "He said that China would strengthen economic cooperation with Britain to ensure a smooth transition in the remaining years."
