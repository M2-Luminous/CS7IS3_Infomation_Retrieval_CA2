Bank vice-chairman Huang Diyan yesterday said difficulties included managing the bad debts arising from policy-driven lending, and maintaining a stable yuan. In a speech on China's financial system, Mr Huang, who is also the chief executive of the bank's Hong Kong-Macao Office, said inherent problems were a result of the wide exposure of the reform measures. "Their success will mainly depend on transformation of the mechanism of state-owned enterprises, and a healthy fiscal system," he said. Mr Huang said the latest financial reforms were the most thorough in China over the past 15 years. China, since January 1, has launched a series of financial reforms on exchange rates and taxation, following the economic austerity programme introduced last July in a bid to rein in the country's heated economy. He said the current financial system had problems which had not been touched by previous reforms. They included a confusion of responsibilities among financial institutions that limited their ability to tune the economy, and an incomplete financial regulatory framework, which had led to a proliferation of lending. He also pointed to the limitations of interest rates as a tool of regulating the demand for funds. The latest reforms, gave the People's Bank of China greater authority over note issue, monetary management, credit adjustment, foreign exchange policy and interest rates, strengthening its role as a central bank. The reforms also took away the responsibility for policy-driven decisions from the four specialist banks, which include the Bank of China, freeing them to act as commercial banks.
