FR940112-2-00025 FR940112-2-00019 [Docket Nos. RP93&hyph;161&hyph;004, RP94&hyph;1&hyph;004 and RP94&hyph;108&hyph;000] Columbia Gas Transmission Corp.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff January 6, 1994. Take notice that on January 3, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia), entered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Sheet No. 31 and Original Sheet No. 31A, to be made effective January 1, 1994. Columbia states that this filing is being made in order to allow those customers that do not contest the settlement submitted on January 3, 1994, by Columbia and Supporting Intervenors in these proceedings to receive the immediate benefits of a reduction in Columbia's Weighted Cost of Gas (WACOG) surcharge filing in Docket No. RP94&hyph;1 from 7.22 ¢ per Dth to 3.8 ¢ per Dth, effective January 1, 1994, as provided for under the settlement. This surcharge applies to all City Gate deliveries under firm Rate Schedules FTS, SST and FTS for Columbia's current and former wholesale customers, including replacement shippers for capacity released by such customers. Parties will be eligible for such reduced WACOG surcharge if they do not advise Columbia or the Commission prior to January 24, 1994 that they contest the settlement or seek modifications or conditions to the settlement which are unacceptable to Columbia and the Supporting Intervenors. Contesting parties will continue to pay the currently effective 7.22 ¢ per Dth WACOG surcharge, subject to refund. Columbia states that the parties are on notice that Columbia has the right to reimplement the 7.22 ¢ per Dth surcharge, effective January 1, 1994, in the event that the Commission rejects the settlement or provides modifications or conditions to the settlement which are unacceptable to Columbia or the Supporting Intervenors. Any person desiring to be heard or protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with §§385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before January 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
