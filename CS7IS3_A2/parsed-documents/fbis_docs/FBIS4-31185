According to the communique, the SRI press bureau has been authorized to publish the following: The examination of the operational situation and the information available in the reference domain does not confirm the existence of any intention or real possibility of assassinating the Romanian president or restoring the monarchy in the near future. The circulation of such news without the sufficient previous checking of its likelihood needlessly creates confusion and unrest or, on the contrary, it makes public opinion doubt the seriousness of such assertions. The SRI communique concludes by saying that, quote, however, if Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor is in possession of realistic information with respect to the aforementioned issue, we invite him to publish it, unquote.
