According to a 1993 Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) report, Mexico is willing to sell its entire stock of crude exports to the United States as long as U.S. market prices for Mexican oil are best for the country. In 1993, Mexico sent almost two-thirds of all the oil it sold abroad to the U.S. market. The nation's overall income from oil and petroleum products in 1993 was $5.992 billion. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 21 Mar 94 p 15) Mexico's oil reserves decreased between 3.5 and 4 percent in 1993. Nevertheless, the decline was not as sharp as in previous years. Pemex Director Francisco Rojas announced at ceremonies marking the 56th anniversary of the Mexican oil industry's nationalization that Mexico currently has oil reserves of 64.769 billion barrels. Energy industry sources say the decrease in the reserves resulted from meager investments in the exploration and production of oil, despite the discovery of new deposits. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 18 Mar 94 p 19) Pemex Director Francisco Rojas says oil production in Mexico declined last year by 14 percent. Rojas attributed the decline to the "worst cyclical depression ever experienced by the petrochemical industry worldwide and Mexico's economic recession." President Carlos Salinas de Gortari spoke at the same event -- the 56th anniversary of the Mexican oil industry's nationalization. He reiterated that "oil is a strategic resource for our great nation and will continue to be the exclusive property of the Mexican people." Salinas added that oil has remained a nonnegotiable point in NAFTA. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 0037 GMT 19 Mar 94) President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has announced in Tlaxcala that the National Foreign Trade Bank and the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development, Secofi, will redouble its efforts to allow more medium-sized and small businesses to enter the North American, Central American, and European export markets. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 12 Mar 94) Fernando Heftye, Secofi's director of foreign investments, says that through February foreign investments in Mexico amounted to just over $4 billion, which could increase to $15 billion by year's end. Heftye said at least 20 countries are interested in signing bilateral agreements to protect and promote investment but that a formal negotiations process has not been initiated. Among the countries interested, he said, are Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland, Italy, and Spain. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 17 Mar 94 pp 1, 6) Jacques Lecomte, European Union, EU, ambassador to Mexico, says Mexico's exports to Europe decreased by 17 percent in 1993 because of the economic recession in the region. This decline in sales also slowed the Mexican economy and fostered uncertainty among Mexican businessmen prior to the signing of NAFTA. Lecomte said the EU has not conducted studies on the impact NAFTA will have on the EU-Mexican trade balance, but, he added, telecommunications will be among the most adversely affected areas. Lecomte concluded that the European countries would like to increase their exports to Mexico. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0242 GMT 16 Mar 94) French Ambassador to Mexico Paul Dijou says French investors and bankers would like to establish themselves in Mexico because NAFTA has made it a strategic point for investments. They are considering opening branches or establishing partnerships with Mexican banks. Dijou toured Puebla State to sign technological cooperation agreements with the Autonomous University of Puebla. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0148 GMT 16 Mar 94) Mexico's industrialization process has remained at a standstill over the past 13 years. Today, high technology exports total 60 percent of the country's total exports. Mexico's participation in the international market with sophisticated technical equipment is limited by the industrial underdevelopment in Latin America. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p 3A) The nation's airlines are not ready to deal with the increased shipping of merchandise under NAFTA. Domestic cargo service by domestic airlines decreased 3.8 percent over the past two years, while foreign airlines increased their cargo services by 30 percent over the same period. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p 21) EL FINANCIERO conducted an economic analysis based on Bank of Mexico information that shows prices of nearly one-third of the basic food basket staples increased at an annual rate of 11.2 percent in January -- a rate 3.7 percent above the national inflation index for consumer prices. Increases in the prices of corn meal, cookies, rice, oats, powdered milk, margarine, and other items all contributed to lowering the people's purchasing power.
