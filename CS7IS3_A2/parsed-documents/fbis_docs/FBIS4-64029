Head of the industrial policy committee Igor Shurchkov said that such secession could lead to greater disintegration and a sharp deterioration in the country's defence capability. He also said that the region's economic hardships, its remoteness and Russia's transport troubles were posing a real threat of the region being used by Asian-Pacific countries simply as a net exporter of mining products and importer of "average quality products at best". A resolution was adopted to form a commission of heads of regional departments and regional administration representatives to work out a package of proposals for economic recovery and on the prospects of regional development "in the context of Russia's geo-strategic and economic interests in the Asian-Pacific region." It was also indicated that the federal government and regional administration must meet to discuss the question of power sharing with each other.
