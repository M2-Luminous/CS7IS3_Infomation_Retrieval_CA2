At present, Petrobras is keeping three probes busy drilling wells in the Santos basin, and a fourth will be installed next week. "The goal of this effort is to find alternatives to the Campos Basin in Rio (the company's main drilling site). The potential for new offshore petroleum discoveries in the Santos basin is very high," said Dimas Dultra Simoes, assistant superintendent of operations for Petrobras's exploration department. According to Simoes, the Santos basin has an estimated potential of 200 million barrels of oil equivalent. The fields already discovered in that basin are Tubarao, Coral, Estrela do Mar, Merluza, and Caravelas. One of the producing wells in the Caravelas field, 1-BSS-64, has the highest flow rate of any in Brazil, contributing about 10,000 barrels of petroleum a day. Of the three wells now being drilled, the 1-BSS-74, located 180 km off Sao Sebastiao, on the Sao Paulo coast, is the first deepwater well in Sao Paulo. It is 1,140 meters deep. "That well is in the final drilling stages. Within the next several days, we will find out if there is oil there," Simoes said. The other two wells are the 1-BSS-72 and the Caravelas, an extension of the Caravelas field. The Santos basin has also shown good prospects as a source of natural gas. The Merluza field has an average production of 600,000 cubic meters of gas per day and a potential to reach the 2 million cubic meter/day level. The field has proven reserves of 13 billion cubic meters of natural gas. According to Simoes, interest in exploiting the Santos basin increased after the seismic data survey done by ship from 1992 to early 1993. In that effort, which involved an investment of $15 million, a radiography was made of the subsoil, surveying the best sites to drill wells. "At the moment, Petrobras is studying an integrated project to boost production in the basin," he said.
