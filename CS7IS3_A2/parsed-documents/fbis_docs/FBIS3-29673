The North Koreans aim to transform the Najin-Sonbong zone into a modern international trade center, fully equipped with industrial, commercial, housing and tourism facilities, according to a confidential document acquired by YONHAP. The 40-page booklet is titled "Golden Triangle Najin-Sonbong" and was issued by the Committee for the Promotion of External Economic Cooperation, formed early last year under the auspices of the External Economic Affairs Ministry. According to the three-phase plan that was initiated last year, the communist country will boast an international-quality port, roads, railways, airport, electricity, telecommunications and industrial facilities in the zone and expand Chongjin port by 2010. To begin with, it will build a new 1,000-meter harbor next to the current 2,515-meter facility in Najin and add 32,399 square meters of storage for an annual freight capacity of 10 million tons in the northwestern port city by next year. Between 1996 and 2000, the area's annual freight capacity will be increased to 20 million tons, with another 3,500-meter harbor to accommodate freighters up to 200,000 tons as well as 500,000 square meters of storage. By 2010, it will be equipped with a terminal capable of handling 40 million tons of cargo and also house 36 freighters weighing 20,000 to 200,000 tons. Sonbong port will have an annual freight capacity of 10 million tons by then while Chongjin port is refurnished to support the international role of Najin and Sonbong. The 168-kilometer Hoeryong-Haksong railway will be duplicated and tracks linking Najin to Kuryonpyong and Hunyong expanded. Also on the drawing board is a scheme to realize North Korea's ambition of linking up with China and Russia. Railways will be modernized and expanded to Hunchun and Khassan, bordering China and Russia, respectively, and expressways constructed to connect Hoeryong, Chongjin, Najin, Sonbong, Khassan (Russia), Onsong and Namyang. In addition, North Korea will set up 100,000 electric telephone and data exchange circuits in Najin and construct an optical submarine cable linking Najin-Hunchun-Posyet. The masterplan also includes a 300,000-kilowatt power station, an international airport in Sonbong and elaborate connections to Niigata (Japan), Vladivostok and Khabarovsk (Russia), and Hunchun and Jilin (China). In particular, North Korea is seeking foreign investment in advanced technology and high value-added services in the booklet. It is offering to rent a square meter of land in the Najin-Sonbong zone for 1.2 U.S. dollars to 3.2 dollars and is asking 59 dollars for land development of each square meter.
