They said the ministry intends to complete and submit the provisional budget by March 29. The budget is expected to pass the House of Representatives on March 30 and the House of Councillors the following day to become law, they said. The Diet is now stalled in its deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget package and it seems certain that the measures will be passed well beyond the April 1 start of fiscal 1994. The current ordinary Diet session is at an impasse over demands by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party for a full accounting from Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of a 100 million yen loan he received from a scandal-ridden company. The delay in enacting the budget has dampened hopes of a quick economic upturn. The budget focuses on policy spending to put the economy on the path of full-fledged recovery. The sources said the provisional budget will incorporate labor, operating and other expenses to keep administrative machinery functioning as well as social welfare spending and tax grants to local governments. Outlays for ongoing public works to be carried over from fiscal 1993 will also be included but new policy spending is not subject to the bridge budget. This is because the economy will be supported on the fiscal side by the recently enacted fiscal 1993 third supplementary budget that finances large chunks of a previous 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package, the sources said. On the revenue side, they said the ministry is to raise funds mainly through treasury bills to cover an expected revenue shortfall at the onset of the fiscal year when tax revenues are normally low. The 50-day provisional period is the second longest in post-World War II history, matching that of bridge budgets formed in fiscal 1987, 1989 and 1990. The total amount of about 11 trillion is a rough calculation that adds increased labor and other necessary expenses on a 50-day provisional budget worth 10.2 trillion yen in fiscal 1990, the sources said.
