Gen van der Merwe said in an SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] interview there was prima facie evidence that the suspects had been involved in the explosions. They would be brought before the courts soon. It was difficult to say whether more Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] Ystergarde [Iron Guard] members were involved, Gen van der Merwe said, but the suspects came from a "certain circle" in the AWB. Gen van der Merwe added that police were investigating intimidation charges countrywide, but the charges could not be described as "widescale".
