Speaking after a session of the ODS Executive Council, he said that the party stuck to its stand that the state was the entity to return property to the churches, and that the former church property, now possessed by communities, would be returned only with their approval. The church property was expropriated after the communists seized power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948. Strasky said that particularly the buildings, which serve religious purposes and which are necessary to ensure the churches' existence, would be returned. Another criterion will be the cost of the consequences of property restitution, he added. The Executive Council has defined items to be returned according to the type, exclusively or enumeratively, and of items that will not be returned at all, Strasky said. He noted that the ODS has partially changed its previous stand and decided that also certain parts of farming and forest land and buildings related to them would be returned exceptionally and exclusively to religious orders. The council also confirmed its previous stand that the property which would not be returned be handled as any other property, Strasky said. The council charged Strasky to defend in future negotiations on church property its negative stands on further restitutions and further proposals to alleviate property injustices. The three other government coalition parties -- the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) favor either comprehensive or almost comprehensive restitution of church property. The council also supported partial remedy of the wrongdoings caused to Czechs during the Nazi occupation for political or racial reasons and will soon initiate "advance, compensation from Czech resources, Prime Minister and ODS Chairman Vaclav Klaus said. He added this move was motivated by humanitarian points of view. "This does not and cannot mean in any case that we are abandoning our claims to Germany," he stressed. The idea to compensate the Nazi victims from Czech resources was first formulated by Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec last year. It takes into consideration the high age of the eligible persons, but counts on continuing negotiations with the Germans on funding the compensation. The compensation concerns about 13,000 people.
