Sani Abacha in its efforts to build a united country. In a message on the occasion of 'Id al-Fitr (end of the Ramadan) made available to journalists Friday [11 March], Babangida urged Nigerians not to undermine the unity of the country but keep to the tenets of their religion. He said in line with the doctrines of Ramadan, Nigerians should always create "an atmosphere of love for one another and develop the spirit of brotherhood and righteousness and service to Allah and the country" in order to live in peace and harmony. This is the first public statement of the former military ruler who stepped down seven months ago after plunging the country into crisis over the annulment of the results of the elections held on 12 June 1993 in which his close friend, millionaire businessman Moshood Abiola claimed victory. Before stepping down, Babangida handed over power to a civilian interim government led by industrialist Ernest Shonekan who was ousted by Abacha in November 1993.
