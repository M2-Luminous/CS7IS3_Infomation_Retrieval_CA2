Discussions will be held this week between the Departments of Defense and Foreign Affairs on the UN request. Defense Department spokesman, Brigadier Adrian d'Hage said Australia was likely to provide a technical and engineering support for a UN force, but peacekeeping troops were usually sent only after some form of political settlement had been reached. [Begin d'Hage recording] The sort of things that will be assessed this week are firstly the risk and security of our own troops. There was always a risk when you put military people in, but the risk has to be acceptable and we will also be looking at the likely duration. So there are a lot of factors to be considered before recommendations are made to government and government makes a decision. [end recording]
