The tirade spun out by the traitor at the "press conference" was, in a nutshell, a base rigmarole full of disgusting honeyed words to justify his towering crimes in seeking flunkeyism and treachery, fascism and violence, division and confrontation last year under the "civilian" veil, prop up the puppet regime facing a crisis of destruction caused by the already bankrupt "policy of reforms" and break the fighting spirit of the people who had risen up resolutely to overthrow the "civilian government", disillusioned with it. Viciously taking issue with the fictitious "nuclear problem" of the North again, he wagged his tongue freely, blaring that he would make his "maximum effort for the settlement of the nuclear issue of the North". Recent contacts between the DPRK and the U.S. opened up a prospect for the solution to the "nuclear problem" of the Korean peninsula and paved the way for a progress of the talks between the two sides. Quite upset by this, the South Korean puppets are raising such terrific outcries over the "nuclear issue" of the North in a bid to set the "international cooperation system" in-motion at any cost. The bellicose blast of the traitor Kim Yong-sam about the "modernisation" of the puppet Army and "establishment of a security posture" shows that the puppets are virtually seeking a showdown of strength. It is an unpardonable anti-national criminal act for the South Korean puppets to take the road of inciting North-South confrontation and aggravating the tension in the Korean peninsula, in league with outside forces, turning down the offer of fellow countrymen to open a way out for the nation through the reconciliation and unity of North and South.
