The decision was made by the IMF board of governors on February 14 for Sudan's delayed repayment of its debt to the IMF. The minister of state said the Sudanese Government has formed a committee representing the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs and the Bank of Khartoum to draft a memorandum as a reply to the IMF decision. He pointed out that the memorandum, which will be submitted to the coming session of the IMF board of directors, involves Sudan's relationship with the IMF and the economic performance and the government's endeavors to rectify the economic course in Sudan. Sudan, al-Zubayr explained, needs 15 percent of the votes of members of the IMF board of governors to revoke its the decision on requesting Sudan to withdraw its membership from the IMF. Sudan has announced comprehensive economic programs aimed at liberalizing its economy, yet the IMF has continued to impose sanctions on Sudan, al-Zubeir said. He complained that the IMF gave Sudan nothing in the course of the year 1993, but Sudan has managed to overcome the difficulties arising from this by relying upon itself, adding that the Sudanese economy has secured a high growth rate over the past three years. The minister of state expressed hope that the IMF member states would understand Sudan's standpoint and help Sudan tackle the problems arising from its foreign debts. Sudan has more than once assured the IMF that it is ready to pay a token part of its foreign debts in order to prove that it is willing to continue to deal with the IMF. The debts owed by Sudan to the IMF total some 12 billion U.S. dollars, 58 percent of which are interest and service charges and the rest is principal.
