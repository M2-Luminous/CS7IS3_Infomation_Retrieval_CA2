The two companies said the alliance was "the result of an in-depth dialogue, during which both operators have gained a new vision of their long-standing partnership in a fast-growing market." According to the MoU signed by the two operators, each will hold equal shares of the new company, as yet unnamed. Initially, the joint venture will build from activities transferred from existing entities of the two carriers such as Transpac and its European subsidiaries, and Datex-P in Germany. Other France Telecom entities, including some units of France Cables et Radio, and DBT units as well as EUNETCOM, the France Telecom/DBT value-added services joint venture, will also be transferred to the joint company. The company will provide services to multinational companies. These will include X.25 switched data, frame relay and Internet Protocol (IP) services, as well as virtual private data network services, international end-to-end digital circuits, VSAT [very-small-aperture terminal] services, international virtual private voice networks, and other voice value-added services. These services will use a single backbone network and have common network management systems. The company is scheduled to become operational in early 1995 when it will offer competitively-priced services, centralised billing, one-stop shopping, and global customer support. Products and services will be marketed under a joint brand name. The new company will be headquartered in Brussels, with corporate offices and central operational units in France and Germany. During its first year of operation, DBT and France Telecom expect the new venture to generate revenues of around ECU1.5 billion and to have some 4,000 employees. The two operators said they viewed the alliance as a "major undertaking to provide a range of competitive, innovative, high-value services on a worldwide basis," and said that "access to the North American and Asia-Pacific markets may be achieved through cooperation with other partners." Negotiations are believed to be ongoing with AT&T of the United States. Formal details of the new global alliance will now be examined by the European Commission which has yet to decide whether it falls under its jurisdiction. Most recently, the Commission said that it could not examine the proposed joint venture between BT and the United States operator, MCI, under its 1990 merger regulations because the deal was too small and instead would examine it under wider European anti-trust rules. BT's Chairman, Iain Vallance, recently voiced his disapproval of the France Telecom/DBT merger. He believes that effective liberalisation and a regulatory regime which encourages European companies to develop new technologies to the best advantage can best be accelerated by a total freedom to compete for telecommunications services and customers across Europe and is dismayed that implementation of a European Commission directive insisting on full telecommunications liberalisation has been delayed until 1998, with exclusion clauses for some countries. It is in this context that he disapproves of the prospect of the merger of DBT's and France Telecom's operations. If such a merger was allowed to take place before the full liberalisation across Europe, then it would simply constitute a firmly entrenched pan-European telecommunications monopoly that is totally at odds with the European vision of open competition in a single market, he said. Announcing the alliance, the two operators said that all the activities of the new company are in sectors fully opened to competition and not subject to monopoly control. Furthermore, these activities will be pursued in total conformity with the rules of competition defined by the European Commission. They added that the arrangements would not compromise any existing bilateral correspondent agreements already established with all other international carriers. DBT and France Telecom hope to receive EC Commission approval for the merger before the end of March next year. Prior to the announcement confirming the alliance, the German Postal Minister, Wolfgang Boetsch, and Industry Minister Gerard Longuet of France, welcomed the European operator's plans and said that they did not infringe upon European competition rules. In a statement, the German Postal Ministry said: "The plans should be seen against the backdrop of an alliance and partnership which could lead to a capital swap as soon as the legal status of the two firms allows it." A date for the privatisation of France Telecom has not yet been decided, while the privatisation of DBT is scheduled to begin in 1995. Announcement of the alliance came as European ministers were meeting in Brussels to discuss the European Commission's proposals for the liberalisation of the European telecommunications sector.
