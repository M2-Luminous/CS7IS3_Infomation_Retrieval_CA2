He called on all electors, regardless of their ethnic origins, to vote for those who "will be promoting in parliament ideas of market economics, for those who stand for a powerful executive branch and presidential government." He also appealed for support for the candidates he had proposed. Nazarbayev expressed the confidence that the people of Kazakhstan would not "swallow the bait of shallow carpers, persons pursuing narrow nationalistic personal aims or populists." Otherwise "we will end up with total discord in parliament, the kind we see in the `near abroad,'" he said. In his view, Kazakhstan has a chance to overcome its present crisis faster than any other CIS country, due to the diligence of its population, its tremendous natural resources and its extensive export opportunities. He said some progress had been made with economic reforms and that gold production had somewhat gone up. By 1996, he said, the republic would have enough gold to keep its currency stable without large dollar infusions. The loans provided by foreign business would top $2.5 Bn [billion] in that year, he said. The president also said it was essential to strengthen political stability in Kazakhstan. "What explains (international) interest in our state and its influence in the international arena are not only its natural wealth and strategic position but also the stability of its social and political life," he said. In this connection, he called for a serious attitude to the problems of migration, citizenship and language and expressed support for the idea of convening an assembly of peoples of Kazakhstan. Nazarbayev suggested making amendments to the Constitution that would authorize parliament to dismiss the president and would give the president the right to dissolve parliament. He said he would like the new legislature to be bicameral. The president said he would urge the new parliament to launch an onslaught on crime. He said murderers, rapists and heads of criminal bands should be put to death without fail. He believes that citizens of other states who have committed a crime in Kazakhstan must bot be extradited to their home countries but be punished in Kazakhstan on the basis of the Kazakh law. He said stronger penalties were needed for the theft of motor vehicles, burglary and robbery, and that the population should be allowed to keep weapons to defend their homes and property.
