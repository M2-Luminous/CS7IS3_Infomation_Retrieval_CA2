In the middle of the French prime minister's visit the police have arrested another dissident, Xu Wenli, a leading figure of the opposition and a known francophile. Our reporter asked Mr. Balladur about the arrest; however, the prime minister shied away from any direct comment. [Begin Balladur recording] I emphasized the importance that France, the birthplace of human rights, attaches to the respect of human rights in all its relations with different countries around the world. It is quite true that to do this we must take account of everyone's traditions, and of the rhythm of evolution appropriate to each country. Moreover, it is true that economic and commercial progress, which increasingly tends to unite the world, is accompanied by what I would call an intellectual and cultural unification, so that a sort of community of the spirit grows around the world from which no country can entirely opt out. It indeed seemed useful to me to have a more restricted conversation with my Chinese counterpart. I have one more word to add, and this is all I will say: on this subject, efficiency is more often better served by discretion than by publicity. [end recording] Chinese President Jiang Zemin has officially been invited to France on a date of his choosing. According to Balladur, this invitation marks the new era in the two countries' relations.
