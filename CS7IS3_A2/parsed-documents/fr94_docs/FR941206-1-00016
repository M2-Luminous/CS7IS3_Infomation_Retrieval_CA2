FR941206-1-00016 FR941206-1-00001 VI. The Proposal FSIS is proposing to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to define and standardize, and establish other requirements for poultry products produced by mechanical separation, including provisions for the composition and use of such products, and requirements for manufacturing and labeling such products. The proposal would prescribe a definition and standard of identity for poultry products produced by mechanical separation with 1 percent or less bone solids content, that requires compliance with certain criteria; e.g., bone solids content (measured as calcium content) and bone particle size. The proposal also would provide recordkeeping and labeling requirements, and limitations on use of poultry products produced by mechanical separation. Poultry product produced by mechanical separation is hereafter referred to as ``MS(K).'' A. Product Definition and Standard FSIS is proposing to prescribe a definition and standard of identity and composition for the finely comminuted poultry product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and other tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses which has a bone solids content of 1 percent or less. This product is commonly known in the poultry industry as mechanically deboned poultry or MDP. While whole carcasses sometimes are used, the starting materials for this type of processing frequently are parts of carcasses, such as frames, backs and necks, which contain relatively low proportions of skeletal muscle, or parts, such as breast frames, from which most of the skeletal muscle already has been removed by traditional deboning techniques. The starting materials, which may have undergone an initial bone breaking process, are pushed under high pressure through equipment with apertures that allow a small amount of powdered bone to pass through with the soft tissue. Such starting material is in natural proportion with regard to skin and attached fat; if skin and fat is in excess of proportions found naturally on a whole carcass, the product is labeled to reflect the presence of skin and fat according to 9 CFR 381.117(d). MS(K) differs from poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques (e.g., hand-deboning) in its highly comminuted and spread-like consistency and in its content of bone and associated tissue, as well as muscle, skin, and fat. In view of the differences between MS(K) and boneless poultry derived by traditional methods (e.g., hand-deboning), it appears inappropriate to continue to include MS(K) within the category of ``boneless poultry products'' (9 CFR 381.117(d)). Instead, FSIS is proposing to define it as a distinct poultry product ingredient and standardize its characteristics under subpart P of the poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR 381, subpart P). FSIS is proposing that the boneless poultry products regulation (9 CFR 381.117(d)) no longer apply to MS(K). Consequently, the current restriction on bone solids content in this regulation, as enforced by limiting calcium content, will be included with other compositional requirements in an MS(K) standard. Moreover, as a standardized product, MS(K) would be differentiated from other poultry product ingredients and it would be designated in the ingredients statements on finished product labels by the name specified in its definition and standard, in accordance with 9 CFR 317.2(c)(2) and (f)(1) and 381.118(a). Product failing to meet the bone solids content or bone particle size restrictions of the standard must be labeled as ``Mechanically Separated (Kind) For Further Processing'' and may only be used in producing poultry extractives, including fats, stocks, and broths because the manufacturing process completely removes the bone solids and bone particles. 1. Product name. FSIS is proposing to define the standardized product that is finely comminuted and results from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses by a distinctive name. FSIS is proposing that such product be called ``Mechanically Separated (Kind) (MS(K)).'' It appears to accurately and concisely describe the product that materially differs in composition and consistency from traditional hand-deboned product, indicating the nature of the process by which and the kind of poultry from which it is made. The proposed name includes ``(Kind)'' rather than ``poultry'' to make it clear that the kind of poultry (9 CFR 381.1(b)(40)) from which the product is made is specified (e.g., ``Mechanically Separated Chicken''). By including ``(Kind)'' in the proposed name, FSIS is acknowledging that skin and attached fat may be present such that the proportion is consistent with that which occurs naturally on a whole poultry carcass. If skin and attached fat are present at levels exceeding natural proportions, as defined for boneless poultry products (9 CFR 381.117(d)), it must be labeled.
