According to the poll, the yes side's only hope is that both Sweden and Finland vote in favor of membership before the Norwegian referendum. Sweden's and Finland's Decision Is of Great Importance Some 55.7 percent of those who took part in the poll said that they will vote against Norwegian membership if the Swedes and Finns have also done so. Only 19.4 percent would vote yes under such circumstances. If Finland decides to become an EU member while Sweden remains outside the Union, 48.3 percent would vote against and 24.1 percent for Norwegian membership. If both Finland and Sweden joint the EU, 39.9 percent of Norwegians would vote against membership. Under such circumstances almost the same number of Norwegians -- 37.5 percent -- intend to vote for membership. The poll is the first which has taken the referendums in Finland and Sweden into consideration. It was carried out over the past week. The Norwegian referendum is likely to be arranged for November or December.
