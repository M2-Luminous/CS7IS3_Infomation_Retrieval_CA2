Ricupero said: "I am not campaigning for the PSDB. I am not linked to any party. Rather, I am a critic of the PSDB." He added that the "PSDB is like a gay who has not dared come out of the closet, as the Americans say. The PSDB has sometimes failed to assume its role." Ricupero even compared the PSDB to the old UDN [National Democratic Union]. He said: "Although the PSDB has good members, it is, like the UDN, a center party despite their thinking it is a leftist party." He made these remarks with a broad smile while mingling with approximately 100 businessmen at the Rio Grande do Sul State Federation of Industries (FIERGS). Under the watchful eye of FIERGS President Dagoberto Godoy, Ricupero said he had "nothing against gays," and even confessed to having a "gay friend." He drew the above comparison in simple terms, and went on. He added: "No one can charge me with campaigning for the PSDB. My son, who is with the Workers Party, likes Antonio Gramsci," the Italian leftist ideologist. In his opinion, the electoral campaign is focusing on the personality of the candidates instead of on their government programs. Ricupero, who also questioned the manner in which the electoral campaign is being conducted, said: "All we are hearing is that Cardoso is this way, while Lula is that way, but no one is talking about their programs." He added: "It is a mistake to believe we will be electing a president who will have powers similar to those of Juscelino Kubitschek or Janio Quadros. At that time, presidents had full powers." Ricupero said the situation "has changed radically, as we have a parliamentarist constitution for a presidentialist system." Ricupero defended the parliamentary system. Without mentioning Cardoso's name, he said "the ideal thing" would be to elect a candidate capable of promoting alliances. "If the winner does not have a majority in Congress and cannot promote alliances, he will not be able to rule," he said. He cited the case of former President Fernando Collor, noting that "Collor did not manage to stay in power, let alone rule."
