In analyzing the discussions that took place both yesterday and today, it seemed to me that the stress was put only on the first argument; namely, on the necessity of postponing the elections. But the other important argument -- that if the Supreme Council adopts the relevant laws and clarifications then the elections should be held -- was not analyzed. Therefore, I am not saying from this podium that the elections should not be held. I said, and I am saying, and I stick to this point of view, that it is necessary to hold the elections [applause], but must be held only when the elections are subject to a legislative base. This is my position and it is based on the fact that otherwise we could finally lose control of power. If the elections are held without the introduction of amendments and additions to the Constitution and laws and if the authorities of oblast and rayon chairmen, and so on, are not clearly defined, then we will have an uncontrolled situation and we will have a complete collapse of the executive authority. I am not threatening you. I am speaking from the experience we have had since 1990, and you will recall that we did not introduce presidency because of someone's whim but because of the situation that developed. Second, if you carefully read the law passed by the previous Supreme Council on the formation of national and local state and representative bodies, you will not find any mention of president there. I remember how your predecessors censored this law and how much they were opposed to the institution of presidency. Suddenly, today, they say that a president must be elected. I am asking you, how? If that law vests everything in the government, this being only a probability because no one knows what specifically is vested, since it only says that specific laws are yet to be worked out, what is the role of the president? If the president is popularly elected given these powers -- and as far as I can see, there is no alternative -- we will have a president in Kiev, who will be the head of state and head of executive power, with no tools whatsoever for the president's regional influence. That is why I am saying that these issues must be settled. If the Supreme Council really wants, as some declared here, Ukraine to remain an independent, governed, sovereign, and democratic state, then, confirming its decision to hold the election on 26 June, it should not make a mere general statement, but take a specific responsibility here, in front of everyone, to prepare relevant documents before 26 June. This must be stated in a resolution. Because the draft resolution says: submit before 12 June -- I read on -- documents regulating the powers of the president of Ukraine. The powers of the Ukrainian president are regulated by the Constitution, and no law can change it, no matter how much you may wish. Changes must be made in the Constitution. Is there a real possibility of making the changes? If there is, let us make them. I am in favor of this; moreover, I was the first to stand for a clear delimitation of powers, and it was my proposal to write down in the draft constitution the delimitation of the president's powers as the head of state and the head of executive power. But this must be written down in the Constitution. Therefore, I would like you to withdraw the allegations made here that someone wants to hold on to his seat, and someone wants something else, and questions as to why the president signed the law on elections. Yes, the president did sign it, but the president has since submitted draft documents to the Supreme Council concerning the law on power, and you said here from the podium that the law on power was absolutely redundant. But it clearly defined what the president does, what the government does, what judicial power does, and what the Supreme Council does. People would have voted for it on 27 March, and then, on this basis, elections would be held. Then there would have been no tug-of-war. But you did not want it that way. Now there's another interesting point. They say that you need only one change: the chairman of an oblast council should be elected by council deputies. Then all will be well. I am asking you: If the chairman is elected by council deputies, can the central government dismiss him? No. Can the president do so? No. I have now three times more powers against the president of Crimea then the president elected in June will have against an oblast or rayon council chairman. If we are to elect a president not just because one does not like the current president, as I feel the case is, I would like the president to be elected without destroying state and executive power, legitimately, consistently, and without saying: Why do we need these legal intricacies, the people want elections! Because tomorrow, when it is destroyed, the same people will come to the Supreme Council and say they are getting no pension, because the budget will not receive any contributions, they are not getting this, they are not getting that. I ask you, who will answer these questions and how? If we are to create new power, in which I support you, let us create it in a way to make it work. I repeat: The power we will elect now will not work. If it does, there will be no control over this power by present law. I don't want to be a prophet in my country, as they say, but you will see it for yourself in a while. That's why I want us to approach the situation in a very responsible way. If the Supreme Council and its commissions undertake to amend these laws and lay the necessary emphases in the laws passed by your predecessors, then there is no doubt that I will support the elections. This is my absolutely clear position on local elections. Second, my position on the presidential election. The president's status today is defined by the Constitution. If the president is elected in this status, then, believe me, if he endures all the tortures of election, no Supreme Council will take away any powers from him. Therefore, any change will have to be put to a referendum. Someone here already hinted at a referendum, that we must hold one to see what is necessary and what is not. This is a curious line of argument, electing a president with all his powers in June, and holding a referendum in September to see if there is any need for him at all. What powers can you then taken away from him? I ask you, what are we after? Just to pass on slogans? I am appealing to you: you will have the greatest responsibility, and I want you to know this, because the presidential campaign is under way. I am a presidential candidate. You are a popularly elected legitimate Supreme Council, a constitutional but not a full-blooded one, because one third of deputies are missing. Some regions are not represented in the Supreme Council. But you are a legitimate, constitutional Supreme Council. You bear the greatest responsibility today for the kind of power we will form. History must know this, what kind of power we are forming. What kind of power it will be is exclusively and fully within the competence of the Supreme Council. Any political passions, any allegations as to who wants what and how, must be dismissed if we indeed are rooting for Ukraine. You can quote enough arguments today both for and against. I want us to form a strong executive power, a legitimate supreme legislative power, and a president with clear and well- defined powers. If we do this, and I urge you to do this, then we need to go to the polls on 26 June. Whoever wins will win -- I never denied that.
