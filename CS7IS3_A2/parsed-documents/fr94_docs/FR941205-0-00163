FR941205-0-00163 FR941205-0-00029 HUD Response. The program does require that HFAs have errors and omissions insurance and this is reflected in the Risk-Sharing Agreement. If there is an impediment that precludes the HFA from obtaining this insurance, the Department will consider waivers for good cause and with adequate protection under some other means. This provision has, in fact, been waived for two HFAs that were either covered under State provisions or where the State was self-insured. In these cases, this provision of the RSA was modified. With respect to the comment about use of certified appraisers, the Risk-Sharing program regulation does require compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). USPAP requires use of a Certified General Appraiser for work done under either Standard 1, for determining value, or Standard 4, real estate consultations. This latter Standard covers multifamily cases where value is not determined using the standard three approaches to value but the appraiser does a rental and expense analysis and calculates a capitalized value, similar to what HUD does in the Section 221(d)(4) program. Subpart B_Housing Finance Agency Requirements Section 266.100␣Qualified HFA. Comments. Commenter 9 expressed a concern that the number of HFAs qualified to originate, underwrite, service and manage multifamily loans is severely limited. The commenter did not question the importance or relevance of the rule's criteria for an HFA to have a certain level of internal staff capacity to review and evaluate work of any contractors it may hire to perform technical services, to make underwriting conclusions, and to oversee its loan portfolio, and that an HFA have an established record in multifamily loan processing, servicing and property disposition, but believes the ability of most HFAs to hire experienced personnel or train existing staff is limited because of local and state budget constraints. The commenter believes that this limited ability to participate will leave many parts of the country with no representation or service. HUD Response. The Department was pleased to approve 33 applicants under the Risk-Sharing Pilot including 26 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and 5 localities. The States approved included many of the most populous States_California, New York, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey and Massachusetts. Section 266.105␣Application requirements. Comments. Commenter 5 questioned the requirement in §266.105(b)(12) for an unaudited interim financial statement if the latest audit statement of an HFA is more than six months old. The commenter stated that the requirement should be more specific about the information to be provided, the time period to be covered, and the standard of accounting to be used. The same commenter stated that the information requested in the additional application requirements for HFAs without top-tier designation or overall rating of ``A'' (paragraph (c)) could be derived from an HFA's comprehensive annual financial report that also includes its audited financial statements. The commenter suggested that the information be provided only if unavailable in other documents submitted. Commenter 12 stated that the ``highest quality compliance plan'' requirement in §266.105(b)(4) is redundant, since other requirements in the application process will ensure the same result. HUD Response. The Department has determined after reviewing the large number of applications submitted for participation in the pilot program that the requirement in paragraph §266.105(b)(12) for an unaudited interim financial statement if the latest HFA audit is more than 6 months old is not only unclear but is unnecessary. This requirement has been removed from the text of this final rule.
