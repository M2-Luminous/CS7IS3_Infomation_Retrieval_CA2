FR940429-0-00016 FR940429-0-00008 (4) Revise observer coverage requirements for vessels using pot gear to participate in a directed fishery for groundfish, so that each vessel using pot gear that is equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA is required to carry an observer during at least 30 percent of its fishing days during each calendar quarter in which it participates for more than 3 days in a directed groundfish pot gear fishery; and (5) Revise the conflict of interest standards for NMFS-certified observers and observer contractors. Revisions include: (1) Placing restrictions on observers who were employed in the observed fishery within the preceding 12 months; and (2) prohibiting observer contractors from assigning observers in response to requests for or against a specific individual or a specific gender, race, creed, or age of individual. The intent of these measures is to increase observer coverage of the groundfish harvests and to promote the fishery management objectives of the FMPs. Further descriptions of, and reasons for, these measures are contained in the preamble to the proposed rule (58 FR 57979, October 28, 1993). With the exception of §672.27(c)(1)(iii)(F), the effective date of the final rule is July 1, 1994. This date coincides with the beginning of the third calendar quarter and will facilitate the implementation of new quarterly observer coverage requirements by reducing confusion that would result from a mid-quarter effective date. Section 672.27(c)(1)(iii)(F) reduces observer coverage requirements for vessels 125 ft LOA or longer fishing for groundfish with pot gear, and thus, provides relief to vessel operators in this category. Therefore, NMFS has determined that the effective date for this section should not be delayed until July 1, 1994. The effective date for §672.27(c)(1)(iii)(F) is May 31, 1994. Changes in the Final Rule From the Proposed Rule This final rule includes three changes from the proposed rule. These changes are described as follows: First, technical changes are made to §§672.27 and 675.25 to include minor editorial revisions and metric equivalents for specified lengths of vessels that require different levels of observer coverage. Second, §672.27(c)(1)(v)(C) is amended to clarify that a catcher vessel delivering groundfish to a shoreside processor or to a mothership in Alaska State waters during a weekly reporting period will be assigned to a fishery category based on the retained catch composition of all groundfish delivered to processors during that weekly reporting period and reported on Alaska Department of Fish and Game fish tickets. Finally, the Observer Plan is corrected by removing from Attachment 3 (Standards of Observer Conduct) an inappropriate reference to title 15 CFR subtitle A, part O, of the U.S. Department of Commerce Regulations. These regulations pertained to standards of conduct for employees of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Certified observers are not NMFS employees and therefore cannot be held to these standards. The Observer Plan continues to require certified observers to comply with the conflict of interest standards and general standards of behavior set out in Attachments 3 and 4 of the amended Plan. Response to Comments Two letters were received within the comment period that ended November 29, 1993. A summary of comments and NMFS's responses follow. Comment 1. The proposed action bases observer coverage on fishing days instead of fishing trip days and increases observer coverage on vessels equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA but less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA. This action would increase the financial burden on the catcher boat fleet, particularly on those vessels delivering to shoreside facilities that are required to have observer coverage. This results in an inequitable impact on the catcher boat fleet and further aggravates the disproportionate effect of the Observer Program on catcher vessels. Given these effects, implementation of measures to increase observer coverage should be delayed until after the North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan is effective.
