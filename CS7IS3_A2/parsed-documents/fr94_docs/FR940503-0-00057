FR940503-0-00057 FR940503-0-00014 As amended by the interim rule, 39 CFR 265.6(d)(8) will authorize disclosure of information only for the purpose of identifying an address as belonging to a CMRA, and no other information concerning CMRAs or their customers will be disclosed pursuant to the regulation. Because the regulation will not authorize the disclosure of the identities of CMRA customers, disclosures under the regulation will not invade the legitimate privacy interests of persons who receive mail through CMRAs. The information will be disclosed primarily by means of annotations to the Postal Service's Delivery Sequence File (DSF). DSF data, the use of which is made available to the public through authorized licensees, contains delivery-point addresses, and it does not include the identities of individuals. Copies of Form 1583 on file with the Postal Service are records protected by the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and they are maintained in the Postal Service's Privacy Act system of records USPS 010.050, Collection and Delivery Records_Delivery of Mail Through Agents. In a separate notice published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register , the Postal Service is adding a routine use to system of records USPS 010.050 which will authorize the disclosure of the information that may be released pursuant to the interim rule. Although the Postal Service is exempted by 39 U.S.C. 410(a) from the advance notice requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act regarding rulemaking (5 U.S.C. 553), the Postal Service invites interested persons to submit written comments concerning the interim rule. These comments will be considered before a final rule is adopted. List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 265 Disclosure of information, Postal Service.
