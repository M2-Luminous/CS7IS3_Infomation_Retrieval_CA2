The only exception was a national dialogue committee; 'Abd-al-Shafi was entrusted with forming a National Dialogue Committee, and with following up on this task. The Executive Committee confirmed that the constitutional document announced had not yet been enacted by the committee. It had been submitted for popular discussion and for specialized parties to discuss it and to propose any amendments and submit them to the Executive Committee. As to the other proposals, a member of the Reform Committee, who refused to identify himself, said that its acceptance in principle was, in actual fact, merely a polite rejection, or an effort to escape and be elusive. The advisory committee, proposed by what is called the Planning Council of the National Council, an ineffective council that has not played any role since it was founded in the second session of the National Council more than 20 years ago, and the Manpower Development Department were gutted of their purpose and abridged by modernizing the Palestinian Data Bank, in place for more than 12 years. As regards elections, the general impression we came away with is that the topic of elections was left open to many different possibilities, as the realization of the importance and necessity of holding them does not rule out the possibilities of avoiding them or emptying them (were they to be held) of their meaning. A member of the Reform Committee added, "The positions and participation of our fellow members of the Executive Committee who took part in the meetings were not helpful to the delegation in its task. They have ranged from utter silence and aloofness to our requests, coming up with pretexts and excuses, to support, confirming our preliminary impression that Brother 'Arafat is still the one who makes the decisions, and that the other members of the Executive Committee make no effort to limit this individual control. They are resigned to this fact." Despite this, the Reform Committee member says that the results the committee achieved on its own constitute a step forward, albeit a small one, and that the process must go on, in various forms, building on this step, in order to achieve decisive reforms, dealing not only with the existing institutions of the PLO, but with the structure, institutions, and departments of the national authority. This way, it will be democratic and attract our people's many qualified cadres to join. He added that the memorandum as a format and framework of the action had achieved its ends, but the democratic demands it contained still stood, and that action had to be pursued to achieve them and to turn them into solid proposals. Reform, in its old concept, and the obselete action linked to it, are not in force. What needs to be done is for demands to be brought forward for the building of the new national sovereignty with its various agencies, departments, and institutions. The Reform Committee delegation, which visited Tunis, may have seven members: Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, Ibrahim Abu-Ayyash, Dr. Taysir 'Aruri, Tawfiq Abu-Bakr, Nabil 'Amru, Dr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, and Ghazi al-Khalili. Zuhayrah Kamal, representative of the women's component in the territories, will be associated with the delegation. The meetings with the Executive Committee chaired by 'Arafat yielded the following provisions: 1. To form an advisory committee for the Executive Committee, with a number of experienced, qualified, and credible persons, and of varied fields of expertise, which will study the issues and topics submitted to the Executive Committee, to advise and consult on them before they are decided. 2. To form two advisory committees, one each in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, made up of capable and credible persons who represent the political and social fabric of our people in the territories, in such a way that each of these two committees might be a national authority in local issues of the political leadership (the Executive Committee), submitting to it advice and consultation in domestic issues in all that relates to the building of the institutions of the national authority, its attendant departments, etc. 3. To create a department to deal with development and the evolution of manpower, as one of the departments of the PLO. This office would be concerned with updating the Palestinian data bank to collect and compile Palestinian resources both in the diaspora and in the country, to prepare precise information about them: their qualifications, fields of expertise, and practical capabilities, to be at the dispoal of of the Executive Committee and its institutions as needed. It will also prepare the program and practical plans for training and retraining. It will train the cadres of the Palestinian revolution and the workers who are proposed for work in the institutions of the national authority and its various departments. 4. To improve our negotiating mechanism as a political command and negotiating committees, to move away from improvisation in defining policies and selecting negotiating committee members, relying on defined authority to monitor the negotiating delegations in receiving information from them or relaying instructions to them, putting an end to the acquisition of multiple communications and contacts with the negotiating delegations, depending on standards of capability, experience, and specialization in selecting members of the negotiating committees. 5. To hold elections for the legislative council proposed for the national authority on its appointed date this coming July, in accordance with democratic and contemporary election law. These elections should not be postponed or avoided, regardless of excuses, pretexts, or justifications. In addition, to submit the constitutional document prepared by the Legal Committee to the people for discussion, for their comments and amendments, to review it in that light, so that it may be a democratic constitutional document, conforming to the democratic principles contained in the declaration of independence, such as: the establishment of democracy as our method, respect for opinions and opposing opinions, political pluralism, the rights of women, etc. 6. To form a National Dialogue Committee made up of independent figures who enjoy the confidence and respect of all levels of our people. This committee would conduct an expanded national dialogue, including not only what are called opposition factions, but the diverse factions and groups of our people at home and abroad, with the aim of achieving a state of national harmony founded on a commitment to democratic dialogue in managing domestic relations on the Palestinian scene; respect for political pluralism and for all shades of opinion; and coordinating national efforts to build the Palestinian national entity on the basis of commitment to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
