The Estonian Association of Small Enterprises (EVEA) and the Estonian Chamber of Trade and Commerce held an emergency meeting at the end of last year to discuss reports on his possible dismissal and sent a letter to President Lennart Meri and Prime Minister saying that replacing Sildmae at the present stage of economic reform is premature and dangerous to the country. Sildmae as a competent minister has done a lot to overcome economic crisis and has launched an effective restructuring of state-owned business, the letter said. The two organisations unite over 1,500 Estonian companies. EVEA awarded Sildmae 1993 "Entrepreneur's Friend" prize. Estonian media has recently reported that Sildmae would be replaced on political grounds. Sildmae, a former member of the communist party, does not belong to any political parties.
