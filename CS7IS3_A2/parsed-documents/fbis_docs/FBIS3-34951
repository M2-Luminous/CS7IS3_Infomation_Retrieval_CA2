['Arafat] I had wished that an initial agreement would be made, as I had agreed with Mr. Peres, in the presence of my brother, Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. I had also wished that this initial agreement would be followed by a final agreement in the presence of Mr. Rabin in Cairo. We covered a considerable distance in Davos during the world economic conference, and before that in Oslo during the funeral of our friend Holst, the former Norwegian foreign minister. However, we were surprised recently by Israel's request for a further delay of one week, after the Israeli delegation received several telephone calls from Tel Aviv, under the pretext that they need more time to study the draft that is under discussion. Apparently, as has been reported by several Israeli newspapers, primarily YEDI'OT AHARONOT, the military command has an intransigent stand against the agreement. As a matter of fact, the question will become one of international responsibility rather than Palestinian responsibility. The agreement was under President Clinton's auspices at the White House and bears the signatures of the two cosponsors of the conference. There was also an international blessing of the agreement. What is happening reflects new, hard-line Israeli positions that try to demolish the very foundations of the agreement. These stands are being fabricated and are related to issues that are foreign to the agreement, in letter and spirit. International law says that the withdrawal of any occupying power from any territory means that this territory is liberated. This applies to Gaza and Jericho. The current attempts to add as many texts as possible is meant to undermine this concept in the September agreement in Washington. It is now clear, after all that has happened in Oslo, Paris, Davos, and Cairo, that there is an ongoing Israeli attempt not to honor the deadlines they have agreed to, or not to honestly implement the agreement. This is now the responsibility of the entire international community. [Shirbil] Do you feel that after the U.S.-Syrian Geneva summit, Israel is no longer interested in quick progress on the Palestinian track? ['Arafat] No. The evidence is that there was no concrete progress in the recent negotiations in Washington. Anyway, any progress on any Arab track is progress on all other tracks. [Shirbil] There has been recently more talk about differences between Rabin and Peres. ['Arafat] I do not take things at face value. The bottom line is that I am facing the Israeli government, whether it is represented by Rabin, Peres, or Baraq. [Shirbil] It is said that arms are being distributed in Gaza and elsewhere. What do you think? ['Arafat] The most serious thing about this issue is that Israeli intelligence officers, with the full knowledge of the government, are carrying out a huge arms sales in the occupied territories, as part of a malicious plan to ignite inter-Palestinian fighting after their departure. Israeli Army officers are behind the arms sales. However, I have great confidence in our people and their awareness, struggle, faith, and power. [Shirbil] This means that your taking over power in Gaza and Jericho will bring up the possibility of a confrontation with some of the population? ['Arafat] No. The issues is not that of some people. The public selling of arms, in this huge quantity, is meant to create a security problem in all of our occupied territory. I hold the cosponsors of the conference responsible for this serious action, and I have raised this question with U.S., Russian, European, and Chinese officials, since they are among the permanent members of the Security Council. [Shirbil] What will happen if Israel pursues its current approach? ['Arafat] The result is that the agreement will not be implemented. Israel, and all its supporters on the international scene -- Israel does not act without the support of some international forces -- should understand that peace is not only a Palestinian and Arab demand; it is a Palestinian, Arab, international, Israeli, U.S., and European demand. Everybody should understand that the alternative is comprehensive anarchy in the region, whose scope only God knows, and that will definitely Balkanize the region. Any Israeli or international official who supports Israel in this stand is mistaken if he believes that Israel can quietly swallow up any Arab territory. [Shirbil] Can we say the agreement is in danger? ['Arafat] There is no doubt about this. It is obvious that Israel procrastinates and tries to evade implementing it. It suffices for Rabin to announce that dates are not sacrosanct to show how false their approach to peace is. [Shirbil] Are you preparing yourself for its possible collapse? ['Arafat] I am a practical man and I do not live in dreams. Things will be tackled as they come. For every action, there is a reaction equal to it, according to engineering theories. [Shirbil] For example, resuming armed operations? ['Arafat] Not only armed operations, but there will be total confusion in the region. [Shirbil] Are there contacts with the Hamas Movement to contain any eventual deterioration? ['Arafat] Contacts are under way with all the brother officials in the factions in the Palestinian arena. [Shirbil] What about dialogue with Hamas? Are there new attempts in this respect? ['Arafat] We never suspend contacts with any Palestinian faction. [Shirbil] How do you assess the results of your visit to Saudi Arabia and your talks with King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, custodian of the two holy mosques? ['Arafat] The truth is that it was a blessed visit. Tne meeting was cordial, brotherly, and positive, as is the case when his majesty the king meets us and with all of Palestine. As you know, I used to put his majesty in the picture, whether directly through letters or indirectly, about all the details of developments in the Palestinian arena, and he supported us. This support was expressed in the statement the Saudi council of ministers issued at the end of the visit. We thank his majesty for this, particularly his stand on the question of Jerusalem and the interest he shows in this issue, toward the Palestinian cause, and the Palestinian people. I thank him from the bottom of my heart. Let us hope we will meet soon, God willing, to pray in Jerusalem. [Shirbil] From King Husayn's statement, one understands that the Jordanian authorities wish to stop speaking about the confederation issue? ['Arafat] I read this statement. Of course, for us, the issue of confederation is a political decision made by the Palestine Nationl Council [PNC] in 1983 and which it reconfirmed in every session that followed. This decision calls for a confederal union with Jordan in accordance with the voluntary and free choice of the two fraternal Jordanian and Palestinian people. This decision is binding on all the Palestinian command and all the Palestinian factions. However, at the same time, we respect and appreciate any free Jordanian option as mentioned in our PNC decision. [Shirbil] It seems that since last August Jordan and the PLO have been speaking different languages, or at least there has not been an agreement on interpretation? ['Arafat] I do agree on this specific topic. As I have said, the talk about a confederation has come within the framework of the voluntary and free choice of the two fraternal people. We do not want to impose our political decision on anyone. You surely remember that one of the decisions was made at the PNC session in Amman in 1984 and in two agreements, one of which I and his majesty the king signed in 1985, dealing with a confederation. After this came the disengagement decision that his majesty the king announced and the 1985 agreement was suspended. Then we went to Madrid as a joint delegation in accordance with a Palestinian-Jordanian agreement the two parties signed. [Shirbil] Some say you are intentionally postponing settling some matters until after you leave for Gaza and Jericho ['Arafat] Like what? [ Shirbil] The relationship with Jordan and issues concerning the Palestinian arena? ['Arafat] This is untrue. We signed two agreements with Jordan, an economic agreement and a security agreement. We signed with Egypt an economic agreement, and we are in the process of signing a security agreement. At my recent meeting with His Majesty King Husayn we agreed that the joint committees' work will continue. [Shirbil] Do you plan to visit Syria again after your recent meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad to offer condolences on the death of his son Basil? ['Arafat] I was dutybound to go to Syria to offer sympathies after his profound loss, considering the longstanding, strong relationship I have with President al-Asad. I had known the departed since he was a little boy. It is a brotherly relation between us that developed 30 years ago. May God help my brother President al-Asad to overcome this profound calamity, which is a loss for Syria, myself, and all of us. I welcome any opportunity to visit the brothers in Syria. I want to proudly note the meeting of the heads of negotiating teams in Washington as a beginning of the restoration of this cohesion to the talks. [Shirbil] Do you expect imminent progress on the Syrian-Israeli track, for example, reaching a declaration of principles? ['Arafat] It was supposed and expected that something will happen in Washington. However, according to what the brothers in Syria said, no progress was made on the Syrian track, nor on the Jordanian, Lebanese, and Palestinian tracks. This reveals the size of the maneuver by which Israel is trying to buy time. [Shirbil] The question of democracy has once again surfaced in the Palestinian arena. What is the scope of the problem? ['Arafat] The very fact that this question has surfaced in the arena gives an indication of the scope of democracy in this arena. I want to ask: Can this problem surface in other arenas with the same candor and clarity that we see in the Palestinian arena? We are democratic. We are proud that we have achieved a democracy of the jungle of rifles since the launching of the Palestinian revolution and up until now. The revolution and the people take pride in this achievement. [Shirbil] I meant charges that you have a monopoly over decisionmaking? ['Arafat] Do you know the saying: They could not find anything wrong with the rose, so they told it: You have red cheeks? I am a businessman for 18 hours a day, and I follow everything, small and important. I have been this way since the launching of the revolution. Is there anything wrong with that? I am proud, at the same time, that I do not make any decision without seeking the advice of my comrades. I also take pride in different views and criticism. I always remember the famous saying: May God have mercy on anyone who corrects [Caliph] 'Umar. I also remember Voltaire's saying: I might disagree with you, but I am willing to fight for your freedom of expression. No doubt, I am there in the serious, important, and major junctures that face our cause, people, and destiny. I am a man who does not hide. I do not bury my head in the sand. But the truth is that there has been a campaign, since we signed the agreement, by some brothers and friends and some international quarters, to try to strangle this new baby, Palestine, which is experiencing a rebirth. There are many forces against this baby and against this rebirth. This event will change the map of the Middle East. They say that we are incapable of running a state. This is one of the stupid questions that are being raised. Right from the outset, we have been a state within a revolution. Has any revolution paid as much attention as we did to education and medical services? Lebanon bears witness to this, through our hospitals and dispensaries. Has any revolution paid as much attention as we did to universities, social care, sports, and exporting agricultural products? I want to know why those questions were not asked to Mandela, Mugabe, Samora Machel, Ben Bella, and why they did not ask all the revolutionaries who liberated their countries? [Shirbil] When did you first think of peace with the Israelis? Were the first contacts with them like the ones 'Isam al-Sartawi held after obtaining your agreement? ['Arafat] Since 1974, I have been thinking of negotiations with Israel. The PNC decided to establish a national authority on any inch of land we liberated or from which Israel pulled out. In the same year, the Palestinian revolution accepted a joint Arab delegation to the Geneva talks. In 1977, we accepted the Egyptian-U.S. statement in which they proposed a joint Arab delegation, including a low-level PLO representation. We then decided to deliver our approval of Resolution No. 242 to Gromyko. I also want to recall our approval of King Fahd's initiative in Fes in 1981. 'Isam al-Sartawi won my agreement to meet with the Israelis. I was the first to meet with members of the Israeli Communist Party, Rakah, in Berlin in 1983. What is strange is that some Rakah members, like Mahmud Darwish, later became members of the PLO Executive Committee. Such meetings were regarded at that time as a crime. We were also the first to support the "Peace Now Movement" in Israel and the first to call for a democratic state in which people can coexist. You have asked me about fears regarding our current decisions and steps. I do not feel I have made a mistake. I have carried out the PNC resolutions, as well as the Palestinian peace initiative. Did we go to Madrid to dance or to make peace? [Shirbil] Did you wish you would enter Palestinian territory with a machine gun? ['Arafat] I entered it with a machine gun. The last time was in 1968. [Shirbil] How many people betrayed you and abandoned you in delicate situations? ['Arafat] Many fell in every stage of the revolution, but they were few compared to those who joined the revolution, more determined and resolute. [Shirbil] With whom had you wished that you would enter Palestinian territory? ['Arafat] I wish all martyrs had been with me, led by my brother Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir] and Abu-Iyad [Salah Khalaf] [Shirbil] When are you supposed to go to Gaza and Jericho? ['Arafat] I am supposed to go there this month, February. [Shirbil] When did you first know that the Soviet Union had ended and that you could no longer depend on it? ['Arafat] During a meeting of the socialist countries in Berlin attended by Gorbachev. I and 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni vice president and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, were also sitting at the main table. I said to al-Bid: This is not the Soviet Union we knew. What is happening is completely different. [Shirbil] What were the most difficult moments in your life, negotiating with enemies or with others? ['Arafat] Was there any moment in my life that was not difficult? I live with difficulties.
