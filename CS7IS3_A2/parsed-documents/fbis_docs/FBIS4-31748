He did not explain what "almost" meant. He also avoided replying to questions on when Russia will join the Partnership for Peace and why President Yeltsin decided not to participate in festivities marking the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising. He expressed the view that the development of Polish-Russian economic relations depends, above all, on creating a legislative basis naturally conducive to direct cooperation between companies of both countries. "Political resolve will then no longer matter," he said. Adam Struzik said the talks focused on general issues and also on concrete matters such as a future meeting of parliamentarians of the Kaliningrad oblast and Polish border regions.
