This trading point has been closed and reopened several times due to fighting in nearby parts of Cambodia. Meanwhile, a source familiar with the Cambodian border in Surin Province noted that kidnapping of Thai citizens for ransom was mostly the result of business blackmail, not hunger. The problem of Cambodian bandits robbing Thais existed long before border points were opened for trading.
