The deputy minister is apparently well-versed in the field so he knew what he was talking about. What he said was an expedient untruth. This time around, we will not devote our attention to the problem of biological warfare agents (for, at this time, the explanation of the difference between an offensive and defensive cholera is beyond our ability). We will leave that for some other time, including the military laboratories in Olesnice, as well as the equipment for the reproduction of viruses, with which the Techonin Research Institute was equipped despite the claims made by the Defense Ministry officials calming down the public. After all, it was from here that the Bulgarian, Romanian, GDR, and Russian experts -- who used to work here -- withdrew their research and documentation. So, that is one group of expedient untruths. Let us, however, devote ourselves to the Klinlab Co., a company that operates in the building of the Military Hospital in [Prague-]Stresovice. It was precisely in the facility leased to Klinlab that the bank of "completely common viruses" was located that was destroyed on Defense Minister Baudys' order under extraordinary security measures. First, already in 1992, expensive foreign-made equipment was bought for the Central Military Health Institution -- a laboratory glass washer, for instance, or an automatic analyzer -- just to guarantee a good future for the Central Military Hospital [UVN]. The purchases were made by the deputy chief of the Central Military Health Institution (UVZU), Dr. Moravek. The justification was that the UVZU would produce and market hygienically pure water for commercial purposes. Shortly thereafter, however, a questionnaire was circulated among the employees of this institution recruiting "experts" for the future private laboratory institute called Klinlab. The questionnaire was then used to justify (the people want it) the establishment of Klinlab. This company assumed, however, only the profit-making or profit promising part of the UVZU. Under the auspices of Economics Deputy Minister Kalousek, the company was authorized to manage the six-floor facility in the UVN by a contract dated 10 September 1993 and signed with the Army for Klinlab by no one else but Dr. Moravek, still an officer on active duty. He signed as the executive secretary of a company that had not yet been founded, much less registered. This violates a good number of laws and regulations -- including the defense minister's order No. 9 of 11 February 1993. Only a month after the signing of the lease (which leaves the owner with the obligations of the owner, including construction alterations), on 11 October 1993, the Klinlab company contract was signed, and only on 23 October 1993 is Klinlab entered on the company register. In a state governed by rule of law, the contract would certainly be invalid. In a state governed by rule of law, the people signing such contracts would be considered cheats. Furthermore, Dr. Moravek and all the other officers from the Klinlab Ltd. who signed the contract brazenly violated Law 143/1992 in its Article 3, Section 4 of the government instruction, according to which they are paid their salary with a 25 percent bonus provided they do not engage in business but only serve in the Army! The Klinlab lease contract (let us assume that the same ministerial office is responsible for its organization, which refused other privatization projects, including one from Canada) rents the relevant part of the UVN for 720,123 korunas annually to the, of course, not yet existing legal entity, and the money was then lent to them interest-free for a fixed term, i.e., until the purchase contract is signed. All that happens on 1 December 1993. Material and supplies worth dozens of millions is passed onto Klinlab without inventory, and when an inventory is taken of the furniture and equipment, it is calculated at write-off prices. Regarding the laboratory equipment valued at approximately 30 million korunas, then, Klinlab chooses what it needs and purchases (until the date of the purchase contract it will use it free of charge) the equipment at a later date. So, this is the expedient lie about Engineer Kalousek of which we are guilty. The military equipment that was profitable for the Army, including the equipment purchased for taxpayer's money, will pass into private hands. The money-losing equipment will be kept by the Army. Of course, some soldiers wanted to object. That was an ill- advised idea. After all, the appropriate commission investigated it. Even Colonel Krizenecky put his iron in the fire, and so did Military Prosecutor Dr. Novak. The same one who was investigating but never concluded the investigation of the activities of another man of the Kalousek-type at the Defense Ministry, the current director of the Nase Vojsko [Our Army] publishing house, Jakub Cisar -- of course, that was still in the Orbis publishing house. We will reach the stage of socialism in our country, we will be successful in defending the peace, and we will thwart the iniquitous activities of traitors, and so on along the arduous path towards a better tomorrow. The officers will get paid (by us, friends) for not engaging in business. They conduct business (with our money). Are we to believe that the sale of microbes, eventually to be thrown into a synagogue as an example, presents a problem for such enterprising entrepreneurs?
