Such a person would be forced to observe clearly the difficulty of extricating ourselves from a crisis which embraces every area of the life of our young nation. Those with power in their hands, instead of struggling heroically against the dangerous problems hanging over our heads, stick their heads in the creeping sand dunes and give themselves to sweet political dreams, thereby resembling amorous prairie hens seeking to comfort each other. They are like some seer prophesying in advance that there must be disaster. It is no wonder that the very worst projections become reality these days. However, it is still not easy to agree with the statement that there are no energies being expended on well-thought-out and creative efforts, capable of depriving us of the [vain] hopes we are so fond of due to peculiarities of human nature, and of turning back the dangerous flow of events in our society. These efforts should be aimed at ordinary people with the intent of removing them from indolence and awakening them from the present state which saps strength and ardor. One of the fires of hope, glowing in the hearts of the people, is the fact that there is no doubt about the activism of the political structures. They should be capable of taking upon their own shoulders responsibility for the fate of a nation, which has lost its potential for happiness, and for the fate of a worn out people. Only those who are not endeavoring to take power into their hands solely for the sake of power will achieve victory. All of this is going on under very complex circumstances. There is unprecedented economic crisis. The people are becoming impoverished. General social dejection and desperation is growing. The government is incapable of ruling the country. There is a cold wind of a bloody future civil war in Russia. There is the unabashed arrogance in that country's relations with us. Separatist notions are on the rise in some regions. Relations are tense to a considerable degree among representatives of executive and legislative authority. Also... the season for new elections to parliament is here. Before reviewing the shape of politics in the Republic, it would seem proper to explain our terminology. Indeed, according to the "traditional" explanation, there are revolutionaries on the left, reformists, i.e., centrists, and conservatives on the right. However, under our present conditions these definitions do not in fact correspond to the real state of affairs. (Since it would take a great deal of time to prove this I will let it go.) We should define the terms as follows: the "leftists" are those supporting an emphasis on returning to their political heritage of only a short time ago; the "rightists" support nationalist movements and traditions; the "centrists" support reforms and a consensus of the entire people. The fact is that we should forget this division as a given. However, lacking such a set division, we should remember that it will be extremely difficult to classify political movements. Thus we divide all the political structures in Kazakhstan into the following groupings: 1) socialists, i.e., the Socialist Party (QSP [Qazaqstan Sotsialistik Partiya]), the Social Democratic Party (QSDP [Qazaqstan Sotsial-Demokratiyalyq Partiya]), the Communist Party (QKP [Qazaqstan Kommunistik Partiya]), and neocommunist organizations, i.e., the local Branch of the All-Union Communist Party (BK[b]P), the Communist Union (in Qaraghandy City), and others; 2) centrists, i.e., the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union (QKhBO [Qazaqstan Khalyq Birligi Odaghy]), the People's Congress (QKhK [Qazaqstan Khalyq Kongresi]), the Democratic Progress Party (QDPP [Qazaqstan Demokratiyalyq Progress Partiyasy]), the recently formed Party for the Development of Rights (QQDP [Qazaqstan Quqyqtyq Damu Partiyasy]), and others; 3) rightists, i.e., the National Democratic Party, the Civil "Azat" Movement, the Republican Party (QRP [Qazaqstan Respubliqalyq Partiya]), the "Alash" National Liberation Party (secret movement), the Kazachestvo Movement, and others; 4) among the social and environmental movements there are mixed groups formed by the Almaty Workers Movement, the Farmers' Party, and the "Tabighat [Nature]" Party for Justice and the Flourishing of the Environment. There is no doubt that other structures, centers such as the Independent Labor Union Center, the Federation of Labor Unions, trade unions belonging to individual independent sector industries, and national and cultural centers and societies have a certain degree of influence on the political atmosphere of the republic. Four parties and movements merit special mention due to their particular weight today among varied parties, movements, and sects. They are: the Kazakhstan Socialist Party, the Kazakhstan Peoples Congress, the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union, and the Civil "Azat" Movement. Let us now look at the kind of potentialities each of them has. I. Kazakhstan Socialist Party The Kazakhstan Socialist Party is the party of persons, weary of taking responsibility for crimes committed by others on their shoulders. The last congress of the Communist Party and the First Congress of the Socialist Party took place in September of 1991. Since that time it has been forced to do a great deal of searching in order to find its political way in new circumstances. Thereby, the party strives to maintain a social-reformist direction and to be true to the socialist heritage. In the end, this party has made known that it supports democracy, a market economy, the independence of Kazakhstan, and social protection of the people. At the same time the party has made known that it is not against the closest possible integration within the framework of the CIS, even the establishment of confederative relations and the formation of structures that are extra-national. The total number of Socialists (according to information from the Ministry of Justice dated 17 July, 1993) is 47,240 persons, and there were 1,586 primary party organizations as of December, 1992. The party has a special apparatus formed from a very fine organizational structure, and officials experienced in activism. However, since Nursultan Nazarbayev publicly announced his support for the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union, there has been much uncertainty among the ranks of members, among which are activist members. There has been observed a trend among them to pass over to the party of the president. Hitherto, the Kazakhstan Socialist Party has supported the policies of the government. However, now the criticism of the government has begun to grow gradually. They have said that it is carrying out its regular policies poorly, that it does not understand reform models correctly, and that it is growing apart from the people. This party did not take part in the "round table" held in the capital. The reason, as the party made clear, is that a "round table" is a poor way for creating solidarity among the parties. However, the real reason was the cool relationships among the leading figures of the party. At present this party is distancing itself from its former policies, and has begun to seek new slogans and new methods of work. However, when these efforts expose socialist ideology itself, they are no easy thing. The first issue of the newspaper RESPUBLIKA has appeared. Set forth there, on the eve of the election campaign, are party tactics and a draft of the basic platform of the Socialist Party. The success of the party will now depend to a considerable degree on how they are able to put these tactics into practice. It would seem that the attitude of the chairman of the Kazakhstan Socialist Party, Anwar Alimzhanov, favoring, more or less, the need to closely follow the party line and to hold the reins as tight as possible in a time of consolidation, is not entirely suited to these times. For that reason, criticism of him has intensified even from among those closest to him. At present it is difficult to say exactly what the fate of the party will be, and how much success it will gain in the struggle to elect deputies. However, if we remember the social circumstances of a people in a very difficult state and the strengthening of the longing for the past socialist way of life, this party cannot be disregarded. Under certain circumstances it would not be surprising if its influence increased radically. At present the Kazakhstan Socialist Party needs a powerful and bold leader who will be able to mobilize the ranks of the party closely around him, and who will know how to unify all the leftist movements. If this need is met, the party could become a very powerful political force. II. The Kazakhstan People's Unity Union The Kazakhstan People's Unity Union appeared on the Republic political scene after the proclamation of the Announcement of the 34 on 5 February, 1993. Those individuals, stirring things up at various levels, have in general begun to become members. For that reason the opponents of this party have referred to it as a "nomenclatura" party or a "government party." The party's abbreviated name, QXBO, is understood as "Kazakhstan Union of Rich Members of the Nomenclatura." However, the organizers of the Union have begun to show that those who say this are not correct. This is because the persons signing the Announcement of the 34 were representatives of the broad ranks of the Kazakh intelligentsia, and there are many young representatives among them. Likewise, we think the fact that Serik Abdirakhmanov, chosen chairman of the Political Kenges of the Union, has begun criticism of the establishment will make possible the repulse of whatever the pronouncement [of criticism] we lay on. The Union has a policy line of centrist character. However, the members of the People's Congress Party claim that the ideas of the Union were stolen from them. It is difficult to say now how just this accusation against the party is. However, it cannot be denied that the platforms of the two parties have a certain similarity. At the same time it must be admitted that, in general terms, the centrist views of the party are different in their universality. On top of that it is a known fact that Nursultan Nazarbayev has for some time given his blessing to the ideas of the Union. This gave Nazarbayev the opportunity to have his own political philosophies carried out in the hands of S. Abdirakhmanov without the latter making any reference to himself. In fact Abdirakhmanov had become the owner of a powerful political organization that has relied on the employment of higher political groups. A large fund called "Yelim-ay" has been established and the mass media, according to instructions sent down from above, widely propagandized the Union he headed. However, the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union has been unable to be a purely mass or an authoritative organization. It does not know how to use its potentialities efficiently. For that reason, a resolution has been enacted on the eve of the parliamentary elections regarding a change in party leadership. Vice-Premier Qwanysh Sultanov, a well-known politician, was chosen in place of Abdirakhmanov. At the same time, a great event took place in the history of the Union. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had hitherto stood as an experienced wise man between the Kazakhstan People's Congress and the Union, not turning "to the right or to the left," now moved somewhat to the right, and made the decision to make known the conditions under which he would become the public leader of the party. These two events would have shaken things up in other parties or movements. Some made known the criticism that "we have gotten the president interested by scaring his side." They began to scold Nursultan Nazarbayev for having missed the paternal truth offered to all their political children. Dashing cold water on the subject was the question to Qwanysh Sultanov: "how is it proper to combine an appointment in the government with a party office?" The debate: "is the Union a party or is it not a party" again gained ground. However, it is clear to any person with vision that such a change had to take place sooner or later. This is because it is well known that Nursultan Nazarbayev could not continue to remain his own man indefinitely. He is the kind of man, in fact, needed by a party. At the same time, he now needs a party faithfully devoted to himself. Likewise, he needs a powerful political party to defend his interests against the establishments. There is a great deal of dispute about the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union, but it is a political union with more than 70,000 persons in its ranks, and it has branches in almost every oblast of the republic. We should not worry so much about the identity of the party. For this above all results will be important. In connection with the appearance of a new party chief and a new party official leader, the role played by the Union in republic political life has changed considerably, something which is in any case well known. Qwanysh Sultanov is full of energy; he is intelligent and competent, shrewd, and a politician who is painstaking in what he does. He knows well the rules of the political events taking place within the scope of the republic and the secrets of responsible internal politics. There was a reason why he was chosen Union party chief. If we bear in mind the well-known disputes about his election among the higher political leaders, and especially among the branches of government power, we understand that the confidence placed in him is extremely great. At present Qwanysh Sultanov is completely involved in party work, and is devoting his efforts to establishing very good order there quickly and, to reestablishing in the shortest possible time the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union as a resourceful and clearly-defined party in contrast to its present careless state. However, in connection with his own political biography, Sultanov has a reputation for shrewdness and strives to "measure seven times and cut once." He is not going to recreate the ship of the party, and he is not going to change the party command all that greatly. He, fundamentally, will work with the material he has in hand. For that reason he is striving as quickly as possible to gain control of all vacancies under the influence of the organizational nomenklatura in his administration. However, it will not be so easy to exert a positive influence in other areas. Nonetheless, under circumstances where the Union plays the role of party No. 1, he will be able to increase hopes through his own influence. There are experienced units of people playing an activist role in the ranks of the party. At present it has a sufficient number of powerful leaders. However, there is a need for clever people who have the oratory skilld to bring the broad masses of the people to the side of the party quickly, who communicate, and who have gained special [public] exposure. III. Kazakhstan People's Congress The Kazakhstan People's Congress Party, which thinks of itself as a centrist, liberal-democratic party, is, more or less, the most active party among all the other political parties at present. It has taken upon itself the role of opposition and of criticism of the government. We know that its goals are the establishment of a democratic society and a unitary state based on law. The Kazakhstan People's Congress thinks of itself as a narcissistic party of the elder intelligentsia. For that reason its platform is directed at the creative intellectual community and professional groups. Due to the reputation of the party's leader, Olzhas Suleymenov, and the party's newspaper NARODNYY KONGRESS (very high quality, published in the Kazakh and Russian languages), its influence has been increased considerably. According to the ideas of the leaders of the party, the party now has nearly 30,000 members. In addition to this, those controlling the "Nevada-Semey" Movement carry out the orders of the party exactly. The Kazakhstan People's Congress Party also has many problems. The largest problem is how to keep in the party Komsomolist and national groups, once the second largest part of the party's membership, after the departure from its ranks of those supporting Mukhtar Shakhanov. Within party ranks there have been, sometimes quite openly, continual squabbles about questions of party tactics and strategy, regarding questions on confederation with Russia, and methods of administration of the party apparatus. However, the group in control of the party is aware of its deficiencies. There was very open discussion of this in the Kazakhstan People's Congress Party Plenum which took place this year at the beginning of October. There was discussion about the weakness of the party's administration, the slack connection between the party administration and the oblast organizations of the party, and the need to draw women and young people broadly into the party... It is well known that the "round table" of political movements was organized under the leadership of the Kazakhstan People's Congress Party. For that meeting the party organ strove to carry out the role of conciliator and of advisor. It was observed that it was not unpleasant for the Kazakhstan People's Congress Party to play that leading role. Thus, the party strove to exercise its influence. However such efforts will not always be lucky. This is because it is a fact that each of the parties participating in the "round table" has its own narrow interests. Then the party has overcome the deficiencies obvious to its own eyes, when it has been able to mobilize its own members to obligatory hard labor, when it has discovered how to place the interests of society above the greed of individuals, it is possible that the Kazakhstan People's Congress Party will achieve considerable power, and will become the No. 2 party. The party has powerful leaders, and there are quite a number of party stalwarts well known to the people. A research center with its own special character is operating and is capable of playing an important role in the formation of party strategy and tactics. However, the work of the party apparatus is insufficiently experienced. Bearing in mind the great role played by party leader Olzhas Suleymenov in the party, it would be proper to discuss him separately. In addition, just now various things are being said about him. It is difficult to find anyone who doubts that Olzhas Suleymenov has made a major contribution to Kazakh culture. However, when we come to his political work, opinions are at odds with one another. Some people think of him as a pure prophet who has set forth the single correct path leading his people to happiness. Others believe that he has sold out national interests to save his own hide. It is not easy here to make clear which view is the correct one. This is because the issue is not only in terms of the political meaning of these questions, but also in terms of their psychological meaning. Olzhas Suleymenov, thanks to his powerful gifts, has gotten used to being measured by all-Union standards and Kazakhstan is too small an arena for him. For that reason he needs the expanses of Eurasia. In this regard his desire is right for himself. Each must find his own way. God forbid, but, if our culture remains in isolation, those making the laws in the area of cultural tradition will be a monotonous color of gray, and will be feeble spirits compelling and casting down all things which do not accord with their narrow interests. The sun of Kazakh culture will sink. However, looked at from another perspective, it is well known that contemporary authors such as Thomas Mann, Bernard Shaw, (and I have not forgotten than ethnically he was Irish), Albert Camus, William Golding, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Julio Cortazar, and others raised themselves from a purely ethnic basis to a world orbit. For that reason political boundaries must set no barriers to the free exchange of culture. In any case, we cannot exonerate most of the opponents of O. Suleymenov. They have even gone so far as to use very crude vocabulary. However, Suleymenov does not lag behind them in this regard. That is to say, he paints all of those he does not agree with in uniform black. Did he not say: "To be sure there are among them (his opponents, the author) some honorable men. True patriots are encountered, but are they all, every one of them, stupid?" This weakens his argument completely. The lack of amiability under just such circumstances is a scrooge sinking into our social soul, and is a restraint for democracy, and a huge, well-established barrier along the road to our desired happiness. [27 Oct p 2] [Text] "Azat" In June of 1992 Mikhail Yesenaliyev, former leader of the Civil "Azat" Movement, made a considerable effort to turn the various currents of the national-democratic movement into a single, common channel, and to unify them into a single huge force. However, nothing came from his efforts. Moreover, at the time that M. Yesenaliyev realized that his suggestion and effort were not going to be supported, he gave up hope of being able to mobilize the potentialities of this movement, and he gradually laid down foundations separate from the movement. This was a categoric, resolute, and principled step. With the departure of M. Yesenaliyev, internal arguments, disputes, and slander openly gained ground within the nationalist camp. However, during October of the same year, after the departure of M. Yesenaliyev, somehow the Civil "Azat" Movement, the Kazakhstan Republican Party, and the Kazakhstan National-Democratic "Zheltoqsan" Party were successful in their effort to achieve unity. However, the effort has not accomplished anything. There are a number of reasons for this. In fact, there was a lack of unanimity in strategy and tactics for action and in the means for carrying on a political struggle. Views on state structure, democracy, and internal party democracy were varied. This by and large happened in connection with the individual self-interests of the chiefs of each of the parties. After this congress called for unity, the young leaders made Kamal Ormantay chairman of the United "Azat" Party in place of the candidature of S. Aqatay, chairman of the Kazakhstan Republic Party. They got excited and blamed Aqatay for trying to cast the blame on them for the self-interest of the aims advanced. S. Aqatay, who was unable to gain election to the united party administration, was forced to walk out of the congress. Shortly after that he called his own congress. At present he has announced that only the decisions of this congress have legal force. At the same time, as often happens in politics, he was unable to attain his initial goals. Two years have now passed since then and "Azat," as of October of this year, is divided into three parts: the Kazakhstan Civil "Azat" Movement, the People's Democratic Party, and the Kazakhstan Republican Party, headed separately by Khasen Qozha-Akmet, Kamal Ormantay, and by Sabetqazy Aqatay. Looking at the present situation, there is nothing that will put a halt to their bickering. It is difficult to foresee in advance how it will end. The group has its own newspaper called AZAT. All in all, the paper carries out its own independent politics. However, it cannot be hidden that it is in sympathy with the young leaders. There is no doubt that they argue with one another and that there is a principled disagreement which they will not be able to reconcile. At the same time, it is also not difficult to understand that behind their heated words lie their individual self-interests. All in all, the national democratic movement wishes to criticize the policies being carried out by the Nazarbayev government in many areas including giving up nuclear weapons, its cadre policy, government policy towards Russia (in this case they are showing no sympathy for the idea suggested by Olzhas Suleymenov of confederation with Russia), allowing the living standards of the Kazakhs to decline, allowing the state of the Kazakh language to remain in an inadequate state up to the present. However, at present there is still no tested body of socio-economic-political policies offered by the movement capable of getting Kazakhstan out of its present crisis. If the "Azat" national-democratic movement, having overcome its internal conflicts, finds a powerful leader capable of putting every thing together, and if they draw up a unified, tried and true platform, and if they renew the slogans which are the order of the day, and if they are able to draw intellectuals over to their side, it would then be possible for them to achieve considerable success. Structures Which May Turn Into Parties We have investigated the possibilities of only the very large parties and movements. However, whatever the state of these other political structures, it is uncertain, given present conditions, that they will be able to compete with the parties mentioned above. It is possible that in this area only the labor movement is special in any way. In truth there are many parties, but they have no real potentiality. It would be no surprise if a "Slavic Party" were to emerge through combining the interethnic "Yedinstvo" Movement, the "Lad" Slavic Movement, and separatist movements in the north and east of the Republic. If this were to happen such a party would have considerable political power, and there would be the need to take it into consideration. There is not a little talk about the possibility of professional groups forming a party. As the election campaign gets nearer, it is well known that political activity will strengthen, that each party will examine more or less completely its specific possibilities, and that all will endeavor to take whatever actions they need to strengthen their ranks. A confused struggle will be waged openly by the parties to draw over to their side figures with strong organizational powers, orators, the communicators, talented crafters of words, and activist citizens who are widely known. Under such conditions, the success of a party will depend upon many factors. As we have noted, factors such as the capacity of the party command to act in complete unity, the resourcefulness of party leaders, finances, access to the mass media, above all the television channels, the ability to select good candidates for parliament, a good election platform, the power to influence in all regions, proper determination of the real point of view of the president and the psychological state of the electorate, and, based upon this, the ability of party propaganda to strike the right note play a very great role. At present it is difficult to foresee what parties will gain seats in the new parliament. A great deal is connected with the conditions under which the elections will take place, what kind of election laws there will be, and how the law is observed. In this connection, it is altogether possible that the elections will be carried out ahead of schedule in connection with certain tactical circumstances. One thing is very clear: if the elections are carried out according to a proportional [representation] system, the paucity of parties will find its clear expression. Under such conditions, it would be no surprise if 10 percent of the body of deputies were to be comprised of representatives of newly rich. This is because they are making every intentional preparation for the impending elections. (We are not taking into account here those who will end up somewhere after the elections.) Close to 10 percent of the deputies may be comprised of strugglers to protect local interests, and five percent may be comprised of independents and of representatives of small parties. All of these categories will account for about one-fourth of all the deputies. The remaining three-fourths, more or less, will be divided among the four great parties. However, if prior to the elections parliamentary parties appear which are not included among the four, it is possible that the division might be between five parties. Without doubt the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union will receive the largest vote. However, it is doubtful if it will achieve an absolute majority. For that reason it will have to seek coalition partners for itself from the onset. A wing of the Kazakhstan People's Congress will be in second place, more or less, in terms of numbers of deputies. (If this is so, under conditions whereby the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union and the Kazakhstan People's Congress maintain their alliance, they will have an absolute majority). However, the Socialists, and the "Azat" people (under conditions whereby they continue to unify their efforts) will be in third and fourth place. It is possible that after the new elections a certain portion of the deputies will look to various interests. That is to say, they will be for a time members of a given party, but at the same time it is possible that they will defend regional interests or that they will develop an interest in some industry or even in the wealth of financial capital and will go over to these causes. (However, if the majority system for the elections undergoes considerable change in time, and the small parties are not able to send their representatives to parliament, then it may happen that the body of deputies will be comprised of only the four large parties). Thus, when the new parliament takes office, it is clear that many factions will be represented there. New relationships based upon principle will be established among them, and the power of such factions will depend not only upon the number of deputies elected supporting them, but, at the same time, upon the prestige and skill of the individual deputies. Whether or not the task of the new parliament will be to form a Cabinet of Ministers capable of bringing our nation our of anarchy and the confusion of rampant crisis, only time will tell. From the Editor We are in a new era for the development of social thought and views in the Republic. The task assigned in this era to political parties and movements, to other social organizations and associations striving to be involved intimately in social life and livelihood, is a heavy one. It is clear in particular that the weight of the these tasks is becoming considerably heavier in the present time of "a narrow road and a slippery street," when the Kazakhstan state is wracking its brain looking for a way out of the pressing difficulties of a complex time and of the quagmire of economic crisis. It is the duty of us all to shape the school constituted by a free, highly sophisticated political parliament which will operate on a new kind of parliamentary model. It will be the political parliament of a free Kazakhstan, which has raised the flag of independence, gained membership in the United Nations Organization, ratified a constitution, and joined the ranks of civilized nations. The methods which we have hitherto expressed, the very great test of our established form of government will produce an outcome in half a year at the time of the elections to the Supreme Kenges of the Republic of Kazakhstan. In whose hands will the reins of political leadership be in the new, specialized parliament? Also, what political parties will carry the burden of the trust of the people and its heritage, and how and in what ways will they be raised to the level of an honored foundation for tomorrow. Who will pay tomorrow's debts? And how will they be paid? The citizens of Kazakhstan, raised to a new level of social development, cannot remain apart from questions concerning the fate of such a nation. This is because the fate of our sovereign people is in the balance. In this circumstance, we think that the pledge which the people will give to the political parties, and the tasks of the times begin with today. It is to be expected that this article offered to readers could have said too much in some places and too little in others. It is not easy to share the latest views on a rich political arena of such broad scope. Large and small events in the backs and forths of our history and the various difficult times which we have suffered show that these views are right. The editors have no intention of supporting any party or any known stalwart. Likewise, it has no intention of offending any party or stalwart. Our greatest goal, growing out of the interests of the people, is to touch briefly on the inner preparation and potentialities of the political forces exhausting us all on the eve of a projecting "national event."
