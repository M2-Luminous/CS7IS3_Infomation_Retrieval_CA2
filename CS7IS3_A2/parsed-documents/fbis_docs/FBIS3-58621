In the "inevitable" struggle that will ensue, Chirac enjoys two important advantages, says Reinhard. He can count on a devoted political apparatus and, unlike a Balladur busy with day-to-day problems and bound by his own promise to postpone the opening of the presidential debate, he enjoys greater freedom of movement. For his part, Balladur does not lack trump cards, Reinhard continues. The prime minister is already considered a candidate by a number of political personalities of the parliamentary majority and enjoys popular support, as indicated in a series of polls. However, the outcome of a race is undecided, Reinhard points out. Both men must take into account those who prefer to wait--like Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe--and those "lurking in the background," such as Union for French Democracy (UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who hopes that a Chirac-Balladur confrontation will open a "window of opportunity" for himself.
