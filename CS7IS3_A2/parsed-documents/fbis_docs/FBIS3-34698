Needless to say, the move means Egypt's withdrawal from the economic and political alliance with Jordan, Yemen and Iraq. It is true that the council, formed at the height of political coordination and cooperation among the four member states, went into limbo after the August 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and reviving it now does not look an easy task, given the state of isolation Iraq is finding itself in. But it is equally tragic that one of its members found it fit to quit the alliance for whatever reason at a time when the shifting regional and international patterns underline the importance of regional blocs in the developing world to get a better deal from the developed world. Launched as an ambitious grouping to gain the benefit from a collective impact of the material and human resources of the four countries while dealing with the outside world, the ACC got off to a good start and was holding out promises of fruits of sincere cooperation and coordination when the Gulf crisis struck it down. Going into apportioning blame for the tragedy that befell the Arab world is a futile, academic exercise and will not serve any useful purpose and will only open old wounds. But, in a wider perspective, the Egyptian decision to quit the ACC raises another serious and grave question: Does it mean that Cairo has given up hopes that Iraq would be rehabilitated into mainstream Arab and international politics? The reality that cannot be waived aside with any gesture, political or economic, is that Iraq and its 18 million people are a part and parcel of the Arab Nation. Indeed, Jordan's concern had always been and remains to be an anxiety to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people. Regardless of whatever anybody had said or has or will say about it, the Jordanian stand remains firm that Arab and international efforts should seek to help the people of Iraq to survive the national catastrophe that has befallen them and eventually their country should reassume the rightful role it has always played in Arab politics and economics. The process might take some time, but the wounds have to be healed and Iraq has to be and will be brought back into the regional and international mainstream. And when that happens, we, the countries of the region, Jordan, Egypt, Yemen and others included, would still be facing the same equation: Blocs vs. states in a world of cutthroat economic policies and markets against which we have to defend ourselves and protect our interests, something better served if done collectively.
