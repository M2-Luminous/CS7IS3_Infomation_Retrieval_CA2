In an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE on Friday [7 January], Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl said: "The leading bodies of the CDU -- the party executive committee and the presidium -- at their first session after the Christmas recess, scheduled for next Friday and Saturday will also discuss the issue of the nomination of the candidate for the office of federal president and make a decision; in addition, we will stick to what I announced before, namely that we will also discuss the matter with our coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]." Yet, such talks have obviously not yet been scheduled for the next few days. For Kohl, the talks of the Western alliance scheduled for Monday and Tuesday in Brussels have priority. Kohl said: "When we discuss European security within NATO in the next few days, we will try to combine two important objectives." Kohl said that as a first objective, the justified security needs of Germany's Eastern neighbors have to be "taken very seriously." The chancellor stated: "If we, as the NATO document says, offer `Partnership for Peace' to our neighbors, such as Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, then, to me, that means that this is not a mere diplomatic formula, but that we are providing clear prospects for future NATO entry." In connection with security policy, Kohl then switched from NATO to the European Union [EU]: "This includes that I am absolutely in favor of EU membership for these countries once they fulfill the economic conditions." According to Kohl, the second objective, which Germany will pursue at the NATO meeting, is: "I am in favor of NATO extending and shaping security relations with Russia to a close level to dispel from the very beginning fears that can be heard in Moscow -- namely that the West was pursuing a policy of isolation toward Russia." Without actually mentioning the name of the nationalist politician Zhirinovskiy, Kohl said: "The shrill extremist noises one can hear in Moscow these days must not be ignored; however, they must not dissuade us from continuing our course. On the contrary, they are an additional reason to maintain the close relations with particular care." The dramatic development after the collapse of the Soviet Union does not only offer the chance for building a law-governed democratic system on the basis of the market economy but also dangers. One can now see that nationalism and imperial claims may increase. Kohl concluded: "I clearly support President Yeltsin's policy of reform and I expect that in the process of establishing a democratic system, a relapse into old thinking can be warded off." For 1994, it is important for Germany to be ready to acknowledge the dramatic changes in the world. Kohl said that Bismarck's statement was still valid -- that is, that a nation's fate is determined by foreign policy. Kohl criticized widespread provincial thinking in Germany when the situation in Germany requires "us to recognize again the outstanding importance of foreign policy." Kohl said that he saw it as one of his greatest achievements that it was possible to reduce, at least in part, distrust, which was noticeable in connection with German unification in 1989 and 1990 in the East and the West. "I am proud that relations with the United States, France, and Russia are very good." At the moment, political unification of Europe is more important than ever. Too many people are looking at Europe only under economic aspects. It is true that Germany's economic development depended on its integration in economic and monetary union, but "even more important for us is to understand that 48 years of peace for Germany are not a matter of course; the question of European unification is ultimately the question of war and peace in the 21st century." The experience in the former Yugoslavia shows that the evil spirits of chauvinism, religious hatred, and nationalism are "not dead": "No one should think that they could not be resurrected in other parts of Europe." European unification, however, offers the strongest bulwark. The Germans and the Europeans must not indulge in self-contemplation. The development of North-South relations are dramatic. Kohl said: "For me, it is of particular importance to look at the economic and political development in Asia with more attention than in the past." He said that he was trying to intensify relations with China, Japan, India, and Indonesia. Economically, 1993 was a particularly difficult year for Germany. "Recession has mercilessly laid bare our structural weaknesses." Deficiencies of the past decades have been clearly exposed. Securing Germany's future requires a process of rethinking in all areas: "As an export nation, we have become too expensive due to our high wage level." Yet, the difficulties cannot only be blamed on the high wage level. Germany has lost ground as far as translating research results into new products and tapping new export markets are concerned. Prospects for 1994 The parties, the business community, and the trade unions are all to blame for the deficiencies. However, there are now "many favorable prospects" indicating that in 1994, "we will be able to stop the negative trend." In his assessment of the situation, Kohl referred to the recovery of the economy in the United States and other countries. The stock exchange was also optimistic. "We have good chances of clearly forcing the inflation rate under 4 percent again." Yet, despite the fact that there was more light at the end of the tunnel, the necessary development at the labor market will follow only with much delay. Therefore, the struggle against unemployment and the creation of new jobs are the most important objective. Kohl said: "Unemployment is not a matter of statistical figures for me. First of all, I see the fate of the affected people and families." He was hoping that in the upcoming wage talks, both sides of industry were taking the stabilization of the labor market into consideration: "Safe jobs must have priority over wage increases." Kohl added: "The state must set reasonable signals in the public service sphere as well." He considers it important for all parties involved to respond to the challenges of the labor market with the necessary sincerity and with new ideas. As one example, Kohl endorsed part-time jobs. By European standards, Germany was offering the lowest number of part-time jobs, only 15 percent. If it were possible to raise the number of part-time jobs to the level of the Netherlands (34 percent), as many as 2 million people could find employment in Germany. Surveys in the old laender have shown that some 2 million fully employed people would be willing to work fewer hours. Head Wind and Fear Kohl claimed that last year, the Federal Government made considerable achievements for securing the future with its contribution to the conclusion of the GATT talks: "As a result of the GATT agreement, Germany will make up to 50 billion German marks [DM] in prosperity profits." Considerable improvement in the sphere of housing construction has been achieved: "In western Germany, 400,000 new apartments were built in 1993, more than the record number of 1977; in eastern Germany, the number of construction licenses doubled over 1992." Despite such success, the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the coalition have to struggle with a head wind. Nevertheless, what the people really think is more favorable than the picture that is generally presented. In all Western countries and Germany, one can see that many people are unable to cope with the dramatic changes. The rapid succession of images and events has contributed to a feeling of insecurity: "Existential fears have increased." In the election year, people might be "greatly enticed to use this fear for political profits." The loss of faith as a result of the major secularization step has created fear. The request to the moral force of the churches for a consensus of values has become more important. "Qualities that were ridiculed during many years by left-wing forces as secondary virtues are now more important than ever: compassion, solidarity, a sense of reality, courage, hard work, and loyalty." One will be unable to overcome economic difficulties without reflecting on these values and foundations. We must stop thinking only about our well-acquired rights: "Insisting on the status quo will not take us any further." The question is not to reduce but to rebuild our social system. Hard work must be worth the effort again. The stability of the currency must have priority. That means: "We must maintain a very tight public budget." Responsibility lies first of all with the politicians: "I personally acknowledge that." However, the politicians cannot achieve everything by themselves: "In no way can I accept a trend where people retire into their privileged positions in society and shirk their responsibilities." Cooperation between all members of society is necessary and the sense for the commonwealth must be developed. Despite all the problems, there is no reason to be pessimistic. Compared to the difficulties of other countries, I cannot understand the lamentation and obsession with complaining in this country: "I also want to make this issue a topic in my election campaign." The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] was avoiding a discussion on facts and indulges in populism. In decisive questions of German unity, the SPD used to bank on the principle of opportunism. Kohl said: Of course, we have not only made many important decisions but also mistakes; still, considering the criticism voiced by the SPD, I am astonished over the impertinence of those who had long since given up and betrayed the idea of German unity, and who even wanted, for example, to accept Honecker's demand for recognizing a separate GDR citizenship, and who wanted to dissolve the central office at Salzgitter that registered law infringements by the GDR judicial authorities." With a view to the challenges of the 1994 election year for the CDU/CSU and himself, Chancellor Kohl said: "I want the coalition between the CDU/CSU and the FDP to continue." Kohl was determined: "We must fight for every single vote and approach the voters. We must mobilize our voters and offer a clear alternative to the SPD, which means that to secure the future of our country, we must change our way of thinking and support the necessary, albeit at times unpopular, measures with great resolve and represent our better arguments." Then, I think we will stand "a good chance" in the election.
