FBIS3-28006 "dreas022_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-022 Document Type:Daily Report 2 Feb 1994 South Korea Press Reacts to 31 Jan DPRK Ministry Statement SK0202060494 SK0202060494 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of reports published in Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 2 February analyzing the statement by a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman denouncing the United States for `reversing' the DPRK-U.S. agreement for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article by reporter An Hui-chang, entitled "Background of the Statement on Reviewing the Withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT." Noting that U.S.-North Korean nuclear negotiations have entered "a new phase" with North Korea's publication of a Foreign Ministry statement warning of its withdrawal from the NPT, the article analyzes the North Korean position as aimed at "strategic purposes." First, North Korea wants to promptly secure "substantive fruit" by realizing working-level contact with the United States, instead of talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, through "a strong message" to the United States. Describing the substantive fruit as "attaining limited inspection" in negotiations with IAEA and suspension of the Team Spirit exercise, the article reports that North Korea must have judged that it had better use "strong measures" toward the United States in a bid to accomplish its goals rather than hoping for results from negotiations with the IAEA; and that by using such measures, the United States would eventually "make concessions," although initially showing "tough reactions." The article cites observations of a National Unification Board, NUB, official that although North Korea is "outwardly" sternly denouncing the United States, it is maintaining the position not to destroy "the frame of negotiation" as long as the United States wants to continue dialogue. Basically, by releasing the recent statement, North Korea is seeking to "resume" negotiations with the United States to discuss the IAEA inspections, the Team Spirit issue, and the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks; and in this way, wants to "secure" its own practical interest. The paper also notes that North Korea intends to "consolidate" its internal unity by further creating "the atmosphere of tension" with the United States. The liberal TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 5 a 1,300-word article by reporter Kim Cha-su entitled "'Attempt to Drag on Time' Aimed at Reducing Inspections." Noting the discussion between North Korea and IAEA over "the scale of inspection" is in the final stage, the article observes that by publishing the statement, North Korea is using "delaying strategy" aimed at dragging on time in discussions with IAEA because it is not in the position of accepting IAEA inspections during Kim Chong-il's birthday on 16 February. North Korea also thinks that if inspections are conducted before the IAEA Board of Governors meeting slated for 21 February, "heated discussions" will take place concerning North Korea's "nuclear development suspicion" by introducing the results of inspections. The article observes that North Korea is attempting to maintain "a favorable position" regarding inspections in negotiations with the IAEA by expressing its "tough position" so "the scale of inspections" will be reduced "as much as possible." The article also points out the possibility that North Korea and the United States interpreted the promise of acceptance of IAEA inspections "differently." In other words, during a 29 December contact in New York, North Korea promised that it will accept IAEA inspections in such a way as to "ensure continuity of nuclear safeguard measures." The United States, however, might have interpreted this as acceptance of inspections "to the extent demanded by IAEA." This misinterpretation might have touched off North Korea's "tough position." Concerning such various observations, relevant government officials predict that North Korea's "true intention" will be revealed during this week in its reply letter to the IAEA on the scope of inspections put forward by the IAEA, which North Korea is committed to send "within this week." The article concludes that the government views that although it is delaying time in negotiations with IAEA, North Korea will accept inspections by making "gradual concessions," and thus will not lead the situation to a "catastrophe." The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word article by reporter Chong Pyong-chin entitled "The Government's View on North Korean Statement on Withdrawal from NPT." Regarding the recent North Korean statement as "a message" to the United States, the article observes that North Korea is attempting to "upgrade" its position during forthcoming U.S.-North Korean high-level talks by stressing "the U.S. violation of promise" as the main reason for deadlocked North Korean-IAEA negotiations. Explaining differences in assertions between North Korea and IAEA on the scope of inspections, the article reports North Korea seems to wish to solve its problems at talks with the United States, instead of talks with IAEA. The article observes that there is "no change" in the North Korean policy to "settle" the negotiation over the nuclear inspections "in any form" before the IAEA's regular Board of Governors meeting slated for 21 February. The article refers to some observations on the ROK and U.S. side that North Korea will likely allow the IAEA inspection team to visit North Korea around 16 February -- Kim Chong-il's birthday. The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,200-word article by Yang Sung-hyon analyzing the background of the statement by a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman. Describing it as "a message to the United States," the article analyzes that the statement has a long-term objective to secure an advantageous position in future talks with the United States by blaming the United States for breaking a promise, thus causing a stalemate in the negotiations with the IAEA. The article notes that "North Korea could not easily accept the IAEA's requirements presented in the fourth contact on 17 January because North Korea had intended to use them as the conditions for a package deal in the third round talks with the United States." The article speculates that the hard-line moves by the United States and the ROK, including discounting the meaning of the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise and the discussion on the deployment of Patriot missiles, may have stimulated North Korea's intention to seek a resolution through U.S.-North Korean contacts again. The article ends by quoting a government official as saying: "It will be difficult for North Korea to secure another contact with the United States" due to the firm U.S. stance to side with the IAEA. The independent left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word article by Pak Chong-mun entitled "North Korea's Nuclear Statement in the Final Stage, Is It a Tactic or Does the North Mean It?" Noting that the statement implies a probability that North Korea may depart from a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue, the article reports the Foreign Ministry is gravely concerned about the aggravation of the situation, although it tries to appear calm. The article analyzes that the Foreign Ministry is not optimistic because: "First, if the statement is interpreted as North Korea's actual refusal of overall inspection [chonmyon sachal], the situation is in a deadlock because the United States and the IAEA cannot make any more concessions. Second, if the statement is interpreted as aiming at another contact with the United States for further reduced scope of inspections, there is still little possibility of settlement because the United States has no reason to intervene between North Korea and the IAEA." The article quotes a Foreign Ministry official as saying: "It seems that North Korea began negotiations with the IAEA based on the optimistic report by the negotiating team with the United States, which had apparently only reported the advantageous part of the agreement, but now the IAEA's requirements are facing strong opposition inside the North." The article ends by reiterating the threat implied by the statement to reverse the resolution plan of the nuclear issue.
