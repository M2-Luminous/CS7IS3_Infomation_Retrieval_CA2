The SNA chairman began his speech by saying that 26 January is the third anniversary of the toppling of the dictatorial regime that misruled the Somali people for over 21 years. He said it is an occasion that the Somali people should mark and celebrate fully. Mohamed Farah Aidid also took the opportunity to congratulate, with great confidence, fighters, heads of social organizations, all strugglers and SNA supporters wherever they may be, as well as other organizations which participated in the political and armed struggle. [passage omitted] He said the struggle had brought about peace, justice, unity, progress, democracy, fraternity, respect for the Islamic religion, equality, and a revival of the Somali people's culture, customs, and history. [passage omitted] Most noteworthy, Chairman Aidid said, are the victories achieved in the defense of the Somali people, spearheaded by SNA leaders, fighters, women, elders, youth organizations, intellectuals and politicians, as well as the Alliance's supporters. He added that in the defense struggle, the unprovoked UN Operation Somalia [UNOSOM] attacks against the Somali people have been countered. He said UNOSOM-II's aim was colonialism, the massacre of people, and the destruction of private and national assets. The colonialists employed the most highly sophisticated weapons, be they on the ground or air, and an estimated 13,000 people, including children, women, and the elderly, were killed over a five month period and twice that number were injured. Apart from the deaths and injuries, private and national assets were destroyed. And although assessment is being carried out to determine the extent of destruction of these assets, the losses have run into the millions of dollars. Aidid said the world was surprised and still is surprised at how UNOSOM turned its humanitarian program into the aforesaid activities. The world is of the opinion that the Somali people's dignity, independence, and nationhood have been disregarded. As the Somali people responded to the aggression, a lot of comments were made, and the strugglers who defended Somali dignity and nationhood were recognized as heroes who became the symbols and defenders of human rights, peace, and international progress. The Somali people within and outside the country are united in the claim that the SNA strugglers are the only people who defended the Somali people's honor and nationhood and brought home tangible victory. All the leaders of the countries of the world and their peoples share the SNA's view. The SNA's reputation is very high, and therefore it always deserves full commemoration on every occasion. Somalia is also defending the dignity and independence of Third World countries and those who believe in peace and progress. Aidid said UNOSOM should compensate the Somali people for the destruction of property and life as such steps could heal wounds and promote peace and reestablishment of cordial relations between the inflicters of the damage and the victims. We call on all Somali people, Mohamed Farah Aidid said, to learn from the problems brought upon them and the misrule by the successor regime ever since they attained independence. It is imperative for the Somali people to attain unity, peace, and progress and to build a new Somalia where stability and respect for each other's rights, cooperation and brotherhood and consultation are practiced. He called on the Somali people to forget their differences and instead turn to the only way, that of defending their dignity and newly written history which is in their favor. Aidid said we should remember the strugglers of various ages who died bravely in the defense of Somali dignity and sovereignty. [passage omitted] Aidid said the Somali people should assist the injured, orphaned, and refugees, wherever they may be. Aidid said we are obliged to thank those governments and international organizations who provided the Somali people with humanitarian aid during the worst times when the Somali people were faced with hunger and starvation. He said we have expressed our profound gratitude to the neighboring governments that welcomed and hosted Somali refugees, and we would like to tell these governments that we will reciprocate in a similar way.
