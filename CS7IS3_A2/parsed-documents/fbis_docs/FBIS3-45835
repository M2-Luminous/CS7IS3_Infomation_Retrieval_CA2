The Dabie Mountain area in northern Anhui is rich in natural resources. But for a long time the local economy remained underdeveloped due to its inaccessibility. Now the country's opening up has broadened farmer's minds. After learning that wild vegetables locally available are popular in Japan, farmers in Huoshan in this mountainous region immediately set up a factory to process them for export, bringing in three million U.S. dollars a year. They found out that nothing succeeds like success. By 1993 the inland province was home to more than 500 overseas-oriented operations run by farmers. The goods exported were valued at close to 1.5 billion yuan last year. In China, some rural enterprises have been built into large-scale production bases and can rival foreign competitors. Their products range from car jacks to sweaters for the American basketball team "The Chicago Bulls". Nationwide, farmer-run enterprises exported commodities worth 190 billion yuan in 1993, up 60 percent over the previous year.
