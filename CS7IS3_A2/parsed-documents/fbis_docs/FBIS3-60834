The same source added that al-Baz received no gesture of cooperation from Libyan officials on this issue. He noted that al-Kikhya's disappearance is now being handled at the security level pending the outcome of an investigation into the incident. The source said that Egypt and its people do not tolerate anyone harming Egypt's security or its guests. So far, no official statement has been issued on the results of al-Baz's visit to Libya. Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said Monday that Egypt's stance on the issue will be determined by the outcome of the security agencies' investigations. After al-Baz's return on Tuesday, some deputies asked the government to announce the outcome of his mission to Libya and the results of investigations. An Arab diplomatic source has clarified that the Egyptian Government's silence on al-Baz's visit shows its dissatisfaction with Libya and its conviction about that government's involvement in al-Kikhya's abduction.
