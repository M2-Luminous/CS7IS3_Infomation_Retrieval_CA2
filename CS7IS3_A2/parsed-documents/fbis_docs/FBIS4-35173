Together, they are responsible for 56 percent of all cases of dumping reported in the current six-year period, according to a study conducted by the Dumping and Subsidies Investigations Directorate under the Unit of International Trade Practices of the Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat (SECOFI). The document says that in the current six-year period, approximately 108 dumping investigations have been conducted to detect cases in which foreign producers are selling products at lower than normal prices in the Mexican market, which hurts Mexican industries so much that they are driven to the verge of bankruptcy. Of a total of 108 cases investigated, 43 have to do with products coming in from the United States and 17 from the PRC, followed by 12 investigations into Brazilian products and five into German products. Figures show that 39.81 percent of all investigations have been conducted against U.S. products brought into the country under unfair trade conditions, while 15.74 percent of all investigations involve PRC products. The countries that have committed the least number of unfair trade practices against Mexico have been those from the Asian bloc and from Latin America, but in the case of Latin American nations, the document notes that trade with these countries is very limited. The analysis conducted by SECOFI reveals that most of the countries with which Mexico trades have been the object of two or more dumping investigations, but in the case of the United States, the number of unfair trade practices committed in the Mexican market is extraordinary. Among the countries that in the past five years have been the object of only one dumping investigation by the Mexican trade authorities are Argentina, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and Chile. Belgium, the EC, Colombia, and Taiwan have been the object of only two dumping investigations each under the current administration, the document states. As for the products involved, the ones that "suffered" most from unfair trade practices were those from the chemical industry, oil byproducts, and rubber and plastic products, and these comprised 40 percent of the dumping cases reported during the current administration. These products are followed by those from the basic metal industry with 17 percent of all investigations and the textile sector with 12 percent of cases of unfair trade. In the same order of importance, metal industry products, machinery, and equipment -- including, among other products, microcomputers, telephone adapters, transformers, and tools -- account for 10 percent of all investigations. Toys, shoes, and electrical appliances, including refrigerators, account for 7 percent of the total number of registered cases. Nonmetal products -- fluorite, cement, artificial corundum, and ceramic coating [recubrimiento ceramico] -- account for 5 percent of the total number of dumping cases, followed by products from the paper and printing press industry. Food products account for the least number of investigations; cases of unfair trade practices have only been reported in the marketing of fish meal, beef, pork, and cationic starch.
