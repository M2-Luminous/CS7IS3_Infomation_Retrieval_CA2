The municipal government decided recently that it will further boost these sectors this year. In machinery, 115,000 automobiles are to be churned out in 1994. And stress will be put on machine-tooling, hydraulic electrogenerating facilities and engineering machines. In the electronics sector, improvement of video recorders and color televisions will enjoy priority as well as advanced telecommunications and computers. The chemical industry will develop high-efficiency pesticide, first-class paint and other products. And top-flight metal products will top the agenda in the metallurgical field. At present, most enterprises involved in these fields boast large scale production. And their products have held a large market share at home. For example, "Xiali" cars and "Dafa" minibuses from the Tianjin Automobile Company have dominated the taxi market in large and medium-sized cities. So far, the industrial output value in Tianjin, north China's No. 1 industrial city, has reached some 50 billion yuan. The city started the development of the four pillar industries in the 1980s.
