[Borge] We could say that we are placing all our hopes on the FSLN coming out of the congress united, unified, and ready to prepare a strategic plan for the new situation that will emerge with the Congress. The Sandinist Congress represents the culmination of one phase and the beginning of another during which we must persuade the Nicaraguan people that we are the best choice for governing the country and finding solutions to the many problems and demands that have proliferated in recent times. [Irias] Is there a threat of division in the FSLN? [Borge] In all the departments, the rank and file is demanding unity. Any attempt to break this unity will clash with the iron will of the Sandinists. The struggle must be directed against divisionist maneuvers, if they ever appear, and against attempts to deform the FSLN and create a different party. The struggle must be directed at preventing an FSLN sector from installing a different tent and waging a struggle against the Sandinist Front. The majority of the Sandinists favor unity. This explains why an overwhelming majority does not favor endorsing tendencies. Tendencies can produce division. However, I favor free debate within the FSLN. Nevertheless, I think that debate must take place within the party's confines. We must try to avoid division. Some months ago several companeros who belong to a specific tendency asked me to run for secretary general of the FSLN. I told them: "I do not belong to your tendency. Why are you inviting me to be your candidate when you have your own cadres?" They insisted on their offer for some time. I saw that as a cheap political maneuver aimed at dividing the historic cadres of the FSLN, specifically speaking: to produce a confrontation between me and the secretary general of the Sandinist Front. I did not fall for that. It was wrong, incorrect, and opportunistic. Had I run for secretary general, I would not have been the candidate for unity, as I could have been ticketed, but the candidate for division. [Irias] Are you saying that if Henry Ruiz were to run as candidate for secretary general of the FSLN he would be creating conditions that would lead to division in the FSLN? [Borge] What I say about myself perhaps could be said about another person, but as everybody knows, I prefer not to mention names. I am mentioning mine so that my case can serve as an example of what may happen to other companeros. [Irias] What kind of leadership does the FSLN need? [Borge] I have always favored collective leadership. Some reason that the collective leadership was weakened by the current historic situation. In wartime, power and leadership must be centralized. In my opinion, the collective leadership should cover a broad spectrum. The limitations placed on the National Directorate as leader of the party resulted from a collective decision. The Directorate decided to centralize authority in the government, in particular, and those who are now criticizing this decision are the ones who endorsed it then. The Directorate handed its authority over to the government, to the executive, and no one protested at that time. In existing circumstances we need as secretary general of the FSLN -- without detriment to the collective leadership -- a companero with historical authority, one who has already demonstrated unselfishness, the ability to go evereywhere, and the firm decision to lead. The FSLN rank and file has already chosen this cadre. On the other hand, everybody has the right to aspire to a position in the Directorate for the sake of collective leadership and shared authority, without detriment to the establishment of hierarchies. I favor the FSLN having a president and a secretary general. The presidency, a position to which I aspire, should be considered a representative of the FSLN, a companero and close adviser to the secretary general, and his substitute. Why do I seek this position? It is not because of any craving for personal ambition or fame, which I do not need, but because I believe that in this way I would be better able to contribute to a revolutionary leadership, in addition to historical reasons. [Irias] Aren't you afraid that your statements on eventual candidates for the post of secretary general could increase the contradictions surrounding this debate? [Borge] I hope there is no internal division over this problem. This is why I reported that an effort was made to lure me in the same way that others have been courted in the search for a secretary general. I am mentioning this example to invite militants and leaders not to do anything that would contravene the FSLN's internal unity. [Irias] Would you support Commander Daniel Ortega as candidate for the post of secretary general? [Borge] I have said that I prefer not to mention names, but I will in this case say that I believe that in the framework of a collective leadership, Daniel Ortega is the most suitable person for the post of secretary general. I have been very critical of Daniel Ortega, much more than others in the National Directorate and in private. This critical posture has yielded fruits in recent times. I have found Daniel receptive to criticism. I never sweet-talk him, as some people who now criticize him and challenge him did in the past. I will never stop being a critic, an adviser, and a nonservile supporter. I will always tell Daniel Ortega the truth as I see it. Of the current cadres, he is the companero most inclined to criticize. In addition, with the undue will to accommodate him that we demonstrated in the past, we gave him the intransigent and authoritarian image he now has. I think this is over. Vertical leadership is not possible now. I think that because of his experience, backing, and open ears, the person most suited to be FSLN secretary general is Daniel Ortega.
