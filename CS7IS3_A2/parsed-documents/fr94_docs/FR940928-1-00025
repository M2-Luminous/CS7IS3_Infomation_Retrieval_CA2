A ``Facility Review'' notice requesting comments from interested persons is posted in the facility fifteen days prior to the scheduled review. A ``Transition Plan'' notice requesting comments from interested persons is posted in the facility for thirty days after the development of a transition plan. Dated: September 22, 1994. Jon H.
