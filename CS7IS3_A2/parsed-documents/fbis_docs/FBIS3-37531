The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry Press Service has revealed that the enemy attacks were rebuffed and the Armenian military units forced to retreat to their previous positions. Reports from Azerbaijan's occupied areas said the Armenian military units are being forced to maintain their attacks regardless of the casualties they suffer. That's because they are being fired on by special obstructive units in the rear lines. Those units are made up of Armenians from Karabakh and other criminal elements. The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry has informed a correspondent from [name indistinct] newspaper that the Azerbaijani National Army units killed 318 enemy troops, destroyed six tanks, and disabled seven armored vehicles and four trucks in their recent combat operations. Reports say that 850 occupation units were urgently dispatched from Armenia to Azerbaijan's Karabakh region during the past two days. Most of them have not even had preliminary military training. A wave of discontent and some disorderliness have been observed among the occupation units in Karabakh. A violent clash took place in Karmirgyukh between the occupation elements affiliated with two political parties in Armenia. Several of them were killed. Azerbaijan's defense units have reportedly approached the heights near Kelbadzhar that are held by the Armenian occupiers.
