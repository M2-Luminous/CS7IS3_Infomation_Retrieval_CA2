Even the meetings between U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor, who arrived into Japan on 1 February, and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, did not go beyond discussing basic things. Even though Jeffrey Garten, U.S. under secretary of commerce, once said "we are not seeking numerical targets," the United States has proposed making trends and indicators objective criteria. Japanese officials in charge of the negotiations take such proposals as de facto numerical targets, saying, "The expressions may be different, but there is no difference in that they want future targets after all." The reason why the Japanese officials are so rigid is because of their bad experiences. One of them is the Japanese-U.S. semiconductor agreement. Whereas it contained a figure of 20 percent for foreign semiconductors' market share in Japan as the U.S. industry's hoped-for figure, before one knew what was happening, the U.S. Government started to say that it was a figure that the Japanese Government promised would be attained. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said it will not retreat from its position, insisting: "We will never repeat the same kind of mistake. If we put numbers in an agreement, that will be interpreted as public pledge by the Japanese Government." One of the reasons why the Japanese Government, which has kept on making concessions in past negotiations with the United States, now has taken so tough a stand is that the trade environment is greatly different following the conclusion of the GATT's Uruguay Round of talks at the end of last year. Its position is now that multinational trade rules have been established, "if a dispute arises between two countries, the right thing to do is to bring it to the GATT for open discussions." After deciding to partially open the rice market, which was a symbol of the closed nature of the Japanese market, Japan's guilty conscience has lessened as well. "We won't tell them not to come. But they can't do anything even if they do come." [source not identified] The arrivals of cabinet-rank officials such as USTR Mickey Kantor -- on the heels of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen -- are seen as an overbearing act ignoring the framework of negotiations now under way at the vice- ministerial level. The U.S. claim against Japan concerning Japanese "bureaucrats' impeding the progress of negotiations" has amplified Japanese bureaucrats' mistrust of the United States, and "we are now mutually distrustful of each other," said Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice minister of international trade and industry. But Japanese officials are perplexed as well. The MITI, working behind the scenes, is asking domestic automobile manufacturers to prepare voluntary plans on the purchase of foreign-made parts -- in hopes of finding a breakthrough in the framework talks on automobiles and auto parts. The government wants to adopt a policy of not being involved directly in order to prevent any figures from turning into numerical targets, but there is no change in the fact that this is nontransparent administrative guidance. Such a practice weakens Japan's position on "not resorting to the practice of trade of a managed nature," and consequently it will be rather counterproductive to the negotiations.
