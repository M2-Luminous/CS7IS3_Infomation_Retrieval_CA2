FR940713-1-00052 FR940713-1-00011 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 85&hyph;07; Notice 9] RIN 2127&hyph;AF23 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Air Brake Systems Control Line Pressure Balance AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: In response to a petition for rulemaking submitted by Sealco Air Controls, Inc., this notice proposes to amend the control line pressure differential requirements in Standard No. 121, Air Brake Systems, for converter dollies and trailers designed to tow another vehicle equipped with air brakes. The agency has tentatively concluded that the proposed amendments would improve the braking compatibility of such vehicles by allowing the use of a relay valve known as a spool-type low opening valve. The agency does not anticipate any adverse safety consequences resulting from amending the pressure differential requirements. DATES: Comments. Comments must be received on or before September 12, 1994. Proposed effective date. The proposed amendments in this notice would become effective 30 days after publication of a final rule in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to the docket and notice numbers above and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Docket hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Chris Tinto, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. (202&hyph;366&hyph;6761). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Standard No. 121, Air Brake Systems , establishes performance and equipment requirements for braking systems on vehicles equipped with air brakes, including requirements for pneumatic timing. For purposes of compliance testing, the pneumatic timing tests for trailers, including trailer converter dollies, are conducted with the trailer connected to a test rig rather than an actual tractor. The test rig delivers air to, and releases air from, the trailer during the timing test. The timing tests for vehicles designed to tow trailers are conducted with a 50 cubic inch reservoir connected to rear control line coupling. This reservoir represents the control line volume of the control trailer used in the compliance testing.
