This is where it will finally be decided what political message the party will have for the Hungarian people at the 1994 elections. We interviewed Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate of the SZDSZ, before the meeting. [Sumegi] After so many exciting general meetings, this one promises to be a calm working conference. [Kuncze] Indeed, we are not expecting any excitement. The SZDSZ is preparing for the elections and it is presenting a program to the citizens that is an alternative to the past four years and to the preceding 40 years. I will have to talk to the representatives of a united party at the general meeting: We will have to set out the direction of the program. [Sumegi] What is your message for the voters? [Kuncze] We can launch the country on the way toward security and prosperity! The SZDSZ has the necessary program for this. We cannot acquiesce in Hungary's current lack of success, which is not the fault of the people who have been working hard in the past four years and before; rather, it is the fault of the governments that have been unable to use these efforts in the interest of a successful Hungary. Light Dreams [Sumegi] The SZDSZ is preparing for a governmental role full steam ahead. However, public opinion polls show that the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ] are leading neck and neck. [Kuncze] The elections will be in May, and the SZDSZ will have to increase its support by then. However, the trends indicate that the SZDSZ has started "to go upwards." According to the latest opinion poll, the party's popularity already reaches 15 percent among those who will choose a party, and we reached this in three months. Almost 40 percent of the electorate would like to see us in government. There is a sympathy toward the SZDSZ, and we will have to change this into more votes. [Sumegi] I will not ask you for coalition speculations, but I would like to outline two versions. What will happen if the MSZP wins? Many people think that the SZDSZ would be willing to form a government with the MSZP and this is also confirmed by the fact that the MSZP does not have a prime ministerial candidate. [Kuncze] The SZDSZ is open to all democratic parties. It will decide on coalition when the election results, and whether the programs can be reconciled, are known. This is not influenced by the fact that the MSZP has not named a prime ministerial candidate. [Sumegi] According to the FIDESZ, the socialists should be kept away from power for at least another four years if we want a real democratic "rotation" system. [Kuncze] Things like this can be said but the electors will make the final decision. [Sumegi] [SZDSZ Chairman] Ivan Peto once said that a kind of revanchist spirit has arisen among the supporters of the old regime, especially in the provinces. [Kuncze] In my experience, people who lost their positions in 1989 and 1990 appear to be getting organized and they are becoming increasingly self-confident. There is a danger that, if they get back into power, people will feel that nothing has happened. This is regardless of the MSZP's national politics. At the same time, all political forces have a responsibility in preventing the domination of revanchism in Hungary. Taking revenge on people every four years would be an impossible situation. A country cannot operate like this. This has to be ended for once and forever. [Sumegi] According to the other -- let us call it -- extreme idea, an agreement between [Prime Minister Peter] Boross and [FIDESZ Chairman] Orban would like to prevent the socialists from coming to power. [Kuncze] When ideas like these surface, it would be best for the affected sides to comment on them. According to our agreement with the FIDESZ, its leaders should inform the SZDSZ about all such talks. We have not received any such information. The fact that certain parties talk about having to prevent another party from coming to power might indicate the lack of programs. However, if it is to indicate that, in this case, they will have to present a good program to the electors; then I can approve this. [Sumegi] It is conceivable that it will not be possible to form a stable government and Boross will in the end be right because he said that, if something other than the current coalition comes to government, new elections will have to be called within a year. [Kuncze] Boross is probably aware of the situation the country was brought into by the government led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. On this basis, he might even be right. However, I believe that if, in 1994, a coalition is formed that is able to present a united program to the people, and which can agree with the employers and the employees, then the government will be supported by the interest protection organizations. This way, a stable coalition can be established, and we bear this in mind. [Sumegi] What are your views on the MDF's chances? In "crisis situations" -- voting for the budget or election of the prime minister -- the MDF has always been able to pull itself together. What can be Boross's role from this point of view? [Kuncze] The MDF will lose the elections. It is undoubtedly true that, to the outside, Boross represents a different style compared to the previous period. The emphasis on the need for dialogue also indicates this. It is also apparent that he wishes to move the government toward pragmatic politics. [Sumegi] As far as I can see -- and the SZDSZ has not indicated otherwise --he has not yet made any big mistakes since he became prime minister. [Kuncze] This is true and when he does make one, we will certainly mention it. The prime minister has not done much good yet, either, and he could not have in this short time. He presents the activities of the MDF government in the past month as a series of successes. The electors will later express their views on the "series of successes." The question is how the forces in the MDF will influence Boross's scope for maneuver. It is certainly true that he simply does not deal with ideological issues. [Sumegi] There is a significant uncertain strata in society which lost its faith in the MDF but cannot find a better party to suit its taste. [Kuncze] In my view, a significant part of the MDF's voters have gone over to the MSZP, just as, at the time, people who otherwise were left-wing sympathizers had voted for the MDF because it had promised "light dreams" and painless transition, as opposed to the SZDSZ that had spoken honestly about the burdens of the changes. People were wrong in 1990 when they chose the MDF. The voters have now returned to the MSZP; many have also changed over to the FIDESZ but those people who are now leaving the FIDESZ increase the number of those who do not choose any parties. I do not believe that the MDF will be able to improve its position considerably. Today, in the view of the public, the SZDSZ is a party that has good ideas and promises safe changes. The FIDESZ in the Center-Right [Sumegi] According to the FIDESZ's leaders, they pulled the SZDSZ into the center through the SZDSZ-FIDESZ agreement. On the other hand, you once said that the FIDESZ is around the SZDSZ. [Kuncze] We should leave it to the electors to decide this. Public opinion polls have been placing the SZDSZ into the center and the FIDESZ either to the left or to the right of the SZDSZ. It was indeed I who said that, according to this, the SZDSZ is in the center and the FIDESZ is around us. However, the movement of the past one year indicates that the FIDESZ is moving to a center-right position, Orban has been taking his party in this direction. The question is what the electors will think of this. However, this does not mean that it is not the FIDESZ that is closest to the SZDSZ. [Sumegi] According to the BESZELO, the SZDSZ and the FIDESZ are as happy about each other's problems as divorcees usually are. After the events of the past two months, people who have been hoping for a liberal victory might even be worried about the alliance of the two parties. [Kuncze] In the Hungarian electoral system, the parties have to have themselves measured to find out their support. It is after this when it is worth talking about alliances. Therefore, in addition to being allies, we are also rivals of each other. We are not happy about the FIDESZ's quick loss of popularity because this weakens the liberal center. However, it is still worth maintaining our cooperation because this can be beneficial for both parties at the elections. [Sumegi] In the MAGYAR NEMZET, [former MDF deputy] Jozsef Debreczeni said nothing less than that the SZDSZ and the intelligentsia that supports it tried to influence the FIDESZ's formidable politics against the successor party [MSZP] through [former FIDESZ deputy] Gabor Fodor. [Kuncze] This is a usual twist in Debreczeni's thinking and it is not worth dealing with it. Naturally, the SZDSZ had nothing to do with the problems within the FIDESZ at the time. [Sumegi] One of the goals of the FIDESZ-SZDSZ agreement was that the two parties would try not to set candidates against each other in six to 12 electoral districts. [Kuncze] This is still a possibility, for example, the FIDESZ has not yet set a candidate in my district, and the SZDSZ has not yet named anyone in some districts. Another section of the agreement talks about automatic withdrawal [to the benefit of the other] between the two rounds, and this also can still be fulfilled. As for the period after the elections, we specified that we would always first talk to each other. However, even this does not mean any strict obligations, the two parties are still free to act as they wish. [Sumegi] The biggest conflict between the two parties is in the local organizations, therefore, the withdrawals will not be so automatic. [Kuncze] The leaderships of the two parties asked the local organizations in writing to take up contact with each other and to try to keep the emerging conflicts in normal channels in order to strengthen the liberal center. [Sumegi] You are talking very cautiously.... [Kuncze] I am making a conscious effort to be a politician who does not steer the political forces toward conflicts. I am aware of the serious differences of views between the various parties but these have to appear in a way that will give people options to choose from, rather than which will divide society. Who Is on the Right Way? [Sumegi] To what extent is the media making the FIDESZ-SZDSZ conflict more acute? [Kuncze] The press pays much attention to this issue because it would cause a big stir if cooperation between the two parties ceased to exist. When I give calm answers to these questions, journalists think that I am avoiding the answer and they are disappointed. However, my view on this issue is exactly what I said. [Sumegi] To what extent will calm politics be characteristic of the campaign? According to Boross, it is important to keep a calm atmosphere. However, you have already been called a rascal by [MDF Executive Chairman] Sandor Lezsak, and some of your fellow SZDSZ members have been called traitors to the country. [Kuncze] I would like the election campaign to be a competition of programs. This is needed because we must regain people's faith in politics. A vehement and negative campaign would even more convey the message that it is not worth dealing with "these" because all they try to do is discredit each other. I believe that Boross has the same view and I can see that Lezsak's views are different. When he called me a rascal, I deliberately did not react because I thought that sooner or later he would make a statement that comes up to the level where it is worth conducting a dialogue. It is a different matter that this has not yet happened. However, I am optimistic in this respect, too. [Sumegi] If Lezsak is elected chairman of the MDF, to what extent will he be able to move the MDF in this direction? [Kuncze] If he takes the party in this direction then the MDF will definitely be lost. Lezsak is already the executive chairman; in this position, he should be more careful about what he says and how he offends politicians. It is he who has to change in this respect; I am on the right road.
