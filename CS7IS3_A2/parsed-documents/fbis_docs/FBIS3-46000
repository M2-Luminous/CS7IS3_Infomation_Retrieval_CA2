The series consists of eight books, and its chief editor is Xue Muqiao and its deputy chief editors Liu Guoguang and Wu Jinglian. Its editorial committee includes economists Zhang Zhuoyuan and Dai Yuanchen, and a number of middle-aged and young economic experts including Li Jiange, Zhou Xiaochuan, Guo Shuqing, and Lou Jiwei. These experts and scholars have personally participated in designing and putting into practice China's reform plans over the past dozen years or more, so the series possesses the characteristics of integrating theory and practice and of being exceedingly functional. Xue Muqiao wrote a preface to the series. He reviewed the course of new China's construction and reform and found that arguments have mainly centered on two main lines: First, the question of whether to take economic development or class struggle as the central task. Second, the question of whether the pattern of economic structure should be the allocation of resources by planning or by the market. We should say there is already common consensus on these two questions now. As this century is drawing to a close and the next is unfolding, economic theorists should make good preparations and can seize the opportunity for all time to push China's reform and lay a foundation for take-off in the next century. At the meeting of economists, Wu Jinglian said: The most important moment of reform, which I have looked forward to for many years, has finally come. Given so many new reform measures and numerous big and small things, it is necessary to seriously study and carefully design reform plans. If we are just a little careless, it will probably lead to disturbances. He Yang argued that it is no longer practical to run the economy through the methods of formalism, mass movements, and administrative orders, instead, economic and legal means should be used, and that what is important is strengthening study of market economic theories. Zhou Xiaochuan said that the fruits of economic theory study over the years have been incorporated into central documents, directly influencing economic life, and that forward-looking economic theories will inevitably play an important role in China's reform. Li Jiange told this reporter that the problem of inflation in the economy is absolutely not caused by the pushing forward of reform, and that reform is intended to suppress inflation, and this view must be clearly elaborated theoretically.
