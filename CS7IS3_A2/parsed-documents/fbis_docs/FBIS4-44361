"The `purple' adventure has been a failure," Kok said at a news conference. Kok said "he had made a great effort to see whether or not any solutions were still conceivable" following the extra package of demands tabled by VVD leader Bolkestein last weekend, who complained at further cuts on government expenditure and proposed further cuts in social security instead. According to Kok, however, it had not yet proven possible to reach agreement. Kok concluded that the investment in a "purple" coalition after seven weeks of negotiations had gone awry. The PvdA leader described as "strange" the VVD's complaints about cuts on the state budget, in view of the fact that in recent years, the VVD had always been the party to say that further cuts could surely be made. On Tuesday [28 June], the PvdA will fix its standpoint. The main conclusion will be that new negotiations will have to focus on a government combining the PvdA, the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], and D66.
