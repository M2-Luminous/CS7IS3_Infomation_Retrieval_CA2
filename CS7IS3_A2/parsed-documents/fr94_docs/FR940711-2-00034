FR940711-2-00034 FR940711-2-00021 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;639&hyph;000] Columbia Gas Transmission Corp.; Application July 5, 1994. Take notice that on July 1, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia), 1700 MacCorkle Avenue, SE., Charleston, West Virginia 25314, filed an application with the Commission in Docket No. CP94&hyph;639&hyph;000 pursuant to sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for permission and approval to abandon deteriorated pipe on Line 1740 in Doddridge and Harrison Counties, West Virginia, and to replace the abandoned facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application which is open to the public for inspection. Columbia proposes to abandon approximately 6.5 miles of deteriorated 20-inch diameter pipe 1 in Doddridge and Harrison Counties, and replace with approximately 6.5 miles of 20-inch diameter pipe and 0.1 mile of 16-inch diameter pipe as an auxiliary crossover pipeline on five segments of Line 1740. Columbia does not request authorization for any new or additional service. Columbia states that the proposed pipeline sections would have equivalent design delivery capacity and the facilities proposed for abandonment are obsolete due to class location changes or are physically deteriorated to the extent that replacement is deemed advisable. The proposed construction would cost approximately $6,624,000 and the estimated net debit to retirement associated with the abandonment is $331,000. 1 See order at 6 FPC 627 (1947). Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before July 12, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by §§7 and 15 of the NGA and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate and permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Columbia to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
