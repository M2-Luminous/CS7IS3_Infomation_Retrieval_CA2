Ambassador Guo Jiading, leader of the Chinese team of Sino- Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, made these remarks at a news conference here this afternoon. Guo said that in 1993 Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Vice- President Rong Yiren and other senior officials had paid official visit to Portugal and Portuguese foreign minister and several other governmental officials had also visited China. He said he was convinced that the high-level contacts between the two governments would further promote the consolidation and development of the Sino-Portuguese friendly relations of cooperation and enhance Macao residents' confidence on Sino-Portuguese cooperation in guaranteeing long-term stability in the territory. Guo said that in 1993 both sides of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group had initially consulted with each other and made marked achievements in handling affairs in the transitional period of Macao by observing the Joint Declaration and on the basis of mutual respect and mutual understanding. In addition to the three major questions in the transitional period, namely the localization of public servants and law and officialization of Chinese language, and question about Macao's entry in international organizations, the two sides of the Joint Liaison Group also exchanged views on retirement pay for public servants, participation of Bank of China in note-issuing in Macao and others, Guo said. He pointed out that the three questions are the major factors which have significant influence on the overall situation of the transitional period, saying that China has and will extend more efforts in pushing forward the settlement of the three major questions and others concerned.
