She said most unreported cases appeared to be mother-to-child infections. She said that in the 1993/4 fiscal year, more than R[rand]21,056,000 had been allocated to AIDS support, research and information, marketing, training and health education and administration. Non-governmental organisations received R2,074,000. Although this budget might be considered insufficient, it had to be remembered the government had a multi-faceted approach to the pandemic and was orientated towards a preventative approach rather than a curative one, said Dr. Venter. She said a task force of the National AIDS Co-ordinating Committee of South Africa was developing a national plan, and the committee was being extended at regional level. "An AIDS health promotion programme should be an integral part of the local authority's existing health policy and control programmes," said Dr. Venter. Community participation plays an integral part of AIDS prevention activities. It means much more than merely complying with medical prescriptions or contributing labour and money to health plans that others have already judged appropriate for various communities. Participation simply means an alliance between communities, policy makers and health care workers for a common purpose." She said when a community was involved in all aspects of AIDS prevention, new ideas and practices were widely and rapidly diffused. "Social networks are activated. People with similar values and experience trust and accept a [words indistinct] other than institutions reaching the `hard to reach' on their own terms may be the most valuable contribution of community participation." Dr. Venter said the AIDS pandemic would have a wide-ranging socio-economic impact on many sectors of the southern African community, besides the health care system. "Sophisticated first world medical care could not only be unaffordable but it would also be inappropriate. The challenge is to ensure that AIDS prevention be made a high priority within the context of other health and social issues."
