FR940428-1-00034 FR940428-1-00008 Because the current rule is so comprehensively revised and reorganized in the proposed rule, it is not practical to provide a full derivation and distribution table for this subchapter. However, as an aid to readers the agency has prepared a very simplified chart showing where old sections can be found in the proposed rule and whether that section has been edited in the proposed rule. ␣ 1Old section 1New section 222.1(a) First half of paragraph 222.3 Addresses and expands. 222.1(a) Second half of paragraph 222.4 Addresses and expands. 222.1(b) 222.2 (Edited). 222.2(a) 222.3(d) Addresses and expands. 222.2(b) 222.3 Addresses and expands. 222.2(c) First half of paragraph 222.3(b)(1)(iii) Addresses and expands. 222.2(c) Second half of paragraph 222.3(b),(c) and 222.4(b) Addresses and expands. 222.3(a) 222.4(a) (Edited). 222.3(b) 222.4(b) (Edited). 222.3(c) 222.3 (b) and (c) Addresses and expands. 222.3(c)(1) ``Grazing permits .␣.␣. or less.'' l 222.5(b) Addresses and expands. 222.3(c)(1) ``Term grazing .␣.␣. policies.'' l 222.5(a)(4) (Edited). 222.3(c)(1) ``Term permits .␣.␣. requires.'' l 222.5(a) (2) and (3) Addresses and expands. 222.3(c)(1)(i) First half of paragraph 222.7(b)(2). 222.3(c)(1)(i) Second half of paragraph 222.3(a) and 222.3(b)(1)(iii) Addresses and expands. 222.3(c)(1)(ii) 222.9(a), (b), and (d) Addresses and expands. 222.3(c)(1)(iii) 222.10(a)(4) (Edited) 222.3(a)(1)(iv) 222.8(a)(1), (2) and (3) (Edited). 222.3(c)(1)(v) 222.7(b)(2)(v) (Edited). 222.3(c)(1)(vi) 222.7 (Edited). 222.3(c)(1)(vi)(A) 222.7(b)(2) (Edited). 222.3(c)(1)(vi)(B) Unnecessary. 222.3(c)(1)(vi)(C) 222.8 Addresses and expands. 222.3(c)(1)(vi)(D) 222.7(b)(3)(i) (Edited). 222.3(c)(1)(vi)(E) 222.7(b)(3)(ii) (Edited). 222.3(c)(1)(vi)(F) 222.8(a) (Edited). 222.3(c)(2) Entire section 222.6 (Edited). 222.4(a)(1) and (2)(i) through (iv) 222.10(a)(1) and (a)(2) (Edited). 222.4(a)(2)(v) and (3) through (6) 222.10(b) addresses and expands. 222.4(a) (7) and (8) 222.10(c) (Edited). 222.4(b) 222.10(a)(3) (Edited).

Regulatory Impact This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review, The agency has determined that in combination with a separate proposed rule to revise grazing fees this proposed rule is a significant regulatory action subject to Office of Management and Budget review. The proposed increase in grazing fees may result in increased operational costs for small ranching businesses that have permits on National Forest System land in Western States. The Department of Interior has prepared an initial Small Entities Flexibility Assessment analyzing the economic impact of this rulemaking on small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605 et seq ). The public may obtain copies of the draft Small Entities Flexibility Assessment by writing the address listed under ADDRESSES earlier in the document.
