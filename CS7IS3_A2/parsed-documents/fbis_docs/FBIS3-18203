The four were part of a group of six Super Galeb aircraft which took off from the northwestern Serb-held airport of Banja Luka early Monday morning, a French military source said. In Bonn, German Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said that the downing of the aircraft was the "bitter but necessary consequence" of Serbian aggression. "The (Serbian) pilots had not reacted to two warnings given after they clearly infringed the UN no-fly zone over Bosnia," Vogel said. In Washington, President Bill Clinton said that the American forces had made every attempt to avoid a confrontation with the Serbs. "There were two warnings," Clinton told reporters. "Every attempt was made to the best of my information to avoid this encounter." In Brussels, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said that the use of force showed that "the international community has decided to make sure it is respected." British Prime Minister John Major, in Washington on an official visit, said that the four downed aircraft had shown clearly hostile intentions. "The planes had no reason to be there, had been warned and should have expected to be shot down," Major said. At the French Foreign Ministry, spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said the Serbian flights over Bosnia "constituted an unquestionable violation of United Nations resolutions." It was "the first violation of this type" and the "most serious violation seen to date," she said, adding: "The international community must show its resolve to see that the UN Security Council's resolutions are respected." In Rome, Italian Defence Minister Fabio Fabbri said that the incident was "painful" but "allowed the United Nations to keep its authority and prestige." Fabbri said that the U.S. pilots had "operated according to the defined procedures in order to see the UN Rsolution 816 on the no-fly exclusion zone was respected. "If the international community and the United Nations want to make their intention of guaranteeing world order credible and influential, they cannot avoid the use of force for peaceful and humanitarian ends," he said. In Athens, Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias, current president of the European Council of Ministers, said that, "disagreeable and difficult as the serious incident was...it could not annul" the peace process underway in Bosnia. General Jean Cot, commander of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR], said in a statement in Zagreb that the shooting down of the four planes was carried out "exactly according to procedures. All stages of this operation were executed by NATO exactly according to the procedures agreed for the no-fly zone," he said. In Tirana, where he was on an official visit, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said he was "entirely in accord with" the NATO operation by which the international community showed "it intends to continue its actions to put an end to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina." In Ankara, a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the action was entirely "legitimate." In Milan, Sarajevo Mayor Muhamed Kresevliajakovic said that "NATO's strength will accelerate the end of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina." In Moscow, extreme nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy demanded the "dissolution" of NATO and the United Nations.
