FR940602-1-00015 FR940602-1-00009 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [OAQPS CA38&hyph;5&hyph;6308; FRL&hyph;4890&hyph;6] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision, South Coast Air Quality Management District AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) which concern the control of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from pleasure craft coating operations and set general recordkeeping requirements for VOC emissions. The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. DATES: Comments must be received on or before July 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to: Daniel A. Meer, Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. Copies of the rule revisions and EPA's evaluation report of each rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region 9 office during normal business hours. Copies of the submitted rule revisions are also available for inspection at the following locations: South Coast Air Quality Management District, 21865 East Copley Drive, Diamond Bar, CA 91765&hyph;4182.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The rules being proposed for approval into the California SIP are: South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Rule 1106.1, Pleasure Craft Coating Operations and Rule 109, Recordkeeping for Volatile Organic Compound Emissions. These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on September 14, 1992. Background On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin. 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305. Because this area was unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40 CFR 52.238. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that the SCAQMD's portion of the California SIP was inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance. 1 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin is classified as extreme; 2 therefore, this area was subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. 1 Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the proposed Post-1987 ozone and carbon monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register Notice'' (Blue Book) (notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1988); and the existing control technique guidelines (CTGs). 2 The Los Angeles South Coast Air Basin retained its designation and was classified by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on September 14, 1992, including the rules being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for SCAQMD Rule 1106.1, Pleasure Craft Coating Operations, and for SCAQMD Rule 109, Recordkeeping for Volatile Organic Compound Emissions. SCAQMD adopted Rule 1106.1 on May 1, 1992 and Rule 109 on March 6, 1992. These submitted rules were found to be complete on November 20, 1992 pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR Part 51 Appendix V 3 and are being proposed for approval into the SIP. 3 EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216). Rule 1106.1 requires the use of low VOC coatings for marine pleasure craft coating operations and coating application methods with high transfer efficiencies, and Rule 109 sets out general recordkeeping requirements for regulating volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions for a variety of source categories. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted as part of the district's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules. EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act. For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents, as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). Rule 1106.1 controls emissions from a source category for which EPA has not issued a CTG and Rule 109 is a general recordkeeping rule and therefore does not have a corresponding CTG. Further interpretations of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book, referred to in footnote 1. In general, these guidance documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP. SCAQMD's submitted Rule 109, includes the following significant changes from the current SIP: •Adds a definition for Exempt Compounds, •Removes Executive Officer Discretion from sections (c)(2) and (c)(3) as prescribed in the Technical Support Document (TSD) (dated January 15, 1992), and •Adds EPA-approved test methods. SCAQMD Rule 1106.1 is a new rule which was adopted to regulate emissions for the coating of marine pleasure craft. EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA policy. Therefore, SCAQMD Rule 1106.1 and Rule 109 are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and Part D. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
