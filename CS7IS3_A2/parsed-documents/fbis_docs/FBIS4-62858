That was stated by the head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council, in a talk with ITAR-TASS correspondents in Pretoria, where he was attending Nelson Mandela's inauguration ceremony. "I formed this impression as a result of meetings with RSA President Nelson Mandela, First Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, and Deputy President Frederik de Klerk," he said. "During my talk with F. de Klerk we reached the common opinion that our states are sufficiently prepared for the successful continuation and development of all-around relations, especially as this cooperation does not have to be begun from nothing. "For me as head of the Russian parliament's upper chamber and chairman of the CIS interparliamentary assembly, it is particularly important to ensure the development of interparliamentary ties," the head of the Russian Federation delegation stressed. "We are now faced with the task of creating within the framework of the CIS model legislation for the former republics of the Soviet Union. Its fulfillment could lead to the point where cooperation between Russia and the RSA grows into the same kind of cooperation that exists with the other CIS states. "Excellent prospects are opened up for collaboration in the political field in connection with the fact that warm, friendly relations have formed between Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin, RSA President N. Mandela, and Deputy President F. de Klerk within the framework of a process which today is called the humanization of politics. We all remember that in the past Frederik de Klerk, as president of the RSA, at a hard time for our country in October last year, supported Russia in a speech he delivered. Such things are not forgotten and they lay the foundation for the further development of our relations. Russia's firm support for the present democratic reforms in South Africa is expressed in President Yeltsin's message which I presented to RSA President Mandela and in his verbal message to F. de Klerk. "In my talk with F. de Klerk I voiced the thought that the international public does not have the right to leave South Africa without attention after the victory of the democratic elections. It is not ruled out that after the voting and the inauguration everyone will calm down and the RSA will be abandoned to the tyranny of fate. Nothing like that should happen. So I allow the possibility of appealing to the international community to continue to support South Africa and to display attention toward it and its development. "In that sense our bilateral economic ties are important and all necessary conditions exist for their development and expansion. The RSA has its problems connected with the emergence of its commodities and technologies onto the world market after the application of all-embracing and primarily economic sanctions against it for decades. That country was obliged to develop its own modern technologies. Now with the lifting of the boycott South Africa is faced with the task of ensuring an outlet for these technologies onto the world market. "Russia is in need of such cooperation and our market is in a certain sense boundless with regard to this cooperation just as the South African market is boundless for many Russian goods, particularly conversion goods. Simple and cheaper consumer goods could be suitable on the local market. We can also discuss military cooperation separately. We discussed all this at meeting with President Mandela and F. de Klerk. "During my stay in Pretoria I was convinced that the present leadership has favorable opportunities for close collaboration. At least I formed the opinion that the president and his two deputies have a great personal liking for each other. And that is already half the battle, or even more than half. If politicians treat each other in a normal, human way that helps resolve many complex tasks. "Many good words can be said about the RSA. Its sincere desire to ensure successful democratic development gives rise to the warmest feelings," V.F. Shumeyko stressed. "With its expanses and wide open spaces and boundless fields that country reminded me of my Russian home."
