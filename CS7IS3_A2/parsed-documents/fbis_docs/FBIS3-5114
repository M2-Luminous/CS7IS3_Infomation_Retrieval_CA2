Korea" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- The U.S. State Department reportedly reaffirmed Wednesday that the demand for the abolition of the "National Security Law" in South Korea was the official stand of the United States. Commenting on the great sensation in South Korea caused by the remarks of Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hubbard urging the abrogation of the "NSL" in South Korea, its spokesman declared again what this senior U.S. Government official had said was not his personal view and what the United States demanded was not the revision of the "NSL" but its abolition. Noting that the maintenance of the "NSL" was illogical, the State Department said what the United States demanded of South Korea was the abrogation of the "NSL" and this was the U.S. official stand. This statement of the U.S. State Department came at a time when the South Korean puppet Foreign Ministry authorities met officials of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul and asked them to inform the U.S. Government of the sensation created in South Korea by the remarks of the deputy assistant secretary of state.
