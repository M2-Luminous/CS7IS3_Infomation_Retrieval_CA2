The production breakthrough in the Thuringian potash plants was only the first step along the way. The salt content of the rivers can be scaled back to a tolerable level by means of interim salt storage underground and modern production processes. For a decade, Federal Republic of Germany [FRG] and German Democratic Republic [DDR] representatives negotiated over the introduction of salt into the Werra and Weser. Lower Saxony's environmental minister, Monika Griefahn, retrospectively sums up the failed endeavors: "The DDR authorities at that time simply were not interested in a solution." The change and production breakthrough in Thuringia's potash plants instantaneously yielded what politicians did not succeed in doing: the Werra and Weser will continue henceforth to be spared immense loads of salt. In peak periods the Werra was twice as salty as the North Sea. In 1988, from second to second, 226 kilograms [kg] of chloride were still being introduced into the Werra, as attested by measurements at the Gerstungen water depth gauge. Since then, to be sure, the chloride load has diminished by about two thirds. But even this easing of the pollution is still not enough to establish even merely approximately ecologically wholesome conditions in the flow of the Werra and Weser rivers. Stephan von Keitz of the Hessian environmental ministry puts it clearly: "As long as there is a potash industry in Germany we will not be able to convert the Werra into a fresh water river." In order to reduce the salt load to a tolerable amount and to keep the salt concentration constant, the laender bordering the Werra/Weser and federal environmental ministry are applying 70 million German marks [DM] to finance the construction of temporary storage sites for saline solutions at the East German potash centers of Merkers and Unterbreizbach. On weekdays the reservoirs are filled with salt water that is flushed into the Werra on "salt-free" weekends. Additionally, in the future underground storage of saline solutions in geological cavities of the dolomite slab is supposed to be used in Thuringia too. In Hesse the "subterranean bathtubs" are used as final storage sites for the saline effluents, whereas in Thuringia they are supposed to be used as temporary storage. If the Werra carries less water, the "tubs" are filled with saline solution. When more water is being carried the liquid effluent from the potash production is then pumped into the river. Hence the Werra in the final analysis is not spared a single ton of salt but the concentration of chloride can be kept constant. In this context, Juergen Hulsch, a water expert in the Lower Saxony environmental ministry, comments that the "buffering of the salt shocks" may often be more important for the Werra's and Weser's biosystem than the absolute salt load. An attempt at temporary underground storage is supposed to begin this week. The appropriate Thuringian water authorities still have not granted approval. They are afraid that the drinking water will be put at risk by the temporary submersion. Earlier in Hesse, slightly salty, standing water showed up in the cavities at the surfaces where the saline effluents of the potash industry were submerged. While only the salt concentration in the river can be kept constant using temporary storage, modern production processes make it possible to reduce the salt load much more effectively. Currently in Thuringia, potash (potassium chloride, KCl) is washed out. In a second wash cycle kieserite (magnesium sulfate) is separated from rock salt (NaCl). Hans-Joachim Scharf, an employee of Kali und Salz AG in Kassel explains: "Such washing of kieserite accounts for the accumulation of large quantities of saline effluents." The flotation process solves the salt separation much more elegantly: tiny air bubbles on the surfaces of the kieserite crystals give buoyancy to the kieserite. "It can be siphoned off as foam, while rock salt accumulates as solid residue and can be stockpiled," is Sharf's description of the process. The flotation process common in West German potash plants is now also being applied in Thuringia. On the other hand, the situation is otherwise with the electrostatic raw salt separation process [ESTA] that Kali und Salz AG has been using for a long time in West Germany. In the mostly effluent-free ESTA process, the different electrostatic charge of the salt minerals contained in the raw salt is exploited. In the initial stage rock salt is separated from the other salt minerals. In subsequent stages kieserite is separated from potash. Alfred Heinz, a chemist and potash specialist in Thuringia's environmental ministry, believes that high costs account for the ESTA process not being used in Thuringia's potash plants. Two-thirds less saline effluent results from the ESTA process. The other side of the coin is that the salt has to be stockpiled. According to Scharf, nearly 10 million tons [t] of waste salt were stockpiled in West Germany in 1992. Four million tons of salt were buried or introduced into the Werra. Clearing the stockpiles and compressing them back into the mines that have been worked is in fact possible and even done occasionally. According to Scharf, however, it is now universally feasible for economic reasons and would signal the end of potash production. The same argument applies to a solution proposed as early as the mid-seventies: creation of a salt-water pipeline from the Werra directly into the North Sea. Actually, the international potash market is marked by overcapacity and declining earnings. Mining in the German pits is steadily waning: between 1988 and 1993 total German demand dropped from 5.8 million t of K2O to three million tons of K2O. Hence, more potash was produced in the GDR than the merger of Kali und Salz (west) and Mitteldeutsche Kali (east) is at present jointly producing. Despite all the economic difficulties the endeavors of the laender bordering the Werra/Weser and the federation are pointing the way. Accordingly, the chloride presently being introduced into the Werra has to be reduced from nearly 70 kilograms [kg]/second [s] to 40 kg/s by 1995. Over the medium term this value should be cut in half once more. In terms of concentration this signifies 2,500 milligrams [mg] of chloride per liter of water in the Werra at the Gerstungen water depth gauge in 1995. In this connection chloride is merely the principal parameter for analysis, the actual amount of salt totals nearly twice as much. Federation and laender want to achieve a value of 500 mg/liter [l] for the Weser. Hulsch emphasizes: "As a result we will get just below the threshold of biological disruption. That would be tremendous progress considering that the Weser has now been virtually dead." Still, even then the city of Bremen would not be able to derive any potable water from the Weser since, according to potable water guidelines, the chloride concentration is not allowed to exceed 200 mg/l.
