It was signed by 70 countries. Russia has, however, officially announced it is not going to join this agreement. Sada Aksartova, a spokeswoman for the international ecological organisation Greenpeace, in commenting on the Russian Federation's stand, told a RIA correspondent it was a great mistake on the part of the Russian Government, and will evoke a highly negative response from the other countries. Among the major powers, according to Aksartova, only Australia, in addition to Russia, has refused to accede to the agreement, "taking time-out" for two years.
