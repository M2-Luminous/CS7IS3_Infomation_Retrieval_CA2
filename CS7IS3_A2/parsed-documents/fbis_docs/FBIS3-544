A team representing 15 civilian opposition parties yesterday complained to President Joaquim Chissano that they have been largely left out of the process that will lead to general elections in the country in October of this year. In a memorandum delivered personally to the Mozambican head of state, the team accused the government of monopolizing the state budget. That document also said that the unarmed opposition faces such financial difficulties that it has not even been able to select its representatives in the electoral, provincial, and district commissions. That document also accuses the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] of continuing to divide the country into two separate territories. This afternoon, we interviewed Inacio Chire of the National Convention Party, PCN. We began by asking him what difficulties the Mozambican civilian opposition is faced with at this stage. [Begin recording] [Chire] In practice, everything remained as it was during the days of the one-party system. There have been no major changes in terms of posture, leadership, or governance by the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] government. Thus, it continues to be very difficult to be in the opposition in this country. This has been a very difficult task for Mozambicans willing to bring about changes in the country. [Unidentified correspondent] What difficulties in particular? [Chire] For instance, only five parties have installations in Maputo. No party has installations in the provinces. [Correspondent] Which parties are you referring to? [Chire] The PCN, the Mozambican Nationalist Movement-Mozambique Social Democratic Party, the Mozambique United Front-Democratic Convergence Party, the Mozambique Peopre's Progress Party, and the Mozambican National Union. Although registered, the other parties have no installations. The parties I have just listed have no installations in almost every province of the country. So, you can imagine the situation, particularly at a time when elections are due to be held in seven months' time. There is also the question of funds. No party is entitled to draw funds from the State General Budget. The international community has made promises to give us funds, but there is nothing concrete. Only the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] has been receiving funds from the international community. Of course, the government has been using the State General Budget. Other difficulties have to do with the structures of a democratic state. There are no division of powers. There is no clear-cut separation between the state and the ruling party. So, you can imagine what the consequences are. We have always stood for the separation between the pacification process -- which includes the demobilization, confinement of troops, and selection of troops from the two sides for the new armed forces -- and the training of a so- called nonpartisan army. There can be no nonpartisan or even a national army when its forces are drawn from two parties. It is an army that can be easily dismembered at any time. That is what the experiences in other countries tell us. So, we believe that that process should only be dealt with by Frelimo, Renamo, and the United Nations because they are more directly involved in the process. There is, however, the process of democratization and of transition to democracy. We believe civil society as a whole should be involved in that process, not only political parties, but also every grouping. Unfortunately, in Mozambique the Frelimo government still wants to conduct the process on its own. [end recording]
