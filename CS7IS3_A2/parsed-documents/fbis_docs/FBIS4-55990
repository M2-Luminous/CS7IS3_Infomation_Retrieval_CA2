After the talks, Prime Minister Valentic told the reporters that in the informal talks with Slovene Prime Minister Drnovsek all the bilateral relations and problems between Croatia and Slovenia were tackled. "We established that many operative problems have been solved since the last time the Slovene prime minister officially visited Croatia. These problems involve the issue concerning Krsko, the signing of bilateral agreements, and the verifications of these agreements by the Croatian Parliament. We openly discussed other unsolved issues, such as the issue of agreements concerning the property-rights relations, that is, the regulation according to which it is still not possible in Croatia to privatize companies owned by other republics, and we believe that the Croatian Government will resolve that within a short period. We also discussed the well-known problem of Ljubljanska Banka, and agreed that within 30 days the ministers of finance will get in touch and propose an agreement acceptable to both sides. We have also arranged an official visit of the Croatian Government to Ljubljana in late June," said Nikica Valentic. The Croatian prime minister also remarked that there was talk of the Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees accommodated in the housing owned by Slovene companies in Pineta, which, as he pointed out, the Croatian Government considers a very complex problem. The Croatian Government will fulfill its obligations regarding the moving of the refugees from Pineta. The problem is that the refugees are in such a psychological and physical state that they are refusing to leave the facilities, and the Government would not like to throw them out, although they have already provided other accommodation for them. Commercial Prices for Pineta We believe that we will be able to solve that problem within a short period also, and the Croatian Government is prepared to compensate for damages and all the costs that have arisen with the refugees staying in the Slovenian companies' housing. We are prepared to buy these facilities from all the Slovenian companies, at commercial prices, and we will propose this to the owners next week. Naturally, those who do not accept the offer will remain owners, and retain all their rights, said prime minister Valentic. He also said that during the conversation with Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek the border crossings were discussed. "We believe we have coordinated our positions concerning all the crossings," said Valentic, remarking that Plovanija is a great problem for Croatia, since it is the main road entrance to Croatia from the west and through Slovenia. "The coming tourist season is very important for us, and this crossing, which is still an untidy building-site, represents a great problem. Next week we will send a letter to the Slovene Government and the public concerning this problem, and try to find a temporary solution for this tourist season, and the Croatian Government will provide guarantees that this does not prejudice any solution for the border lines," said Valentic. "We discussed the Piran Bay and supported the work of the committees. The Slovene Government stayed by their demand, and I believe that a solution acceptable to both sides will be found. It is important that there have been no incidents and that the cooperation between the police of the two countries is very good," said Prime Minister Valentic. He stated that the positions concerning the Yugoslav debts have been fully coordinated, and "we have made a joint demand that the succession process be speeded up. We have also agreed that solidaristic guarantees of the former Yugoslav debts by individual republics are out of the question. Instead, we want to take our debts after the succession and regularly service them, especially as Croatia and Slovenia can settle this debt. We will have the succession process speeded up, as this is in the interest of both countries," said the Croatian prime minister. Friendly Relations With Italy Speaking about the relations between the Republic of Croatia and Italy, Valentic said that the joint position of the two governments is that relations should be friendly, "because Italy is one of the most important European countries, and one of the most important neighbors must receive friendly treatment. We also established that no country can accept any discussion, let alone certain demands for the revision of the Osimo Accords, as it would mean changing the borders with all the negative consequences possible," said Prime Minister Nikica Valentic. Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek said that a revision of relations and open issues was made. He stated that the last meeting in Zagreb, held in February, was successful, saying that "some of the difficult issues remained open then, such as the Krsko nuclear power plant. The agreements concerning the plant are being implemented, the financing is going well, and the talks related to property issues are under way." With regard to Ljubljanska Banka in Zagreb, the positions are different. Drnovsek said that Slovenia wants the problem to be resolved within the succession of the former Yugoslavia, while Croatia has a different proposal. Both sides have been reviewing this problem, and some new solutions have been proposed. The next meeting of the representatives of the two countries is expected in June, which is when, as Drnovsek believes, there will be changes concerning the issue of Ljubljanska Banka.
