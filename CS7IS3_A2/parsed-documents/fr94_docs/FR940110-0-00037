FR940110-0-00037 FR940110-0-00012 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Parts 22, 25, 80, 87, 90, 95 and 99 [GN Docket No. 93-252; FCC 94&hyph;2] Private Land Mobile Licenses; Reclassification In the matter of implementation of sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act; Regulatory Treatment of Mobile Services. AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Procedures for waiver petitions. SUMMARY: As a result of recent legislation, certain private land mobile radio licensees will be reclassified as commercial mobile radio service licensees and will be subject to foreign ownership restrictions within the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. The Commission has now established a procedure by which such licensees may file a waiver petition with the Commission to request retention of existing foreign ownership that would otherwise not be permitted. Such waiver petitions must be received at the Commission by February 10, 1994. DATES: This document is effective January 10, 1994. Petitions for waiver must be filed with the Commission by February 10, 1994. ADDRESS: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M St. NW., Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: The Private Radio Bureau, Licensing Division, Consumer Assistance Branch, (717) 337&hyph;1212 (for information regarding the filing of waiver petitions). For information regarding this First Report and Order, contact Carmen Cintron at (202) 632&hyph;6450 (Common Carrier Bureau, Mobile Services Division) or Eric Malinen at (202) 632&hyph;6497 (Private Radio Bureau, Land Mobile and Microwave Division). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: First Report and Order Adopted: January 4, 1994; Released: January 5, 1994. By the Commission: I. Introduction 1. On September 23, 1993, we adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice) 1 in which we proposed, inter alia, to establish a procedure by which private land mobile radio licensees that will be reclassified as commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers pursuant to this rule making proceeding could file a waiver petition to retain existing foreign ownership. We now establish the filing procedure for these waiver petitions and remind all potentially affected licensees of the February 10, 1994, filing deadline. We also emphasize that filing such a petition will not prejudice the licensee's right at a later date to assert that it should not be classified as a CMRS provider. 1 GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252, 8 FCC Rcd 7988, 8002&hyph;03 ¶¶ 76&hyph;78 (1993), 58 FR 53169 (October 14, 1993). II. Background 2. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act) 2 amended sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 153(n), 332 (Communications Act), to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for all mobile radio services. ``[A]ny provider of a private land mobile service that will be treated as a common carrier as a result of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993'' is subject to the foreign ownership restrictions imposed on common carriers by section 310(b) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 310(b). 3 Nevertheless, the statute allows affected licensees to petition the Commission for waiver of the application of section 310(b) to any foreign ownership that lawfully existed as of May 24, 1993. The statute requires that these petitions for waiver be filed with the Commission by February 10, 1994 (within 6 months of enactment of the Budget Act). The Commission may grant such waivers to eligible petitioners only upon the following conditions: 2 Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;66, Title VI, §6002(b), 107 Stat. 312, 392, 395 (1993); see H.R. Conf. Rep.
