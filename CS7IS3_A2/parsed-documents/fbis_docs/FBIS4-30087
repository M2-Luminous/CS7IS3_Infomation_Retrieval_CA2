The government should pursue a new security policy on electric power generation in response to the recent marked increase in safety and maintenance levels amid a rapid improvement in product quality, the Electricity Utility Industry Council, an advisory organ to the trade minister, said. In an interim report presented to International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, the council said the government's direct involvement in security of power generation should be reduced to a minimum necessary level. How to maintain safety levels should thus basically be left to decision by each power supplier, with emphasis put on the principle of "self responsibility," the council said. Government controls should be limited to prevention of pollution and other areas that affect public safety, it said. Consumers of electricity should also share responsibility in maintaining security, the report said. The council recommended further improvement in safety and maintenance levels through new technology development. Standardization of power generation facilities and equipment should be promoted to upgrade overall security levels, it said.
