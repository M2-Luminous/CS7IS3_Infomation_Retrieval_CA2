FR941125-1-00046 FR941125-1-00009 Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed, stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return the postcard by mail. Effective Date The effective date of the final rule would be December 27, 1994. Because the final rule establishes no additional burden on any party, it is hereby tentatively found for good cause shown that an effective date for the amendments to Standard No. 108 that is earlier than 180 days after their issuance would be in the public interest. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This action has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 (NRM: We are submitting this notice to OST/OMB for determination of significance.) It has been determined that the rulemaking action is not significant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The purpose of the rulemaking action is to simplify compliance with Standard No. 108. Since the rule does not have any significant cost or other impacts, preparation of a full regulatory evaluation is not warranted. National Environmental Policy Act NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. It is not anticipated that a final rule based on this proposal would have a significant effect upon the environment. The design and composition of center high-mounted stop lamps would not change from those presently in production. Regulatory Flexibility Act The agency has also considered the impacts of this rulemaking action in relation to the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify that this rulemaking action would not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. Manufacturers of motor vehicles and stop lamps, those affected by the rulemaking action, are generally not small businesses within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Further, small organizations and governmental jurisdictions would not be significantly affected because the price of new vehicles and stop lamps would not be impacted. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) This rulemaking action has also been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and NHTSA has determined that this rulemaking action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Civil Justice A final rule based on this proposal would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103 (formerly section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard. Section 30163 (formerly 15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571 Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles. In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR Part 571 would be amended as follows: PART 571_FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS 1. The authority citation for Part 571 would continue to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 30111, 30115, 30162; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50. 2. Section 571.108 would be amended by revising Figure 10 as follows: §571.108 Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108 lamps, reflective devices, and associated equipment. * * * * * Figure 10._ Photometric Requirements for Center High-Mounted Stop Lamps 1Individual test points 1Minimum intensity (candela) 1Zones (test points within zones, see note 2) 1Minimum total for zone (candela) 10U&hyph;10L 8 Zone I (5U&hyph;V, H&hyph;5L, H&hyph;V, H&hyph;5R, 5D&hyph;V) 125 &hyph;V 16 ␣ l ␣ l &hyph;10R 8 ␣ l ␣ l 5U&hyph;10L 16 Zone II (5U&hyph;5R, 5U&hyph;10R, H&hyph;10R, 5D&hyph;10R, 5D&hyph;5R) 98 &hyph;5L 25 ␣ l ␣ l &hyph;V 25 ␣ l ␣ l &hyph;5R 25 ␣ l ␣ l &hyph;10R 16 ␣ l ␣ l 5D&hyph;10L 16 Zone III (5U&hyph;5L, 5U&hyph;10L, H&hyph;10L, 5&hyph;10L, 5D&hyph;5L) 98 &hyph;5L 25 ␣ l ␣ l &hyph;V 25 ␣ l ␣ l &hyph;5R 25 ␣ l ␣ l &hyph;10R 16 ␣ l ␣ l H&hyph;10L 16 Zone IV (10U&hyph;10L, 10U&hyph;V, 10U&hyph;10R) 32 &hyph;5L 25 ␣ l ␣ l &hyph;V 25 ␣ l ␣ l &hyph;5R 25 ␣ l ␣ l &hyph;10R 16 ␣ l ␣ l ␣ i0Maximum intensity (candela) See note 1 160 Note 1: The listed maximum shall not occur over any area larger than that generated by a 1/4 degree radius within a solid cone angle within the rectangle bounded by test points 10U&hyph;10L, 10U&hyph;10R, 5D&hyph;10L, and 5D&hyph;10R.
