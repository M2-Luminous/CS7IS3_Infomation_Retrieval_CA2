Therefore, it was necessary for me to pay cordial visits to several friendly countries, like Syria, which are playing an important role and to contact these countries' governments to discuss the final proposals to be made during the organization's upcoming meetings. This is my first visit to this country after I assumed my position in the organization, and I hope the visit will give me a chance to meet with officials in the Syrian Government to thank them for their contributions to the organization.
