The committee, which is chaired by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and Israeli Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq, will meet next week. The delay will allow the committee to take into account the outcome of the talks Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa is holding in Israel with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. According to responsible Palestinian sources, the Israelis are showing some flexibility in handling the Palestinian requests. In return, the Palestinians are showing understanding of Israeli security concerns. The sources say that 'Arafat and Peres agreed during their meeting in Oslo that the Palestinian flag will be hoisted on the buildings that will be set up on the crossing points between Jericho and Jordan and between Gaza and Egypt to administer travel procedures. An Israeli security official will monitor the flow of travelers from behind a smoked, one-way mirror. [passage omitted]
