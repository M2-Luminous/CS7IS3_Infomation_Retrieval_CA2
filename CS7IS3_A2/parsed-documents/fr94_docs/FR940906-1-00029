FR940906-1-00029 FR940906-1-00012 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION 48 CFR Parts 10 and 52 [FAR Case 92&hyph;44] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Reconditioned Material AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to combine the clauses at 52.210&hyph;5 and 52.210&hyph;7 as an acquisition streamlining measure. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before November 7, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW, Room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 92-44 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jack O'Neill at (202) 501&hyph;3856 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;44. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The clauses at FAR 52.210&hyph;5, New Material, and at FAR 52.210&hyph;7, Used or Reconditioned Material, Residual Inventory, and Former Government Surplus Property, address the condition of material to be furnished under Government contracts. This proposed rule adds the requirements of the clause at 52.210&hyph;7 to the clause at 52.210&hyph;5 and revises the title of the clause to read ``Acceptable Material''. Corresponding changes are made to the clause prescription at FAR 10.011(e). B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because the rule merely rearranges and clarifies existing requirements. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 92&hyph;44), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paper Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.
