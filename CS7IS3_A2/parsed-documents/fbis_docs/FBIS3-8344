Merliha Colo reports: [Begins Colo recording] The members of the parliamentary commission at today's session discussed the general agreement for the formation of a federation on those Bosnia-Herzegovina territories with a majority Bosniak and Croatian population, and a framework for the preliminary agreement on principles and bases for the formation of a confederation between the Republic of Croatia and the Bosnian federation. Secretary General of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly [word indistinct] Sampara explained the main provisions contained in the general agreement on the federation of the Bosniaks, the Muslims, and the Croats concerning the structure of the central state authorities. The agreement envisages that the assembly of the future republic will consist of two chambers -- a chamber of deputies and a chamber of peoples. The chamber of deputies will have 120 seats and will consist of deputies from political parties, while the other chamber, the chamber of peoples, is seen as having 90 deputies -- 30 each from the Croatian and Muslim communities, and 30 from other ethnic groups. The president and vice president of the state, as well as the prime minister and deputy prime minister, would be from each of the ethnic groups, while the foreign minister and defense minister could not come from the same ethnic group. Several members of the commissions said that the existing draft is more generalized that it should have been and, as such, does not answer numerous questions concerning the future constitutional-legal order of the Bosnian federation as well as purely procedural matters, for example, in what manner will the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly and its bodies take part in the passing of a future constitution. The presentation by Dr. Haldo Causevic was interesting. He pointed at several terminological imprecisions in the agreement that create dilemmas and hide legal traps. For example, it is not defined whether by forming the new federation, the state and legal sovereignty of the existing Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina will be forfeited and whether the new state community will be able to inherit its rights. The agreement is also not precise in the part in which it outlines the territories of the future state, while the territories and the peoples are the two pillars of each state. In deciding about these and other controversial issues, not a single step further must be made without activating the work of the republican assembly, which must adopt a stance toward them, it was concluded at today's session of the republican assembly commissions.
