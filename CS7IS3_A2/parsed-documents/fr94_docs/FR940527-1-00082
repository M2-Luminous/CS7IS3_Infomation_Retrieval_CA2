FR940527-1-00082 FR940527-1-00014 (6) Primary culturing for transmittal to a certified laboratory. We note that this change would not prevent any RPCH from providing tests that are not listed in §485.635(b)(2). An RPCH is free to choose a higher level CLIA certification than the certificate of waiver if it wishes to provide tests of a higher complexity and to comply with all CLIA requirements. The current regulations do not set out a clear and consistent position on the applicability of the advance directives requirement. Under the regulations in §485.645(b)(1), swing-bed RPCHs are required to meet a number of skilled nursing facility (SNF) requirements, including §483.10(b)(4). That regulation requires that the patient be given the right to make an advance directive. (An advance directive is a written instruction, such as a living will or a durable power of attorney for health care, that deals with the provision of health care when the individual is incapacitated. See Subpart I of 42 CFR Part 489.) Thus, the regulations apply the advance directives requirement to RPCH inpatients receiving a SNF level of care in swing beds, but not to inpatients receiving RPCH care. We believe the RPCH benefit could be administered more simply and equitably if both hospitals and RPCHs were required to comply with the same advance directives requirement. As explained in the preamble to the May 26, 1993 final rule on EACHs (58 FR 30635&hyph;30636), as authorized by section 1861(e) of the Act, we have read the word ``hospital'' to include RPCHs where the context appears to support such a reading. We believe the context of section 1866(a)(1)(Q) of the Act would support this reading, since many patients are likely to seek RPCH care as an alternative to treatment in a hospital or SNF, and many RPCHs will accept patients who are at risk of the kind of incapacitating condition addressed by an advance directive. Thus, we propose to revise the regulations at §489.102 to provide for more consistent application of the advance directive requirement, by specifying that it will apply to RPCHs on the same basis as to hospitals. We believe this approach is simpler to administer and expands beneficiary rights. Moreover, since all prospective RPCHs must be (or have been) hospitals and have been required to meet the advance directive requirement, there should not be any added burden. I. Clarification of Payment to RRC/EACH Hospitals We wish to clarify a response in the EACH final rule of May 26, 1993 (58 FR 30639&hyph;30640), regarding the effect on a rural referral center's (RRC) payment rate should it elect to become an EACH. An RRC that elects to become an EACH is considered to have dual classification; that is, it is classified as an RRC/EACH. Since section 1886(d)(5)(D)(iii)(III) of the Act specifies that an EACH is to be treated as an sole community hospital (SCH), in determining which of the three payment rates will yield the highest aggregate payment, we will use the ``other'' standardized amount in determining the Federal payment rate for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994. (As discussed above, as of that date, the other urban and rural payment rates will be the same.) For discharges occurring before October 1, 1994, the Federal payment rate is based on the ``other urban'' payment rate. Thus, an RRC that elects to become an EACH is paid based on whichever of the following rates yields the greatest aggregate payment for the cost reporting period: •The national Federal rate applicable to the hospital (that is, other urban before October 1, 1994 and ``other'' on or after that date); •The updated hospital-specific rate using FY 1982 cost per discharge; or •The updated hospital-specific rate using the FY 1987 cost per discharge. J. Direct Graduate Medical Education Payment (§413.86) 1. Definition of Initial Residency Period Section 1886(h)(4) of the Act bases payment for direct graduate medical education (GME) costs on the hospital's number of full-time equivalent (FTE) residents multiplied by a hospital-specific adjusted base year per resident amount. The number of FTE residents is determined by applying a weighting factor to each FTE resident. A resident in an initial residency period is weighted as 1.0 FTE. Residents in approved training programs that are beyond their initial residency period are required by law to be counted as .50 FTE. The initial residency period is defined at §413.86(g)(1), as the minimum number of years of formal training necessary to satisfy the requirements for initial board eligibility in the particular specialty plus 1 year, not to exceed 5 years. Section 13563(b) of Public Law 103&hyph;66 amended section 1886(h)(5)(F) of the Act by deleting ``plus one year'' from the statutory definition of initial residency period, effective July 1, 1995. To conform the regulations to the statute, we propose to revise §413.86(g)(1) by specifying that, effective July 1, 1995, an initial residency period is defined as the minimum number of years required for board eligibility.
