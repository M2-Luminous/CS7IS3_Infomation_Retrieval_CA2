FBIS3-27942 "dreas021__a94015" FBIS-EAS-94-021-A Document Type:Daily Report 1 February 1994 ANNEX Japan MITI Abandons Joint YXX Aircraft Project OW2901063194 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 27 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 7 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2901063194 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] revealed on 26 January that it is, in effect, cancelling the project to develop the next-generation medium passenger airplane (YXX) which was being worked on jointly by Japanese airplane makers and the U.S. Boeing company. This follows Boeing's decision not to use the YXX (called the 7J7 by Boeing) to replace the current Boeing 737. The decision meant, in effect, that even if the YXX was developed, sales would never be enough to make it economical. As a result, Japan's aircraft development plans will shrink to one, the next-generation small passenger plane (YSX). The MITI and the Japanese aircraft makers will hold negotiations with foreign makers, including Boeing, Saab-Scania of Sweden, and Aviation Industries of China, to select a partner this year to share development costs of the YSX. Japanese heavy industrial companies and Boeing conducted market research for the YXX, which was to be a medium passenger aircraft capable of carrying 150 passengers. However, last fall Boeing unilaterally decided to give priority to remodeling the Boeing 737 as the 737-X and using it to replace its existing Boeing 737 because this option was than development of the YXX. As a result, the MITI and Japanese aircraft makers have decided to withdraw from the development project, concluding that if Japan tried to go it alone the YXX would be more expensive than the Boeing 737-X. The Japanese partners in the project are expected to withdraw from the project some time this year after consulting Boeing. The MITI is now shifting its attention from development of the YXX to development of the YSX. In formulating its budget for next year, the MITI will ask the Ministry of Finance to allocate only 500 million yen to the YXX project -- for payment of interest on the past development costs -- but to allocate 1.6 billion yen, 16 times the YSX development project received this year. Japan has not developed any civil passenger aircraft since the "YS-11." The MITI wants to do everything to develop the genuinely Japanese-made YSX as a replacement for the "YS-11" in order to help defend Japan's aviation industry technology. It is hoped to use the YSX on domestic routes, the so-called "niche market," in which there is no competition from aircraft made by European and U.S. manufacturers.
