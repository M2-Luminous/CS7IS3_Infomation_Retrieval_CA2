Urge for Light. German World Market Leaders Want to Strengthen Their Position With Higher Beam Power"] [Excerpts] [[passage omitted] The laser is more and more developing into a wonder weapon in the struggle for international competitiveness. And technology for the future is one of the few areas in which the Germans are ahead technologically. "The Japanese are simply not up to date here," asserts Arnold Mayer, chief executive of Optech Consulting in Bieseingen and one of the best authorities on the scene. Welding and three-dimensional cutting above all are provinces of the Germans. In these most important fields of application for CO[.sub]2[/] and solid-state lasers they profited strongly from the automobile industry's innovation drive during the 80's. Today there is hardly a single passenger car maker that does not cut, drill, mark or process with the aid of lasers. Most recently small and medium-size companies have also been feeling the urge for light, especially in the electrical and electronics industry. Point-precision microsurgical intervention in integrated circuits is possible with lasers. Precision welding and soldering are also no problem for a light beam. Added to this is the flexibility of the tool, which enables the economical production of even small lots down to single pieces. Still the marketing of laser machines is making no progress. "The high investment," says an industry observer, "is at the moment not possible for most companies." For better or worse, laser manufacturers are tied to the situation in the machine building industry, which is only slowly improving. For instance, the domestic demand for lasers last year dropped by 20 percent to 600 systems. Only exports saved the German laser industry from a nose dive. The dynamically growing U.S. market represented a substantial share of this. Even Rofin Sinar Laser GmbH, world market leader in the manufacture of CO[.sub]2[/] lasers, is "distinctly in the red," admits chief executive Samuel Simonsson. After the success of the 80's the Siemens subsidiary set its mind totally on expansion. Today part of the just recently developed site of a passenger car dealer is being used for a warehouse. "Our great expectations have not been fulfilled," Simonsson laments. Now management is placing its hopes on a new development, the so-called diffusion-cooled CO[.sub]2[/] laser. In conventional systems large quantities of the gas have to be circulated because it gets hot. Part of the carbon dioxide is routinely removed in order to reduce the contaminants that originate in the process. In the new development the gas is cooled as the laser light forms, so that the tremendous technical input for circulation is done away with. Because of this the new CO[.sub]2[/] laser is smaller and more flexible. Rofin Sinar is presenting at Metav in Duesseldorf--the metal machining show that starts on May 3--a model having a power of 2 kilowatts. The immediate objective is to double this.
