Earlier drafts of the Radon Science Initiative Report were released to the public, and the document is currently undergoing revision. Other topics at the meeting should include a continuing discussion on Cleanup Standards, planning for an upcoming review on EMF and Carcinogenicity, briefings or consultations from the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA) staff on Low Level Waste Research and other topics as time permits. The RAC will also discuss briefly the anticipated Fiscal Year 1995 review topics.

The Environmental Futures Committee (EFC) was formed by the SAB at the request of Administrator Browner to assist the Agency in anticipating environmental problems, issues and opportunities. The charge to this Committee includes: developing a procedure for short and long-term forecasting of natural and anthropogenic developments which may affect environmental quality and its protection; develop detailed examinations procedures and apply them to some future developments; and draw implications from the examinations of future developments and recommend actions for EPA to address them. At these meetings, the EFC will receive briefings on Futures issues; discuss the overall progress of the project (including tracking the activities of the SAB Standing Committees that are involved in the project); and begin to outline its draft report. These meetings are open to the public, but seating is limited and available on a first come basis.
