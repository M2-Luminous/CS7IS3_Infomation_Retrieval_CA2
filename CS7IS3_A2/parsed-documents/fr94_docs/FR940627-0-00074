The additions and revisions read as follows: §1.414(r)&hyph;3 Separate line of business. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (4) Separate employee workforce. *␣*␣* A line of business has its own separate workforce only if at least 90 percent of the employees who provide services to the line of business, and who are not substantial-service employees with respect to any other line of business, are substantial-service employees with respect to the line of business. *␣*␣* (c) *␣*␣* (2) *␣*␣* (ii) The denominator of which is the total number of employees who provide services to the line of business within the meaning of paragraph (c)(5) of this section and who are not substantial-service employees with respect to any other line of business. * * * * * (4) Employees taken into account. For purposes of applying this paragraph (c), only employees who are employees on the first testing day are taken into account. For this purpose, there are no excludable employees except nonresident aliens described in section 410(b)(3)(C). Consequently, all other employees who are employees on the first testing day are taken into account, including collectively bargained employees. For the definition of first testing day, see §1.414(r)&hyph;11(b)(7). (5) *␣*␣* (iii) Optional rule for employees who change status _(A) In general. Solely for purposes of the separateness rules of this section and the assignment rules of §1.414(r)&hyph;7, if an employee changes status as described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, an employer may, for up to three consecutive testing years after the base year (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) of this section), treat the employee as providing the same level of service to its lines of business as the employee provided in the base year. (B) Change in employee's status. An employee changes status as described in this paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) if_ ( 1 ) For a testing year (the base year), the employee was a substantial-service employee with respect to a qualified separate line of business of the employer (prior line of business) and, for the immediately succeeding testing year, the employee is not a substantial-service employee with respect to that prior line of business; or ( 2 ) For a testing year (the base year), the employee was a residual shared employee and, for the immediately succeeding testing year, the employee is a substantial-service employee with respect to a qualified separate line of business. (c) *␣*␣* (6) *␣*␣* Unless otherwise specified, it is assumed that the employees and their services described in these examples are taken into account under paragraphs (c) (4) and (5) of this section for the testing year and that the employer does not use the option under §1.414(r)&hyph;11(b)(2) to treat employees who provide less than 75 percent of their services to a line of business as substantial-service employees with respect to the line of business. * * * * * Example 2. *␣*␣* Moreover, because Employees M and N provide at least 75 percent of their services to Employer A's tire and automotive products line of business and are substantial-service employees with respect to that line, they are disregarded in applying paragraph (b)(4) of this section to any other line of business, even if they provide services to the other line. * * * * * Example 5. *␣*␣* Under the definition of substantial-service employee in §1.414(r)&hyph;11(b)(2), Employer A may treat Employee R as a substantial-service employee with respect to the tire and automotive products line of business because Employee R provides at least 50 percent of his services to that line. In that case, Employee R would be disregarded in applying paragraph (b)(4) of this section to the construction machinery and agricultural equipment lines of business. * * * * *
