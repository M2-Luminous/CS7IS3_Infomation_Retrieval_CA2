Noting that though nearly a year has passed since the Kim Yong- sam regime made its appearance, styling itself a "civilian government," nothing has changed in South Korea, the author of the article says: As for the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime, it is the "second-term fascist government of the Sixth Republic", an offspring of the "Sixth Republic" of No Tae-u who made himself infamous with treacheries, fascism and murder. In advertising "civilian administration," Kim Yong-sam the traitor has sought to veil the ugly color of his regime, not to shape any civilian politics. What the Kim Yong-sam group has done under the "civilian" veil has been to put the people under heavier yoke of colonial slavery and bind them tighter to fascist chains, to drive the economy and the people's living to the worst phase with deceptive "reforms" and bring the situation of the country to the brink of war. With the traitorous and fascist nature of the "civilian" regime and the fictitious nature of the "reforms" advertised by it fully revealed, the South Korean people have nothing to expect from it. What they have to do now is to finally settle scores with the false "civilian" regime. The crafty "civilian" dictatorship is more heinous than the brutal military dictatorship and the former's consequences are more serious. Kim Yong-sam is a rare fascist, warmaniac and traitor who would unhesitatingly turn the whole of South Korea into a sea of blood and plunge the nation into a nuclear holocaust for his personal comfort and distinction and maintenance of his power. The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique is destined to meet a disgraceful doom in face of the strong resistance of the pro-reunification democratic forces.
