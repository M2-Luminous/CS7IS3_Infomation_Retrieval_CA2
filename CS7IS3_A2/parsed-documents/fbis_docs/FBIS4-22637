Many political forces link their plans for economic and political reforms in Russia with these people. During the recently held elections, there were no voting blocks which did not declare their support for entrepreneurship. An even larger number of parties, associations, funds, etc., claimed that they, and only they, have the right to speak in the name of the entrepreneurs and to represent their interests. Who is he, the Russian entrepreneur? Primarily, it is not the political sympathies of the entrepreneurs but their parameters as business partners that interest us. Let us avail ourselves of the materials from a survey of participants in the Second International Congress of Small and Average Entrepreneurship in Russia, which was held in Moscow during the summer of 1993. A total of 1,300 entrepreneurs from all regions of Russia participated in its work at the time. One-tenth responded to the questionnaire of the New East Society, which conducted this survey jointly with the Russian Management Personnel Consulting and Research Center. There were no big businessmen at the congress. Those, who had practically not yet begun active entrepreneurial activity but who were just taking the first steps in it, were also not present. In a word, we will talk about the normal Russian entrepreneurs. Where did they come from? The opinion is prevalent that former CPSU workers and criminal elements basically became entrepreneurs. Possibly, such exist. However, our information says that 46.6 percent of the entrepreneurs came from production, 18.8 percent worked in VUZ [higher educational institutions] and scientific establishments, another 6.75 percent were students, and 3 percent were servicemen. Only 13.5 percent came from the state apparatus and less than 3.3 percent from the party and Komsomol. With all the shake-ups that have occurred in the management staff during recent years, one should only welcome the fact that a part of the bureaucrats decided to earn money on their own and not settle into the next "office." The opinion that, except for cunning and cleverness, an entrepreneur does not need either special brains or education, was also not confirmed. It is difficult to talk about intellect; we did not conduct an intellectual testing. There is total order with respect to the entrepreneurs' education. A total of 90 percent have a higher education and 13.5 percent an academic degree besides. The majority (63.9 percent) are engineers; 30.8 percent -- economists; 12 percent -- humanities graduates; 3.75 percent -- jurists, etc. Several have two and even three higher educational diplomas. Almost half have a good command of the English language; 18.8 percent -- the German; substantially fewer know other languages. There were not so few women among the respondents -- 20.3 percent. A total of 83.5 percent were married. Despite the widespread opinion that entrepreneurial activity has a bad influence on family life, there were not many among those surveyed who were divorced -- 6 percent. Here is the composition of the surveyed entrepreneurs by age (see Table No 1). Table 1 Age Up to 26-30 31-35 36-40 41-50 51-60 Older 25 than 60 Percent 1.5 9.0 12.8 19.5 37.6 13.5 1.5 Thus, it is basically people, who are already mature and who have a good life experience, that engage in entrepreneurship. The motivation for their activity also confirms this. To the question: "What motivates you to engage in entrepreneurial activity?" the following answers were received: - the desire for independence and self-realization -- 52.0 percent. - the desire to provide material independence for myself -- 45.1 percent. - the wish to carry out my own plans and to incorporate my own ideas and works -- 45.1 percent. - the wish to make my own contribution to the forming of a market economy --32.3 percent. - the absence of other types of activity -- 0.75 percent. It is quite clear that not hopelessness but a completely deliberate choice led the respondents to entrepreneurship. When answering another question about whether they would again make this selection now, 91 percent confidently said: "Yes" and only 0.75 percent said: "No." This is particularly important because 57.2 percent of the surveyed entrepreneurs can be called veterans. They began to engage in this activity during the period from 1985 to 1990, inclusive. A total of 32.3 percent became entrepreneurs during 1991-1992 and only 2.25 percent can be called beginners. (In a number of cases, the total is somewhat less than 100 percent because some did not answer this question; in other cases, it is more than 100 percent because a respondent could mark several versions of answers). The information about the type of the activity and the nature of the enterprises is of undoubted interest. Based on form of ownership, 50.4 percent are joint-stock companies: 33 percent -- private individual ones; and 6.0 percent -- cooperatives. A total of 5.3 percent have foreign capital. Among the surveyed entrepreneurs, 42.1 percent are joint owners of their enterprises, 30.0 percent are stockholders, 20.3 percent work on contract, and 9.0 percent are individual owners. Based on number of workers, the enterprises are distributed in the following manner (see Table No 2). Table 2 Number 6-10 11-20 21-50 51-100 101-250 251-500 More than 500 Percent 8.3 14.3 15.8 16.5 20.3 5.3 4.5 From the cited table, it is clearly seen that we are dealing in a very strict sense with small and average entrepreneurs. Almost half of these enterprises are located in oblast and kray centers and other large cities; 30.0 percent are in small cities. A total of 22.5 percent of the respondents were from Moscow or Saint Petersburg. As was already mentioned above, practically all regions of Russia were represented in the sampling. Before describing the type of activity, one should point out that the majority of firms in Russia have been forced to engage in different types of work. Under conditions where a market is only being formed and where the norms regulating the activity of entrepreneurs frequently change, it is impossible, as they say, to put all your eggs in one basket. In addition, assets have a very rapid turnover in trade. Nevertheless, the strategic trend in the development of Russian entrepreneurship -- the production of goods and services -- is being clearly tracked; this is evident from the table: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Types of activity |Percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Industrial production, construction a-|48.7 | |nd repairs | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Retail and procurement activity |37.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Commercial middleman operations |29.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Diversified activity |24.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Innovation activity |13.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Consulting activity |12.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Transport services |9.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Agricultural production |9.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Operations with money and securities |7.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Organizing spare time |6.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Housing and municipal and consumer se-|4.5 | |rvices | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Artistic trade |3.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other types |9.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Among the most important factors having a positive or negative impact on the activity of small and average enterprises, almost three-quarters of the surveyed entrepreneurs mentioned state laws; half -- relations with banks; 30.8 percent each -- monetary assets and the qualifications of personnel; and 26.3 percent -- relations with local authorities. Other factors disturb them considerably less, for example, production practices -- 7.5 percent; and production costs -- 6.3 percent. Only 6.7 percent of the respondents mentioned the racket, about which so much is said and written. However, even the mentioned problems do not reduce the level of optimism in our respondents. To the directly posed question about the degree of their confidence in the success of their business, they answered: Have complete confidence -- 37.6 percent; basically convinced -- 44.4 percent. Only 0.75 percent have a complete lack of confidence. The block of questions concerning the foreign economic activity of the entrepreneurs was extremely full. A total of 62.3 percent of them have foreign partners. However, only about half have specific projects with them. Just as many respondents regularly go abroad. A total of 23.3 percent of those surveyed have never traveled abroad. An absolute majority of the entrepreneurs (87.2 percent) emphasized that they need the assistance of consulting firms to establish contacts with the necessary organizations and businessmen abroad and an organizational accompaniment for implementing agreements and contracts. A total of 38.3 percent of the entrepreneurs indicated their lack of sufficient information about the interests of foreign partners and conditions for activity abroad as the main difficulty in their foreign economic activity. In the opinion of the entrepreneurs, the most preferred types of cooperation are: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Types of cooperation |percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Investments in Russia |54.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Joint enterprise |45.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Selling products abroad |31.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Purchasing products abroad |29.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Using Western technology and know-how |24.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Using Russian technology and know-how |18.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russian investments abroad |3.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The proposal about possible investments from Russia occupies the last line. Meanwhile, this is a completely realistic possibility. Actually, free capacities frequently exist in Western countries for producing a number of the products required by Russia. The problem is not a simple one; however, it deserves very careful study. The problem of Western investments in the Russian economy still has great urgency. We are talking about private investments. The following conditions are required for this: 1) The possibility to select an investment project from correctly formulated proposals of equal value; 2) Support and written guarantees from regional (oblast, kray, republic) management bodies; 3) Professional consulting accompaniment for organizational, legal and all other types of questions on the part of a Russian or Russian-German firm. If one is talking about the projects of small and average business, this is quite sufficient to begin work. The political risk has practically no serious relationship to this subject. The political line of entrepreneurship itself is the policy of concrete affairs in the area of a market economy. It is no accident that 70.7 percent of those surveyed did not participate in the activity of parties and social movements. They are engaged in business and building the foundation of a new economy. Of course, we are not pioneers in the area of a market economy; many countries have achieved great success on this path. In the opinion of the Russian entrepreneurs, which one is of most interest to us? Germany -- 39.1 percent, USA -- 28.6 percent, South Korea -- 21.0 percent, China -- 17.3 percent, Japan -- 15.8 percent, Sweden -- 13.5 percent A considerably smaller number of respondents indicated the experience of other countries. This information makes one wonder. Look at the bookshelves of Russian stores. Are there many books on the experience of the FRG? At a minimum, nine out of ten books are devoted to the experience of the United States or other English-speaking countries. The lack of the required amount of necessary knowledge and experience transfers is becoming a serious problem that must be solved by joint efforts.
