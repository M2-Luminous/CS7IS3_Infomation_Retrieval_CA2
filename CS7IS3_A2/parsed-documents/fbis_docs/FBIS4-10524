FBIS4-10524 "drlat072_b_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 Haiti Sansaricq `Optimistic' on Support in Chamber of Deputies Sansaricq `Optimistic' on Support in Chamber of Deputies FL1304212594 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole in French 1600 GMT 13 Apr 94 FL1304212594 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole French BFN [Text] Despite the negative reaction reported at the lower chamber regarding the 10 April resolution demanding the installation of the president of the Court of Cassation, the president of the Senate opposition office, Bernard Sansaricq, shows great optimism. For Senator Sansaricq, the text of this resolution will receive the approval of the deputies. He warns the populace against rumors of [someone's] taking the office of Justice Jonassaint. Sen. Sansaricq specifies that the Senate he leads is expecting a green light from the deputies. [Begin recording] [Sansaricq] I am very optimistic, and I believe the Chamber of Deputies will definitively shoulder its responsibilities and pass the resolution. We have many deputies, I repeat, who agree with this resolution; I think it will be passed this week or, at latest, next week, and we are waiting for its passage so that the resolution has full impact. If the Chamber of Deputies commits the mistake, before history, of not approving this resolution, then at that time we will think of a solution to take, but not now. Right now, we are optimistic that it is going to be passed by the Chamber of Deputies. [Reporter Francois] Have you already contacted Justice Jonassaint in that regard? [Sansaricq] I can tell you that officially we were waiting for the result of the vote on the resolution in the Chamber of Deputies in order to contact Justice Jonassaint. Unofficially, contacts with him have been made by some senators. I can tell you that Justice Jonassaint is a patriot, a nationalist, a man who definitely will fulfill the duty that he must fulfill toward the nation. It is a page of history that we are writing, and I do not think that the Chamber of Deputies is going to shy from a constitutional duty. The Legislative Palace is also ours. It was built by President Dumarsais Estime for the use of both chambers. No one can prevent us from entering our home. There are all kinds of rumors spreading about how so-and-so will be appointed prime minister; the installation will take place today. No! We are doing what is right, a historic action for the nation, and we want to come out great in the eyes of history and the Haitian people. We ask the populace not to believe those rumors and to remain calm. [end recording]
