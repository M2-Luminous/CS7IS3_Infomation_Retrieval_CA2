You, Brazilian workers in any position or activity, have just received your first salary in URV's [real value units]. In practice it is the first time we have felt the effect of the stabilization program in the workers' incomes. I know, however, that people still have many doubts, as a lot was said about alleged salary losses as a consequence of the conversion of salaries into URV's. The truth, however, is that no one has been able to demonstrate that these losses have in fact taken place. On the contrary, in some cases there have been salary gains. This is why I agreed with President Itamar Franco that tonight I would address the nation to explain the economic plan a little bit more. For us workers, for most of us who receive a salary with which to face family expenses, the economic program yields many advantages. To receive a salary in URV's is to receive a salary corrected daily according to inflation. Contrary to other plans, our program began with the protection of salaries. Housewives who go to the supermarket know better than anyone else that salaries always lagged behind prices. No matter how many salary increases or salary readjustment triggers were applied, they never served to protect salaries. This time it is different. With the URV salaries will run hand in hand with the prices in real cruzeiros, at the same speed. In addition, at this stage industrialists and businessmen, along with the government, are converting contracts, prices, and utility rates into URV's. Well then, you may now ask yourselves: And the prices in real cruzeiros? Don't they continue increasing every single day? It is true, as I said before, that at this stage prices in real cruzeiros continue to increase while salaries lag behind. We need to stop this price stampede, because only a few privileged people obtain gains with it. At present salaries are already in URV's, and the prices that have already been converted into URV's are ceasing to increase. Why? Because whoever signs a contract in URV's stops readjusting prices. Thus, the price of things remain the same. The government remains alert, as with beer and medicines. With the April salary you will be able to buy the same things you bought with the salary of March, the first one that was corrected. Today many products and services have two prices: one in real cruzeiros, which continues to be readjusted, and another in URV's, which remains stable and is also the measure of the value of your salary. The result is that commerce has increased its sales and people can buy goods in URV's with credits, without inflation, and without black market quotations. Soon, given that salaries and prices will both be expressed in URV's, prices in real cruzeiros will no longer mean anything. Soon we will arrive at the much expected moment. Instead of only changing the name of the currency we will change the currency itself. But this will take place when the URV complies with its other role, which is to give producers and businessmen the conditions to foresee their costs and thus stabilize prices. The new currency will come when the URV finishes its work. Only then will the new real come into circulation, substituting for the URV, ending the real cruzeiro, and it will be the new currency of a Brazil without inflation. It will be a strong currency, like that of the developed countries; a currency that is valuable because inflation will be low, the economy will work, and salaries will have purchasing power. We are making these changes without surprises, frights, without hurriedness, carefully discussing each of the next steps of the program. We will announce the implementation of the real at least 35 days before it is put into circulation. We now have a great chance, perhaps a unique chance to end an inflation that is destroying Brazil. We have begun by putting the house in order, balancing the government accounts, cutting expenses, and chasing tax evaders to increase tax collection. We would all like to have a higher minimum salary and see all salaries raised. But let us be honest -- right now that kind of increase would be unrealistic, because it would further fuel inflation. Furthermore, it would bring a serious imbalance to the government's budget. Just to give you an idea, an increase in the minimum salary may ultimately cause the social security system, and many state and city governments, to go bankrupt. The Itamar Franco administration has never thought that it could save the nation without the support of each Brazilian citizen; that is, without the help of workers, businessmen, housewives, students, and political leaders. We must all shoulder this responsibility. I once again appeal to political leaders, to all candidates, to the members of Congress, and to the judicial branch about the need for them to understand the stabilization program. Please give this program a chance. Those economic packages that had instituted shock treatments, price and salary freezes, bank holidays, and even confiscation of savings were all approved by Congress, which gave these programs the chance to be put to the test. It would be an enormous injustice if the first truly democratic economic plan -- which does not contain either shock treatments, surprises, or any form of violence -- should be denied the same vote of confidence. Congress -- which is sensitive to the feelings, anxieties and hopes of the Brazilian people -- knows that it should pave the way for the implementation of a program that meets every condition required to be successful. This program does, however, need a chance to prove itself. Let us not deceive ourselves or the public. Without economic stability, we will not be able to increase salaries, correct injustices, or enable the government to discharge its duties concerning health, education, public security, and retirees. This is the first time that a government, instead of spending more in an election year, is proposing a plan that reduces its own expenditures so that the next government, irrespective of who forms it, may inherit a sound economy. All of those who are seeking to rule the nation beginning next year should understand that they will be unable to keep their promises if they assume a government that is undergoing an economic crisis with a high inflation rate, a government which would thus be rendered incapable of discharging its most basic duties. The Brazilian people will not tolerate it if selfish interests prevent the implementation of the economic program in the coming decisive weeks. The fact of the matter is that we all know that. It is in the best interests of Brazilian voters to put an end to inflation, and not in hearing once again promises that will not bring solutions to the country's problems. And the worst socioeconomic problem in Brazil today is inflation. This is our main challenge, the target of our struggle. With the help of God and of all Brazilians, we will achieve our goal to build a better, more just country where there is no inflation, and where money and salaries may reward the efforts of the working class. Thank you and good night.
