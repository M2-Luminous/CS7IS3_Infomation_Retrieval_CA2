Hata aims to establish personal rapport with European leaders ahead of the July summit in Naples, Italy, of the Group of Seven (G- 7) major industrialized nations, Foreign Ministry officials said. The visit should also serve to strengthen political ties between Japan and the European Union, they said. The trip was originally scheduled for January by then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, but was postponed until May due to tight domestic political schedules. [passage omitted on previously filed material] It is extremely rare for a Japanese premier to leave the country so early into his term -- a mere five days in Hata's case. Hata, who was elected prime minister by the Diet on April 25, inaugurated a minority cabinet Thursday following the withdrawal of a key coalition ally, the Social Democratic Party.
