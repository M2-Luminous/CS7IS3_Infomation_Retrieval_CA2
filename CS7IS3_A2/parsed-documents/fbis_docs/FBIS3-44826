In 1993, China's imports grew by 29 percent over 1992, amounting to 103.95 billion U.S. dollars; exports increased by 8 percent, reaching 91.77 billion U.S. dollars. Textiles and garments still topped the exports list, recording a 7.2 percent lift with a total volume of 27.13 billion U.S. dollars, while machinery and electronics witnessed a steady rise of 16.1 percent, totalling 22.7 billion U.S. dollars. Machinery and electronics also made up a nearly-half share of the imports, to the tune of 49.46 billion U.S. dollars, a steep rise of 41.7 percent and including cars, aircraft, telephone sets and telephone switchboards as well as machinery for textiles, construction, mining, metal processing and rubber and plastics processing. Imports of raw materials and fuel also witnessed a large growth, in which steel imports jumped to over 30 million tons, up 327 percent, processed oil hit 17.48 million tons, up 128 percent. The import and export of foreign-financed enterprises continued to rise sharply, with a total export of 25.24 billion U.S. dollars, representing a 45.4 percent increase and accounting for 27.5 percent of China's total exports; and an import of 41.83 billion U.S. dollars, increased by 58.6 percent, covering 40.2 percent of China's imports. These foreign-funded enterprises shipped as much as 16.63 billion U.S. dollars of equipment, increased by 107 percent. In volume, China's biggest trade partners are Japan, Hong Kong, the United States, the European Community, Taiwan, Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore, Australia and Canada. In 1993, Japan imported 15.79 billion U.S. dollars worth from China while exporting 23.25 billion U.S. dollars worth to it. Hong Kong consumed 22.06 billion U.S. dollars worth of China's exports and provided it with goods worth 10.48 billion U.S. dollars. The United States imported 16.96 billion U.S. dollars worth from China, and its exports to China were worth 10.69 billion U.S. dollars. In 1993, China's export growth rate was the lowest since 1986, while the import growth rate was the highest since 1986. The reasons for the result included the domestic economy's high growth rate; large-scale investment; thriving market demand; lack of some commodities, especially primary products due to the rising domestic prices; meanwhile, imports of raw materials and energy which met soaring domestic demand, and machinery and telecommunications facilities increased by large amounts. Equipment imported by China's foreign-funded enterprises also contributed to China's rapid increase of imports and huge trade deficit, as China drew more overseas investment last year. Besides, the imports increase can also be attributed to China's bid to lower import tariffs last year. It is predicted that with the reform of China's trade system and foreign exchange system this year, China's export volume in 1994 is expected to exceed 100 billion U.S. dollars and its import growth rate is to slow down.
