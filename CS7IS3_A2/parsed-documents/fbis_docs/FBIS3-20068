And Conservative back-bench dissidents claim that Britain has climbed down from her previous insistence that 23 votes should be enough to block unwanted Brussels legislation -- even after the enlargement of the Community to 16 in the New Year. Now, they fear, their opponents have won the day, naming 27 votes as the blocking figure, with any concessions to Britain still to be decided -- and still very vague. But Mr Hurd insisted there was no question of his resignation, declaring: "I have been operating under a very flexible mandate given me by the Cabinet. I have no problems about that. I have had full support from the Prime Minister and my colleagues." The matter will go to the Cabinet on Tuesday [29 March]. "I have agreed to nothing," he told the BBC Radio 4 "The World This Weekend" programme after the foreign ministers' meeting broke up at Ioannina, in northern Greece. But he claimed that other countries had made a "serious move" in Britain's direction. And on enlargement of the EU he conceded that the four incoming countries -- Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria -- were becoming "very anxious and distressed as the time passes and there is no agreement. It would be a great own goal if that British objective were denied." Mr Hurd: "What has happened is that there has been serious work. Our position and our worries and those of the Spaniards are more fully understood. People have moved towards us. ``We have said we are willing to consider a satisfactory compromise. We are not there yet. What has happened is that the Greeks, in the chair, put forward a paper which no one has agreed to yet, but they have asked for comments by Tuesday night. ``I, and indeed all the other ministers here, have to go back and discuss that with our colleagues at home. But I have agreed to nothing.'' Mr Hurd said that everybody accepted that this was going to be sorted out and gone into in depth at the 1996 conference. "The whole relationship between the size of countries and their votes cannot be brushed under the carpet." When it was put to him that any concessions towards Britain were very vague, Mr Hurd replied: "We have to decide how our interests and those of the minority can be protected." He said the problem would not be solved by delay. "It is solved by how you protect that position. And that is what everybody now has to reflect on." Mr Hurd said that some people in the majority were worried that the presidency paper went too far in Britain's direction. "We have to consider ourselves very soberly whether it goes far enough, whether there are comments we want to make." He went on: "We shall have to make a judgment whether what is proposed adequately protects our interests. We will have to judge the position of those whose entry into the European Community we have worked for for many years. ``They are becoming very anxious and distresed as time passes and there is no agreement. It would be a great own goal if that British objective were denied.'' The Foreign Secretary: "I have been dealing with this for weeks and trying to get a deal which is acceptable in our terms and also allows other British objectives for enlargement to be realised. ``I don't know if I have got that. There has been serious work and a serious movement in our direction. We will have to decide whether this can be wrapped up by Easter or not.'' And asked whether he had considered resignation, Mr Hurd replied: "One only needs to consider resignation if you are fed up with the job, or if your colleagues or your party or country as a whole goes off in a direction one feels oneself is unacceptable. I am not in that position at all. ``I have been operating under a very flexible mandate given me by the Cabinet two weeks ago. I have no problems about that. I have had the full support from the Prime Minister and my colleagues.'' Later, David Blunkett, chairman of the Labour Party, told the Press Association: "Petulance followed by capitulation has severely damaged Britain's standing and our bargaining position for the future. ``This sorry episode has done nothing to help Britain in Europe and will in the end have severely damaged the Tory Party.''
