"When there's no order, the chances of an accident are much higher," the minister said. A Swedish expert working at Ignalina showed and explained how Sweden helps Lithuania to make its plant safer. Af Ugglas said she is satisfied with the work done. The Swedish minister's meeting with her Lithuanian counterpart was mainly devoted to cooperation between Baltic and Nordic countries.

Before Palanga, Nordic countries are expected to discuss possibilities to represent consular interests of the Baltic states in countries where Estonia, Latvia and Estonia do not have their diplomatic missions. Nordic countries already set up a joint working group to deal with the matter. Gylys and af Ugglas also discussed Kaliningrad's demilitarization. The Swedish minister said she intends to inform Matochkin about Sweden's official position regarding the need to reduce Russia's military potential in Kaliningrad.
