(KOTRA) said Tuesday. As hawkers bring in more and more goods, Moscow has decided to lower the duty-free limit to 2,000 U.S. dollars per person from 5,000 dollars. The decision is expected to deal a heavy blow to traders in Pusan and other international marketplaces, who have prospered from their dealings with Russian peddlers over the last three years, officials at KOTRA's Pusan branch said. Russian sailors and traders have been top customers in the southern port since Seoul and Moscow normalized diplomatic ties in 1991 and their purchases from the so-called Texas market of such necessities as refrigerators and bread are worth 10 billion won (12.3 million dollars) a month, the officials said. Texas market in eastern Pusan hired Russian-speaking students and ethnic Koreans from Sakhalin early last year and set up shops exclusively for Russians to meet the growing demand.
