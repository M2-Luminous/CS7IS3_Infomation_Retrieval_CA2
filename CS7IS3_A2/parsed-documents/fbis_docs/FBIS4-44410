During the morning session, Vice Governor Song Fatang of Shandong, Director Nicholas Hope of the World Bank's China and Mongolia bureau, and an official from the World Bank office of the Ministry of Finance addressed the gathering on behalf of the provincial government, the World Bank, and the ministry, respectively. Song Fatang began his remarks by expressing his warm welcome to World Bank officials who had come to Shandong for inspection and guidance purposes. He said, "There has consistently been good and effective cooperation between the province of Shandong and the World Bank since 1982. As of late 1993, Shandong had utilized a total of $824 million in World Bank loans distributed among 26 projects with a combined investment of 11.74 billion yuan. Of the total loan amount, almost 40 percent went to energy; 30 percent, agriculture; and the rest, communications, industry, and social development. Utilizing World Bank loans, Shandong has expanded projects in agricultural irrigation, highway construction, education, and public health; accelerated agricultural and economic development in impoverished areas; furthered the development of basic industries; and raised technical and managerial standards, all of which has had positive effects on economic and social development in Shandong. Song Fatang noted in his speech that the signing of a loan agreement is but the first step in bilateral cooperation. Reviewing a project promptly and investigating and solving in time the problems that arise in the course of implementing a project are important ways to ensure that a project is completed successfully and meets expectations. The latest conference, he said, would do much to help Shandong utilize World Bank loans even better. He expressed the hope that the World Bank and the various ministries in the central government would continue to show interest in and support Shandong. Mr. Hope expressed his heartfelt thanks for the warm reception given him and others by the Shandong provincial government and the meticulous way the conference was put together. He said, "China's outstanding performance in executing World Bank loan projects is known to all. Currently 90 projects are under way with a total loan amount of $16 billion. Shandong, in particular, has accumulated a wealth of experience in implementing a variety of projects and for the most part compares very favorably with other provinces and nations. As China undertakes more and more World Bank-financed projects, inevitably a host of problems will occur. This conference is profoundly significant in that it gives us an opportunity to obtain a detailed understanding of the implementation of provincial-level projects." Director Huang Kehua of the Shandong Finance Office presented a report on the inspection of Shandong's utilization of World Bank loans. He expressed the hope that cooperation between Shandong and the World Bank would cover an even broader area, including environmental protection, infrastructural development, social development, economic development in impoverished areas, and housing reform. Dawude, director of operations in the World Bank's representative office in China, devoted his report to a detailed description of the implementation of World Bank-financed projects in Shandong and had high praise for the specific way in which Shandong utilizes World Bank loans. In the afternoon the conference broke up into small groups to discuss the financial issues of loan projects, cost and risk analysis, and other topics.
