The peace process cosponsors -- Russia and the United States -- will do well to coordinate their positions, Mr. Rabin told Andrey Kozyrev. He reiterated the Israeli stand that there is no point in reopening signed agreements, and that the PLO should return at once to the negotiations with Israel. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz notes that the visiting statesman called on Israel to make a move that will persuade 'Arafat. The meeting, which was held in the prime minister's Tel Aviv office, was also attended by Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation to the Taba talks, and Shim'on Sheves, director general of the Prime Minister's Office.
