FBIS4-27778 "dreas108__a94009" FBIS-EAS-94-108-A Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Action Plan Readied in Case of DPRK Sanctions Action Plan Readied in Case of DPRK Sanctions OW0506035094 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0506035094 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The government has firmed up its plan of action in the event sanctions are imposed against North Korea [DPRK] over the issue of its suspected nuclear arms development program. The plan is comprised of three major components: "control of personnel exchanges," which bans visits and entries by Japanese and DPRK Government officials into each other's countries, and "control on academic and cultural exchanges"; "a ban on trade and capital transactions"; and "control on commodities and money." These plans will be readjusted during tripartite talks with the United States and South Korea, which begin in Washington on 4 June. The government will first watch to see if sanctions are imposed at all, and, if they are, whether they are a result of a UN Security Council resolution or a unilateral judgment by the three nations of Japan, the United States, and the ROK. Depending on which course of action is taken, the government will decide on specific actions to be taken. According to the government plan, actions under the "control on personnel exchanges" include: 1) restrictions of contacts between diplomats [from Japan and the DPRK] in third countries; 2) a ban, in principle, on visits to the DPRK by Japanese Government officials; 3) a ban on entry into the country by DPRK Government officials, and a tightened review of [DPRK] civilians' entry applications; and 4) a ban on special airplane flights between Japan and the DPRK. Measures under the "control on academic and cultural exchanges" include: 1) a ban on importing, exporting, and brokered trade; 2) suspension of investment, loans, and other types of capital transactions; and 3) restrictions on means of remittances into or out of [the DPRK]. This means the "suspension of remittances" requested by the United States is included in the actions. However, from the humanitarian viewpoint, Korean residents reentering Japan after visiting the DPRK are not included in the ban.
