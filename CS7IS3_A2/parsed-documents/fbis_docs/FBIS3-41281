Competition is great, which sometimes helps the police. Thus, investigators of the Vienna Security Bureau learned that a "large Mercedes from Slovakia" would arrive on 27 January to deliver heroin for a deal in a restaurant in Vienna's 15th district. The officials waited and pulled three "innocents" and 1 kg of heroin out of circulation. Croat Cani N., 43, who drives a Mercedes 500-SEL, had a cafe in Vienna some years ago, and is now operating an import-export company in Bratislava, claims that he only took "a package from A to B" to earn 6,000 German marks. Slovak Klaudia B., 25, on whom 35,000 marks were found, only wanted to "visit a friend in Vienna. The suspected main perpetrator, Vietnamese Minh Bang T., 30, who lives in Munich, refuses to say anything at all."
