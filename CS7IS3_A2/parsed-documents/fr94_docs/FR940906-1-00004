FR940906-1-00004 FR940906-1-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;196&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Proposed rule; withdrawal. SUMMARY: This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. That action would have required replacement of certain main landing gear (MLG) torque link dampers. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received new data indicating that the proposed actions have been accomplished on all affected airplanes; therefore, the previously identified unsafe condition no longer exists. Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Timothy J. Dulin, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2141; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to add a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes, was published in the Federal Register on February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4607). The proposed rule would have required replacement of suspect main landing gear (MLG) torque link dampers with serviceable dampers. That action was prompted by a report that certain MLG torque link dampers may have been assembled with incorrect parts. The proposed actions were intended to prevent loss of the damping characteristics of the torque link damper, which could lead to the loss of the MLG wheel assembly of the aircraft during takeoff or landing. Since the issuance of that NPRM, Menasco, the manufacturer of the suspect MLG torque link dampers, has provided evidence to the FAA that the proposed requirement to replace suspect MLG torque link dampers has been accomplished on all affected airplanes. (Evidence was provided to the FAA in Menasco's facsimile, dated February 10, 1994, which is contained in the Rules Docket.) Based on this evidence, the FAA has determined that the previously identified unsafe condition no longer exists with regard to Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. Accordingly, the proposed rule is hereby withdrawn. Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future. Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore, is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Withdrawal Accordingly, the notice of proposed rulemaking, Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;196&hyph;AD, published in the Federal Register on February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4607), is withdrawn. Issued in Renton, Washington, on August 30, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
