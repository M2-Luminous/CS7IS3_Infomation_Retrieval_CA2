[Osorio] Good morning, Dario. [Arizmendi] Congratulations once again. The media, the observers, and the campaign headquarters have all highlighted your excellent work and that of your whole team at the National Registry, particularly, your diligence in releasing the information. [Osorio] Why, thank you, Dario. We are very pleased, and I reaffirm that this was a team effort in which my coworkers accompanied me all the way. [Arizmendi] Regarding the claims of alleged technical fraud made by Deputy Fabio Valencia Cosio, member of the Conservative Party National Directorate, just 72 hours ago? [Osorio] There is absolutely no discussion of it. [Arizmendi] Sir, will you issue Bulletin No. 11 before 1000 [1500 GMT]? [Osorio] We can try, Dario, but I do not think we will be able to release it any earlier. I expect to get there as early as possible to see what we can do before the tallying process begins. I do think, however, that there has been a significant amount of information. [Arizmendi] How will the runoff election ballot work? When will the position drawing take place? What will the numbering system be? [Osorio] I do not think there will be a need for a drawing or a special numbering system or anything like that. I think all that would hamper the campaigns. In any case, that is a decision we have to make in conjunction with the Electoral Council. Perhaps not to hold a drawing, but surely to approve a design for the ballot itself. There is not enough time to change all the advertising materials, nor would there be numbered positions on the ballot. One candidate would go on the left and the other on the right. [Arizmendi] Would they carry the same 005 and 010 they did on the first ballot? [Osorio] I imagine so, yes, because there is no other way to go about that. The funny thing is, however, that for the presidential election, that issue must be discussed with the Electoral Council, while the registrar approves all the other ballots on his own. [Arizmendi] Based on the celebrity of yesterday's process, during which there was a very efficient flow of information throughout, we think you could have almost 90 or 95 percent of the results in by 1800 [2300 GMT] or 1900 [0000 GMT]. Is that so? [Osorio] Dario, it is not so much the smaller number of candidates. I have said all along that the same number of voters who voted this time will again vote for one of the two candidates. Whoever is adding, moving documents, and so on, will take the same amount of time because the number of votes will still be the same, if not higher. [Arizmendi] But there are less candidates, so the process should be simpler, should it not? [Osorio] There are less candidates, but there is the same number of ballots. If 250 people voted at a given table, they are expected to do so again. Although they will only find two candidates on the ballot this time, they will vote in the same way they did the last time. Not much time can be saved here. Timing also depends on how fast local officials can get the tally sheets to a transmission center. Basically, the timing will be the same. [Arizmendi] Will the electoral officials be the same ones who acted this time? [Osorio] Yes. We have already summoned the members of the electoral boards, the table officials, and the logistics team, which includes transportation, communications, and supplies. Everything has been foreseen and practiced already. [Arizmendi] There is no impediment for the election to be held in three weeks time, from an organizational, technical, and budget stand point? [Osorio] No. Nothing at all. Everything has been planned, calculated, and foreseen. We had already decided this a while ago, because 21 days does not give much time for anything. [Arizmendi] Mr. Registrar, will there be any change in the voter registration process? Will any voting cards be issued in the next few days? [Osorio] Unfortunately not. We will issue voter cards to those who have that right, such as former rebels who have reentered civilian life, and we will continue to do so. Those who are not eligible, because they failed to register at least four months prior to the first election, will not receive their cards yet. If there are voter cards that were eligible and have not yet been delivered, we will go ahead and deliver them. [Arizmendi] According to statistics and information from the Civil Registry, was this the closest election ever in Colombian history? [Osorio] Without a doubt. Of course. The difference between the two front runners has no precedent. [Arizmendi] Would you say there could be a lower abstention level this time around? [Osorio] That is something we all hope for, Dario. Democracy can only be consolidated with a lot of votes and a lot of people.
