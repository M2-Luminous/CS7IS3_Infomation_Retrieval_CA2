FR941117-0-00207 FR941117-0-00013 In addition, the Commission has prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis (``FRFA''), pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act 215 regarding the proposed amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12. The Commission requested comment on the extent to which current practice deviates from the requirements of the proposed amendments, and the extent to which additional costs may be imposed on small issuers, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers if the amendments are adopted as proposed. The FRFA indicates that the amendments to the rule could impose some additional costs on small broker-dealers and municipal issuers. Nonetheless, the Commission is of the view that many of the substantive requirements of the amendments already are observed, absent access to the continuing information provided by the amendments, by issuers, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers as a matter of business practice, or to fulfill their existing obligations under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. To the extent that the Proposed Amendments would have imposed additional costs on small issuers, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers, in response to commenters' concerns, the Commission has modified the amendments as described. 215 5 U.S.C. 604. A copy of the FRFA may be obtained from Janet W. Russell-Hunter, Attorney, Office of Chief Counsel, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Mail Stop 7&hyph;10, Washington, DC 20549, (202) 942&hyph;0073.
