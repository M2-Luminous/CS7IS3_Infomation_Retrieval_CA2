FR940616-0-00074 FR940616-0-00009 4. Common Carrier Bureau 32. Most common carrier regulatory fees are based on the size of a regulatee's communication operation as determined by number of stations, subscribers, access lines, or antennas. a. Mobile Services 33. Cellular and Public Mobile Licensees. Under Part 22 of our rules, common carriers are authorized to offer land-based or air-to-ground mobile telephone or paging services to the public. In addition to cellular telephone service, these services include those using radio to provide telephone services at fixed locations, such as Basic Exchange Telecommunications Radio Services, Rural Radio and Offshore Radio. For FY 1994, each common carrier license authorized under Part 22 will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $.06 per subscriber. 34. Personal Communications Services. Licensed personal communications services (``PCS'') will consist of a wide variety of commercial or private mobile communications services, including advanced paging, microcellular telephone communications, portable facsimile and other video and data transmission services. See generally, First Report and Order, Gen. Docket No. 90&hyph;314 and ET Docket No. 92&hyph;100, 8 FCC Rcd 7162 (1993) (narrowband PCS); Second Report and Order, Gen. Docket No. 90&hyph;314, 8 FCC Rcd 7700 (1993) (broadband PCS). The statutory Schedule of Regulatory Fees enacted in the 1993 Budget Act established an annual fee of $60 per 1,000 subscribers for PCS licensees. At the same time, the 1993 Budget Act recognized that PCS licenses have not yet been issued. In particular, Congress directed the Commission to conclude its PCS rulemaking proceedings (Gen. Docket No. 90&hyph;314 and ET Docket No. 92&hyph;100) by February 6, 1994, and to commence the PCS licensing process by May 7, 1994. 5 In addition, our new PCS service rules provide licensees five years to meet minimum construction requirements. 6 Accordingly, since it is unlikely that any PCS licensee will have a significant number of subscribers in the immediate future, no regulatory fees will be collected from PCS licensees during the 1994 fiscal year. We intend to begin assessing and collecting regulatory fees for PCS in the 1995 fiscal year. 5 Section 6002(d)(2), 1993 Budget Act. See Second Report and Order in Docket 93&hyph;252, FCC&hyph;94&hyph;31, adopted February 3, 1994. 6 See First Report and Order, at ¶ 37; Second Report and Order, at ¶ 134 (petitions for reconsideration pending). b. Space Stations 35. Space Stations in Geosynchronous Orbit. Domestic and international satellites, positioned in orbit to remain approximately fixed relative to the earth, are authorized to provide communications between satellites and earth stations on a common carrier and/or private carrier basis. For FY 1994, entities authorized to operate these space stations in accordance with §25.120(d), will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $65,000 for each operational station in geosynchronous orbit on the date for calculating fees. 47 CFR 25.120(d). Payment may be made in two installments. 36. Space Stations in Low-Earth Orbit. Domestic and international non-geostationary satellites, positioned in a low-earth orbit (``LEO''), may be authorized to transmit to satellites and fixed or mobile earth stations. These services include the new non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service, see Report and Order, CC Docket No. 92&hyph;76, 8 FCC Rcd 8450 (1993). Entities authorized to operate LEO systems will be assessed an annual ’ gulatory fee of $90,000 for each such system. For purposes of assessing regulatory fees, a LEO operator is required to submit its annual regulatory fees in the fiscal year in which it commences operating its first satellite, pursuant to §25.120(d), even though all the space stations specified in its application or instrument of authorization have not become operational. 47 CFR 25.120(d). While it appears unlikely that a LEO system will be operational by the date for calculating fees for the 1994 fiscal year, 7 should a LEO system be operational on the date for calculating fees during that period, we will require payment of a regulatory fee for such operational systems. The entire annual fee amount will be required. Payment may be made in two installments. 7 See Report and Order, at ¶ 18 (a permittee must begin construction of its first two satellites of its system within one year of grant of its construction permit). c. Public Fixed Radio Services 37. Domestic Public Fixed Services. Licensees in the Domestic Public Fixed Services are authorized to use microwave frequencies for video and data distribution communications within the United States. These services, authorized under Part 21 of the Rules, include the Point-to-Point Microwave Radio Service, Local Television Transmission Radio Service, Multipoint Distribution Service (single-channel and multichannel) and Digital Electronic Message Service. For FY 1994, these licensees will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $55 per call-sign. 38. International Public Fixed Service. Licensees in the International Public Fixed Service are authorized as common carriers to provide radio communications between the United States and a foreign point via microwave, HF, troposcatter systems (other than satellites and satellite earth stations). This does not include service between the United States and Mexico and the United States and Canada using frequencies above 72 MHz. See 47 CFR part 23. For FY 1994, these licensees will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $110 per call-sign. d. Earth Stations
