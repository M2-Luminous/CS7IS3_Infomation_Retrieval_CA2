THE THEATER OF MILITARY OPERATIONS At about 0300, Khizha, Shoygu, and Filatov went to a suburban residence to catch some sleep. As soon as they fell asleep, they were awakened by the clamor of a battle. Internal troops commander Savvin spent the night in the office of the military school commander and, having learned of an intensive exchange of fire near the government residence, sent a detail there. The detail reported: "It is our own." The detail ruined the spectacle, and the shooting stopped. As GKChS [State Committee on Emergency Situation] Chairman Shoygu, his deputy Colonel General Filatov, and internal troops Commander Colonel General Savvin noted, a considerable share of reports on the happenings were invented or the events themselves staged. The special predilection for this was shown by the North Ossetian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], the republic's MB [Ministry of Security], and their press centers. It appeared that episodes of a scenario prepared in advance were being retold. Military and MB personnel alternately reported periodically on Ingush tanks coming from somewhere, on Ingush APC's [armored personnel carriers] breaking through, on Ingush artillery. Reports were predominantly delivered verbally, and decisions had to be made on the spot. It was reported to Shoygu that according to operational data, two Su-25 fighter planes were discovered in the Ingush settlement of Muzhichi. He ordered helicopters to fly there to verify the reports, to the laughter of others, who explained to him that the people in the mountainous village of Muzhichi there have never been any asphalt paving, let alone a take-off strip for a Su-25. Even before the conflict broke out, the internal troops commander received a report from the North Ossetian MVD on movements of tanks from the Chechen side and armored vehicles from the Ingush side, on shelling of administrative buildings in Prigorodnyy Rayon. Every time a check revealed that the reports were not true. During the days of the armed conflict, intensive reconnaissance--airborne, among other kinds--refuted Ossetian side's information that Ingush allegedly had some structured system of armed formations. They did not have armored vehicles, tanks, or rocket-propelled Grad systems. But the authoritativeness of the sources, among which were not only the republic's enforcement agencies but also its statesmen, required continuous verification of the coming reports. Judging by the statements of the North Ossetian leadership, Ingush armed formations were seizing internal affairs departments here and there. Savvin had a communications officer stationed in Oktyabrskoye, and all he had to do was pick up the receiver--to find out that he had been lied to again. Still, there were embarrassments. What happened on that day in Dachnyy, Chermen, and in the Chermen circle could only be explained by the fact that the military was put in a position of actors familiar with the plot of a play but not with their parts and therefore forced to improvise. An airborne troops regiment of the Pskov internal troops division immediately upon arrival went to cover Chermen. They got on their way close to the evening, and when the reconnaissance unit in PFV's [paratroop fighting vehicle] approached Chermen, shots sounded. The commander thought they had been fired upon. In the darkness they approached Dachnyy instead of Chermen, by mistake. They opened "return" fire on Dachnyy's outskirts as well. One fighting vehicle, making a turn near a bridge, hit a land mine; two paratroopers died. The second, a PFV, was reported to the commander as having been captured by the enemy (as it turned out later, the crew lost their way and ended up in Nazran). The paratroopers thought they saw tanks. The regiment commander reported to corps headquarters, to the deputy commander of internal troops General Chindarov, that he was engaged in a battle and the fire was very dense, denser than in Afghanistan. At about 0100, another report--this time of encountering unidentified armored forces. Savvin got in touch with Chindarov on the telephone, who confirmed that heavy fighting was in progress, but could not tell anything regarding casualties. Upon arrival at corps headquarters, Savvin found Chindarov talking to the commander of the Russian Air Force. Chindarov was asking for air support. It was promised to him. He was told that support aircraft would be taking off shortly from several airfields. In the morning, the generals in helicopters inspected the areas of "heavy fighting." A burned Moskvich; a burned bus; and no traces of tanks. Thus ended the Russian Army's biggest battle in this imaginary war. CLEANSING THE TERRITORY On 1 November 1992 at 0540, a massive artillery shelling of all population centers of compact habitation of Ingush began. In the afternoon, units of the Pskov Airborne Division began to arrive. At 1600 official representatives of North Ossetia and Ingushetia met on the territory of the 19th Division (settlement Sputnik). The decision was made for a cease-fire at 1800. The Ingush accepted the proposed terms. The fire only became denser, however. The president's representative Issa Kostoyev was calling Khizha. Khizha demanded new negotiations, stalled; Khizha and Galazov had different plans, and Ingush capitulation did not fit in. In the opinion of former internal troops commander V.N. Savvin, all that was needed was just one division that could be positioned against the national guard and thus extinguish the conflict. One! In his opinion, the Ossetian leadership, which insisted on "cleansing" the territory, was against separating the conflicting sides. Galazov saw the task of this purge in a methodical disarmament from house to house, which meant people had to be squeezed out. Khizha accepted Galazov's plan, although he knew of I. Kostoyev's proposal--to advance the troops from the direction of Beslan, in order to block the zone from both sides. Still, had the MVD troops entered shortly after the paratroopers, setting up posts and commandants' offices, there would have been fewer casualties and less cruelty and destruction. The internal troops were in no hurry, however. Instead, it was the Ossetian OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments], republican guard, people's volunteer corps, and South Ossetian units commanded by Teziyev, a deputy chairman of South Ossetian Council of Ministers, who entered Prigorodnyy Rayon villages in the paratroopers' wake. The latter, by the testimony of everyone, including the top military, displayed particular cruelty. Later, the belated entry of the internal troops was blamed on Colonel General V.N. Savvin. The reasons he cited in his defense are indeed not very convincing, and the consequences of his inability to get things organized are frightening. But could he cite real reasons? Moreover, both Savvin and Shoygu get touchy when it comes to questions about interaction with North Ossetian armed formations. Forced to admit that he as the senior troops commander was instructed by Khizha to take command of the unified forces, General Savvin immediately points out that the republican guard and the volunteers corps were not subordinated to him, but remains silent about the North Ossetian MVD units. Sergey Shoygu maintains that the participation of the volunteers corps, the guards, and the "southerners" was not envisaged by the plan. Shoygu does not answer, however, a direct question about the actions against the "aggressors" by the united front of the Russian Army and the Ossetian side. Shoygu speaks of the republican guard as a well-organized formation armed in the military fashion; the volunteer corps he considers as something akin to loose guerrilla groups. Both Savvin and Shoygu believe that the participation of Kudarians from the south in punitive actions was the initiative of the North Ossetian leadership. The generals are in a difficult situation. If they admit that North Ossetian formations, fortified by a South Ossetian "peacekeeping" battalion, were part of the unified forces, they would have to accept part of the responsibility for the massacre in Prigorodnyy Rayon. As to Savvin's inability to get organized, keeping in mind Khizha's stalling in negotiations with the Ingush, it looks artificial. If they admit that the Ossetian republican guard and volunteer corps were not subordinate to anyone, including Ossetian leadership, this makes their illegitimacy inarguable, and they have to be declared dangerous gang formations. In this case, there is an obvious fault of the political and military leadership, who did not take any steps to disarm and disband them. I could even feel sorry for both generals, had I not seen corpses of men with their throats slashed and of women with traces of torture on their bodies. Even by the admission of the Ossetian press, all kinds of armaments, including heavy, were used against the Ingush. On 11 November 1992 the newspaper SEVERNAYA OSETIYA ran a photo of tanks in a battle formation with this caption: "Military units participating in cleansing the territory of North Ossetia of Ingush gang formations more than once had to deploy heavy hardware and use tank firepower. In the photo: tanks during an attack". Whom did these tanks attack? Both Shoygu and Savvin admit that the Ingush did not have military-type armed formations; that their armed groups numbered 25-30 persons each; that they had no arms other than firearms and several captured APC's. Yes, the tanks attacked the homes of peaceful residents, and the unified forces of Russia and Ossetia were not conducting a military operation--they were cleansing Prigorodnyy Rayon of "persons of Ingush origin." I should probably write that Galazov's plan was given life. But the word "life" is not appropriate here. The purpose of the operation was, as already mentioned, to push the Ingush out at any cost. All of them, to the last man. Therefore, cruelty was part of the set of tools, and there is nothing surprising about that. Neither is it surprising that public opinion in North Ossetia, with minor exceptions, supported and justified this cruelty. After all, the propaganda apparatus that had remained since Stalin's time and now was supplemented by no-longer-concealed nationalistic texture, deluged citizens of Ossetia with an avalanche of impressive cliches, legends, and heart-rending details. A strictly civilian person--a Vladikavkaz designer--told me on the way: 'Having heard of children's heads chopped off and pinned on fence spikes in Chermen, I came to the volunteer corps headquarters and offered the use of myself and my car for the defense of the republic." According to the latest data of the provisional administration, fortunately, not a single Ossetian child was killed during the war. FROM THE IZVESTIYA FILE Information of casualties (from the investigation materials): Overall, 546 persons died during the days of the armed conflict. Of them, 407 were Ingush and 105--Ossetians. Among the dead are 41 women (33 Ingush and five Ossetians), 12 children under 15 (all on the Ingush side), and 49 persons over 60 (42 Ingush and 7 Ossetians). By other reckoning, a total of 1,300 persons were killed on both sides. VLADIKAVKAZ, INGUSHETIA, CHECHNYA. 2-11 NOVEMBER Beginning 2 November, a state of emergency was imposed on the territory of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. All power in the state of emergency zone was vested with the provisional administration headed by Georgiy Khizha. Sergey Shoygu was appointed Khizha's deputy. For almost two days they possessed almost dictatorial powers, until under pressure from North Ossetia the president relented and issued a new edict, which in essence restricted the powers of the local authorities only on the territory of Ingushetia. They have not used their power and strength for peacekeeping, however; instead, they used them as if they were on the one side of the front line confronted by the commensurate strength of an enemy power. Actually, the inquisitive mind of the deputy head of provisional administration moved him once to a heroic deed comparable only with actions of the unforgettable Shtirlits. On the night from 3 to 4 November, he drove in a Volga car with two bodyguards through Beslan and Mayskoye to Nazran's central square. Incognito. None of the local top officials expected him in Nazran. There were a lot of people on the square--a rally was in progress. All speeches were in the Ingush language, and therefore he did not understand a word. He did not see any armored vehicles there. He did not meet with any of the local leaders. He stood there, walked around, and returned to Vladikavkaz the same way, unimpeded. So what did Sergey Kuzhugetovich report to the center from his deep undercover mission? "Could not understand a word"? He was not afraid of a bullet. What he did not have the guts to do in Nazran was to get up to the second floor of the building in front of which the rally was in progress, to meet Issa Kostoyev, Ruslan Aushev, Commandant Musa Tsechoyev--also, by the way, Russian generals--and listen to "the other side." How else can one explain then why Sergey Shoygu, a man undoubtedly intelligent, energetic, and knowledgeable about his business, closed his eyes to what he saw, and did not see what he looked at? The GKChS Chairman Shoygu, Colonel General Filatov, and Colonel General Savvin, who arrived in the zone of conflict--or, to be precise, to the capital of North Ossetia, Vladikavkaz--had been here before, had established official and personal contacts. One could explain by these factors their openly pro-Ossetian position, had it not been for two considerations. The generals' remarks and actions were so one-sided that they could be regarded not just as politically tactless, but as provocational. For instance, Colonel General Filatov, speaking on Vladikavkaz television, stated: "Russia has not forgotten its loyal Ossetian sons, who served it faithfully and honorably for many years. And as early as today, the airborne troops, jointly with Russian internal troops and the troops of the North Ossetian Ministry of Internal Affairs, will begin military operations.... With every passing hour this pressure on the aggressor will be increasing." Having confided that he has acquired many loyal friends among Ossetians--apparently the kind only Ossetians can be--the general suggested that all Ossetian families should leave the zone of conflict so that the troops could operate without looking over their shoulder. "I basically followed the text Galazov wrote for me," Filatov later would explain innocently. What is worse is that G. Khizha, a deputy prime minister of the Russian Government, whose intellectual level is attested to by the title of professor, and who has no known personal reasons for pro-Ossetian sympathies, immediately upon arrival took the same one-sided position and, speaking on television, said that Ossetia is a loyal friend of Russia and that he will do everything possible to clear its land of Ingush aggressors. In addition, Khizha did not denounce any of the gross anti-Ingush statements of Ossetian leader Galazov; neither did he refute Galazov's numerous statements regarding military operations jointly with Russian troops against another part of Russia--the Ingush Republic. One would think that such behavior on the part of the highest Russian official sent from Moscow with a peacekeeping mission and the statements and actions of the generals subordinate to him should have immediately prompted the president of all Russians to recall and demand the resignation of officials and military people who have discredited both him and themselves. Nothing like this happened until a certain time, however. It looks as if Khizha and others had received a dispensation in advance. As to the military, they had been publicly relieved by the presidential address from any pangs of conscience and doubts with respect to the legitimacy of their orders. "Your actions are protected," declared the president, "and are guaranteed by the law and affirmed by the people." But could it be that B.N. Yeltsin would give the troops an indulgence for the massacre of civilian Russian citizens? After all, only two years earlier he spoke to the troops with these soul-touching words: "You may be told that with your help order will be restored in society. But can you consider violating the Constitution and the laws as restoration of order, because this is precisely what you are being pushed into by those who strive to solve political problems with the help of the might of Army units.... By carrying out the order....to use arms against the civilian population, you are becoming a tool in the hands of dark forces of reaction." These were the same troops--the Pskov paratroop division; and the laws were the same. Could the president have changed that much over a short period of time? Even knowing now of the tragic experience of October 1993, let us not forget that in Prigorodnyy Rayon we were dealing not with an insurrection, and not with the danger of a split in the Army and a civil war in the entire of Russia. If we assume, however, that what the president meant was not a war against the civilian population, but military operations against the army of another state, then everything falls into place. The only army not subordinated to Commander in Chief B. Yeltsin in the North Caucasus was the Chechen army. Now the closing words of the president's address acquire at least some meaning: "The honor and dignity of Russia, its security and territorial integrity, must be ensured." This pathos cannot possibly refer to a conflict between the inhabitants of two small Russian republics.... Before his trip to Vladikavkaz on 31 October 1992, Deputy Prime Minister Georgiy Khizha had in his possession a secret decision of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, signed by Skokov. One would imagine that a person of such high rank as a deputy prime minister also received verbal information of an especially confidential nature. What about? We can reconstruct it only by accidental slips in the available documents and statements of G. Khizha, carried away in his role. And most importantly, by what was happening in those several days. At the time, the secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council, Skokov, attempted to introduce censorship in the Russian mass media by sending to television and to newspapers an nonclassified excerpt from a classified document. But this document is interesting not because of Skokov's natural emotional move, but by its suddenly prominent Chechen motif. The Russian mass media were prescribed not to allow "reports that provoke escalation of an armed conflict, first and foremost on the part of the leadership of Chechnya as an illegitimate formation on the territory of the Chechen-Ingush SSR." G. Khizha apparently got such a powerful impetus in Moscow that during the first day of his Vladikavkaz visit he still continued publicly to expound on the Chechen factor. To confused Ossetian journalists, who dutifully retold government rumors of a high-powered Ingush offensive, he said that "Right now there is no other danger except that which arises on the part of Chechnya," and remarked ominously: "Some solution to this problem must be found." And once again: "This issue must remain in the field of vision of the Government of Russia, and it must be resolved." The Chechens, however, were displaying indifference not anticipated by Moscow, and Dudayev even went as far as to proclaim his neutrality. But a peacekeeping mission that arrived to Ossetia at the time Khizha was there was not permitted to proceed to Vladikavkaz on 4 November. The untimely peace-loving behavior on the part of Chechens clearly irritated the head of the Provisional Administration. This irritation he turned against Colonel General Savvin. The internal troops commander was accused of bringing them into the zone of conflict at a wrong time. Savvin, on the other hand, kept saying stubbornly that he did not agree that troops should be sent into Ingushetia. Thus, until 10 November they did not have the opportunity to bring Russian tanks into Groznyy on the backs of the retreating Chechen army. It is hard to tell what role in this other example of brilliant planning was played by Vice President Rutskoy, but in the past he already had tried in the president's absence to impose a state of emergency in Chechnya and to grind Dudayev's regime into dust; what he achieved was an unconditional consolidation of the Chechen people and a sharp rise of President Dudayev's authority. Who conceived the next clumsy step is not known. Except that on 10 November "in order to prevent mass unrest and to confiscate the arms and ammunition in illegal possession of the population" troops were brought into Ingushetia. Heavy T-72 tanks, armored vehicles and paratroops moved on Chechnya in great numbers. Yes, Chechnya, because there was, and still is, no border between Chechnya and Ingushetia. Chechens from nearby villages came out to the road and blocked the highway with gasoline trucks; Dudayev declared a state of emergency. There was again the smell of big war in the Caucasus. The next day, on 11 November, the Russian Government's Acting Prime Minister Gaydar signed an agreement with representatives of Ingushetia and Chechnya on withdrawal of troops. The idea of "Ingush aggression" was losing attractiveness for the Russian center. Participation in the Ingush pogrom did not bring any glory to Russian arms. Another peacekeeping action resulted in great blood and humiliation--not too conspicuous, though. The Russian press, with the rare exception, kept an organized silence, while the West, not yet interested in this incomprehensible Caucasus cauldron, was wary of interfering in Russian family affairs. All three "enforcement" ministers--Grachev, Barannikov, and Yerin--who arrived a day before at the theater of military operations, also departed quietly. Savvin resigned. So did Khizha. One could question the motives of Deputy Prime Minister G. Khizha's behavior, but his intentions were announced publicly, his orders did not diverge from his intentions, and he did not even find it necessary to hide his personal affinity toward the Ossetian leadership. It is hard to imagine that Khizha could not foresee the casualties and destruction stemming from his orders. But where experienced generals turned away in disgust, he went to the end. The generals he advised to rid themselves of the "Tbilisi syndrome." He knew he was answerable only to those who had appointed him, and he was right. When the time came, he was held to answer both for the dilletantism of Moscow politicians and his own zeal. Khizha has disappeared from the political horizon.
