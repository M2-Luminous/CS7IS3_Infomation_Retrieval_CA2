But for "Commander Marcos" -- the leader of the guerrillas who have occupied San Cristobal de las Casas and who are now keeping the army busy on the road to Ocosingo -- these seem to be the only elements of anonymity. Tall -- taller than the Indians who form his army -- and with pale skin betraying his Hispanic, non-Indian origins, he does not evade questions. He spent the entire day of the occupation explaining to people the reasons for the struggle. "In any case," he said, "for us war is a political act, not a military one. We must depend on everyone's support." [Crocco] Why have you come out into the open only now, by declaring war on the Federal Government? [Marcos] Look, when we opted for armed struggle we decided to prepare ourselves properly. The Zapatist army was formed 10 years ago, and before that we tried other forms of political intervention which all failed. We are an army, not a guerrilla group. We are not interested in attacks, looting, and kidnapping: We are at war and we need our people. [Crocco] What support do you have? [Marcos] In the Southeast our support is mostly among the Indians. In other areas it is the peasants. [Crocco] What is your objective? [Marcos] To create a real democracy in Mexico. With this precondition, we could tackle specific problems such as a better distribution of wealth, observance of the Indians' rights, and a reform of the health and education systems. We believe that our country's main problem is the federal government, which is the result of an electoral fraud. The people do not feel that they are represented. [Crocco] Who do you support in the government contest? [Marcos] Nobody. We say that Salinas de Gortari must go, but we are not proposing anyone to replace him. We are demanding the establishment of a provisional government that will bring Mexico to the first free and democratic elections in its history. Then victory may be gained even by a party that we do not like, but it will have been chosen by the people. I want this to be clear: We do not represent any ideology. The Zapatist army stemmed from a group of people who wanted, and still want, more social justice. [Crocco] But does the decision to take up arms not hinder the achievement of the democratic process? [Marcos] Do you know how many people die in Chiapas every year? Some 15,000, killed by malnutrition and the lack of medicines to treat diarrhea and cholera. It is worse than the war in El Salvador. They are all Indians. NAFTA will make things worse and will cause the death of the Indians. Legal methods have failed. Now these people are demanding to live. [Crocco] What kind of response do you expect from Salinas? [Marcos] He will issue a tough response, as always. But there are over a million Indians in Chiapas. They cannot kill us all, and they will never know who is with us and who is not. [Crocco] Do you enjoy any international backing? [Marcos] This is our own, Mexican struggle. We do not receive help from abroad, from other nations. We have support from within: In the states of Guerrero, Michoacan, Oaxaca, and Veracruz people have already adhered to our declaration of war. [Crocco] What will you do at the military level? [Marcos] We will attack the army, avoiding as long as possible confrontations involving the civilian population. We will try to grant the military no respite. [Crocco] When will this revolution end? [Marcos] I do not know when; I only know how -- with the occupation of Mexico City.
