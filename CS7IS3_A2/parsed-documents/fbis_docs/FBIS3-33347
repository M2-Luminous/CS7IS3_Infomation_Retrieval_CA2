At the request of attorney Julio Castro, he disqualified himself to continue hearing the case and transferred the dossier to the Federal Court, which now must appoint a new judge. Literas' unexpected change of mind put an end to the hopes of the Italian court officials who had arrived in Buenos Aires to investigate the case of the missing people and hear the questioning to be conducted by the Argentine federal courts. This was the mission of Rome's Judge Antonio Capiello and attorney Antonio Marini, who arrived in Argentina on 14 February after the Italian courts had sent the Argentine ones a rogatory letter, to which Judge Literas -- head of Federal Court No. 10 -- had initially agreed. On 16 February, a few minutes before the court hearing was to begin and the first witnesses summoned by the court had arrived (among them Peronist leader Dante Gullo), the judge told the Italian officials that the hearing had been suspended. The judge's unexpected decision is threatening to become an international scandal. Rumors spread on 16 February stated that the Italian court officials were planning to hold a news conference on 17 February because they had been told that the court's unexpected decision was more the result of political pressure on Judge Literas' court than of difficulties arising during the lawsuit. Meanwhile, the first protests against the Argentine court decision began in Rome. Sandro Sessa, head of the League for the Rights of Peoples, said that in Italy the lawsuit against the accused military "will not stop just because it had been suspended in Buenos Aires." On 14 February, Lieutenant General Mario Candido Diaz, chief of the Joint Staff, sent Defense Minister Oscar Camilion a report conveying to the government the Argentine Armed Forces' "uneasiness and concern" over the presence of Italian court officials in Argentine courts.
