FR940302-1-00033 FR940302-1-00013 The following proposed modification of the Charlotte Class B airspace area reflects public comments and user group inputs: Area A. That airspace extending upward from the surface to and including 10,000 feet MSL within a 7-mile radius of the Charlotte VOR/DME. This airspace is necessary to contain large turbine-powered aircraft within the Class B airspace area, while operating to and from the primary airport, and allow for ingress/egress to secondary airports. Area B. That airspace extending upward from 1,800 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL between the 7- and 11-mile radius of the Charlotte VOR/DME, excluding that airspace within a 2-mile radius of the Gastonia Airport. This airspace is required for vectoring aircraft arriving at, and departing from, the primary airport. Area C. That airspace extending upward from 3,600 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL between the 11- and 25-mile radius of the Charlotte VOR/DME, including that airspace within a 2-mile radius of the Gastonia Airport, excluding that airspace within and below Areas D, E, and F hereinafter described. This airspace configuration would provide an area to contain aircraft during climb and descent transition maneuvers between the terminal and enroute structures. Area D. That airspace extending upward from 4,600 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL between the 20- and 25-mile radius northwest of the Charlotte VOR/DME, bounded on the west by U.S. Highway 321, and bounded on the east by the Marshall Steam Plant Rail Spur; and that airspace between the 20- and 25-mile radius southwest of the Charlotte VOR/DME, bounded on the east by U.S. Highway 21, and bounded on the west by a line due south from the Charlotte VOR/DME 218 ○ radial 20-mile fix to the intersection of the 25-mile arc. This airspace is required to provide an area to contain aircraft using Charlotte/Douglas International Airport during profile descent. The proposed floor would allow sufficient airspace for VFR operations underneath the Class B airspace area. Area E. That airspace extending upward from 6,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL beginning at lat. 35 ○36 ’30 ’ ’ N., long. 80 ○57 ’45 ’ ’ W., extending counterclockwise on the 25-mile arc of the Charlotte VOR/DME to U.S. Highway 321, thence south on U.S. Highway 321 until intercepting the 20-mile arc southwest of the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence counterclockwise on the 20-mile arc to the 218 ○ radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence due south to the intersection of the 25-mile arc of the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence due west until intercepting the 218 ○ radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence southwest on the 218 ○ radial to the 30-mile fix, thence clockwise on the 30-mile arc to the 328 ○ radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence direct to the point of beginning, excluding that airspace between the 20- and 30-mile radius of the Charlotte VOR/DME between the 242 ○ radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME clockwise to the 293 ○ radial; and that airspace beginning at lat. 35 ○36 ’30 ’ ’ N., long. 80 ○57 ’45 ’ ’ W., extending clockwise on the 25-mile arc of the Charlotte VOR/DME to long. 80 ○46 ’00 ’ ’ W., thence due south to the 20-mile arc northeast of the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence clockwise on the 20-mile arc to the 081 ○ radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence west along the 081 ○ radial to the 11-mile fix from the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence direct to the Charlotte VOR/DME 147 ○ radial 25-mile fix, thence clockwise on the 25-mile arc to the intersection of U.S. Highway 21, thence direct to the Charlotte VOR/DME 147 ○ radial 30-mile fix, thence counterclockwise on the 30-mile arc to the Charlotte VOR/DME 025 ○ radial, thence direct to the point of beginning, excluding that airspace east of U.S. Highway 601 between the Charlotte VOR/DME 062 ○ radial clockwise to the 120 ○ radial. This airspace is required to provide an area to contain aircraft descending into the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. The proposed boundaries would allow sufficient airspace for VFR aircraft operations outside the Class B airspace area. Area F. That airspace extending upward from 8,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL between the 20- and 25-mile radius of the Charlotte VOR/DME from the 242 ○ radial clockwise to the 293 ○ radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME; and that airspace between the 20- and 25-mile radius from the Charlotte VOR/DME between the 062 ○ radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME clockwise to the 120 ○ radial and east of U.S. Highway 601. This airspace is necessary to provide descent profile for aircraft en route to Charlotte/Douglas International Airport and to allow sufficient airspace to VFR operations at area airports.
