Deng, 89, was filmed at a Lunar New Year's reception in Shanghai, the television said. The report of more than four minutes on the national evening news showed him looking frail, with a somewhat vacant look, and walking with difficulty, supported all the while by two of his daughters, Deng Rong and Deng Nan. The presenter, however, said Deng was "in good health, smiling and walking with a firm step." The television said Deng spoke to local officials, wishing them a successful new year and predicting "new victories" for China. But the report did not give the sound of Deng's voice, merely reporting his message. The few words he spoke were apparently pronounced with difficulty. Waving his hands with apparent difficulty, Deng's emaciated face betrayed no emotion and he appeared unable to respond directly to the words of local officials, with his daughters needing to repeat their words close to his ears. [passage omitted] Wednesday's news also showed footage of Deng in Shanghai on December 13 and 31, visiting a new bridge and a new hotel. Deng's last television appearance was in January last year.
