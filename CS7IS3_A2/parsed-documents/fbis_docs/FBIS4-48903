A meeting between the newly formed "Contact Group" and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo on Friday [29 April] appeared to make little progress, reports reaching here said. During the two-hour meeting, Serb leaders insisted on an overall permanent cease-fire in Bosnia, reports quoted the mediators as saying. On Thursday, Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic proposed a temporary truce of two to three months to allow time for a settlement of territorial disputes. Bosnian Muslims fear that a permanent cease-fire would allow the serbs to hold on to captured land, stalling a final peace settlement. The "Contact Group", consisting of representatives from Russia, the United States, the European Union (EU) and the United Nations, headed to Sarajevo for another meeting with Izetbegovic. Before leaving Pale, Charles Redman, the U.S. representative of the group, stressed that differences between Serbs and Muslims over the length of a proposed cease-fire must be overcome before peace talks could resume. Also on Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev reportedly proposed an interim one-year cease-fire to seek a final settlement in Bosnia. If a settlement is not then reached, a high-level conference can be convened for arbitration. The mediation team, faced with the task of securing a cease-fire of at least three months and a division of Bosnia, is preparing a report for discussion at a ministerial meeting on Bosnia. A member of the team was quoted by local media as saying that the difficulty will not be how much land the warring parties get, but rather which land. After meeting with the "Contact Group", Izetbegovic raised new conditions for the resumption of peace talks, demanding that the world community formally recognize the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. He also asked that Serb forces "withdraw from the occupied Muslim and croat territories" as a precondition for new peace talks. On Thursday, both Britain and the U.S. urged the three warring parties-- Serbs, Muslims and Croats--to come to the negotiating table and make "constructive efforts" in a new round of peace talks.
