In itself this figure does not contain much that is new, since in 1993 almost as many people were put to work through support measures or received job training. Government officials responsible for labor market programs are angry at being charged with not doing anything to combat mass unemployment. In connection with providing information on two new job-creation measures, the [Labor] Ministry took the opportunity to more generally report on what is being done and what goals are being striven for in the active job-creation policy this year. "I venture to assert that unemployment in March or April will start to decline. Unfortunately, we estimate that the unemployment rate for the entire year will be 19 percent. It would be important to be able temporarily to end unemployment for as many as possible. It is a horrifying thought that at the end of the year we will have 200,000 long-term unemployed. The primary goal in this year's job creation programs is to end youth and long-term unemployment for as many as possible," said Labor Minister Ilkka Kanerva in presenting the Labor Ministry's goals. There are currently 56,000 individuals who have been put to work through some sort of job-creation support. There are 27,000 unemployed people receiving job training. These measures have time deadlines. Most subsidized jobs are for six months; training programs are generally four months. The reason for these time limits is to reach as many as possible. Those with temporary jobs or in training programs are not counted in the unemployment statistics. This group usually goes under the category of "hidden unemployment." This means that Finland actually has closer to 620,000 unemployed (24.5 percent of the work force). Sweden, which traditionally has worked very hard on an active job-creation policy, has an open unemployment of 8 percent. If those who are participating in active measure programs are included, the Swedish unemployment rate is 14 percent. "Despite the catastrophically high jobless figures in December, there are many indicators that the employment situation is about to slowly turn for the better. Unemployment lasting durations of less than three months has more or less stopped increasing. In December 15,600 unemployed got jobs in the normal labor market. This is 43 percent more than in December 1992," said Kanerva. He pointed out that job-creation policy cannot perform miracles. Above all, it is monetary and fiscal policies that most effectively can improve employment. His hope is that the Bank of Finland [Central Bank] will consider the exceptionally high unemployment when planning strategy dealing with monetary policy. Interest rates must be further brought down in order to get activity in the domestic market under way. Business employment thresholds must made lower. This means that the indirect wage costs, at least for small businesses, must be reduced. "Alongside these important economic measures the Labor Ministry is trying to end unemployment for almost 250,000 persons. From 4 to 5 billion markkas have been earmarked for job creation in the supplemental budget that will be presented in February. Next fall we will concentrate on a job creation program for youth that should provide training places for 35,000 young people," said Kanerva. The Labor Ministry estimates that unemployment will begin to drop by March or April, but it will drop very slowly. Around December 1995, it is estimated that unemployment will still be around 15 percent. How the level of long-term unemployment will be then remains to be seen. Researchers studying unemployment are entirely in agreement that a long period of high open joblessness leads to permanent unemployment, which takes a high toll on society both economically and socially. Denmark, whose economy for the moment is among the best in Europe, is still fighting with an unemployment rate of 11 percent. A little over 300,000 Danes have been without jobs for longer or shorter periods.
