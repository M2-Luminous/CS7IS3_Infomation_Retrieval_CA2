Having resolved the question of the national police force, the two sides are now discussing national reconciliation. UNITA says the important thing is the decentralization of power. Its spokesman, Jorge Valentim, has demanded important government ministries for the organisation: [Begin Valentim recording] If the people are really to believe that we are advancing towards national reconciliation, it is necessary that we be placed in charge of significant ministries. I think that the government is revising its attitude. And if this proves to be the case, it will be a positive development. Besides, 1994 is not 1992. We have evolved, all of us. So we shall come to an agreement, as we have done with regard to the army and the police. [end recording]
