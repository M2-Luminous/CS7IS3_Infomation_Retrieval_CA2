According to the 76-article rules, all companies, enterprises, organizations and individuals except those covered by special laws and regulations, are allowed to receive the right of land use through the form of assignment for the purpose of development, utilization or business. In addition, all commercial projects including those involving foreign investment should transfer the right of land use through public bidding or auction rather than through negotiations as has most often been done in the past. An authoritative official noted that with the implementation of the new rules, the practice of combining free utilization of land with paid use has been replaced by paid use for all utilization of land in the city. Meanwhile, the official said, the Shanghai municipal government will continue to list more fields in land use besides commercial housing for foreign businessmen to invest in.
