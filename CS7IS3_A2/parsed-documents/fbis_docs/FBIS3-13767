These newspapers published a statement by President Clinton declaring that the unified Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. If this statement is true, then it means there has been a radical change in the U.S. stand on the Jerusalem issue and it also represents a real catastrophe for all the Arab and Islamic countries and the PLO too. We know that the official U.S. stand on the Jerusalem issue regards East Jerusalem (the Arab part) as an occupied territory to which all the UN resolutions, including Resolution 242, are applicable in the same way they are applicable to all the other occupied territories. But in view of the sensitivity of the status of Jerusalem, both its Arab and Jewish sectors, for the followers of the three major religions -- Muslims, Christians, and Jews -- and its special sensitivity for Israel and in view of Israel's topographical and demographic changes to Jerusalem, the U.S. stand has been that the future of Jerusalem should be decided during the final stages of the negotiations. And this does not mean that they deny the fact that East Jerusalem is occupied territory. In view of this stand, the United States has so far refused to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Hence, this provocative statement attributed to President Clinton worries the Arabs and Muslims in general and the Palestinians in particular. In our view, if this statement is true then it is hundreds of times more serious than the al-Ibrahmi Mosque massacre because it slaughters our Jerusalem itself and presents it as an offering to Israel. But it is our duty to wait before being overcome by emotions and first ask the U.S. Administration for a clarification of this grave stand, because I discern in it the involvement of Zionism, which is well versed in the art of driving wedges and laying traps. It is clear from the report published by AL-AHRAM that Clinton did not say this directly to the conference of the American-Israeli Political Action Committee [AIPAC], the largest of the Jewish-American organizations, but to Steven Grossman, the AIPAC chairman, who cited the U.S. President at the conference. Radio Israel said that the U.S. President told the AIPAC leaders that the United States regards the unified Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The radio added that Clinton said this in reply to a question from an AIPAC member on the possibility that the Security Council will pass a resolution on the Hebron massacre that will include a reference to Jerusalem as part of the occupied territories. The radio added that Clinton is keen not to let Jerusalem be mentioned in the Council's resolution and designated as part of the occupied territories. The fact of the matter, as reported by the news agencies and all other media, is that Clinton's objection to any mention of Jerusalem does not stem from his ideas about it being occupied territory but from his desire not to raise it in negotiations until the final stage of the peace process. There is a big difference between these two concerns. The new stand would mean that the United States has unilaterally decided the fate of all Jerusalem in favor of Israel. The old stand means that the fate of Jerusalem remains subject to negotiations; and this in fact is the U.S. stand known to everyone. It is spurious to note here, as the AIPAC chairman did, that Clinton never mentioned Jerusalem during his election campaign, because the circumstances of the elections are one thing and the official U.S. stand is something else. Why couldn't we say, for example, that Clinton's silence over deciding the fate of Jerusalem in favor of Israel during the elections campaign -- that is, when he most needed the Jewish votes and the Zionist lobby's support -- is proof that Grossman's statements on Radio Israel are a mere media fabrication or an intentional propaganda ploy meant to embarrass the Arabs and divert any U.S. attempt to force more flexible negotiating stances on Israel? I therefore advise that we wait and be cautious and also that we seek clarification of the issue from those who have authority to define such stands before we take any action on this very grave affair.
