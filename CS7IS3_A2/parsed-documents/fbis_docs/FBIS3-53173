The Rabin government has asserted that negotiations on the Palestinian-Israeli track could last two months. The Palestinian side, however, does not think there is any need for the negotiations to last more than three weeks. Apparently, Israel does not plan to reach an agreement with the PLO anytime soon. This is driving it to obstruct the negotiations. Israel has repeatedly said that it will not relinquish sovereignty over the crossings and the bridges and will not abandon direct supervision of Jewish settlements in the self-rule region, nor will it change its position on the size of Jericho. In brief, Israel has already started to create problems and concentrate on disputed issues. It could be that Israel wants to paralyze its negotiations with the PLO to see the outcome of the al-Asad-Clinton summit and the situation on the Syrian-Israeli track and how this is going to affect the peace process on all tracks. Israel is thus capitalizing on the weak coordination between the Arab cordon states and the suspension of negotiations on some tracks. Since the Madrid conference, the Rabin government has been seeking to divide the peace process and conclude separate peace treaties with certain Arab parties. This government will continue to exploit the weak coordination between the Arab cordon states and the weakness of their negotiating cards. The Arab cordon states should therefore take note of the intentions of the Rabin government and enhance and deepen their coordination to restore credibility. The Rabin government has worked hard to sow distrust among the Arab parties. It is worth mentioning that Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian negotiating team, has denied Israeli claims that Jordan objects to Palestinian supervision of the crossings. It is important that the Arab cordon states should be vigilant and alert to Israeli attempts to destroy Arab coordination and conclude separate agreements that will prove unacceptable to future Arab generations.
