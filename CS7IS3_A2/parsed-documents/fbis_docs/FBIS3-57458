Some people may think my claim not quite objective, but most enterprises in Russia's long-suffering defense complex this time met the New Year in fairly good spirits, and even with a certain degree of optimism and hope. First, despite the gloomy forecasts -- which, it should be stated directly, were more than sufficiently well-founded -- our defense industry has not collapsed or been fragmented into a multitude of design bureaus, scientific research institutes, and plants, cast upon the whim of fate. What is more, in some areas, above all in spheres defined as priorities by the Ministry of Defense -- strategic nuclear forces, automated command and control systems, communications in the tactical echelon, intelligence systems, high-precision conventional weapons, and a number of others -- definite progress was achieved. The construction of a new multi-purpose submarine was begun, a new frontline combat aircraft was tested, and a number of models of new-generation command and control radio stations are ready for mass production. There are also other achievements. As for optimism and the glimmer of hope suddenly kindled in the breasts of defense industry workers, these are due to the Russian president's edict of 6 November 1993 "On Stabilizing the Economic Situation of Defense Industry Enterprises and Organizations, and on Measures to Ensure the State Defense Order" (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, 20 November 1993). Let me recall that this document covered many of the sore spots of enterprises fulfilling the State Defense Order. And, most importantly, it determined specific measures to implement many of the proposals made to the president and the government by the Ministry of Defense. It would not be far from the truth to assert that, following this edict, many began to believe that this year would be a year of revival for Russia's industry. And at the end of December the papers brought more joyful tidings -- the president had given an instruction to the government on the payment to enterprises and organizations of money owed by the state for deliveries of arms and military equipment, completed scientific research and experimental design work, and for deliveries of fuel, food, and clothing and related gear. No one had even dreamed of a better New Year's present. Let me remark that this is not a question of a couple of million rubles [R] but of a far more significant sum -- more than R1 trillion. This is just for regular deliveries of weapons systems and combat equipment, and also for completed research and development. But then the New Year holidays began; in many enterprises, because of an absence of orders and a lack of funds to pay for electricity and heating, they lasted until 10 January, and the omen that the defense industry was in for a prosperous year simply failed to come true. Rather the reverse -- the first half of January showed that a still more austere and uncertain situation is developing over funding than last year. The Russian Federation president's instruction remains unfulfilled, as do the corresponding government directive and an instruction to Finance Minister Boris Fedorov personally. But meanwhile the economic and financial situation in the country is indeed extremely difficult. The Ministry of Defense and leaders of industrial enterprises fulfilling the State Defense Order are deeply committed to cutting the inflation level and in principle support the measures adopted. However, it can hardly be correct to implement them at the cost of the virtually total shutdown of industries which still retain a unique human, scientific, and technological potential, and which are capable of ensuring the recovery of Russian industry as a whole, and also the production of competitive, science-intensive, civilian output. In addition, the inflationary properties of the State Defense Order in its current form are highly exaggerated. Sad to relate, but we are already on the brink of chronic delays in the supply of funds even for the purchase of the spare parts and consumables necessary for maintaining in operational readiness the equipment which the troops already have, let alone for the development of new weapons systems. The majority of enterprises fulfilling the State Defense Order are wholly deprived of the possibility of accumulating funds and compiling circulating capital, and therefore, of functioning normally. According to data from Defense Ministry military representatives, around 70 percent of enterprises fulfilling the State Defense Order are standing completely idle. The implementation of the Long-Term Arms Program -- whose basic directions and priorities, according to the report of Russian Federation First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, were approved by the Russian Federation president and the Security Council 19 January 1994 -- is threatened with breakdown. Without the payment of money owed to enterprises, scientific research institutes, and design bureaus, the Ministry of Defense is unable to begin fulfilling the government-approved 1994 defense order. Andrey Kokoshin stresses that without a solution to this problem a significant number of defense production units are threatened with a crisis that is fraught with the most serious consequences for Russia's defense capabilities. Furthermore. By reducing funding year after year and not paying debts we place millions of people employed in defense production units in a critical situation and doom them to unemployment and an impoverished existence. Especially in cities and camps which are in effect satellite cities of the big defense plants. There are hundreds of them across Russia. Take Severodvinsk, Votkinsk, Kaliningrad, Zhukovskiy, Arzamas-16, and many others. The editorial offices receive virtually every day alarming reports that many defense enterprises have been placed in a critical situation because of poor funding. Here are just a few of them which were received through ITAR-TASS channels. "The largest defense industry enterprise in Siberia -- the Biysk `Sibpribormash' association -- has been completely shut down. This happened after the city's No. 1 TETS [heat and electric power station] switched off the enterprise's steam and hot water. The reason for this was the association's R5 billion debts. `Sibpribormash' owes the same sum to the power generating industry. In the very first hours the electroplating and powder metallurgy workshops were rendered inoperative and will now cost several billion rubles to restore..." "One-third of workers and employees of the `Amurmash' association have been sent on indefinite leave on the minimum salary of R14,620. The enterprise has no funds -- the Ministry of Defense owes the association R2.5 billion for the output which it produced over the past three months." The tragedy of the situation lies also in the fact that the entire social sphere -- schools, kindergartens, hospitals, dwelling houses, and so forth -- is, as a rule, funded by the defense enterprises. Formerly these facilities were an asset for these plants; today they are a heavy burden. According to specialists' assessments, up to two-thirds of the funds allocated to the defense order are spent on maintaining the social infrastructure and paying wages. But this must be done, and Defense Ministry leaders must treat enterprises' problems with understanding. Otherwise life in these cities would simply be at a standstill -- which would, naturally, provoke a mighty social explosion. The year just gone was not an easy one for the defense industry. It also began with debts. Then the state owed the defense complex R39 billion (somewhere in the order of R300 billion at today's prices), but by February these debts had largely been cleared; moreover, in March 1993, for perhaps the first time in recent history a certain proportion of the defense order was actually paid for in advance. Many defense enterprise directors mark this down as greatly to the credit of the Ministry of Defense. The Russian president's edict of 6 November 1993 again provided for advance payment, but so far not a kopek has been received for these purposes. So the Ministry of Defense, instead of concentrating all its attention on ensuring the implementation of the approved priorities in military-technical policy, the State Defense Order, and the Long-Term Arms Program, has to spend a great deal of time and energy on literally extorting the proper funds from the government and the Ministry of Finance. In these conditions, trying to distribute financial resources to enterprises fulfilling the State Defense Order equally is like patching up a caftan -- you sew it up in one place, and it tears in another. Nevertheless, last year the Ministry of Defense managed to ensure the funding of a number of the most important weapons systems, thereby preserving the backbone of the defense industry. Whether it will manage to stabilize the situation this year and move forward in a number of areas is a big question. Right now the government is again examining proposals from the Ministry of Defense geared not only toward the swift payment of debts and beginning the advance payment of enterprises, but also at the creation of a mechanism for the regular and timely supply of financial resources aimed at fulfilling the decisions of the president and the Security Council.
