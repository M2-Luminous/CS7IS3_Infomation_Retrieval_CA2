The government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and ruling coalition parties had planned to adopt the package this week, but political turmoil over tax issues has forced a delay at least until Monday. Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the powerful Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said, "there is no time to spare in implementing a comprehensive stimulative package, including a major income tax cut." Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said "economic recovery will come later than expected." He said Hosokawa may come under strong pressure from the United States to implement an income tax cut when he meets President Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11. "The most urgent task facing the government and coalition parties is to get the weak economy back in good shape as soon as possible while keeping political reforms from retreating any further," Nagano said. In this connection, Tadahiro Sekimoto, president of electronics giant NEC Corp., called on Hosokawa to show strong leadership.
