In a statement to AL-HAYAH, he said that he had contacted Patriarch Nasrallah Sfayr suggesting that "a day of prayer and mourning be held for the souls of the martyrs with the patriarch urging all the Lebanese to attend. Then, after the day of prayer, a national stance would be formulated." That was Gen. 'Awn's first contact of its kind with the patriarch since he left Lebanon. He had a courtesy contact with him through a third person when he was in Marseilles. 'Awn said that "the explosion was a part of a chain of incidents aimed at underming Christian-Muslim relations, including the attack on the al-Mansuriyah graves, the leaflets distributed to prevent feast celebrations, the Phalangist headquarters explosion, and, before that, the al-Balamand explosion." He said: "We are not accusing anyone, but we know that Syria is responsible for security in Lebanon, so if it is not in collusion, let it expose the perpetrators." He added: "We do not want statements in the air condemning the traditional enemy, which is Israel, and those who do not want peace in Lebanon. We want identification of the culprits and their links, otherwise the Syrians should leave Lebanon because all their claims about maintaining security have fallen." He continued: "Whichever hand perpetrated all these incidents, I call on the Lebanese, especially the Christians, not to level charges against one another and to close their ranks to put an end to this continuing plot against Lebanon. The culprits are the same people who hatched this plot as far back as the early seventies and who agreed to depose me by force on 13 October 1990 in order to complete the plot because I had urged you all to cut off the foreign extensions in Lebanon." He concluded: "I hope the world's condemnation will be at least as strong as its condemnation of the al-Ibrahimi mosque massacre because the only difference between the two incidents is in form not in substance."
