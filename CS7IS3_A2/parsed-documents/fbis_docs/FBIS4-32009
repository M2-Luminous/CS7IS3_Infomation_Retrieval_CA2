The two delegations, headed by Qin Huasun, deputy foreign minister, and Ion Gorita, secretary of state, approached matters of multilateral diplomacy and especially problems on the UN agenda. The visit to be paid here at the beginning of July by Li Peng, president of the Council of State of the People's Republic of China, the first at this level after 1990 paid by a Chinese official to Central and Eastern Europe, was also discussed by the two deputy ministers. Regarding the multilateral diplomacy, the two delegations referred to such topics as the UN's reform and restructuring, especially concerning the Security Council, the peace-keeping operations, regional conflicts, with stress on developments in ex-Yugoslavia, human rights, and disarmament. Both parties expressed their "concern" in connection with the recent developments in the Korean peninsula and stressed that what was needed was "a political settlement negotiated among all parties concerned." The representatives of the Chinese and Romanian foreign ministers noted pursuant to the consultations the existence of an "identity" of standpoints between the two countries concerning the major issues of concern to the UN. It was agreed that, based on the fine relations of cooperation, such kind of consultations should be continued, in view of establishing common modalities of action for the future UN session (September 1994.)
