The resolution which was introduced by Mr Narain Dutt Tewari and seconded by Commerce Minisster Pranab Mukherjee, praised the Narasimha Rao Government for carrying on the policies of Rajiv Gandhi under the overall perspective chalked out by late Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. It condemned the "baseless, mischievous and malicious propaganda launched by non-Congress parties against India's signing of the GATT agreement. It said it recognised the benefits that the country would get from the multilateral, rule-based trading system. "A multilateral system which is based on negotiations and flexibility is better for a country like India." Observing that the public sector was extremely useful for the economy, the resolution said "the public sector will, however have to become profitable. Such obligations are best met when public enterprises make profits, not losses." In a highly self-congratulatory tone it noted that India was the only country in the world that had recorded positive growth rates in the first three years of its reforms-cum-fiscal correction programme. It urged the Government to effectively deal with the problems confronting urban India and said the time has come to look at rural and urban development not separately but as interlinked phenomena. Later, intervening in the debate, Finance Minister Manmohan Singh said a lot of funds from the non-resident Indians and foreign investments had come in due to the new economic policy being pursued by the Centre. This would boost production and generate employment, taking India towards progress and self-reliance, Dr Singh said while rounding up the discussion on the economic resolution. Earlier Mr Mukherjee said the Centre's policy was to attract direct foreign investments for higher growth and instead of depending on borrowings alone. However, the foreign investment would come "on our terms and in areas we consider essential", he said.
