During his visit to Israel, the defense minister was informed about the conversion of Israeli arms factories, which was completed within five years. We are in the fourth year of the conversion of Slovak enterprises, and many of them still have enormous problems. What alternatives do these enterprises have? [Strbava] First, we have to say that, in Slovakia, we have never introduced arms industry conversion; we simply stopped our production. I believe this to be a nonsystemic solution to a nonsystemic decision. For natural reasons, the role of the state in that sphere is still understood as paternalistic. It is true that, everywhere in the world, the state has its say in arms production. This production is not regulated by free market mechanisms but is subject to the laws of a controlled and regulated market. We have not adopted methods of developed economies but have succumbed to the pressure of social groups. Projects that were expected to compensate for the shock from conversion--I stress, these projects were not conversion projects--required a lot of capital. Because of the recession and imperfect entrepreneurial plans that were drafted under time pressure and according to antiquated ideas, many restructuring projects were made ad hoc, putting many enterprises in a situation where they lack capital. This is, in fact, the root of our situation today. As a result of this brutal intervention, teams of top experts vanished. They asserted themselves in small businesses, which is good, but this cannot compensate for our losses in large and complex factories. Jacok, when he wanted to sort out problems in the Chrysler company, hired a team of top managers, whom he had to overpay. [Strbava] What will be the solution? Are you considering the possibility that the Slovak Republic or its arms factories could join the [Czech] RDP Group? [Magvasi] It is a big plus that [Czech] enterprises were able to establish a joint group and find a common language. Among the Slovak enterprises, there are disintegration trends, and companies are fighting for the leading place instead of making efforts to join forces. [Strbava] The management of many arms factories is against the entry of foreign capital. They are rather drafting projects for the privatization of enterprises by shareholders' companies. They are willing to communicate with foreigners only after the enterprises are privatized. Therefore they require the creation of favorable conditions under which they want to privatize the enterprises. At the same time, they extend the problems, demand debt write-offs, and reject dividing large production complexes into smaller units. Is that to our detriment? [Magvasi] I do not fully agree with your statement that the management is against the entry of foreign capital. I rather believe that foreign capital is willing to enter only when the owner is clearly defined. For them, state ownership, particularly our way of understanding it, is a too vague ownership. That is the first thing. The second is: It is true what you have said that general conditions should be established that would make the situation clear and tell us which procedures we should adopt. In Martin, we partially succeeded in doing it. It has become evident that establishing four enterprises from the former Turcianske Teplice Engineering Works by the end of 1992--and making their situation clear--was one of our good steps. That is, dividing large enterprises into smaller ones is a way we should go. By changing the political system, we want to change ownership relations and install the plurality of ownership relations. Under such circumstances, privatization has a slightly different function, such as finding an owner who has the best entrepreneurial plans. This is why the privatization process must be very comprehensible and must be made public. We have to have clear information on it and must accept the fact that we will not be able to satisfy everyone. If one group is unsuccessful in one project, it should try another one. Our weakness is that we concentrate on one thing and, if we fail, we lament our failure. [passage omitted]
