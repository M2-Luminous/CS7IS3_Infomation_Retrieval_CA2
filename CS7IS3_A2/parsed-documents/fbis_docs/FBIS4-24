FBIS TRENDS-11APR94-EGYPT Cairo Ends Elections of Village Mayors to Boost Security Cairo Ends Elections of Village Mayors to Boost Security SUMMARY In an evident effort to strengthen Cairo's control over the countryside--particularly in areas affected by Islamic militant violence--the government has pushed through parliament legislation abolishing the election of village leaders in favor of their appointment by the Interior Ministry. Supporters of the change argued that many elected officials were unwilling to cooperate with the Ministry in maintaining security in the villages. Roundly opposed by opposition officials and even by a number of ruling party deputies, the move continues Cairo's retreat in recent years from the democratization of local government--a trend probably inspired in large part by the current Islamic unrest. END SUMMARY Egypt's People's Assembly on 10 April approved a controversial bill abolishing the current system for choosing the "'umdah," or village mayor, and the assistant to the 'umdah known as "shaykh al-balad" (Al-Ahram international edition, 11 April). Under the new law, the country's 3500 'umdahs and more than 20,000 shaykhs- -posts filled by election in one form or another since 1957--will be appointed by the Interior Ministry (See Note 1). In a statement later repeated by Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, Minister of State for People's Assembly and Consultative Council Affairs Kamal al-Shadhili explained the change to the People's Assembly by asserting that more than 3O percent of the 'umdah posts have long been vacant "because the security situation is not stable" enough for elections to be held or because of disputes between village clans over election results (Al-Akhbar, 29 March, Al-Ahram international edition, 1 April). In defending the bill, Ahmad Abu-Zayd, representing the parliamentary majority bloc of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP), asserted that the election system has "led to corruption of the administrative process" (Al-Ahram international edition, 29 April)--presumably because of the strong financial and political power concentrated in the hands of some village families. (Note 1) Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi has said that the 'umdahs will be appointed by the Ministry on the basis of recommendations by several committees, probably comprising, inter alia, security officials, judges, and officials from his ministry, which will review nominations from each village (Al- Ahram international edition, 1 April). Reaction to "Terrorism" Proponents mostly refrained from directly referring to Islamic extremists when defending the bill, but they clearly alluded to them. For example: --According to the daily paper of the liberal centrist Al-Wafd party, Abu-Zayd asserted during the parliamentary debate that "the importance of the law flows from the circumstances that the country is currently undergoing" (Al-Wafd, 29 March). --In a similar vein, Kamal Henri Badir, chairman of the assembly's Defense and National Security Committee, reportedly said he could find "no excuse for the uproar against this bill because whoever is familiar with the country's interest knows that security is the most important thing right now." Implying that 'umdahs often conspire with villagers to cover up terrorist and other criminal activity, he lamented that "village gangs have made it impossible for the elected 'umdah to inform [the security authorities] of any abnormal activity among those who elected him" (Al-Akhbar, 29 March). According to Al-Ahram, Badir claimed that even though the 'umdahs are a part of the central authority and receive their instructions from the Interior Ministry," a fear of losing votes has prompted them to "close their eyes to the crimes that take place in the villages" (29 March). --Interior Minister al-Alfi told Al-Ahram that the 'umdah is responsible for "informing [the security authorities] promptly of any strangers entering the village or living in it, and working to prevent crime before it happens" (Al-Ahram international edition, 1 April). An article in Al-Ahram's international edition said al-Alfi explained that the law "aims to tighten the fist of the security [organs] over the villages and choke off the sources of extremism and terrorism" (23 March). --Muhammad Juwayli, a deputy of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP), asserted during the debate that opponents of the bill are attempting to "outdo each other" in criticizing the legislation as a "retreat from democracy" and are "ignoring today's priority of confronting terrorism which threatens everyone--the majority [party] and the opposition" (Al-Ahram international edition, 29 March). Opposition to the Bill As Juwayli pointed out, opposition party leaders and others have strongly protested that the bill is a retreat from democracy. Nu'man Jum'ah, deputy head of the opposition al-Wafd party, was cited as asking rhetorically why all deputies of the People's Assembly should not be appointed for the same reasons used to justify the bill on appointing 'umdahs (Al-Akhbar Al-Yawm, 13 March). Even before the bill was submitted to the People's Assembly, Muslim Brotherhood official Mukhtar Nuh, treasurer of the Lawyers Syndicate, protested that the bill is part of a trend in recent years to replace elections with appointments, citing a February 1993 law that provides for the appointment of temporary boards to govern professional syndicates that fail to draw a third of their eligible voters to internal elections. A number of NDP deputies have also expressed strong opposition to the bill. Following the bill's approval by the National Defense and Security Committee, Al-Ahram's regular party politics page claimed that "a majority of NDP deputies" still opposed the bill (Al-Ahram international edition, 16 March). An Al-Wafd account of the committee's debate on the bill reported that some NDP representatives strongly attacked the bill. One reportedly accused the committee chairman of attempting to ram the legislation through "dictatorially," leaving insufficient time for review. The deputy suggested sarcastically that the 'umdah position should be renamed "Interior Ministry informer" (23 February). Despite dissent among ruling party representatives, the People's Assembly approved the bill on 1O April with only 26 of the body's 454 members voting no and one abstaining--underscoring the government's determination to see the legislation enacted. One Al-Ahram commentator observed during the bill's passage through the People's Assembly that "for the first time in a long period, strict party discipline has returned to the majority deputies" so as to allow for the "liberation" of the law on 'umdahs and shaykhs by the parliament (Al-Ahram international edition, 29 March). Retreat From Decentralization The government's move to appoint 'umdahs and shaykhs marks another step back from political decentralization and liberalization, a retreat that began prior to the November 1992 local council elections. Before those elections Cairo considered but rejected a plan to make the local council electoral system less biased in favor of the ruling NDP and give opposition and independent candidates a fairer chance. However, the government ultimately changed its mind, evidently prompted in large part by concern over the wave of Islamic violence that had begun the previous spring (See Note 2). (Note 2) See the Trends of 28 October 1992, pages 24-3O. Implications As with the 1992 decision on preserving the old local council elections system, the recent move to appoint 'umdahs and shaykhs appears largely a reaction to the current Islamic unrest. The parliament's debate of the issue underscores not only the contentiousness of the new law but also the independence being displayed by some NDP deputies since the last parliamentary elections in 199O. Opposition party officials, for their part, will probably use the government's passage of this legislation to question the government's good faith as the latter proceeds with plans for a "national dialogue" of Egyptians representing diverse political orientations, called for by President Mubarak last November.
