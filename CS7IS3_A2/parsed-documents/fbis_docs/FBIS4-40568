He has arrived in Vladivostok from Sakhalin, where he held a news conference. Asked by our correspondent Sergey Padenko about the activities of special services of adjacent states, Sergey Stepashin said: [Begin recording] [Stepashin] I will not name any names, but representatives of the Chinese and North Korean intelligence services have been very active recently in the Maritime Kray. They use methods of direct recruitment and especially military espionage. After all, Vladivostok is a military town. Narcotics is also involved. Despite the fact that most states surrounding the territory of the former Soviet Union have become our partners rather than potential opponents and enemies, their special services have become more active than before. [Padenko] Here is his answer to the question about borders: [Stepashin] You know the position of the Chinese side. China is very active on the subject and has a viewpoint of its own. I believe that our Foreign Ministry and those who are empowered to conduct negotiations on border guard troops must take a much tougher line. We lost our people on Damanskiy Island. We gave away about 1,200 islands. Therefore we will be discussing this at the Security Council. [Padenko] And here is Sergey Stepashin's answer to the question about interaction between the Interior Ministry and the Federal Counterintelligence Service. [Stepashin] Next week Interior Minister Yerin and I will be signing an agreement enshrined in a range of judicial documents on interaction and the demarcation of powers. Several joint orders will also be signed. Whereas in the past there was competition, as you know, and sometimes even confrontation between the two departments, now Minister Yerin and I have agreed--and we will do it, I can assure you--to put a stop to this confrontation. Our departments will be collaborating in the investigation of corruption among the top ranks of state power. We will also be investigating a range of groups involved in organized crime where we have our agents and therefore have the opportunity to work. We will be investigating cases of international terrorism and international drug trafficking Jointly with the Interior Ministry. In addition, in the very near future the president will sign an edict on setting up a directorate and other appropriate bodies on the territory of operations in progress. [sentence as heard] We will also have the opportunity to take direct part in the detention, search and, if necessary, elimination of those who are breaking the law and encroaching on human rights and life.
