This was his comment on the conflict between the president and parliament caused by the Sejm's rejection of Lech Walesa's proposal concerning the procedure of passing the Constitution. [Begin Oleksy recording] I do not accept that a war at the top has started. I am opposed to this. I think that the president, whose spokesman's statement in a way sent a signal about such war, will think as I do and will make efforts to achieve harmonious cooperation between parliament and the president. Because, I stress, Poland does not need a war at the top. There have already been too many and they have spoiled too much. Poland needs reconciliation and common understanding in order to resolve problems of millions of people. [passage omitted] [end recording]
