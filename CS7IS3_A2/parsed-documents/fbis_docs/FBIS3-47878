On 13 January, it was abruptly reported that the cabinet would be reshuffled shortly after the Diet's passage of the political reform bills. In reaction, Prime Minister Hosokawa and officials in the Prime Minister's Official Residence were eager to discredit the reports, saying: "The cabinet reshuffle is not under consideration at all." It is true, however, that Shinseito and Komeito are weighing when to reshuffle the cabinet with the primary aim of "ousting Mr. Takemura as chief cabinet secretary" after the Diet's passage of the political reform bills. Like the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] era, some members of the ruling parties are patients stricken with "minister disease" and the reports on the cabinet reshuffle are likely to smolder without interruption in Nagata-cho. Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura was quick to react to the reports of the "cabinet reshuffle." He confirmed the prime minister's "real intentions" about the reported cabinet reshuffle before holding a regular morning news conference. Speaking at the news conference, Mr. Takemura said: "I was greatly surprised by the reports." He went on to say: "The prime minister told me that he does not consider reshuffling his cabinet at all at a time when the political reform bills are at a crucial stage and his government is saddled with such major policy tasks as stimulus measures and the compilation of the 1994 fiscal budget." In this way, he suggested that he got a promise from the prime minister that the latter will keep him in his chief cabinet secretary post. Asked if some ruling parties are asking for a cabinet reshuffle with an eye on the replacement of the chief cabinet secretary, Mr. Takemura categorically denied the request, saying, "I do not know of such a request." Mr. Takemura also stressed: "I have been doing my best to shore up the coalition government." Asked about the future treatment of Sadao Yamahana, minister in charge of political reform, after the passage of the political reform bills, whose treatment is said to have a momentum for the cabinet reshuffle, Mr. Takemura said: "I conferred with the prime minister about that matter" and went on to say: "Even if the Diet passes the political reform bills, there are still major issues such as the demarcation of (single-seat constituency), the reform of the House of Councilors, and the reform of local governments. The political reform is not finished yet." In this way, Mr. Takemura suggested that Mr. Yamahana will not be replaced after the passage of the political reform bills. As parliamentarians close to Mr. Takemura said with displeasure: "We are aware of the origin of information that has fueled the reports," Shinseito and Komeito are increasingly hostile toward Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura. Some members of the two parties are voicing their intentions to seek the replacement of the chief cabinet secretary at an opportune time. A senior member of Shinseito "condemns" Mr. Takemura, saying: "Mr. Takemura has given his priority to consultations with the LDP and he is unfit to serve as a troubleshooter in the ruling parties." Shinseito and Komeito appear to be intending to keep Mr. Takemura out of the center of power in an attempt to take the leadership in realigning the political parties after the passage of the political reform bills. In an interview carried in a magazine, to go on sale this week, Mr. Takemura made it clear that he takes a different political stance with Shinseito Representative Secretary Ozawa. In this way, Mr. Takemura is increasingly taking an anti-Ozawa attitude. Aides to the prime minister say: "Some members of the ruling parties feel that the present cabinet members look good. But we do not know what will happen to them after an ordinary Diet session...." (according to a high-ranking government official). They also say: "We do not know what will happen to the present cabinet members after the Diet's enactment of the 1994 fiscal budget," (according to a senior Shinseito member). In this way, some members of the ruling parties have begun voicing the need for the cabinet reshuffle before or after an ordinary Diet session due to be convened in late January with a duration of 150 days. Therefore, there is a possibility that the passage of the political reform bills in the Diet will rekindle the rivalry between Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, and Shinseito and Komeito, and spark a full-fledged tug of war between each ruling party over the cabinet reshuffle.
