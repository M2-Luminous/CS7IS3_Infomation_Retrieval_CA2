In an interview with KUNA on the third anniversary of liberation, Hogg said that the international alliance against the ruler of Baghdad ensured respect for Kuwait's sovereignty. He affirmed in an interview at the Foreign Office in central London that the Desert Storm operation to liberate Kuwait "should send a warning to the Iraqi aggressors that they would inevitably be defeated." [passage omitted] He pointed out that the ruler of Baghdad must put an end to the operations to "liquidate his people." In reply to a question, Hogg said he was not aware of the current cooperation between French companies and Iraq and referred to the existence of "a significant difference between current and future plans for cooperation." However, Hogg stressed that the British Government had approached the French Government regarding a number of issues concerning the Iraqis. He said: The French are well aware of our views. Hogg expressed his conviction that on the whole: We and the French adopt the same stance vis-a-vis our policy regarding the Iraqi regime. Hogg stressed that there would not be any changes in their policy regarding the ruler of Baghdad unless he complied with the UN resolutions on the war for the liberation of Kuwait. Meanwhile, he said that he did not think it was unlikely that the head of the Iraqi regime would attempt to exploit the current preoccupation in the West with the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina to embark on a new adventure. In reply to a KUNA question on this, Hogg said: That is possible, but he would be making a terrible mistake. Hogg said that Britain was concerned about the situation in northern Iraq and stressed that the no-fly zone had to be respected and its monitoring had to be strengthened. He said: We continue to do this. [passage omitted] Hogg hinted that he wanted to visit other countries that he had not visited in the region, such as Oman, and pointed out that it could take place at the end of next May. No specific date had been decided. Concerning the Hebron massacre, Hogg admitted that Britain realized the usefulness of an international presence of some kind in the occupied territories. Hogg said that he discussed the idea with a group of Arab ambassadors accredited to Britain, who came yesterday to condemn and denounce the massacre. [passage omitted] He expressed his conviction that the circumstances could encourage the Israelis to accept this formula. Hogg told KUNA that an international military presence in the occupied territories should not be in the form of forces but in the form of international observers. He once more emphasized the British Government's feeling of fear and shock for the occurrence of that massacre. [passage omitted]
