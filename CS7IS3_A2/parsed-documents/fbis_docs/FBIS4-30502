The road is about 255 kilometers long and the survey work will take about six months to complete. The Lao Government, being aware of the good intentions of the Thai side, has notified the Thai Goverment that it is now ready to provide all the necessary conveniences for Thai survey teams to start their operation. The construction of the road is expected to cost more than 1,275 million baht -- 80 percent of which will come from a loan from the Asian Development Bank and the rest from financial institutions of the Thai Government. Charat disclosed that a Thai private firm has conducted a survey for the road construction two years ago and offered to get loans to finance the project. However, the Lao Government is still considering the conditions offered by the Thai company. Touching on the quadruple economic development scheme, the deputy minister revealed that two piers, each cost 20 million baht, will soon be built at Chiang Khong and Chiang Saen Districts of Chiang Rai Province. Two Thai-Chinese joint ventures have also received approval from the Lao Government to operate boat services from northern Thailand to southern China. Another Thai company will also operate a passenger boat service along the Mekong River. The Thai Government will provide assistance in the form of equipment and communications facilities to these companies. Meanwhile, the Thai Government is lobbying for the opening of aviation services between Chiang Mai Province and China's Xishuang Banna region and between Xishuang Banna, Luang Prabang, and Kunming. At present, tourists and business people have to depend on the regular Chiang Mai-Kunming flight for travel from northern Thailand to southern China.
