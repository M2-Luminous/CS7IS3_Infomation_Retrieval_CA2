FR940317-0-00053 FR940317-0-00022 In 1989, the Commission adopted Rule 15c2&hyph;12 under the Exchange Act 14 to enhance the quality and timeliness of disclosure to investors in municipal securities. 15 The rule requires that underwriters (both bank and non-bank) of primary offerings of municipal securities with an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or more obtain and distribute to their customers the issuers' official statements for the offerings. This mechanism provides underwriters an opportunity to review the issuer's disclosure documents before commencing sales to investors. 16 14 17 CFR 240.15c2&hyph;12; see Municipal Securities Disclosure, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26100 (Sept. 28, 1988), 53 FR 37778 (``Proposing Release''); Municipal Securities Disclosure, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26985 (July 10, 1989), 54 FR 28799 (``Adopting Release''). 15 Proposing Release, 53 FR at 37779&hyph;37782; Staff Report at 25. 16 Adopting Release, 54 FR at 28800. There is a consensus that, over the last two decades, these market and regulatory efforts have improved significantly the quality of primary offering disclosure in the municipal securities markets. 17 Nonetheless, there continue to be concerns with the adequacy of municipal offering disclosure, particularly with respect to offerings of non-general obligation bonds and smaller issues. 18 17 National Federation of Municipal Analysts, Membership Survey Results Fall 1992 Disclosure Survey (``NFMA Survey''); Public Securities Association, Municipal Securities Disclosure Task Force, Report: Initial Analysis of Current Disclosure Practices in the Municipal Securities Market (June 1988) (``PSA Survey'') (content and completeness of primary disclosure documents and sufficiency of financial information rated satisfactory to excellent by 94% and 93% of firms responding, respectively). 18 See Letter to Chairman Levitt from Charles Mires, Allstate Insurance Company (Nov. 4, 1993, as updated Jan. 19, 1994) (``Allstate Letter'') (primary market disclosure by conduits found inadequate in 43.8% of rated issues reviewed); NFMA Survey (local housing, special district, hospitals, long term healthcare and industrial development issues were found to provide the least disclosure); PSA Survey (small issue industrial development bonds received a low rating; issues of $10 million or less received a low rating).
