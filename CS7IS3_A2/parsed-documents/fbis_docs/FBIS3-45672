The priorities will be mainly in the fields of the automobile, electronics and new building materials industries, as well as urban infrastructure, deep processing of farm and farm side-line products, and the service sector. Beijing will encourage foreign investors to engage in production of less-energy-consuming, high value-added and high-tech products. Investment in real estate development linked with the reconstruction of old urban areas, and construction of commercial, consultancy, information and tourism facilities is also welcomed. It will export fine varieties of fruit trees, vegetables, poultry, and deep-processing equipment and techniques for farm products. More overseas funds will be guided into high-tech and export- oriented products, and technical upgrading of old industrial enterprises. As the political, cultural and international exchange center of the country, Beijing made marked progress in industrial output value, house construction and profits made by the service sector last year. The city is also the country's biggest hub of communications. It has 19 railway lines with a total annual handling capacity of over 45 million tons, and 2,037 highways with a total length of over 10,000 km, of which more than 100 km are express highways. It has 85 air routes to nearly 40 cities in 29 countries, IDD [international direct dialing] service to 96 countries and regions, and postal service to 207 cities in 120 countries and regions. Last year the city approved the setting up of 3,752 foreign- funded enterprises with total foreign investment of 6.28 billion U.S. dollars. The investors are from over 60 countries and regions. By the end of last year over 600 foreign-funded firms had gone into production.
