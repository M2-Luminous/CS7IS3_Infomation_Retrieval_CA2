FBIS4-3947 "drchi080_v_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 TAIWAN Council Says Reliance on Mainland Market Increases Council Says Reliance on Mainland Market Increases OW2504082894 Taipei CNA in English 0753 GMT 25 Apr 94 OW2504082894 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Sofia Wu] [Text] Taipei, April 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan's reliance on the mainland Chinese market continued to rise last year, while the mainland's trade dependence on Taiwan declined, the government said Monday [25 April]. The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which sets the country's policy toward Beijing, said exports to the mainland accounted for 16.47 percent of Taiwan's total outbound shipments in 1993. It was the highest ratio since the government began to tally commercial exchanges across the Taiwan Strait in 1981, the council noted. In 1992, mainland-bound shipments made up 12.95 percent of the island's total overseas sales. Imports from the mainland accounted for a modest 1.43 percent of Taiwan's total purchases from abroad in 1993, according to MAC tallies. Altogether, two-way trade with the mainland made up 9.32 percent of Taiwan's total foreign trade, also a new record, the council said, quoting statistics released by local and Hong Kong customs authorities. Meanwhile, mainland China's trade dependence on Taiwan declined last year for the first time since 1986, the council said. Indirect cross-strait trade via Hong Kong made up 4.44 percent of Mainland China's total foreign trade in 1993, down 0.03 percent from the 1992 level. Shipments destined for Taiwan accounted for only 1.2 percent of the mainland's aggregate overseas sales last year, while purchases from Taiwan made up 7.3 percent of its total imports. In addition, the council said that Taiwan has gradually lost to the mainland in overseas markets. "The mainland has overtaken U.S. in our two major export markets -- the United States and Japan," a MAC official said. Quoting statistics compiled by Taiwan and U.S. authorities, the official said America imported U.S.$24.98 billion worth of goods from Taiwan last year, up 1.83 percent from 1992, while its imports from the mainland rose a hefty 23.17 percent to U.S.$31.43 billion. Mainland China's share of the U.S. market stood at 5.47 percent in 1993, higher than Taiwan's 4.35 percent, the official noted. It was the second year in a row Taiwan lost to the mainland in the American market. The mainland took a 4.8 percent share of the U.S. market in 1992, while Taiwan's share was 4.67 percent. The mainland has outpaced Taiwan in the Japanese market since 1982 and the gap has widened steadily, the official said. Japan imported U.S.$9.68 billion worth of Taiwan goods last year, while its imports from the mainland reached U.S.$20.56 billion. The mainland commanded an 8.55 percent share of Japan's total imports, more than double Taiwan's 4.02 percent share. The official noted that increased Taiwan investment on the mainland has helped boost the mainland's exports while undermining Taiwan's own competitiveness in major overseas markets. Many Taiwan-owned companies on the mainland produce goods similar to their counterparts at home, the official explained. Slow technological development has made Taiwan manufacturers less competitive than their mainland counterparts, he added. Government tallies show Mainland China remained Taiwan's top overseas investment destination last year. Government approved outbound investment totaled U.S.$4.83 billion in 1993, of which 65.61 percent went to the mainland. Hong Kong and mainland estimates of Taiwan investment in the mainland are much higher.
