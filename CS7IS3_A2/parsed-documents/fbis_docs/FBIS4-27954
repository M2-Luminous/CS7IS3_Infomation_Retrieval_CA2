The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 2 a 1,000-word article by Pak Tu-sik citing the government's position on applying sanctions against North Korea. Noting that the government agreed that it is inevitable to apply sanctions against North Korea, it continues to express worry about China's reaction. The article reports that the most desirable way to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue is for North Korea to eliminate all uncertainties regarding the nuclear issue on its own, but notes that it will be difficult to expect that North Korea will take such an action. The article concludes that the government hopes that sanctions against North Korea will be carried out gradually and hopes for an opportunity to resume talks with North Korea. CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries a 1,200-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Hae-yong citing the U.S. position regarding the North Korean nuclear issue. The article explains the background of the decision by the UN Security Council to consider sanctions against North Korea. The article notes that the United States is also concentrating on finding effective ways to take sanctions against North Korea. It notes the firm U.S. position that it will by no means allow North Korea to possess nuclear weapons. The article continues that the United States hopes that China will follow the decision made by the UN Security Council. The article concludes by noting that the United States opposes the eight-party international meeting proposal put forth by Russia to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries a 700-word article by An Hui-chang noting the National Unification Board's, NUB, analysis of why North Korea has let the situation move toward sanctions. It notes that this may be aimed at achieving a last-minute victory, realizing that there is still a lot of time before actual sanctions are applied against North Korea. The NUB believes North Korea is using the sanctions to secure its system. The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 2 an 800-word article by Chong Pyong-chin on the ROK Government's position. The article reports that the government has three possible plans in dealing with the sanctions. The article adds that these plans must be carried out while keeping the door open for dialogue. The article notes that apart from the UN sanctions, the ROK, the United States, and Japan are holding a meeting to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue. It concludes that in addition to international cooperation, the government is seeking various measures to deal with this matter in which the first stage is to examine the ways to suspend trade with North Korea. The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 5 a 900-word article by Ku Pon-yong on the government's measures to deal with the sanctions. The article reports the result of the 3 June coordination meeting of reunification and security officials dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue. It reports the government's position that sanctions against North Korea are inevitable. The article notes that if the economic sanctions are to be effective to make North Korea give up its nuclear development, China, Japan, and Russia must all participate in the sanctions. The article expresses concern over the fact that China must be persuaded to take part in the sanctions because it is a core variable in the success of the sanctions. The article concludes that if sanctions are taken against North Korea, it will suffer greater economic difficulties. Thus it is hoped North Korea will come forward to find a point of compromise regarding this matter. SEOUL SINMUN on page 3 carries a 600-word article by Yang Sung-hyon urging China to join in the sanctions against North Korea, and on page 3 a 600-word article by Yi Kyong-hyong from Washington on the U.S. position on sanctions against North Korea. The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 2 a 800-word article entitled "Will China Join in Sanctions Against North Korea?". The article reports that even though China is officially opposed to sanctions, the possibility of its changing its views for the UN Security Council vote cannot be excluded. The newspaper also carries on page 3 a 1,000-word article by Washington-based correspondent Nam Chan-sun entitled "U.S. View on the North Korean Nuclear Issue." The article reports that a hard-line view prevails in the United States, a situation that will test the Clinton administration's diplomatic capability. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 a 1,000-word editorial entitled "North Korean Nuclear Issue and ROK-Russia `Security Partnership.'" The editorial first welcomes the ROK-Russian agreement on the North Korean nuclear issue and stresses that "it is important for Russia to demonstrate its pledge and rhetoric through action." The newspaper also carries on page 4 a 1,000-word article by reporter Chang Yun-yong entitled "Economic Sanctions Would Deal a Lethal Blow to North Korea." The article reports that trade sanctions will cause North Korea the most enormous pain and that if China, a major food and energy supplier to North Korea, does not join in economic sanctions, the effect of the economic sanctions will be less than expected. The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN on page 3 carries an 800-word editorial entitled "Unpredictable Future of the North Korean Nuclear Issue." The editorial says that even though economic sanctions will most likely be pursued, military threats, including a display of military power, will be stepped up, and tensions will be further aggravated on the Korean peninsula as a result. The editorial then asks the ROK Government not to uncritically follow international trends, but map out its own countermeasure for this difficult task. The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO on page 3 carries a 1,000-word editorial entitled "Have Domestic Countermeasures Been Mapped Out?" The editorial asserts that a firm security posture must be assumed and stresses the importance of close cooperation between the ROK and the United States in coping with the crisis. It then asks the ROK Government to map out measures to cope with possible economic sanctions because some domestic businesses are involved in indirect North-South trade. It also asks the ROK Government to lead people by assuming a prudent and reliable attitude and making prudent remarks.
