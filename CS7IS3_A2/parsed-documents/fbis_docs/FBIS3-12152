Fifteen residents were killed by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] gunfire in Hebron and its environs during the riots which erupted following the massacre. Another four were killed in similar circumstances -- three in Gaza and one in Nabulus. IDF spokesmen say they do not have accurate figures regarding the number of casualties in Hebron, adding that the issue is still being examined. The number of wounded rose yesterday to more than 250 people. Approximately 100 cartridge cases fired by Barukh Goldstein were found in the Cave of the Patriarchs' Yitzhaq Hall. The security forces are preventing Qiryat Arba' residents from entering Hebron. They can reach Jerusalem only in military escorted convoys going through Bet Shemesh. Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports from Hebron that car traffic in Qiryat Arba' is extremely limited.
