According to Moldovan Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli, this document removes obstacles to the movement of goods between the two countries. Minsk is now one of Chisinau's main partners. Chisinau sends foodstuffs to Belarus, receiving in return engineering products and refined fuel. Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich told ITAR-TASS that the greatest obstacle to integration among the CIS countries was the shortcomings of the payments system and fluctuations in currency rates. Merging monetary systems with Russia would not be an impediment in Belarus's relations with the other republics, but, on the contrary, would work to get rid of this shortcoming. He denied rumors saying differences had arisen between the leadership of Russia and Belarus over differing approaches to the merger of monetary systems. The first stage, Vyacheslav Kebich said, of this merger is now under way: removing duties, quotas, licences and other obstacles to the movement of goods and people. "What we are doing with Russia is way ahead of the processes taking place in the CIS and even the proposal by President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan for a Euroasian Union," Kebich emphasized. "We believe that our example might perhaps be followed by other republics, which will achieve the same degree of synchronization of legislation, as we are with Russia." The Moldovan prime minister expressed regret that the time for merging the monetary systems of the CIS countries had been missed. "Moldova has introduced its own currency, and we believe everything has to be done to make the CIS and the inter-state bank, which has been set up within the CIS, work properly," he told ITAR-TASS. "To do this we need to summon up our courage and implement what has been signed at previous CIS heads meetings. If this happens many problems, including those concerning payments, will disappear."
