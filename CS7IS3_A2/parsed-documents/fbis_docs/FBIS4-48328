The charred body was found at about 2PM on the corner of Lekwane and Masibuko Streets -- about two blocks away from the Tokoza hostels. Inkatha Freedom Party whip in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] legislature Gertrude Mzizi told reporters at the scene the victim was believed to have been an IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] member allegedly caught by a mob in a known African National Congress stronghold. Mrs Mzizi expressed the belief that violence had flared up in the East Rand townships after a quiet spell during the elections because of the new troop deployment there. She said acts of criminal and political violence had increased because the new troops were unfamiliar with the area, especially the hot-spots. However, the situation could improve as they got to know the area better. The police said the motive for the killing was unknown but a murder docket had been opened.
