FR941107-0-00021 FR941107-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;08&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9058; AD 94&hyph;22&hyph;09] Airworthiness Directives; Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc._Manufactured Model UH&hyph;1A, UH&hyph;1B, UH&hyph;1E, UH&hyph;1F, UH&hyph;1H, UH&hyph;1L, UH&hyph;1P, TH&hyph;1F and TH&hyph;1L Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. restricted category military Model UH&hyph;1A, UH&hyph;1B, UH&hyph;1E, UH&hyph;1F, UH&hyph;1H, UH&hyph;1L, and TH&hyph;1L helicopters, that currently requires an inspection before the first flight of each day of certain tail rotor drive shafts and the tail rotor drive shaft hanger bearings (bearings) for grease leakage, security, overheat conditions, binding, or roughness until the bearings are replaced. This amendment requires the same inspection of the bearings, but also requires replacement of the affected bearings within the next 100 hours time-in-service and extends the requirements of this AD to the Model UH&hyph;1P and TH&hyph;1F helicopters that were recently type certificated. This amendment is prompted by an accident involving a bearing failure, and by the certification of two additional affected helicopter models. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the bearing, failure of the tail rotor drive shaft, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. DATES: Effective November 22, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before January 6, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;08&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Uday Garadi, Aerospace Engineer, Rotorcraft Certification Office, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Fort Worth, Texas 76137, telephone (817) 222&hyph;5157, fax (817) 222&hyph;5959. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 5, 1992, the FAA issued Priority Letter (PL) AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;14, applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. (BHTI)-manufactured Model UH&hyph;1A, UH&hyph;1B, UH&hyph;1E, UH&hyph;1F, UH&hyph;1H, UH&hyph;1L, and TH&hyph;1L helicopters, to require an inspection before the first flight of each day of certain tail rotor (T/R) drive shafts and T/R drive shaft hanger bearings (bearings) for grease leakage, security, overheat conditions, binding, or roughness until the affected bearings are replaced. That action was prompted by an accident involving a BHTI Model 412 helicopter that experienced a bearing failure. Inspections performed as part of the accident investigation found metal particles from the manufacturing process in the bearings. Contaminated bearings can seize and stop rotating, causing the spline coupling shaft to rotate inside the bearing and overheat. That condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the bearing, failure of the T/R drive shaft, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has determined that the affected bearings need to be replaced within the next 100 hours time-in-service in lieu of continued inspections before the first flight of each day as required by the PL AD. In addition, Type Certificate No. H12NM was issued March 30, 1993, to Western International Aviation, Inc. for Model UH&hyph;1F, UH&hyph;1P, and TH&hyph;1F helicopters that use the same bearings. Therefore, this AD should be applicable to these model helicopters. Also, some editorial changes were made to the AD.
