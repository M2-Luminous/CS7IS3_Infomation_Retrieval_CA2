FBIS4-13064 "drnes074dd_94004" FBIS-NES-94-074 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas' Ghawshah on Reciprocal Treatment With Israel Hamas' Ghawshah on Reciprocal Treatment With Israel JN1704115994 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 14 Apr 94 pp 1, 4 JN1704115994 London AL-HAYAH Arabic BFN [By 'Ali Nun] [Text] London--Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, told AL-HAYAH yesterday that "the principle of reciprocal treatment is approved by all secular and religious laws. When Israeli Prime Minister Rabin stops killing our children and women, Hamas will then stop attacking Israeli civilians and commit itself to attacking soldiers and settlers only." Replying to a question, he asserted that "the intifadah youths will perform miracles and prove that the Israeli Army is a paper tiger." Ghawshah rejected President Yasir 'Arafat's declared regret over the killing of Israeli civilians, and reiterated that "the ball is in Rabin's court. The blood of Palestinian children and women is not cheaper than the blood of Israeli civilians." In a telephone contact, Ghawshah told AL-HAYAH that the Hadera operation, for which the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions claimed credit, "came as part of the Palestinian people's reaction to the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre. Moreover, it was directed against Israeli occupation and is part of the Hamas Movement strategy. We believe that there cannot be any peace as long as there are settlers on our land. No doubt, these strikes have put Rabin, 'Arafat, and U.S. President Bill Clinton in an impasse because they are in the same boat." Ghawshah added: "These strikes prove that Rabin failed to fulfill his promise to the Jews that he would restore calm and guarantee security. These strikes happened in the territories occupied in 1948 under strict and serious security measures. Rabin's situation is being eroded. As for 'Arafat, the Palestinian people have bypassed him since the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre in Hebron. When the 'Afula operation was carried out, Hamas managed to prove to the world that it can punish the criminals and murderers and impose respect for the will of Muslims and Arabs throughout the world." Replying to a question, Ghawshah said that "Hamas was committed to attacking soldiers and settlers. What happened, however, is that Rabin did not stop killing children and women. Yesterday, they killed a pregnant woman, and they did not stop blowing up houses, which reminds us of the Nazi actions in Europe. Therefore, Hamas was obliged to expand the circle. The principle of reciprocal treatment is approved by all secular and religious laws. As we eagerly adhere to Islamic principles, we are aware that Islam permits reciprocal treatment for us. Thus, let them stop killing children and women, and Hamas will then commit itself to attacking only soldiers and settlers. If, however, they continue their actions, we tell them that the blood of Palestinian civilians is not cheaper than the blood of Jewish civilians. Rabin should be aware of this."
