The source described it as "more than just an agreement on cease-fire and bilateral differences." The source, who took part in the recent round of negotiations with Hamas leaders in Gaza, added that Hamas had submitted proposals for participation in the Palestinian national institutions, including the Palestinian police. He pointed out that Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat welcomed Hamas' offer and willingness to join the national authority, despite its earlier opposition to the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. He noted that 'Arafat had accepted in principle the proposals made by Hamas in Gaza. The proposals were also approved by Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the movement's [not further specified] political bureau. The source stressed that 'Arafat will soon meet Hamas leaders in an Arab capital, probably Amman, to work out a final agreement on Hamas' participation in the Palestinian national authority. 'Arafat, the source added, is convinced that Hamas' new position represents a practical stand on the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. It shows Hamas' desire not to be isolated from the future Palestinian national authority's institutions, particularly since other Palestinian factions, such as the George Habash-led Palestinian Front for the Liberation of Palestine, have expressed a desire to join them. The same source said that during its meeting in Tunis under 'Arafat yesterday, Fatah's Central Committee endorsed the agreement with Hamas.
