Answering a question about the nonexistence of a prime minister within his government, Mr. Jonassaint, the provisional president, officially declared that the Constitution has yet [as heard] been revoked. He pointed out that his cabinet is responsible to parliament. Concerning rumors of a invasion as a resolution of the Haitian crisis, Attorney Emile Jonassaint pointed out that Haiti cannot struggle against the United States and that a U.S. military intervention to resolve the crisis would be a crime. Concerning the embargo, attorney Jonassaint announced that his government is going to take important measures to manage the international embargo, which will become a total embargo as of this weekend. Let us listen to an excerpt of statements by Emile Jonassaint, who immediately pointed out that there is no friction between the Army and his government. Answering a question regarding General Cedras, he pointed out that Gen. Cedras is commander in chief for three years. [Begin recording] [Jonassaint] Gen. Cedras was appointed for three years. [Francois] Mr. President, resigning Prime Minister Robert Malval has called on taxpayers to boycott -- if you would -- the fiscal system. This is a call for fiscal disobedience. How do you interpret such a statement? Will your government let itself be pushed around in case the taxpayers refuse to pay taxes? [Jonassaint] Mr. Malval has already asked all employees to resist, did he not, but nothing has been done so far. Besides, did he, himself not say on 7 February when the parliament convened that as resigning prime minister, he had nothing further to do with the business of Haiti. If Mr. Malval makes some mistake or commits some infraction of the law, he will fall under the provisions of the law. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, do you intend to rule by decrees? A number of people say you [words indistinct] the Constitution. How do you intend to rule? [Jonassaint] The Constitution has not yet been revoked. [Reporter] Mr. President, your government does not have a prime minister. Is that constitutional? [Jonassaint] The prime minister... [pauses] all the ministers have the right to go into parliament to defend the projects of the government even if there is interpellation. The prime minister is not the only one. [Reporter] Mr. Malval said that your government is not legal and that you are not the president. [Jonassaint] That is his opinion. [Reporter] It is also the opinion of the international community. Do you not have a sense of being alone against the world? [Jonassaint] Haiti has always been alone, ever since it became independent. Even those whom Haiti helped to become independent took sides against Haiti. This is a fact that everybody knows. [Reporter] Mr. President, are you concerned that the U.S. might invade Haiti [words indistinct]? [Jonassaint] Haiti does not have atomic bombs. [Reporter] [words indistinct] what would you do and what will you do to prevent that? [Jonassaint] To avoid it? If the United States invaded Haiti, it would simply be a crime. [end recording] That was an excerpt from the news conference held by the provisional president, Emile Jonassaint. You will receive more details during the upcoming newscasts.
