In an interview with BOPA [Botswana Press Agency] today, Mr. Monyane Moleleki, who is Lesotho's minister of natural resources, said the Lesotho Government intended to have experts from Botswana, South Africa, and Zimbabwe in that commission. He said the terms of the inquiry had said that the Lesotho Government was not going to be represented in the commission. He said some opposition members had alleged that some cabinet ministers were involved in the disturbances and demanded that they resign. He said he does not understand why the present disturbances took place just before the commission started its work. Mr. Moleleki said the commission should have been allowed to take place and establish who was involved in the January fighting. Mr. Moleleki said ministers could resign for moral and political considerations, and not (?killed) by force by the army if ever they had a hand in the disturbances. He described the political situation in Lesotho as stable but volatile due to the murder of Lesotho's deputy prime minister, Mr. Selometsi Baholo, and the abduction of four cabinet ministers, including himself, last Thursday. Mr. Moleleki said he intends going back to Lesotho very soon. He said after his abduction he and the other ministers were kept at the army barracks for four days, but later handed over to the police. He said once in custody, they were accused of the disturbances that took place in January when there was factional fighting within the Lesotho Defense Force. Mr. Moleleki said the soldiers accused them, saying one of them had gone abroad to recruit mercenaries to kill some members of the Lesotho Army. He said Mr. Baholo was not in the country during the January disturbances as he had gone to Belgium for medical reasons. Meanwhile, the minister for foreign affairs, Dr. Gaositwe Chiepe, has confirmed that she met Mr. Moleleki, but not the three other ministers who are said to be in Botswana. Dr. Chiepe said it is her hope that the ministers would go back to Lesotho because they are not refugees. She said Botswana is still consulting the Zimbabwean Government on the action to be taken.
