Ossetian Official Opposes Accord LD2506161794 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1305 GMT 25 Jun 94 LD2506161794 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] There is every indication that a protocol on refugees return to North Ossetia's Prigorodniy region will not be signed on Saturday, the Federation Council's Vice Chairman Ramazan Abdulatipov, who is currently in the zone of conflict, has said in an interview with Interfax. "We should not rush with signing this document since we need a coordinated protocol that would be implemented in full," he stressed. It is for precisely for this reason, he stressed, that a meeting between him and North Ossetian leaders would be expedient. "Only after all points of the protocol were agreed, a meeting between the presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia would make sense. We do not need one more unfeasible document," he remarked. "It will take decades to stabilize the situation after that horrible tragedy, and Ingushetia's president has chosen a correct course toward bringing the refugees back stage by stage," Abdulatipov said.
