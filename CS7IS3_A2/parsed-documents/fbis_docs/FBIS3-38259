"My government's, and my own personal task are over," said the former long-serving governor of the Bank of Italy, who was brought in from that post to head the cabinet in April of last year. Answering questions at a joint press conference with Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Ciampi said his government had been set up to run the country until the approval and first application of the new electoral system. "Strong or less strong forms of renewal are to be found in all countries, and for neighbouring countries the question is to follow them and learn from them," commented Vranitzky. "I consider Ciampi as one of the fundamental promoters of renewal in Italy, whence I wish this renewal all possible success."
