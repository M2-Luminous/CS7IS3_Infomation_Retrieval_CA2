Many big-name companies and financial groups worldwide have come to do business in Tianjin because of the ample supply of talented people here. Statistics show that in 1993 the city approved the setting up of a record 3,500 overseas-funded ventures, with a large proportion of them engaging in technology- or capital-intensive projects. City officials said a healthy cycle of supply and demand, and transfer and management of talented people has formed in the city, as there is a steadily increasing supply of and demand for such persons. At a talent fare on January 18 this year more than 30 overseas-funded enterprises were among hundreds of firms recruiting specialized technical and managerial personnel as well as skilled workers. At one counter a solely Japanese-funded firm specializing in electronics in the city's high-tech development zone was visited by more than 100 high-grade personnel though the company wanted to hire only 20 management professionals. Qin Huilin, personnel manager of the firm, said, "we have plenty of room to maneuver and pick out the best." She also said that in just one month before the firm went into business in August 1992, the company had recruited over 200 people skilled in management, finance and technical maintenance to fill all the vacancies. After a short period of training all of them were well adapted to their respective work, Qin said, adding that the firm's product quality has reached the Japanese standard. "A major reason that we have progressed so far and so fast is that we have a qualified staff," she said, noting that all the 500 employees of her company were recruited from talent centers. Zhou Jiazhu, chief executive of the Tianjin Municipal Talent Exchange Center, said more than 1,000 overseas-funded ventures hired over 20,000 well-trained professionals from his center last year but the overall situation of the city's labor market is that supply far surpasses demand. He said world-renowned companies like Coca-Cola, Motorola and Yamaha can be choosy, as they are besieged by hundreds of applicants every day. According to Zhou, Tianjin has a large bank of talent, with personnel specializing in all fields. No company in Tianjin will have difficulty employing any kind of high-level professional, he assured. In one case, Zhou said, a joint venture unsure whether it could find several first-class technicians at a talent fare received more than 70 well-qualified applicants in only three hours. An official with the municipal personnel bureau said the city has over 600,000 specialized professionals and technicians, and 200,000 of them are of superior grade. He added that, overall, more than 80 percent of the city's nine million-strong population are well-educated. He further pointed out that the city's talent reserve will keep growing, as Tianjin has 26 universities, around 1,000 technical schools and more than 140 natural science research institutes. As a result, the official said, the municipal economy is growing robustly and overseas-funded ventures are springing up ever faster. The city's flourishing talent market is also attracting flocks of talented people in north China to Tianjin, he said, citing Beijing as one of the major sources. The official said the on-going reform in the country's personnel and employment systems will push more people onto the market for job opportunities and transfers, which is sure to benefit overseas-funded ventures. Meanwhile he said the Tianjin Municipal Government is to launch a series of projects, such as "The Rising Sun Project" and "The Cross-Century Talent Project", to tackle problems such as the aging of professional talents and knowledge structure as well as to train more people for its modernization drive in the long run.
