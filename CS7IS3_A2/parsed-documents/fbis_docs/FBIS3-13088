It said this stand reflects the profound link and common destiny between the Jordanian and Palestinian peoples. The PFLP also appreciated Jordan's decision, along with Syria and Lebanon, to halt the negotiations in protest against the massacre of the age. The PFLP held the PLO leadership and Executive Committee, led by Yasir 'Arafat, responsible for the current status of the Palestinian revolution and the PLO itself. It called upon 'Arafat and the Executive Committee to resign because they are unable to assume their national and political responsibilities. PFLP Political Bureau member 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, who has frozen his membership in the Executive Committee in protest against the Madrid negotiations, has called for forming an interim PLO and Palestinian revolution leadership from inside and outside the territories. This leadership should be capable of ending the deterioration in the PLO's status and the Palestinian situation in general. Speaking to SAWT AL-SHA'B, Malluh said the new leadership should be qualified and capable of assuming its national and political responsibilities and worthy of being entrusted with the rights and national cause of the Palestinian people, primarily their right to repatriation, self-determination, and independent statehood. [passage omitted] Malluh strongly rejected the attempts of Rabin and his government to confine international protection of our people to Gaza and Jericho and to be supervised by civil observers. He said: We want full international protection by deploying a sufficient number of troops that can prevent a repetition of the daily massacres committed by the occupation authorities. Malluh welcomed the return of Fatah's hawks and panthers to armed struggle against the occupation authorities and settlers. [passage omitted] Malluh condemned U.S. policy that is biased toward Israel, calling for exposing it because it paves the way for further massacres against our people and sheds light on the true U.S. position toward our people's national rights. He urged those who have illusions about -- or wager on -- the U.S. position to drop their illusions and wagers. [passage omitted]
