Senior officials of the president's staff, the Supreme Council, and the Cabinet of Ministers and the leaders of ministries, state committees, companies, and banking and financial authorities took part in the meeting. The meeting's opening remarks were delivered by Geydar Aliyev. We are paying constant attention to the socioeconomic problems of the republic, the president observed, although we are having to devote a large amount of time to matters connected with the war. Sometimes, therefore, problems of the socioeconomic sphere are not being resolved quickly enough, at times, because the instructions that are issued are not fulfilled in good time. But we consider the solution of these questions a most important task and we will continue to work in earnest in this direction. The development of the socioeconomic sphere, Geydar Aliyev emphasized, is our strategic course and the path toward a strengthening of the country's independence and the increased well-being of the people. Tasks of socioeconomic development are being tackled together with the shaping of a free market economy and the creation of extensive opportunities for enterprise and business initiative, the president went on to say, and the measures that are being adopted are designed, primarily, to serve the interests of the people and are targeted at an improvement in the social position of all strata of the population. Having announced that the leadership of the republic was preparing for the implementation of a number of steps in this direction, Geydar Aliyev expressed the opinion that they should be discussed in advance and invited the participants in the meeting to embark on this discussion. Vakhid Akhundov, state counselor for economic policy, described the principal measures that it was planned implementing for a resolution of problems of the socioeconomic sphere and familiarized the participants in the meeting with a draft presidential edict that had been prepared in this connection. Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Supreme Council, Fikret Yusifov, first deputy minister of finance, Tofik Azizov, chairman of the Commission of the Supreme Council for Economic Policy and general director of the Nord Research-Production Association, Abdulla Melikaslanov, deputy president of the National Bank, Chingiz Abdullayev, chairman of the board of the Azerigazbank Industrial- Investment Bank, Rovshan Mustafayev, rector of the Azerbaijan Constitutional Development and International Relations Institute, Shokhret Vekilov, chief of the Republic State Main Tax Inspectorate, Sayad Ibragimov, vice president of the Azerbaijani Republic GNK [State Petroleum Company], Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, Fazail Agamaliyev, minister of labor and social protection of the populace, and Asaf Nadirov, academic secretary of the Academy of Sciences, took part in the discussion. There was a wide-ranging exchange of opinions on the ways to lower social tension and normalize the financial situation. It was observed that whereas prices grew in the year approximately 14-fold, wages grew on average by a factor of 4.4. The interruptions in the supply to the populace of bread and fuel were discussed, and the opinion that a negative influence on the state of affairs in the baking industry was being exerted by the current big difference in the price of flour and the finished product was expressed. The situation in the petroleum industry has become extremely complicated, and the sector's debts have risen by 10 billion manat. The participants in the meeting agreed with the need for the adoption of urgent measures to rectify the current situation. It is necessary first and foremost, the speakers emphasized, to increase the minimum wage and pensions paid to nonworking retirees and the grants to students and trainees of vocational-technical schools, to make provision for the payment of supplementary compensation from the resources of the republic budget for families whose per capita monthly income does not exceed double the minimum wage, and to raise the price of bread and energy, which should, in addition, be revised at least quarterly and brought into line with the rate of inflation. Proposals were heard concerning the suspension prior to the end of the year of the construction of publicly funded facilities, the cancellation of the decisions adopted earlier on the allocation of soft loans to state-owned enterprises and organizations, a reduction in the number of central organs of administration and their employees, and a cutback on administrative-managerial costs. It was proposed also to make provision for the government's issue and sale of the requisite quantity of securities in order to partially cover the budget deficit and to switch from a tax-free system and tax exemptions for individual categories of individuals and legal entities to a system of payments of monetary compensation to the socially unprotected strata of the populace. Speaking of other measures pertaining to a solution of the questions discussed, the participants in the meeting noted the importance of increased supervision of the pricing of the products and services of state-owned enterprises and organizations, the need for an audit of the resources of the entrepreneurs and other resources invested by state-owned enterprises in the private sector, the establishment of a precise delineation between republic and local budgets, and so forth. In the opinion of a number of speakers, a rise in the minimum wage not only would not lower but would, on the contrary, increase the rate of inflation. To reduce it it is essential to saturate the consumer market either by increasing production or, temporarily, thanks to credit resources, thereby creating real conditions for a lowering of prices. Having dwelt on questions connected with a normalization of the financial situation, the participants in the meeting observed that the criminal machinations and exaggerations in determination of the price of the dollar perpetrated by a number of private banks are serious destabilizing factors in this sphere. The president of Azerbaijan gave the necessary instructions in this connection. Having considered the proposed draft presidential edict, the participants in the meetings were of the opinion that it should be reworked with the participation of scientists and specialists. The meeting was summed up by Geydar Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, who delivered an important speech. Afiyaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Council, Fuad Guliyev, first deputy prime minister, State Counselors Arif Ragimzade, Gabil Guseynli, and Idayat Orudzhev, Deputy Prime Ministers Samed Sadykhov, Elchin Efendiyev, and Asker Mamedov, and Rafael Allakhverdiyev, chief of the executive of the city of Baku, took part in the meeting.
