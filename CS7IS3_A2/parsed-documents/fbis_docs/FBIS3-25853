He believed that the annual GNP growth rate should not be under 12 percent. However, the State Council has stipulated the GNP growth rate for this year to be 9 percent. Deng Xiaoping had not summoned Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, or Zhu Rongji since July last year. His remarks were made to Ding Guangen, his bridge partner, who relayed the message to the central Political Bureau. Ding Guangen said that recently, Comrade Xiaoping had aired his views on economic growth rate being fast or slow; he believed that should the economic growth be too fast, it would inevitably bring side effects, such as inflation and an imbalance between supply and demand. Deng Xiaoping indicated that economic growth should be viewed in a dialectical way; people should not always be scared of inflation surfacing and an imbalance between supply and demand whenever a fast growth rate is advocated. Deng Xiaoping stressed: "Only with a fast growth rate will it be possible for our economy to possess a solid foundation, ensure the employment rate, and reduce social contradictions." It has been learned that earlier last year, Deng Xiaoping said that we must have an annual 12 percent economic growth rate; otherwise, China will never reach the level of a moderately developed country. The source said that Deng Xiaoping's remarks had an "obvious target" because some members of the central authorities vigorously advocated slowing the economic growth rate. At the economic work conference last year, the GNP was stipulated to be 9 percent. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's target was 9 to 10 percent and he believed that this index would ensure economic growth while maintaining social stability. In recent years, Deng Xiaoping has vigorously advocated speeding up the growth rate. The precise reason why he made the southern inspection tour in the spring of 1992 was that he was unhappy about the dullness and seeming stagnation of the three-year improvement and consolidation. What he mainly required was that the economy "mounted a new plane every several years." The essence of Deng Xiaoping's current talks did not go beyond those he delivered during his southern inspection tour in 1992. Although Deng Xiaoping was repeating his own words, they had a particularly clear target at this specific moment. The leading members in office were very sensitive about it but they have not publicly propagated Deng's remarks as of today lest they should rekindle the just dampened local government craze for investment, which would then become even more difficult to control. It has also been learned that at a recent high-ranking conference in Beijing, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji declared that the tasks for macroeconomic regulation and control had not been completed; currently, it is still necessary to reduce the momentum of inflation, the trend to widen the capital construction scope, and the volume of bank loans and money issued. The main task for 1994 is a soft landing and it is primarily necessary to do a good job of reform. Local governments were all drawing up their plans for dealing with the central reform measures, especially for banking and tax reform. It is said that Guangdong and Jiangsu already have their well thought out plans, whereas other localities are sending personnel to Guangdong to learn from its experiences by taking advantage of extending greetings for the Spring Festival. The source said that Deng Xiaoping does not have any current plan to conduct a "second inspection tour" down south to Guangdong; nevertheless, it is thought that he will make an appearance and say something during the Spring Festival to set the principle and guidelines for the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference upcoming in March.
