Chissano said, however, that the process should advance quickly so that those areas are open to all political groups, and for businessmen to operate. He also said the lack of freedom of movement in areas under Renamo control, the movement of armed men of that organization, and the policy of violence against citizens who do not abide by its rules are causing concern.
