FBIS4-29781 "dreas119__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-119-A Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Continued Reports on U.S.-Japan Framework Talks Continued Reports on U.S.-Japan Framework Talks Government Procurement Discussed OW2106104194 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 21 Jun 94 Morning Edition 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2106104194 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Of the three priority sectors, Japan and the United States are expected to reach an agreement on the government procurement sector in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks prior to Japan-U.S. summit to be held during the industrialized nations' summit talks (the Naples summit) scheduled for July. During negotiations on the government procurement sector, the Japanese side has promised that the Japanese Government offices will "significantly increase" their purchase of foreign-made communications apparatuses and medical equipment, and the United States has virtually accepted the promise as "Japan's future commitment." The United States is likely to definitely promise Japan that the it will not impose any sanctions against Japan on the grounds that Japan has failed to live up to its future commitment. The two countries will work out an agreement document after vice ministerial negotiations, which are scheduled for Tokyo beginning 22 June, discuss the details of the words "significant increase." Both Japan and the United States are in a hurry to coordinate their views on the insurance sector, one of the three priority sectors, in an effort to find areas of agreement prior to the Naples summit. The two countries, however, have still failed to bridge their wide differences on the automobile and auto parts sector, and it would be difficult for the two countries to reach an agreement on the sector prior to the Naples summit. The two countries are expected to put off settling negotiations on the automobile and auto parts sector until later by compiling an "interim report" assessing progress in the negotiations. As a result, the two countries will have to seek a phased-settlement for the three priority sectors in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. In the negotiations on the government procurement sector, both Japan and the United States are expected to concede to each other on the question of how to handle an "objective criteria" aimed at measuring the openness of the Japanese market. During the negotiations on government procurement, the Japan has given the United States it's commitment to a "significant increase" while rejecting any "numerical targets" which commit it to specific market shares for American corporations in the government procurement sector. The idea is surfacing of making the phrase "Japan's maintenance of the past growth trend in the medium and long term" Japan's commitment, and the vice ministerial negotiations will discuss details of Japan's commitment. The purchase of foreign-made telecommunications apparatuses and medical equipment by government offices in 1992 amounted to approximately $32 million and $85 million, respectively. Japan has so far maintained that the objective criteria should be used as a yardstick to measure the actual purchase of telecommunications apparatus and medical equipment by government offices from the past to the present. The United States, however, has argued that the objective criteria should be used as some targets for future purchases. Thus, the two countries dispute how to apply the objective criteria. The United States has asserted that "government procurement is different from the private sector's procurement and the government can intervene in the its own procurement to some extent." The Japanese Government has decided to give the United States it's moderate commitment after accepting this assertion. The United States is likely to praise highly Japan's policy shift to accept the U.S. demand for setting future targets. Japan and the United States are in a hurry to settle the negotiations on the government procurement sector, because the deadline for deciding whether to slap sanctions against Japan in accordance with a provision concerning the government procurement in the Omnibus Trade Act falls at the end of June. If the two countries fail to reach an agreement on the government procurement sector, prompting the U.S. Congress to begin debating sanctions against Japan, the yen would further appreciate against the U.S. dollar on foreign exchange markets and a steep rise in the yen's exchange rate against the dollar would have an adverse impact on the economies of the two countries. Both countries fear the consequences of this.
