It is scheduled for 13.05 minutes 32 seconds Moscow time, January 8. A "Soyuz TM-18" vehicle with three cosmonauts on board is to be orbited by Russian military-space forces from the Baykonur cosmodrome. The rocket is already in position on the launching pad. A meeting of the state commission is to endorse the main and stand- by crews today. At present, the main crew includes Viktor Afanasyev (commander of the vehicle), Yuriy Usachev (board engineer), and Valeriy Polyakov (research cosmonaut, physician). The stand-by crew includes Yuriy Malenchenko (commander) and Tolgat Musabayev (kazakh board engineer). The docking of the "Soyuz TM-18" vehicles with the "Mir" orbital complex is to take place at 14 hours 50 minutes Moscow time on January 10 (plus-minus 10 minutes). The members of the 15th main expedition will work on board the station for three days together with the crew of the 14th main expedition -- Vasiliy Tsybliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov, who began their orbital flight on July 1st, 1993. Tsybliyev and Serebrov had to remain on orbit for 146 days (until November 24, 1993), but due to difficulties with the timely delivery of carrier-rockets for the "Mir" complex, the crew's stay on the orbit was prolonged for 200 days (until January 17, 1994). The cosmonauts agreed to this prolongation. And now the landing capsule of the "Soyuz TM-17" transport vehicle is expected to touch down at 11 hours 25 minutes Moscow time, January 14. Tsybliyev and Serebrov have made five exits into open space in the course of the flight, remaining there for a total of 14 hours 2 minutes. The implementation of the planned research programme and experiments was impeded by the limited financing of technological, biotechnological, geophysical and applied studies. Therefore, priority attention had to be given to research carried out on the commercial basis (for instance, nature studies and ecological research carried out to German and American orders), to astrophysical experiments ordered by the space research institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and also to works needed to draw up a target programme for the "Mir-2" station. The 15th main expedition is to stay on the orbit for 179 days (up to july 4). But the research cosmonaut (physician) will remain on the orbit for a much longer period -- 427 days. He will play host to two more expeditions on board the "Mir" station this year, first to the 16th expedition which is to last for 135 days (from June 22 to November 2), and to the 17th expedition, which is to last 157 days (from October 3). The 17th main expedition will include a representative from the European Space Agency. The experiments that are to be carried out during the 15th main expedition will focus on medical research. No exits into the open space are planned. Supplies to the "Mir" station will be brought by three cargo "Progress M" transport vehicles.
