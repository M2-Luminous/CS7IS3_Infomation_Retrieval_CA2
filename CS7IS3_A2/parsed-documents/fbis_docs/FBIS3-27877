In particular, in connection with the issue concerning Patriot missiles which was mentioned in the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, the government revealed that because Patriot missiles are purely defensive weapons, the government's review [komto] of deploying Patriot missiles is only one of the efforts to improve the ROK-U.S. combined defensive posture and thus has nothing do with nuclear issues.
