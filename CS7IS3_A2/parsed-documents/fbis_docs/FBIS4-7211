The LDP "will take issue of (some aspects of the budget bill the LDP cannot accept) and urge the government to amend what should be amended," the leader of Japan's largest opposition party told a group of reporters. Japan's fiscal 1994 state budget to cover outlays for the 12-month period that started on April 1 is already one month overdue. Kono also criticized Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key coalition party, of trying to dominate the policy-making process. "We cannot deny the fact that Shinsieto has come to assume greater weight in the government," he said. "Without question, it will be a fragile cabinet, as the ruling coalition has been reduced to a parliamentary minority." He rapped Shinseito, a former LDP breakaway, for maintaining the "two-tiered power structure," in an apparent reference to the growing dominance by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa of the policy-making process. Hata "is not the prime power in Shinseito," he said.
