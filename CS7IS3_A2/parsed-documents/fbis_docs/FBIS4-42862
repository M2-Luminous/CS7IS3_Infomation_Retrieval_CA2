A plan to amend Butrus-Ghali's report to the UN Security Council supposedly to include Denktas' intentions is already under way in New York. It is obvious that this attempt aims at changing the climate that has been created following the points made in the Butrus-Ghali report regarding Turkish intransigence. Once again, the United States and Britain rush to support the Turkish side. Once again, the United States and Britain attempt to prevent developments which are not satisfactory to Ankara and Denktas. Again and again, the United States and Britain render useless, or at least attempt to render useless, every possibility to steer the Cyprus issue onto the right course. It is natural that these attempts concern us and we should deal with them in a decisive and vigorous manner, because we do not have the margin to be dragged into a process which derails the Cyprus issue even further from its correct direction and framework.
