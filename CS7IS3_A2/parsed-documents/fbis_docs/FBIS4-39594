Here is our correspondent Aleksey Venediktov. [Venediktov] The passing of the second reading of the budget was replete with dramatic situations. The parliamentary speaker Ivan Rybkin delayed the opening of the evening session by 42 minutes and assembled the heads of all the political groupings in the presidium room. He proposed adopting all the amendments put forward by the budget committee as a single package without voting on each one separately. Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov demanded that Sergey Glazyev should be allowed to speak on one amendment on setting up a non-budgetary fund into which would go the money from privatization and from which the money would be used for the needs of the army. The leader of the Yabloko group, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, stated that if Glazyev was allowed to say anything at all, then he would demand that all 275 amendments should be voted on separately. As a result of such slight blackmail, all the amendments were grouped together for a single vote. [Announcer] The document was then passed by a majority of two. [Correspondent Ivan Trefilov] The State Duma's deputies had the wisdom to leave unchanged the main figures of the budget which were adopted in the first reading. In 1994 expenditure will be 194.5 trillion rubles [R] and revenue will be R124.5 trillion. The budget deficit is fixed at R70 trillion which is 36 percent of the expenditure section. Thanks to the efforts of the budget committee, some corrections have been made within various articles. There has been a reduction of R4.5 trillion in expenditure on foreign economic activity and a reduction of R1.5 trillion in expenditure on servicing the internal debt. The total savings amounted to R8.5 trillion. These monies will be used to add R3.5 trillion to the defense budget. The subjects of the Russian Federation have received just under R3 trillion. The rest of the savings has been directed to supporting the social and cultural sphere, to scientific and fundamental research and to law enforcement activity. Support was also given to the proposal of the budget committee to create a special non-budgetary fund to support the army. Ivan Trefilov for Ekho Moskvy from the State Duma. [Announcer] Those who voted for the budget were primarily the Communists and Agrarians. In an interview to our correspondent [Communist leader] Gennadiy Zyuganov stated: [Begin Zyuganov recording] This is the logic of common sense. Any government, regardless of its ideology, if it is going to operate, will be obliged to tackle these questions regardless of what its overall basic views are. Everyone wants to eat, work and have social protection and adequate security. [end recording] [Announcer] Parliament's democratic wing came out against the budget. In an interview with journalists [Yegor] Gaydar, leader of Russia's Choice said: [Begin Gaydar recording] I would like to point out that the very idea of creating a non-budgetary fund with monies from privatization for financing defense is an obvious delusion. The budget was one small weakness: It is clearly unrealistic. It is clearly out of touch with the possibilities of Russia's economic development in 1994. It has many things which are not at all correct. [end recording] [Announcer] Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the Yabloko grouping, holds a position which is similar in principle. [Begin Yavlinskiy recording] The voting just now concerned the redistribution of 10 percent within the budget. This is not a fundamental issue. In those places where, say, 70 percent of our amendments were adopted it was somewhat improved, but this did not alter the overall situation. [end recording] [Announcer] The budget will now be sent to the Federation Council. Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Budget Committee of the upper chamber, told our correspondent: [Begin Gonchar recording] It has evidently been suggested to the leadership of the Federation Council that the Federation Council should be convened earlier than planned, that is, perhaps, next week because, I believe, the situation is rather tense. I think the Federation Council will come under very strong pressure and the Federation Council deputies will find themselves between the pressure put on them from above and the pressure put on them from below. [end recording] [Announcer] However, before the document can be examined by the upper chamber it must undergo its third reading. In accordance with the law, the government should, within a period of two weeks, take account of the observations which the Duma made today and, after this, put it forward for the final vote.
