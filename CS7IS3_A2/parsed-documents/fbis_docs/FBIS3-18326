Andreatta and Yusuf, said the communique, agreed on the need to support national reconciliation efforts and that warring Somali factions must be the ones to identify acceptable forms of future contacts. Andreatta stressed that after Western contingents withdraw from Somalia, leaving fewer United Nations troops in the country, international aid efforts will be forced to be directed to more secure areas where "pacification is more advanced." He also warned that Italian aid will continue only if guarantees are given on the safety of Italians. Yusuf reportedly assured Andreatta that the SSDF, of the northern Mijurtin clan and one of the two strongest military forces in Somalia, will provide these guarantees. The ministry described the talks as cordial. They followed a tour by Italian Foreign Undersecretary Carmelo Azzara' in the Horn of Africa last week, when he also met Somali warlord General Aideed in Nairobi, Kenya. Although the SSDF has been at war with Aideed's clan since the fall of dictator Mohammed Siad Barre in January 1991, Yusuf in May of last year began talks with Aideed, talks which were not officially sponsored by the political wing of the party, led by SSDF president Mohammed Abshir.
