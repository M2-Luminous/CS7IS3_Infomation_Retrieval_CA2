We connect you with correspondent Laszlo Gardai at the parliament building: [Gardai]] I am glad that the two parties could agree on the programs: In the future, good cooperation will depend on goodwill, dialogue, and teamwork, the president said. He expressed his hope that disputes can be resolved later, just as they can now. The two sides' flexible attitude is promising for the future, he said. The coalition cannot be avoided, and the result of the elections was not surprising for me, Arpad Goncz said, though the Hungarian Socialist Party's very large victory made the assumption that a social-liberal government was to be formed a bit doubtful. Arpad Goncz repeated that the second free elections had been more important than the first. The large turnout indicated that the country cares about its fate and wants a say in its affairs. In connection with the coalition negotiations, Arpad Goncz said that he had not found any intention to shut out the opposition. Modest optimism is justified for the future, Arpad Goncz said. In reply to a question he said that he hopes the whole country will be able to cooperate in a harmonious way. He asked the coalition partners not to forget the opposition and to understand its role, if only because they represent one-third of the country in the parliament.
