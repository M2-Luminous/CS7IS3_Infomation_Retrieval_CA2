The newspaper dismissed claims by State President F. W. de Klerk and ANC President Nelson Mandela that the constitution they had drafted was a federal one, saying scores of foreign experts had pointed out that it was not. The newspaper made an urgent call for the election to be postponed. The SUNDAY TIMES also accused the ANC of being responsible for the massacre of Zulu demonstrators during their march in Johannesburg last week. The paper said its reporters had proved that most of the shooting had come from identifiable ANC supporters. The newspaper also said it had been arrogant of ANC President Nelson Mandela to deny detectives access to Shell House to gather evidence.
