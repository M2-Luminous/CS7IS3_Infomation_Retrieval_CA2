Following the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks in February, the industry has been studying measures to increase purchases of U.S.-made products at the private-sector level. The two main points of the plan are: 1) to set up a new consultative organization between the U.S. Big Three automakers and Japanese car dealers in the field of finished cars; and 2) to increase members of the existing consultative body between Japanese automakers and the U.S. auto parts industry in the auto parts field. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association [Jikokai or JAMA] (chaired by Yutaka Kume) and other organizations will brief the U.S. industry on the plan. Together with voluntary plans now under study by individual automakers, including Toyota Motor Corporation, the Japanese industry intends to make a final decision on its plan by late this month when the government is to issue its study on a package of market-opening measures. As far as the expansion of imports of finished cars is concerned, JAMA will serve as mediator in urging the Big Three automakers to set up a consultative body between the Japan Automobile Dealers Association (chaired by Keishin Kato) and the U.S. Automobile Manufactures Association, an organization of U.S. automakers. JAMA has maintained that "the increase in sales of American cars on the Japanese market is decided by the thinking of consumers," (as stated by JAMA Chairman Kume). Because JAMA has stated the need for U.S. makers to negotiate directly with Japanese dealers, it plans to establish a venue for negotiations between the two sides. Meanwhile, JAMA and the U.S. Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA) have already set up a consultative body in the auto parts field. The Japan Auto Parts Manufacturers Association (Bukokai, chaired by Masao Itagaki) plans to join the consultative body. Because about 140 auto parts makers of Bukokai, which has approximately 500 members, own production bases in the United States, the association intends to increase those Japanese-affiliated makers' procurement of auto parts in the United States.
