FR940719-2-00053 FR940719-2-00029 Defense Logistics Agency Defense Logistic Agency's Termination of the Regional Freight Consolidation Center Program AGENCY: Defense Logistics Agency, DOD. ACTION: Notification of termination of RFCC program. SUMMARY: The Defense Logistics Agency has terminated its Regional Freight Consolidation Center program and will no longer use the centers in new contract solicitations. To avoid the expense of modifying contracts, however, DLA will allow vendors with outstanding contracts to ship to the RFCCs until July 22, 1994. Before DLA created The RFCC program in November 1988, vendors delivered all products directly to DLA depots. The RFCC program was designed to reduce vendor transportation costs by consolidating small package and less-than-truckload shipments at regional centers, which then shipped the larger loads to DLA depots. DLA believed that vendors would pass these savings on to the government as lower-priced bids for Department of Defense contracts. At its peak, the program included seven regional centers_five operated by commercial firms and two operated by DLA depots. DLA officials decided to end the program for several reasons. Most important, DLA was not satisfied that vendors were passing transportation savings on to DOD in the form of lower contract prices and the RFCCs sometimes increased delivery time to customers. In addition, because DOD is downsizing, the volume of shipments is decreasing and the cost of operating the centers would outweigh the savings realized. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 22, 1994.
