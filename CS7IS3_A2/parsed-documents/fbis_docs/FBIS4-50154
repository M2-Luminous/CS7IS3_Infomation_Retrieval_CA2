"The two countries have no fundamental conflicts of interests, either from the geopolitical or geo-economic point of view," said Zhou Shijian, deputy director of the Institute of International Trade Research under the foreign trade ministry. "What we have in common outweighs what divides us," he said in an interview with BUSINESS WEEKLY. Despite the differences that do exist, he said, bilateral trade and economic relations will continue growing steadily. "We should be clearly aware of the fact that despite all the major or minor skirmishes between the two nations in the past, bilateral trade has developed in the fast lane." For example, bilateral relations suffered major setbacks in 1981 and 1989. While two-way trade plummeted in 1982 and 1983, it has maintained astonishing growth since 1989. According to Chinese figures, two-way trade in 1993 was 176 per cent over that in 1988. Under American accounting standards, two-way trade last year was quadruple that of 1987. "The exceptional growth momentum proves that the mutually beneficial nature of the two countries' economies is not subject to changes by wishful thinking," Zhou said. The potential for co-operation lies in more than just economics, he said. Zhou believes the two countries need each other when it comes to strategic and political interests in the face of the new international situation. "The U.S. cannot ignore the fact that China has one-fifth of the world's population and has its own nuclear power, that China is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and is an important element for stability in the Asia-Pacific region," he said. "Sino-U.S. relations are expected to improve further with the fall of U.S. hegemony and the rise of conflicts between the U.S. and Japan, Europe and Russia." Because of the differences in social systems and values, Zhou said, it isn't strange to see China and the United States locked in skirmishes over some major issues. However, he cautioned that the direction of bilateral trade-fast growth -- should not be overshadowed by these differences. "Isn't it out of date for the U.S. administration to be simmering with debate over whether or under what conditions to continue most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade status for China while most Western countries are helping their businesses to enter the Chinese market?" Zhou pointed out that many U.S. senators, policy strategists and business executives have demanded an end to the U.S. practice of annually reviewing China's MFN status. They argue that wielding MFN renewal as a possible trade sanction is a tactic of the Cold War period and no longer suits the current world situation. Zhou said the Clinton administration cannot afford to ignore the importance of the Chinese market if it wants to keep the U.S. economy growing. He noted that China plans to import; $1 trillion in goods over the next seven years. "This vast market," Zhou stressed, "will be attractive to U.S. and other foreign businesses."
