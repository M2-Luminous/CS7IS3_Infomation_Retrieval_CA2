He told the Oil and Gas '94 international conference in Moscow on Wednesday that, in addition, Russia is shortly due to join the European Energy Charter Treaty, which would provide more favorable conditions for foreign investors. He said Russian President Boris Yeltsin's December decree entitling Russian and foreign businesses investing in the exploration and development of mineral deposits to part of the minerals extracted from them made it possible to embark on major oil and gas projects. One of such projects is Sakhalin 1, Shatalov said. He said the Russian Economics and Environmental Protection Ministries would soon consider the project and that a contract on it would be signed before the end of the year. Another project is soon due to be launched, Sakhalin 2, to be handled by the MMMSM international consortium, Shatalov said. Output-sharing agreements will also be signed with foreign firms which are to work deposits in the Timan-Pechora oil and gas province encompassing parts of northwestern Russia's Komi Republic and Arkhangelsk Region. Apart from that, Russia's Energy Ministry and the administrations of the country's Volgograd and Saratov Regions by May 20 are due to finish talks with the French company Elf Aquitane on developing oil and gas deposits in the two regions.
