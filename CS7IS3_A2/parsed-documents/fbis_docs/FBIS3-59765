The plastic processing industry has many small and mid-sized companies, and business expansion on a global scale has lagged behind other industries. In addition to its current measures to combat the high value of the yen, MITI has decided that healthy business growth will be impossible without expansion in Asia, which is a site of potential growth. Furthermore, various countries in Asia are looking to Japanese industry to raise the level of their plastic processing technology and train their personnel, so mutual exchanges of personnel are on the rise. In addition to ROK and Taiwan, the petrochemical industry is expanding rapidly in Southeast Asian countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. At the same time, in these countries the plastic processing industry is expanding as well in step with the rapid growth in assembly industries such as the electric/electronics industry and a higher standard of living. According to MITI, Thailand alone has about 3000 plastic processing companies. The fact is, however, that international expansion by Japanese plastic processing companies has lagged behind other industries. MITI contends that we cannot expect future growth in this industry without expansion in Southeast Asia, which is becoming a major consumer site. Therefore, MITI will begin a study to allow for Japanese companies to make capital investments and provide technical training in Asia in a smooth manner, and also to raise the level of technology in the region and cooperate in personnel training. MITI plans to conduct this study through the Japan High Polymer Center, a non-profit corporation with experience in overseas technical cooperation such as a plastic processing testing and inspection project in Uruguay and a water-retaining materials project in Egypt. MITI plans to begin a new policy of global expansion through mutual exchanges of personnel with Asia, which continues to grow rapidly not only as an export base to the U.S. and Europe, but also as a huge consumer market. The New Fiber Vision, for which an interim report was recently released, also proposes the establishment of a new global strategy centered on Asia. In the petrochemical industry as well, a Southeast Asia study group will be dispatched by the International Supply & Demand Subcommittee of the Petrochemical Product Supply & Demand Research Institute. All this will add impetus to expansion in Asia in fields related to the chemical industry.
