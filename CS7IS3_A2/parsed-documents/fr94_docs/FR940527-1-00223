FR940527-1-00223 FR940527-1-00014 â€¢The ProPAC CIPI has no interest component. PROPAC treats interest rate changes as a separate update factor component. Through 1995, for example, ProPAC expects that long term interest rates will remain stable and, therefore, believes that it is not appropriate to adjust capital payments for forecasted changes in interest rates in the target year. HCFA incorporates a vintage-weighted composite of interest rates in its CIPI for the target year. BILLING CODE 4120&hyph;01&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSEP27MY94.003 BILLING CODE 4120&hyph;01&hyph;C 2. Depreciation ProPAC states that its CIPI is analogous to the prospective payment operating price index. We disagree. The components of the operating index represent price changes in ongoing hospital expenses for labor and non- capital goods and services. The analogous capital expenses in this context are current depreciation costs, interest costs and other capital-related expenses (taxes and insurance). Current depreciation and interest costs are a cumulative composite of segments of expenses incurred in current and prior periods. Current interest costs are a cumulative composite of segments of past and current year debt costs. Since both depreciation and interest costs have a vintage component, the price aspect of these costs must have a vintage component as well. The HCFA CIPI attempts to capture these vintage components.
