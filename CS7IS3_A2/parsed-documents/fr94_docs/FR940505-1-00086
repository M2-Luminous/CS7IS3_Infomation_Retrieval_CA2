FR940505-1-00086 FR940505-1-00012 (a) Fees. Because of large diversity within and among AIM coating categories and because of the multitude of uses for these coatings, it may be preferable to establish a fee-based strategy for providing additional emission reductions rather than to establish limits for specific categories. For example, a fee-based strategy could be established using a combination of gallons sold and VOC in each gallon (e.g., an annual fee equaling total grams or pounds of VOC sold by each manufacturer). Because fees provide uncertainty as to actual emission reductions, the fees would need to be periodically adjusted to achieve their intended reduction and market response. Currently, EPA has limited FIP authority (see III.A.2.b. and c.) to collect and redistribute fees. Because fees have previously not been used as an emission reduction strategy, limited data is available to predict and establish the level of fee necessary to achieve the intended reductions. With these constraints in mind, EPA is asking for comment on the potential use of fee-based approaches for within the FIP. This concept is also discussed in III.C.5.i.(3). (b) Corporate Average VOC Emission (CAVE) Limit. Within the Reg Neg discussions, the concept of a CAVE limit has been suggested. The CAVE limit would allow each manufacturer to average all coatings sold nationally to meet a single, overall grams of VOC per liter CAVE limit. The CAVE limit would be based on a table of standards (e.g., VOC limits for each category) and the previous sales for each manufacturer. In theory, the CAVE approach could be applied in the FIP on a statewide basis. Because the limit is based on averaging, it could provide uncertainty as to the expected reductions (e.g., increased use of both a high and low VOC coating may not decrease actual emissions to the predicted amount). Therefore, a backstop measure (e.g., a cap on overall emissions per manufacturer) may be needed to guarantee expected reductions. Although the details of this concept have not been worked out, EPA is asking for comment on the potential use of a CAVE approach for AIM coatings regulated within the FIP. (c) Manufacturers Bubble. In EPA's 1990 FIP proposal, the concept of a manufacturers bubble was proposed as a backstop measure. This approach would establish a single gram or pound of VOC per year limit for each manufacturer selling coatings within California. Each manufacturer's limit could be established using a table of standards and historical annual sales. This approach aggressively encourages the use of low-VOC coatings, provides greater assurance of actual reductions, and could potentially be expanded to incorporate additional flexibility, such as a banking/trading component. Although the details of this concept have not been worked out, EPA is asking for comment on the potential use of a manufacturers bubble for coatings regulated within the FIP. This concept is further discussed in III.C.5.i.
