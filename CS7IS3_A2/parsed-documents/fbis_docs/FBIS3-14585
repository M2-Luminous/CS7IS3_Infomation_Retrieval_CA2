This will erode the competitive edge that developing countries currently enjoy. The prime minister raised this issue today during the plenary session of the fourth G-15 summit meeting in New Delhi. Briefing Malaysian journalists, Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said he regarded the prime minister's statement as an early warning for developing countries so they are not caught up in what is seemingly a very attractive scheme to protect the interests of workers. He said Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir pointed out that such a scheme is not advantageous to them. The economies of developing countries economies would be destroyed. They would lose their competitive edge and ultimately be confronted with a severe unemployment problem. The only advantage that developing countries currently have is cheap labor. This has enabled them to develop their economies and produce goods at a much cheaper price. On the other hand, the developed nations have numerous advantages, such as capital, skilled manpower, and modern technology. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir told leaders at the session that if they are forced to accept the global minimum wage scheme, their economies will be continuously harmed. Although the scheme looks good on the surface, it will not be beneficial because it will ultimately lead to the closing of factories and bring about unemployment. He also pointed out that the standard of living is low in the developing countries and should therefore not be compared with the developed nations. He considered the move to impose a global minimum wage a protectionist policy against the developing countries, regardless of whether such a policy is linked to issues of democracy, the environment, or human rights. Datuk Abdullah said the prime minister also welcomed the issue raised by the Senegalese President Abdou Diouf with regard to the Western media. The president believes the Western media does not present an accurate picture of the nations of the South, particularly the African states. The media only highlights negative aspects. Malaysia truly understands the sentiments expressed by the Senegalese leader. The current leaders of the G-15 are holding an unofficial meeting with representatives of leaders who are unable to attend the summit.
