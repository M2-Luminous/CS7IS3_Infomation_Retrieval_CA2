At today's discussion, Municipal Party Secretary Wu Bangguo and Mayor Huang Ju spoke at length to explain once again about Shanghai's shopping basket project. Deputy Wu Bangguo said: "I would like to use a common expression. I am just like a scale that carries a 1,000-jin weight. Shanghai residents will be angry if they do not see vegetables for three days. Comrade Zemin used to say in Shanghai that the people can see the situation from their shopping baskets. I think this is an issue that directly concerns the people's interests. Further, we all know that the vegetable supply in Shanghai often fluctuates. Sometimes they are in short supply and sometimes they are abundant. When they are in short supply, urban residents will grumble. When they are abundant, on the other hand, vegetable farmers complain. But it is not only Shanghai residents who are concerned about this problem, the general secretary and the premier also understand the problem very clearly." Speaking from the viewpoint of Shanghai residents, Mayor Huang Ju talked about his plan for the shopping basket project: "A prominent contradiction is the vegetable issue, and the prominent contradiction of the issue is how to reduce difficulties and enhance our ability to adapt green vegetables supplies due to seasonal changes. We should start a new-generation shopping basket project, called the green vegetable project. We should guarantee [?40,000 mu of land for this project]. Once this has been decided, it should not be changed for 10 to 15 years. Even if the land is infertile, the entire municipality should unanimously implement the policy. No changes should be carried out until after new farms have been established. Secondly, we should strengthen the establishment of agricultural facilities. The municipal government has allotted 250 million yuan to construct large sheds on 5,000 mu of farmland. [sentence indistinct] If Shanghai has 25,000 mu of vegetable farms with large sheds, the supply of vegetables for residents can be ensured. Further, we can gear our policy toward meeting this goal. Therefore, I believe that in three years' time, we can achieve our goal in green vegetable production." What should we do about enterprises that incur losses? This has been a noticeable problem in Shanghai in recent years. In their speeches today, deputies Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju gave us their thoughts on how to solve this long-standing problem. Wu Bangguo maintained: "We will continue to apply measures taken previously to tackle Shanghai's deficit-ridden enterprises one by one. The problem is relatively prominent in six out of our eight major industrial zones. In Shanghai's industrial zones, not all enterprises incur losses, although occasionally some of them encounter difficulties. There are about 144 such enterprises, involving some 165,000 people. How much is the loss? It is (?350 million) yuan. What can these enterprises do? My view is that the market economy is different from the planned economy. There are no losses in the planned economy because the state assumes unlimited responsibility and makes up for losses incurred by enterprises. However, in the market economy, there are both newly formed enterprises and long-established enterprises, leading to a situation in which the fittest survive. Deficit-ridden enterprises should not always use old methods to solve their problems. They should actively explore and apply the laws of the market economy to solve their problems. An enterprise may possess market share and be known for quality and efficiency, but it may have too much plant and equipment. We can help this type of plant by reorganizing it into a new enterprise. This is called injecting new blood, the purpose of which is to avoid (?collapse). For a second type of enterprise, we should undertake what we call merger. We may [words indistinct] some deficit-ridden enterprises while leasing or auctioning off others. However, merger is a very good method. In recent years, Shanghai has merged 456 enterprises with relatively good results. This year, we have decided to merge between 80 and 100 enterprises. We should be determined in tackling bankrupt enterprises. I personally feel that if we succeed in tackling the bankruptcy issue, it will carry major significance for the establishment of the socialist market economic system. This means we will have taken another step forward." On ways to help troubled enterprises, Deputy Huang Ju said: "Shanghai is currently dealing with this problem. Its approach is to rely on the social security system to guarantee the basic living expenses of workers. Enterprises and the government should support the social security system in order to guarantee the basic living expenses of workers and to let everybody derive tangible results from reform. Therefore, to do a good job is to improve people's lives in the course of economic development. In eliminating difficulties, Shanghai will not confine its efforts to injecting new blood but will mainly focus on changing enterprises' mechanisms and on developing their blood-making functions so as to acquire new [words indistinct]." Deputy Huang Ju is very familiar with Shanghai's strengths and weaknesses. He is keenly aware of his heavy responsibility stemming from what is expected from Shanghai by the central authorities. He specifically thanked other provinces and municipalities for their support for Shanghai. Today, he told fellow deputies and dozens of Chinese and foreign correspondents who were present either as visitors or to cover the NPC session: "Shanghai is a metropolis as well as a city devoid of energy and raw and semifinished materials; it is an open port city with a huge population and a limited supply of land. Although we have a strong industrial base, we are confronted with the question of how to further enliven large and medium state enterprises. Some of the measures and methods that we have adopted can only be applied to Shanghai; they cannot be promoted in other parts of the country. We need the understanding and support of fraternal provinces across the country. "Shanghai is worthy of its name in three aspects. It is my opinion that we should truly implement Comrade Zemin's requirement that we be worthy of our name in these three aspects. We should truly justify our leading role among areas targeted for development along the Chang Jiang. To do so, we must elevate our standards and development baseline. We should introduce technology and management expertise from abroad, assimilate them, and disseminate without reservation the results of our assimilation across the country so that Shanghai will truly become a distribution center in this respect. Moreover, we should really justify our name as a prospective international economic, financial, and trade center. This year, we should actually start moving and strive to achieve this goal. Of course, turning Shanghai into an international economic, financial, and trade center in the Asia-Pacific and West Pacific regions is a long-term task which will take about 20 years to accomplish. But it does not run counter to our goal of becoming a center in another area. Comrade Zemin has specifically called on Shanghai to become the Shanghai of the entire nation. We feel [?we have come a long way] from the Shanghai of the fifties through the eighties to become today the Shanghai supported by the rest of the country. Particularly during the nineties, Shanghai enjoys the support of other parts of the country in its development drive. Of Shanghai's 3 million residents who came from other parts of the country, 1 million work in major construction projects or in partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, thus contributing to Shanghai's construction. Shanghai should serve, support, and contribute more to other parts of the country. To this end, we shall send more people to fraternal provinces this year to learn from their valuable experience. Also, we shall further explore the means of cooperation with fraternal provinces and municipalities in the interests of common prosperity."
