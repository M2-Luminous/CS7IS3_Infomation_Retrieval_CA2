The idea and theory of dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il on consistently maintaining the socialist principle in revolution and construction illuminated a revolutionary path that enables us to thoroughly smash the imperialists' anti-socialist maneuvers and to tenaciously defend, protect, and carry to accomplishment the socialist cause. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: The principle of socialism should be consistently maintained in the revolution and construction to carry to accomplishment the socialist cause. The dear comrade leader clearly expounded the fundamental principle that should be consistently maintained in socialist construction. The fundamental principle that should be consistently maintained in socialist construction is to thoroughly protect and embody the independent demands and interest of the popular masses. The socialist society is a society that has embodied the natural demand of the popular masses to eliminate exploitation and oppression of the people by the people and to live all equally independently. The course of building socialism and communism is the course of realizing the total independence of the popular masses. Although circumstances and conditions of struggle in the course of building socialism may change, the fundamental demand and position of the popular masses to achieve independence will never change. Therefore, the party of the working class should tenaciously defend the independent demand and interest of the popular masses while leading socialist construction, and should resolve all problems raised in the revolution and construction thoroughly in accordance with the fundamental interest of the popular masses. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has clearly elucidated the issue as to how one should carry out work to maintain the fundamental principle of socialism. For one to maintain the fundamental principle of socialism, which defends and protects the independent demand and fundamental interest of the popular masses, one should strengthen the party of the working class organizationally and ideologically, and should firmly ensure the party's guidance over the revolution and construction. In addition, one should constantly enhance the role and functions of the socialist regime; should adhere to and develop the socialist ownership, and should tenaciously struggle against the imperialists. This is the revolutionary principle which we cannot concede even to a slightest degree. The independent demand and interest of the popular masses can be firmly ensured and achieved only by the leadership of the party of the working class. The working class is the class that has embodied independence at the highest level and that struggles more tenaciously than any other class for achieving the independent demands and interest of the popular masses. For the working class and for its party, there cannot be any other demands and interest than the demands and interest of the popular masses. The class mission of the working class is to thoroughly defend and achieve the demands and interest of the popular masses. Therefore, it is an indispensable demand to maintain consistently and thoroughly the embodiment of the revolutionary principle in socialist construction to strengthen the party and firmly ensure the party's leadership. It is a firm guarantee for thoroughly adhering to the principle of socialism to strengthen the socialist regime and enhance its role and functions. The socialist regime is a commanding system that represents the sovereignty of the popular masses--the masters of socialist society--and manages overall domains of socialist life in a unified manner. Thanks to the socialist regime, the independence of the popular masses is to be ensured, creative activities are to be carried out in a unified manner, and socialist construction is to be pushed for. Only when we strengthen the socialist regime, can we always dampen the swell of antirevolutionary factors by using revolutionary weapons under the condition that the imperialists are continuously maneuvering against socialism. To maintain [kosu] and develop socialist ownership is also important in holding fast to socialist principles. If we fail to maintain socialist ownership and tend toward private ownership, we would completely destroy the socialist system itself and, as a result, the working people would become slaves of capital. Therefore, we should constantly develop socialist ownership by evolving cooperative ownership into all-people ownership [hyoptongjok soyurul choninminjok soyuero chopkunsikinun pangboburo] while continuously enhancing the guiding role of all-people ownership. Revolutionary principles in socialist construction are importantly shown in one's attitude toward imperialists. It is particularly important to thoroughly hold fast to an anti- imperialist position under the situation in which imperialists are strengthening the antirevolutionary maneuver to annihilate [wahae] and destroy [malsal] the socialist cause. Accordingly, we should continue to struggle against imperialism. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il not only elucidated questions raised in adhering to socialist principles, but also clearly explained that one should not abandon the basic principle of socialism under any condition and that even the slightest concession of the basic socialist principle would result in the grave situation that the party itself will be destroyed and socialism will be frustrated. We should creatively develop our line and policies in accordance with the changing environments and conditions for the revolutionary struggle in the course of building socialism, communism. Under any situation, however, the working-class party shouldering the people's destinies should not deviate from revolutionary principles and the working-class line. To abandon revolutionary principles in the struggle in between socialism and capitalism means surrender and degeneration. If one vacillates in a temporary obstacle, yields under the imperialists' pressure, and abandons revolutionary principles after making a gradual concession of them, it will result in an unimaginably grave consequence. In adhering to the basic principle of socialism, it is particularly important to heighten our caution against pluralism being blared by imperialists and to thoroughly oppose it. The so-called pluralism cannot be allowed in socialist society. Ideological freedom, a multi-party political system, and varied ownership under the mask of pluralism are political methods of a capitalist society that is governed by a struggle for existence based on individualism and liberalism. As the socialist society is based on collectivism, and its heart [saengmyong] is the unity of popular masses, socialism and pluralism cannot coexist. Introduction of pluralism in socialism would encourage individualism and liberalism, which will infringe upon common social interests, destroy the unity of popular masses, and create social disorder and confusion. The allowance of ideological freedom and a multi-party political system will result in the destruction of socialist ground. An ideological struggle is the prelude of a political struggle, which finally develops into a power struggle. If antisocialist ideological trends are dissipated due to ideological liberalization and antirevolutionary political parties' activities are guaranteed by the allowance of democracy represented by the so-called multi-party system, the class enemies and reactionaries will raise their heads and try to conquer the people's regime. If we generally accept the capitalist political methods and economic system after completely abandoning socialist principles, being obsessed by an illusion of capitalism without faith in socialism, socialism will be frustrated and capitalism will revive. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il taught [karuchisimyonso] us that only one step backward from socialist principles will lead one to make 100 steps of concession and retrogression, and stressed that we should keep them to the last under any condition. Embodied herein is our party's revolutionary position and iron-strong will to consummate the socialist, communist cause under the banner of the chuche idea while boldly overcoming any severe circumstance and trial. The justness of the ideological theory on invariably adhering to socialist principles in the revolution and construction is clearly proven by specific realities in our country. All party members and working people should firmly keep the basic principle of socialism, whose justness and vitality are obviously being demonstrated, and should faithfully uphold the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.
