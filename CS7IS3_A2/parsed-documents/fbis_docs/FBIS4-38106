But the Yemeni leaders stand out for using the daily cease-fire violations to kill as many of their own innocent civilians as possible and to destroy the facilities and installations for which the Yemeni people have paid huge amounts of money, the paper says in its editorial today. It says the arrogant and intransigent positions of some Yemeni leaders and their rejection of any Arab mediation will not solve the problem. Indeed they will make things worse, deepen the wounds, and make it more difficult--if not impossible--for things to return to normal. AL-AKHBAR notes extensive Arab diplomatic activity to end the conflict and asks why the Sanaa government is sending envoys at the same time as it rejects Arab mediation as interference in its internal affairs. The paper expresses the fear that the Yemeni crisis may be internationalized given that some non-Arab quarters are exploiting it. This will only make things worse, it says.
