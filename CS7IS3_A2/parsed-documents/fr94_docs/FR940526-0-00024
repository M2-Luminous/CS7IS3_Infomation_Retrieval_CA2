FR940526-0-00024 FR940526-0-00010 The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempt therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his/her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the raisin marketing order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of producers and a minority of handlers of California raisins may be classified as small entities. An interim final rule was published in the Federal Register on March 17, 1994 [59 FR 12528], with an effective date of March 17, 1994. That rule established final free and reserve percentages for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year. The percentages were established in a new section 989.246 of the rules and regulations in effect under the marketing order. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended April 18, 1994. No comments were received. The order prescribes procedures for computing trade demands and preliminary and final percentages that establish the amount of raisins that can be marketed throughout the season. The regulations apply to all handlers of California raisins. Raisins in the free percentage category may be shipped immediately to any market, while reserve raisins must be held by handlers in a reserve pool for the account of the Committee, which is responsible for local administration of the order. Under the order, reserve raisins may be: Sold at a later date by the Committee to handlers for free use; used in diversion programs; exported to authorized countries; carried over as a hedge against a short crop the following year; or disposed of in other outlets noncompetitive with those for free tonnage raisins. While this rule may restrict the amount of Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins that enter domestic markets, final free and reserve percentages are intended to lessen the impact of the oversupply situation facing the industry and promote stronger marketing conditions, thus stabilizing prices and supplies and improving grower returns. In addition to the quantity of raisins released under the preliminary percentages and the final percentages, the order specifies methods to make available additional raisins to handlers by requiring sales of reserve pool raisins for use as free tonnage raisins under ``10 plus 10'' offers, and authorizing sales of reserve raisins under certain conditions.
