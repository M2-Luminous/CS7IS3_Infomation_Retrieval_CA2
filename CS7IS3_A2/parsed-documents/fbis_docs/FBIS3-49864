In its report, KOHA JONE reported Mr. Imami's view that "The Alliance paid in blood for a peaceful meeting." According to Mr. Imami, Cjovalin Cekimi was a member of the Democratic Alliance [AD], and a participant at the meeting. In connection with this shocking incident, I turned to Mr. Arben Imami, AD general secretary. [Brace] The spokesman of the Public Order Ministry late last night, and today's newspapers, reported a murder in the city of Shkoder yesterday. Because there is little information in the newspapers and the Public Order Ministry's report, please add something. [Imami] The Public Order Ministry's report is strange, because the background of the incident and its aim and purpose were political. The Public Order Ministry does not normally report the dozens of murders that take place in Albania, but this time it did, saying that this was an ordinary murder with nothing to do with the political background I am talking about. In brief, the chronological course of events was as follows: While we were holding our meeting, about 2030 members of the Democratic Party [PD] who work in the local PD presidium entered. Not receiving the support with which they intended to break up the meeting, they stood up following an order and demonstratively left the hall, shouting the basest insults and slanders. Our people were aroused, and an incident could have occurred. Aware of this, together with Mr. Gjerjgj Zefi, the assembly's deputy chairman, we called on our party's members and supporters not to fall for this provocation. We continued the meeting in an entirely normal fashion for another 30 minutes. When the people left the hall, and obviously those who had remained behind were AD members and supporters, the murder occurred. According to eyewitness descriptions, a car arrived and stopped in front of the Migjeni Theater. Its engine was left running, and someone got out to meet someone else in a Toyota with an official license-plate. At this moment, the people from the hall arrived, and this person turned to the participant in the meeting, saying "Whoever insults Sali Berisha is a so-and-so, and does such-and- such." A minor conflict then followed; the person in question had the revolver he used for the attack constantly drawn. Other people tried to hold him back, stop him, and calm him, and then he committed his crime against a member of our party [words illegible] were together and included the one who commuted the crime, and whose names are known although one must wait for the ministry to issue them, at least one can already be said, here in Tirana without going to Shkoder to check, to be one of the main protagonists of the provocation inside the meeting hall. The plan was very clear. They entered the meeting to disrupt it, failed in this, went outside, organized themselves, decided to do something, came with the car, left the car engine running, and commuted the crime, while the car drove off and the murderer escaped on foot. The criminals have still not been detained, although, as the police say, they have been identified. To my mind, this is a murder, a second 2 April. The PD, which was the party that fought against violence and for freedom and democracy, is the party that today organizes all the counter- rallies, mounts provocations, and is creating an atmosphere of political crime. We have felt that political crimes were impending. I have even asked in the parliament, "Why do you not play the game politically, but play with life and death?" However, we will accept this game, and are ready to reply with our lives. The PD, having been the party of the struggle against crime, has become a party that organizes crime at all levels. The corruption that has enveloped the entire PD will naturally result in crime. Berisha too has particular responsibility, starting from the earlier incident when he asked what the Socialists wanted in Shkoder. One could say the same of anybody: What does the AD want in Shkoder? What do the Republicans want in Shkoder? -- as if Shkoder belonged only to the PD or to Sali Berisha. Meanwhile, strong feeling against Sali Berisha has arisen in Shkoder. We will exploit this mood against him. For the television and ATA, which daily issue statements calling the people of our party spies and mercenary dogs, and for a party fanatic who is also corrupt, the idea of defending certain values and murder [passage illegible] is clearly prepared and wound up morally, psychologically, and politically. [Brace] Mr. Imami, why this time against the AD? [Imami] We must realize that Shkoder is a citadel of democracy. Shkoder is a city of anticommunism, a city of freedom. Shkoder is a city of serious religious belief (I am not talking here about religious intolerance). Shkoder after all is a city, and the PD wanted to preserve its monopoly at least in Shkoder. It has no doubt conclusively lost its monopoly in Albania, but it wanted to at least preserve its monopoly in Shkoder, and our meeting there, with its substance, support, and splendid level of participation, no doubt touched its nerve. However, I will say one thing that we must remember. One of the murderers, one of the group, was a person who expects to gain something from privatization, at a time when we are speaking out against this privatization, which is a form of theft. Thus, the general political interests of this party coincide with the specific economic interests of corrupt individuals. Thus there is a combination of general and personal interests that leads to crime. [Brace] What will you do now? [Imami] It is a little early to talk about further action; we must not behave overhastily. We have a political responsibility because this person was one of our people and we stand by him. We did not succeed in protecting him against this fascist state while he was alive. This murder is typically fascist, because only fascists murder political activists and disrupt political demonstrations by such means. To come back to the question, I say that the party will defend this issue to the end, and we will explain calmly and without haste the means that we will employ. We will issue a statement at a news conference tomorrow. We will send a memorandum to European institutions. We will call on the members of our party not to retreat a single step in this issue and will plan our political action to the last detail: no retreat toward a restriction of freedom, toward a restriction of rights, no retreat when faced with this state of violence and organized crime.
