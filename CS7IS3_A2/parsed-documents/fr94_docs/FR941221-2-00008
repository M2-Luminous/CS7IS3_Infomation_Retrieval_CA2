FR941221-2-00008 FR941221-2-00006 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;549&hyph;502] Circular Welded Carbon Steel Pipes and Tubes From Thailand; Amended Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of amendment to final results of antidumping duty administrative review. SUMMARY: On November 29, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) submitted to the Court of International Trade (CIT) the final results of redetermination pursuant to a remand in Primary Steel, Inc. v. United States (Slip Op. 93&hyph;192, October 6, 1993). On January 14, 1994, the CIT affirmed our redetermination (Slip Op 94&hyph;7). In accordance with that affirmation, we are hereby amending the final results of the administrative review for the March 1, 1987, through February 29, 1988, period with respect to Thai Union Steel Co., Ltd. (Thai Union), Thai Hong Steel Pipe Co., Ltd. (Thai Hong), and Siam Steel Pipe Import-Export Co., Ltd. (Siam Steel). EFFECTIVE DATE: December 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas W. Prosser or Wendy J. Frankel, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;1130. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In the final results of administrative review, the dumping margin calculated by the Department for Thai Union pipe and tube sold to the United States during the period March 1, 1987, through February 29, 1988, was 38.51 percent (see Certain Circular Welded Carbon Steel Pipes and Tubes from Thailand, Final Results of the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 56 FR 58355 (November 19, 1991)). The 38.51 percent rate was also used as the basis for the best information available (BIA) for Thai Hong Steel, and Siam Steel, since significant portions of the responses from these two firms were unverifiable. Plaintiffs challenged the rates applied to all three companies. On October 6, 1993, the CIT, in Primary Steel, Inc. V. United States, Slip Op, 93&hyph;192, remanded to the Department for redetermination the final results of administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand. In accordance with the CIT's order, the Department has corrected two erroneous home market unit prices in its margin calculations. The CIT affirmed our redetermination on January 14, 1994 (Slip Op. 94&hyph;7). Amended Final Results of Review The revised weighted-average margin for Thai Union for the period March 1, 1987, through February 29, 1988, is 29.89 percent. The BIA rates for Thai Hong and Siam Steel are based on the highest calculated rate for this period of review, which continues to be Thai Union's revised rate. Because the BIA rates for Thai Hong and Siam Steel were based on Thai Union's rate, which the plaintiffs challenged as well as Thai Union's rate, we revised the BIA rates for Thai Hong and Siam Steel to 29.89 percent. The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between United States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentage stated above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. This notice is in accordance with section 516(a)(e) of the Act. Dated: December 13, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31361 Filed 12&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
