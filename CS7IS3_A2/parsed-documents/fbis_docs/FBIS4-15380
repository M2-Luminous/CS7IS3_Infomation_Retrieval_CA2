In an interview with Interfax on Thursday, he said it made no sense to try to involve such hardline opposition members as those granted amnesty recently in work over the draft. "If these people say they will agree to sign pact under their own terms, there can be no question of consensus with them," Filippov said. "I cannot really see how it will be possible to sign a peace pact with a party like Barkashov's," he added. The official said that "if there is a certain group of people who uphold extremist views, this does not mean that society must seek a compromise with them." The question is one of opening dialogue between the government and a civilized opposition, Filippov believes.
