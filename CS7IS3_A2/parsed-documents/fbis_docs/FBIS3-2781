Jiang made the statement in a 70-minute meeting with Warren Christopher who is in the third day of his China visit. Jiang noted that during the past 45 years, the Sino-U.S. relations have experienced many twists and turns, with both positive and negative experience to be drawn from. Practice shows that the Sino-U.S. relations can move forward so long as both sides view things from a world-wide perspective, proceed from the fundamental interests of the two peoples, respect each other, transcend their differences in ideology and expand cooperation. This will bring benefit to the two peoples and is favorable to world peace and stability as well. Otherwise, the bilateral ties will meet with difficulties and even suffer setbacks, he said. "We should all bear in mind the lessons in history." Recalling his meeting with U.S. President Clinton in Seattle last November, Jiang said he had told Clinton that the Sino-U.S. ties is not only a matter of bilateral relations. It should be viewed in a world-wide perspective and in the context of the approaching 21st century. China and the U.S. have common interests on many important issues, Jiang continued, stressing that the two sides should increase trust, reduce troubles, expand cooperation and avoid confrontation. "President Clinton shared my views. We all agreed that the Sino-U.S. relations should be handled with a long-term point of view and considered in a broader perspective. The differences should be resolved through dialogue and one side should not impose its views onto the other," Jiang said. He held that due to different social systems and ideologies, it is natural that China and the U.S. have differences on some issues, which should not become obstacles to the expansion of mutually beneficial cooperation. As both China and the U.S. are sovereign states, they can discuss their differences on the basis of equality and mutual respect, and no one should interfere in the other's internal affairs, he said. Concerning the issue of human rights, Jiang pointed out, "some people in the west are concerned not with the interests and welfare of the broad masses of the Chinese people but only a small number of people who attempt to subvert the Chinese Government and undermine China's stability. This in essence is not an issue of human rights but a political and legal issue. The government of every country is bestowed with the responsibility and obligation of upholding law and order and maintaining political stability. It is groundless for some people to accuse the Chinese Government in this regard," Jiang stressed. Christopher conveyed President Clinton's regards to President Jiang, saying that Clinton is determined to build a broader and more constructive relations between the U.S. and China. The two sides should seize the opportunity and take positive actions to push forward the bilateral ties, said Christopher. He also briefed Jiang on the U.S. views on human rights, the most favored nation status, proliferation of weapons and other issues. Jiang asked Christopher to convey his good wishes to President Clinton at the end of the meeting which proceeded in a "frank and candid atmosphere," according to a Chinese official. Among those present at the meeting were Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, U.S. Ambassador to China Stapleton Roy and senior U.S. officials accompanying Christopher on the visit.
