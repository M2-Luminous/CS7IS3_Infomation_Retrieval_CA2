As a result, an area half the size of the Saarland has been left devastated. Radioactivity from the former pits in the ore mining area in Saxony and Thuringia is posing a massive threat to drinking water supplies in eastern Germany. Let us take Koenigstein, for example. Wismut GmbH mining specialists and engineers believe that the uranium, which is readily soluble, would have to be "flushed out" of the rock before the Koenigstein mine, which is situated in the Elbe sandstone range, is closed down and flooded. This, they say, would be the only way to prevent radioactive substances from finding their way into the environment in the distant future. However, Saxony's Environment Ministry in Dresden, which has to license reclamation methods, fears that this in itself could contaminate a major groundwater stratum from which a million people in the Dresden and Pirna area draw their drinking water. What is going on in the pit whose closure could have a serious impact on the population's living standards? Koenigstein is one of the four mines from which the Wismut Soviet-German Joint-Stock Corporation (SDAG) extracted uranium for decades without regard to the damage inflicted on the environment and the health hazards to which it exposed the population. Processing plants then turned it into "yellow cake," the raw material for the fuel elements used in east German and Soviet nuclear power stations and Moscow's atom bomb industry after the war. The Federal Trade and Federal Environment ministries discontinued uranium mining after the unification of Germany on grounds of unprofitability. The SDAG was converted from a mining and production corporation into a reclamation firm, Wismut GmbH, and is now responsible for freeing the uranium mining area of "pollutants, soil, waterway, and air contamination, and other environmental hazards present on the operating site and in the real estate pertaining thereto." "Actually, Koenigstein is just a small part of this comprehensive eco-repair operation, albeit a particularly delicate one," says Stephanie Hurst of Saxony's Environment Ministry in Dresden. Indeed, in order to dissolve the uranium out of the rock, the SDAG, in its day, had forced hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of dilute sulfuric acid 300 meters down into the uranium-bearing seam, which is about 20 meters thick. In order to increase the working surface for the acid solution, the rock was divided and blasted into blocks measuring about 80 by 80 meters by a height of -- depending on the uranium content and the characteristics of the rock -- 5 to 20 meters prior to "leaching," as mining specialists call this method of mining. "Pillars" were inserted between the blocks to support the "pits." The liquor containing the uranium was collected by a drainage system and pumped to the surface, where the uranium was extracted. There were 750,000 cubic meters of dilute sulfuric acid circulating between the leaching zone and the processing plant. There are currently about 1 million cubic meters of leaching fluid in the pores and crevices of the whole mined area of the Koenigstein pit, where it is still producing its effect. The people in charge at Wismut intend to flood Koenigstein as well, like most closed mines. This means switching off the high-power pumps that keep the underground shafts and tunnels free of water seeping in from the neighboring rock. The mine then "drowns," as the mining specialists put it. Flooding the Koenigstein pit will entail hazards that cannot yet be assessed, as the groundwater bearing stratum that provides Dresden and Pirna with their drinking water is only just above the stratum from which the miners have extracted uranium. It is true that the water bearing stratum is separated from the mined cavities by a 20-meter thick, water-retaining, argilliferous sandstone stratum. However, the flood water from the mine, which would be contaminated with radionuclides and other pollutants, could find its way into the drinking water and contaminate it either via the mine shafts and bores or via naturally occurring crevices and faults in the rock. "An increase in the quantity of radioactive substances in the drinking and household water means a rise in the cancer and leukemia risk to the population," warns Munich radiobiologist Edmund Lengfelder, who is studying the impact of uranium mining in Saxony and Thuringia on health. This hazard would be reduced by keeping the mine "open." "But that would cost us 15 to 20 million German marks a year," explains Rudolf Daenecke, who is in charge of the reclamation work at Wismut GmbH. This is what the electricity to power the pumps and technical measures, such as ventilating the underground cavities, would cost. First of all, Wismut GmbH did something that provoked accusations of fraud: After the cessation of mining work as of 1 January 1991, it blasted a number of blocks of stone in the mine, which it intends to leach using the previous mining method to flush out the pollutants. The uranium will even be processed into yellow cake and sold through EURATOM [European Atomic Energy Community]. Wismut claims that the profit will be spent on the reclamation project.
