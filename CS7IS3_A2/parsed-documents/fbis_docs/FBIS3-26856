Five pillar industries include automobiles, bio-medicine, communication facilities, computer and power station facilities, whose annual sales are expected to surpass 100 billion yuan by the end of this century. According to local leaders, the shift is based on the harsh reality that the city faces tough competition from its neighbouring provinces which have abundant raw materials and a booming consumer market in certain fields. In 1993, sales of the five pillar industries reached 43 billion yuan, within the city's industrial total of 323.7 billion yuan. Foreign-funded enterprises play a major role in these sectors. Sales of the auto industry, the heavy-weight among the five, achieved 30 billion yuan last year and are expected to reach 50 billion yuan by 2000. Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Co. Ltd, a Sino-German joint venture, turned out 100,000 Santana sedans in 1993, bringing in 10 billion yuan, accounting for a third of the industry's total. The company plans to roll out 300,000 sedans in 1997. Foreign-invested firms are also seen as backbones in the other four fields. For example, ten out of the 18 hi-tech communication enterprises have introduced considerable sums of overseas money. It is said that the city's top officials are to focus attention on these sectors. Mayor Huang Ju will be in charge of the auto industry, and party chief Wu Bangguo, communications. They said Shanghai will bring in more funds and technology from abroad and will foster a strong research force. According to the city's ambitious plan, there will be several conglomerates emerging in these fields, each with more than one billion yuan in sales.
