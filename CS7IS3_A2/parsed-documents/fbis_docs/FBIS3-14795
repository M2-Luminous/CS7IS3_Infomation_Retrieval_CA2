That was the conclusion reached by the participants in today's session of the chamber's council. The council discussed the situation that has developed over the anmesty decision and the negative reaction to it from the president's staff. Commenting on the course of the session at the request of the ITAR-TASS correspondent, Valentin Kovalev, deputy chairman of the Duma, said: "Several of the country's political figures have spoken in the press about the amnesty and stated that the act adopted by the State Duma should be regarded more as a pardon than as an amnesty." However, "there are clear legal criteria that make it possible to distinguish between these two acts. An amnesty is a legislative instrument that is binding for all. A pardon is an act that is applied individually and must be applied strictly to a specified person. Furthermore, a pardon covers only the convicted. An amnesty also covers those under investigation, as in this case." "In my view, there are no grounds whatsoever for saying that the State Duma exceeded its rights and violated the law and the constitution; the Duma Council registered this opinion in the record, and there were no objections to this view," Valentin Kovalev noted.
