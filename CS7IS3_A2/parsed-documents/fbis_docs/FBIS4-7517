Unlike the present, that is, the two-year long situation on the ground, the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] will be deployed between the two, until now, warring sides. The signing of the cease-fire agreement was preceded by a detailed analysis of maps indicating the existing situation by all the parties to the negotiations. According to the Krajina side, the cease-fire agreement also means that Kasici and other villages in Ravni Kotari have been returned to the republic of Serbian Krajina, which the Croatian Army occupied 14 months ago, and that the population of the Obrovac region -- a region which during the same Croatian aggression found itself in those parts of the Serbian Krajina that were the least safe -- will have a more peaceful life. We learned at the news conference that the region of Velebit -- including its Obrovac part -- was the cause of the fiercest debate, or disagreement, that is, during the negotiations yesterday and overnight. The text of the cease-fire agreement is today the most sought-after written document and is being xeroxed and copied in Knin. The first date set in the document is 4 April. AT 0900 [0700 GMT] on that day, the cease-fire will enter into force on the front lines, while in the following 24 hours -- so the agreement stipulates -- all indirect weaponry will be moved away [razmjesteno]: mortars and antiaircraft guns to a distance of at least 10 km, artillery and tanks to a distance of at least 20 km from the demarcation lines. By 0900 at the latest on 8 April, all units on the demarcation lines will be disengaged in order to prevent mutual targeting with direct weapons. The cease-fire will be monitored by international observers. The agreement also confirms an agreement on the establishment of a joint commission with the aim of maintaining the cease-fire.
