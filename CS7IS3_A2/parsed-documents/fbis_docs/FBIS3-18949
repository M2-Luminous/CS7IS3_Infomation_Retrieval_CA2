In a statement to AL-HAYAH he demanded that "firm, strong, and clear measures" be taken to protect Palestinians. [passage omitted] Alain Juppe stressed the need to continue and speed up the peace process "in order to restore the credibility of the negotiations." In his view, this aim requires that "security be guaranteed in the occupied territories. It is the responsibility of the occupation authorities now. This responsibility will be assumed by the Palestinian authority after the Israeli withdrawal" in accordance with the agreement between the Israeli Government and the PLO. France is urging European Union countries to "take firm, strong, and clear measures, and -- to that end -- supports an international civilian presence in the occupied territories." According to the French foreign minister, the second condition for restoring credibility to the peace negotiations is to speed up the implementation of the international aid program in order to improve living conditions for the Palestinians, "as this aid is still in the coffers of international organizations."
