Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri yesterday denied for the second time in two days that there will be a cabinet reshuffle, noting that reports about this matter are merely newspaper speculations. Deputy Prime Minister Michel al-Murr repeated an earlier denial that there will be a reshuffle of portfolios. He explained that although there are certain reservations about the level of performance in some ministries, this does not necessitate a reshuffle. Sources close to the prime minister told the newspaper AL-NAHAR that those who spread rumors about a cabinet reshuffle are seeking to achieve two things: First, to provoke a dispute between the prime minister and the Chamber of Deputies speaker; and second, to provoke quarrels between the prime minister and the ministers and also among the ministers themselves. The sources noted that such quarrels would paralyze the government and undermine the current cooperation between the government and the Chamber of Deputies over the passing of laws beneficial to the country's peace and reconstruction process.
