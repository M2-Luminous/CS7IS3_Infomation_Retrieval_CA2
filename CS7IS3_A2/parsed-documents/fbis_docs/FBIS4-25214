He was talking to an economic mission headed by Trade Development Council (TDC) chairman Victor Fung, which yesterday met Chinese officials in Beijing to discuss strengthening economic ties. Mr Lu urged all provinces and major cities on the mainland to help protect Hong Kong's economic system and to take advantage of the territory's position for expanding international trade. Mr Lu said the TDC had done much in fostering closer economic ties with the mainland, which should be strengthened further. At a meeting with Minister of Internal Trade Zhang Haoruo, Mr Fung said Hong Kong companies wanted to expand further in China and hoped to broaden their scope of operation into China's distribution system. Mr Zhang said China would continue to do its best to conform to international practices as it developed its internal commerce. The mission also met Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Zheng Silin. They discussed issues facing China in its application to re-enter GATT and the subjects of anti-dumping legislation and protectionism in major markets. The mission was part of Hong Kong's participation in the Asia Pacific International Trade Fair in Beijing, to which the TDC has sent a delegation representing 118 Hong Kong companies.
