At the last meeting of the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Reactor Safety Committee, held on 20 October, the ministry denied media reports that dummies had been incinerated in Basel in 1986 instead of the 41 drums containing highly toxic dioxin from Italy: The documentation supplied by the Hoffmann-La Roche chemicals group stated that the incineration process had been monitored by the Swiss authorities, and this appeared plausible, said the ministry. An investigation program had nevertheless been initiated, in the course of which the area under and around the Schoenberg dump would be inspected and the dump's archives would be laid open. In the meantime, a computer model of the site was being drawn up to give an idea as to which type of waste was where, and as to the areas for which there was no information, the Federal Government stated. Representatives of the Alliance 90/Greens parliamentary party pointed out that the dump's bookkeeping had been doctored and that there was insufficient data to trace any old toxic drums. Not for nothing had the Schoenberg area enjoyed ``top secret site'' status in the days of the GDR. The group also voiced the criticism that the inspection had been set in motion only after a ``considerable delay,'' in spite of the long-standing suspicion that toxic matter from Seveso had found its way to Schoenberg. The CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] parliamentary party was of the opinion that, by GDR standards, Schoenberg was one of the safest dumps. The FDP [Free Democratic Party] parliamentary party also shared the view that ``agitation'' seemed out of place. SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] deputies called on the Federal Government not to leave the entire responsibility for such matters with the laender should evidence of deposits of dioxin from Seveso come to light. For its part, the government gave assurances that it would investigate all suspicious circumstances. In the event of the offending drums emerging, they would be returned ``promptly and without red tape'' to sender.
