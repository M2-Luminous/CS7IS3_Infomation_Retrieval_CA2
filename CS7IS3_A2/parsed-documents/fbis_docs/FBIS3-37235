The Russian bias, of which the present U.S. administration has long been accused, recently found yet another critic -- serious and unexpected -- in the shape of Nazarbayev. In contrast to the Ukrainians, for example, the Kazakhstan leader has invariably been courteous toward Moscow. That is now a thing of the past. Last week, on the eve of his second U.S. visit, Nazarbayev added his voice to the chorus of those for whom assistance for Moscow has long since ceased to be a symbol of the general rush to democracy. Two years ago Nazarbayev's position contrasted sharply with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's pronouncements. At that time the Kazakhstan leader did not follow the Ukrainian guest's example and refused to criticize Russia, which made a very favorable impression on the former administration. This time Kravchuk will be coming to Washington a few weeks after Nazarbayev. Specialists believe that on this occasion their views of Moscow, while not coinciding, will not be too different. Following the dramatic changes in Russian domestic and foreign policy, Kazakhstan has acquired special importance for the West. It is the only one of the major post-Soviet nuclear states to move toward nuclear-free status, somewhat more slowly than Washington probably would have liked, but not by fits and starts. Small and large enterprises are being privatized here consistently and more quickly than anywhere else in the former USSR. The enormous oil deposits, surpassed only by the reserves in the Persian Gulf, give hope of an influx of hard currency and financial stabilization. Of course, hard currency for Baykonur -- that is, joint missile launches, participation in international telecommunications programs, and admittance to the high technology club -- remains a dream. That was the motivation behind Nazarbayev's agreement to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation treaty. For its 104 heavy ICBM's, each with 10 nuclear warheads, Kazakhstan will get $311 million next year -- three times as much as expected. When Secretary of State Christopher visited the Kazkahstan capital last fall he insisted that Nazarbayev sign the nonproliferation treaty. Nazarbayev refused. Well aware that the possession of nuclear weapons makes his country the object of international attention, the president of Kazakhstan would only agree to a ceremony in the White House -- with President Clinton. The Clinton administration would be happy to arrange some kind of showcase cooperation, in particular in the economic sphere. But this depends only to a limited extent on the administration. More than 50 major U.S. corporations are already operating in Kazakhstan, but they are cautious and in no rush, and their participation falls far short of what the country needs.
