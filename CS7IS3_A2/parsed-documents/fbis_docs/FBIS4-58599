At 0530 [0230 GMT] today, two aircraft belonging to the secessionist gang, which is rebelling against the Constitutional legitimacy, launched air raids on the capital, Sanaa, aiming at vital targets. The antiaircraft defenses intercepted the raiding aircraft and forced them to flee. In the meantime, the gang, which is rebelling against the Constitutional legitimacy sent some aircraft to strafe the al-Hudaydah and Ta'izz airports. The ground defenses forced them to flee without hitting their targets. The forces of that rebelling gang are continuing their criminal aggression in more than one place in the homeland against the sons of our brave Armed Forces. These criminal forces will reap nothing but loss and defeat, God wiling, so that the Yemeni homeland will continue to be united and prosperous.
