Relating to the Establishment of Uniform Listing and Trading Guidelines for Stock Index and Currency Warrants December 12, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on November 30, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Phlx proposes to amend: (1) Rule 803(e) to revise the listing criteria for stock index (``stock index'' or ``index'') warrants and currency warrants (``currency warrants''); 1 (2) Rule 722 to specify the customer margin for the purchase or short sale of index and currency warrants; (3) Option Rules 1001, 1002, 1024, 1025, 1047A, 1049, and 1070 thereby extending these trade practice rules to currency and index warrants; and (4) Rule 1000 to add applicable definitions. On Dec. 2, 1994, the Phlx amended certain surveillance related matters addressed in the filing. See footnote 3, infra. 1 Currency warrants, as used in this filing, may refer to warrants on individual currencies (or cross currencies) or to warrants on a specific currency index group (``currency index warrants''). The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Phlx and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The Purpose of this rule change is to: (1) amend listing guidelines for stock index and currency warrants, (2) amend various rules thereby extending their applicability to index and currency warrants trading, and (3) establish special customer margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency warrants. The Phlx seeks to amend its listing standards for currency and index warrants. Phlx Rule 803(e) will provide that issuers must have a minimum tangible net worth in excess of $150 million. In addition, the aggregate original issue price of all of a particular issuer's stock index or currency warrant offerings (combined with offerings by its affiliates) that are listed on a national securities exchange or on NASDAQ would not be permitted to exceed 25% of the issuer's net worth. The proposed amendment will also provide for automatic exercise of warrants upon expiration and that opening prices will be used to determine the settlement value of an underlying index. Exchange Rule 722 is being amended to apply the customer margin required for broad based index and currency options to stock index and currency warrants, respectively. Thus, purchases of stock index and currency warrants will require payment in full, and short sales of stock index warrants will require an initial margin of 100 percent of the current value of the warrant plus 15 percent of the current value of the underlying index, less the amount by which the warrant is out of the money, up to a maximum of five percent of the index value. Short sales of currency warrants similarly will follow the margin requirements applicable to listed currency options. The Exchange proposes that its index and currency warrant margin requirements be permitted offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions. 2 2 The staff of the Commission has indicated to the Exchange that it must request and obtain appropriate interpretive or no-action relief from the Commission in order to permit its index and currency warrant margin requirements to allow offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions. Exchange Option Rules 1024, 1025, and 1070 concerning opening of accounts, supervision of accounts, and customer complaints will all be made applicable to index and currency warrants. Presently, Exchange Rule 1026 and 1027 respecting suitability and discretionary accounts for option transactions already are applicable to index and currency warrants. Rule 1049 respecting written customer communications about listed options will apply to index and currency warrants and require approval by a Compliance Registered Options Principal of all advertisements, sales literature and educational material issued by a member organization pertaining to stock index and currency warrants. The Rule further requires Exchange approval of all advertisements and educational materials pertaining to stock index and currency warrants. Rule 1001 is being amended to provide that index warrants on the same index with original issuer prices of ten dollars or less will be 15 million warrants covering all such warrant issues and that warrant issues with an original issue price over ten dollars will be weighted more heavily than warrants with an original issue price of ten dollars or less. Rule 1002 is being amended to provide that the exercise limits for index warrants will be analogous to those found in stock index options and that such limits are separate and distinct from any exercise limits imposed by the issuer of such warrants. Rule 1047A regarding trading halts in index options is being amended to indicate that it also will apply to the trading of index and currency warrants. Rule 1000 will be amended to include applicable definitions of ``stock index group,'' ``stock index warrant,'' ``currency warrant,'' ``currency index group'' and ``currency index warrant.''
