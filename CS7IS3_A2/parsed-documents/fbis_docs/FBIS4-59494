FBIS4-59494 "drnes094dd_94021" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 16 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Official on Cairo `Farce,' Military Action Hamas Official on Cairo `Farce,' Military Action JN1605104294 Amman AL-MAJD in Arabic 16 May 94 pp 1, 11 JN1605104294 Amman AL-MAJD Arabic BFN [Text] Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, the chief of Hamas' Political Bureau, has reaffirmed that resisting the occupation is a strategic option for Hamas until the occupation is defeated and all Palestinian lands are liberated, primarily Jerusalem, the capital of Palestine and the land of the prophet's ascension to heavens and of all holy sites. In an exclusive statement to AL-MAJD in Beirut, Abu-Marzuq said military action is a primary means of resistance against the Israeli occupation. It has been proven that the Israeli occupation knows no language other than that of force. Take, for example, the outcome of the negotiations, which began with the illusion of the "state" and ended up in the farce of "Gaza-Jericho". On the Cairo agreement signed recently between 'Arafat and Rabin, Abu-Marzuq said: It is a farce. This agreement, as its clauses show, is worse than the Camp David Accords. The points of this agreement explain the vague Oslo accord in favor of the Zionist enemy and at the expense of Palestinian, Arab, and Islamic interests. Asked by AL-MAJD about the movement's official position on the agreement and the possibility of dealing with it as a fait accompli, Abu-Marzuq wondered sarcastically: Can any sane person accept this agreement or deal with it? Especially since many of those who support a settlement are now weaseling out of the agreement and refusing to deal with it. Abu-Marzuq then said in a very serious tone: This "farcical" agreement does not commit Hamas and its heroes to anything at all. We are going ahead with our jihad scheme without paying heed to what 'Arafat and his tools conclude with the Zionists. Answering a question about the relationship between Hamas and the alliance of the 10 factions, Abu-Marzuq said: We have a good relationship despite recent reports casting doubt on this relationship, which will remain pivotal for us. Abu-Marzuq further stressed that Hamas seeks to develop this relationship so the alliance can undertake its important jihad role to defeat the Oslo and Cairo accords, as an indispensable step before resuming the plan of liberation. Abu-Marzuq, who had just heard about the unjust Zionist bombing of the [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine] General Command positions in al-Na'imah, expressed his sympathy and solidarity with the heroes of the General Command, saying: We complement each other in the same trench and course. On Jordan-Hamas ties after the recent problems resulting from Israeli threats, Abu-Marzuq said: Our brothers in Jordan know well that the threats of Rabin and Peres came to distract attention from Rabin's internal crisis first and from what was being cooked up between 'Arafat and Peres without the knowledge of Jordan, Syria, and the Arabs. Abu-Marzuq asserted that Hamas is keen to preserve Jordan's security and stability. Jordan is the land of mobilization and steadfastness and the first line of confrontation against the enemy occupying the land of Palestine. Abu-Marzuq said he looks forward to good brotherly and lasting relations with Jordan. On the fate of the 10 factions that oppose the settlement if a Syrian-Israeli agreement is reached, Abu-Marzuq said he rules out the possibility of such agreement in the short run, considering the solid Syrian position. He stressed, however, that the major organizational body of Hamas is inside the occupied territories. Therefore, it remains free from influence by any Palestinian or Arab agreements. Commenting on the entry of the Palestinian police force into Gaza and Jericho, Abu-Marzuq said: These forces are from the sons of the Palestinian people and some of them fought heroic battles for liberation. Therefore, we will welcome their presence among the people there as long as they are protecting the people's security. This position will change if these forces change their attitude and turn into political forces to suppress strugglers and opponents from various national and Islamic political currents and persuasions.
