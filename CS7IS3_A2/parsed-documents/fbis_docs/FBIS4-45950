FBIS4-45950 "jptnd012___94042" JPRS-TND-94-012 JPRS PROLIFERATION ISSUES 28 April 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA INDIA Concern Expressed Over Intent of London Talks Concern Expressed Over Intent of London Talks Sense of Disquiet 94W0091B Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA in English 28 Apr 94 p 13 94W0091B Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA English CSO [Article by Manoj Joshi: "A Growing Sense of Disquiet"] [Text] New Delhi, April 27--During the Talbott visit to the subcontinent earlier this month, U.S. officials candidly accepted that the "Pakistan track" of their programme to eliminate nuclear and missile capability in South Asia was the "F-16s for capping" arrangement. But they claimed that they had not quite formulated what they had in mind for India. It would appear now, looking at the composition of the Indian delegation, that the London "secret" talks are being used to discuss the "India Track" of the U.S. plan. Also not merely some "principles" or modalities for a multilateral conference to eliminate strategic weapons capabilities in South Asia. The presence of Ms Meera Shankar, commercial attache in Washington and Mr K. Santhanam, Chief Adviser Technology in the DRDO [Defense Research Development Organization] dealing with Indo-U.S. technology transfer issues suggests that the talks will also take up India's taking "interim" steps to halt the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons, maintaining its cap on its Agni development, as well as desisting from deploying the Prithvi missile system in exchange for some commercial and technology transfer incentives. The government's decision to use a retired diplomat, Mr N. Krishnan to hold the fourth round of the Indo-U.S. dialogue on capping India's self-defence capability in "secret," and that too in a third country--UK--appears to defy commonsense and logic. Depending on the point of view, it appears either redundant or ominous. Not surprisingly, it has raised a storm of protest in Parliament. The composition of the delegation appears to be an effort by the senior-most bureaucrat in the Prime Minister's office (PMO) to bypass the established official channel through the Ministry of External Affairs. But even the choice of the leader of the delegation appears questionable. Mr Krishnan is a distinguished diplomat who has served the country in a number of important and challenging assignments. But he also has, according to many of his former colleagues, strong and not-so-secret views in favour of India signing the Non-Proliferation Treaty, something which the government is even now saying it is opposed to. Ever since the Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao's meeting with President Bush in New York in early 1992, India has been committed to a dialogue with the United States on the nuclear weapons issue. The United States has made it clear that it would like to see the elimination of strategic weapons capability in South Asia, i.e., ending India's unexercised option to make nuclear weapons and its research and development programme for missiles. India has, however, till now insisted that this policy is unrealistic since it did not take into account India's wider security concerns, viz. China. Since March 1992, three rounds of dialogue have been held till now with teams led by senior foreign ministry officials. So why the change for the fourth round? No clear explanation is available. The public relations mills at the PMO claim that the MEA [expansion not given] was not executing the Prime Minister's policy efficiently. Some suspicions that there may be more than just alleged MEA incompetence emerged from the dismantling of the team set up by the former foreign secretary, Mr J.N. Dixit, in his ministry to focus on the dialogue. Some clues are now available from the composition of the delegation to London. The presence of Mr Satish Chandra, India's permanent representative at Geneva is a fig leaf that cannot hide the lack of a substantive MEA representation in the talks considering that the first three rounds have been coordinated by them. Mr Rakesh Sood, Director disarmament had to be included in the team since he is, at present, the only official familiar with various Indian negotiation stances at various bilateral and multilateral fora on disarmament issues. The presence of two other persons as well as the leader has, as has been noted, provided an ample inkling to the nature of the dialogue. But whether this is good for India or not, that it can do anything is another aspect. India has no institutional arrangements such as a national security council to decide on the issues. So policy has been made whimsically. As it is there is now a growing sense of disquiet among senior civil servants as well as armed forces officers at the recent directions in India's security policies and the "extra-constitutional" role being played by some elements in the PMO in formulating them. Not unlike Europe, the nuclear and missile capabilities in South Asia have stabilised the regional situation notwithstanding the Kashmir rebellion. Ironically, the "secret" talks are likely to increase Islamabad's sense of unease rather than the other way around since there is a belief there, conditioned by its perceptions of New Delhi, that the improved tenor [as printed] of Indo-U.S. relations is directed against Pakistan. There is some question as to whether the United States knows what it is doing and, perhaps more germane, whether India does.
