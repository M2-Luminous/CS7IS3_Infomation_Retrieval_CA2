Treaties between the postcommunist countries should be adjusted in the same way," said Henning Christophersen, vice president of the European Union, at a meeting of the European Banking Forum in Prague yesterday. Should the contrary be the case, Europe may find after yet another integration that it has to face several hundreds of incompatible bilateral treaties. The European Union decided last summer that it would support the multilateral aspect of treaties, and the EU foreign ministers established that they would invite their Eastern colleagues for cooperation. The EU finance ministers also arrived at an identical conclusion on Monday evening [21 March], Christophersen stressed. Euro treaties are expected to greatly liberalize mutual relations, and the establishment of a free trade zone should become the main objective before full membership is assumed, the vice president added. Despite the needed rapprochement of economic policies, the East European countries should not make the same mistake as the European Union--that is, introduce a vast system of state supports and subsidies. We can see that the European Union is hesitating about its expansion, Christophersen said. Questions are being raised regarding the pressure exerted by the competitors, the decisionmaking process in such a large group, agricultural policy, and structural funds [strukturalni fondy]. According to him, the countries of Central and East Europe are also hesitating to a certain extent. They have to sort out problems with meeting EU social and ecological standards, carrying out economic conversion, the functioning of democracy, respecting minority rights, and introducing the EU legal system. Both sides should stop hesitating and avoiding problems, Christophersen stressed. According to him, the European Union was not established in the 1950's because the member countries loved each other but because it was necessary, in view of the failure of diplomatic structures.
