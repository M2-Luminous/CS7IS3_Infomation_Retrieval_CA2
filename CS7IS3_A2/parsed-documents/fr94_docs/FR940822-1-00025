FR940822-1-00025 FR940822-1-00006 4. Statement of Radiological Criteria In developing the staff's draft rule, attention was focused on four approaches: (1) establish an annual risk or dose limit for an individual, (2) establish an annual risk or dose goal, (3) require use of best available technology, and (4) require return of the site to background radioactivity. Comment. Most commenters from State governments, the nuclear utilities, the fuel cycle industry, the medical community and non-fuel cycle industry, cleanup contractors, and professional society/standard setting organizations favored a risk-based or dose-based standard over a standard based on best available technology or return to background. Most commenters from citizen/environmental organizations and some from other organizations favored a return-to-background standard. Many commenters objected to a best effort/best available technology standard for various reasons including the belief that it would be extremely subjective. Response. The proposed rule would establish a dose limit for release of the site of 15 millirem per year (mrem/y) TEDE for residual radioactivity distinguishable from background and require that the licensee reduce this residual radioactivity to ALARA. Sites meeting this criterion would be considered acceptable for release for unrestricted use and termination of the license. Fifteen mrem/y TEDE is consistent in terms of risk with the NRC release limits for low-level waste facilities (10 CFR 61.41), is consistent with the individual dose protection limit in the EPA Environmental Radiation Protection Standards for the Management and Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel, High-level and Transuranic Wastes, 40 CFR Part 191 (December 20, 1993; 58 FR 66398), and provides a substantial safety margin below the NRC's 100 mrem/y dose limit for individual members of the public. Use of a dose limit is consistent with long standing NRC (and AEC) regulatory practices for protecting radiation workers and the public. The use of a limit also provides a clear measure for determining the acceptability of a site and a clear basis for determinations of compliance with the regulations. The NRC staff agrees that the objective of decommissioning should be to reduce residual radioactivity at a site to levels that are indistinguishable from background. Therefore, the draft rule proposed to establish the following goal for decommissioning within the structure of reducing exposure below the limit to as low as reasonably achievable: (1) Reduce the concentration of individual radionuclides which could contribute to residual radioactivity at the site to a level which is indistinguishable from background; (2) Release the site for unrestricted use; and (3) Terminate the license. For purposes of determining when further ALARA efforts need not be further analyzed and documented, the Commission would consider that the ALARA requirement has been met if the TEDE to the average member of the critical group from all radionuclides that could contribute to residual radioactivity and are distinguishable from background does not exceed 3 mrem (0.03 mSv) per year. Three millirem per year is a small fraction of the NRC's 100 mrem/y dose limit for individual members of the public, typically is not distinguishable from variations in local and national radiation background levels, and is consistent with the 10 ^4 level of lifetime risk used by EPA for Superfund. Dose based criteria were selected over risk based criteria for ease of implementation. Based upon comments received on the NRC staff draft, the Commission has decided to remove the numerical values of 3 millirem per year from the proposed rule. However, the Commission remains committed to the objective of decommissioning to levels that are indistinguishable from background. 5. Consistency and Compatibility Comment. Many commenters urged that all regulatory agencies (EPA, NRC, State and local governments, etc.) use the same radiological criteria for decommissioning and that the agencies be consistent in how they apply the criteria. Some commenters said that the NRC's adoption of a risk/dose limit of 100 millirem per year, with a proper application of ALARA, would result in a 10 ^6 annual risk and a 10 ^4 lifetime risk, which would be consistent with the EPA's Superfund remediation goals. Other commenters recommended that State and local governments be at liberty to adopt more stringent requirements. Response. The NRC is hopeful that the proposed criteria developed through the enhanced participatory rulemaking process will be acceptable to all regulatory agencies and will be consistent and compatible with the requirements of other regulatory agencies. The EPA and NRC have overlapping authority in the area of developing radiological criteria for decommissioning for nuclear sites. In addition, decommissioned sites, if not remediated properly, could later be subject to remedial action under EPA Superfund requirements. This is an outcome which is viewed as undesirable by both the EPA and NRC and is considered unlikely because the proposed NRC criteria are designed to be consistent with the risk range incorporated in EPA's Superfund requirements. NRC and EPA are developing decommissioning criteria in parallel rulemaking efforts. The NRC and EPA are coordinating their efforts in this area to ensure that effective and consistent site decommissioning standards are established while minimizing duplication of effort. Accordingly, the EPA was an important participant in the NRC rulemaking workshops and is a cooperating agency in the preparation of the GEIS for the rulemaking. The NRC has also consulted extensively with EPA throughout the rulemaking process. The objective is that EPA will be able to make a finding that NRC decommissioning criteria provide adequate protection for the public and the environment and will exclude NRC licensees from the EPA cleanup standards. In addition, State and local governments will have opportunities to participate in certain individual decommissioning actions carried out under the proposed regulation. Further discussion on participation may be found in item 7, below. Agreement State compatibility is discussed briefly in a separate section near the end of this supplementary information. 6. Finality Comment. Several commenters stated that the NRC's decommissioning standard should be long-lasting and provide a final solution for decommissioning sites that are contaminated with radioactive material. The NRC's standard should be consistent with EPA rules to assure that a site remediated under NRC's rules will not require further remediation under EPA rules. Some commenters questioned whether it is possible to have finality in decommissioning standards because of likely new information and improved technology in the future. They stated that sites should continue to be remediated as necessary to meet new standards. Those opposed stated that rules should be changed only if a substantial increase in public safety can be demonstrated. Response. The NRC staff believes that actions taken under the criteria in this rule need not be revisited unless, based on new information, there is reason to believe that residual radioactivity remaining at the site could result in significant public risk. Therefore, once a site has been decommissioned and the license terminated in accordance with the criteria in the rule, the Commission would require additional cleanup only if, based on new information, it determines the level of residual radioactivity at the site substantially violates these criteria. Based on the NRC's experience in the SDMP and other decommissioning programs, it is important to provide a high level of assurance that decommissioning actions conducted under the current criteria will not need to be revisited in the future under potentially more restrictive criteria. Licensees have indicated a genuine reluctance to commit the large financial and corporate resources necessary for complex decommissioning projects without these assurances. Uncertainty with future criteria and the potential need for additional remediation introduces havoc in the planning and conduct of effective decommissioning. Without some degree of finality in the criteria, licensees may be motivated to forestall decommissioning actions pending development of more favorable criteria or less expensive decommissioning technologies and waste disposal options. This approach manifests itself in extended administrative appeals and litigation, which often redirects licensee resources away from efforts to reduce levels of contamination. At the same time, the NRC recognizes that there may be legitimate needs for additional remedial actions in the future if significant additional contamination is discovered at a site or if the technical basis on which the criteria are founded changes significantly, indicating that potential future residents of the sites may be at significantly greater risk than previously anticipated. Therefore, the proposed criteria allow for additional remediation, if necessary, if additional significant contamination is identified or if changes in the risk or health basis for the criteria indicate the remediation is necessary to protect the public against significant radiological risks.
