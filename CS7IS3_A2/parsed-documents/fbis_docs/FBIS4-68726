On 13 April the state Duma was disturbed by the news of the NATO bombing of Serbian positions in Bosnia. They decided to consider the situation, as speaker Ivan Rybkin put it, "concretely and specifically." And immediately the deputies turned their attention to the fact that Andrey Kozyrev was not among them at this difficult time. The renowned minister and unknown deputy Kozyrev had failed to grace the Duma with his visits previously as well. But here a case like this! Some of the Duma members lost their patience. Vladimir Semago angrily demanded that "the deputy from the Murmanskiy electoral district working also as minister of foreign affairs, Kozyrev, be in attendance in our ranks, that he be here if only for two or three sessions." Kozyrev did not show up that day and his deputy, Sergey Lavrov, answered for him to the people's elect. And yet--and here is the supernatural part!--the elusive deputy minister, it turns out, was at the session of the state Duma on the morning of 13 April. He was--if you are to believe the information from the electronic registration. It was not so easy for the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer to get his hands on this information. Although it is not secret, according to a just adopted regulation of the state Duma, permission for access to the information from the electronic system shall be granted "to individuals other than deputies" by the chairman of the committee for organizing the work of the lower chamber. They were warned in the committee that granting permission depends on the newspaper's position toward the state Duma. Ultimately it turned out that OBSHCHAYA GAZETA was "not the worst newspaper" and the permission was given. Taking up 27 sheets, the registration table contains a good deal of interesting information. Above all--about the diligence of the people's elect. It is understandable that the electronic system does not know the reasons for the absence of a deputy--they can be quite respectable, nonetheless.... First place in terms of the number of sessions missed is held by a group of deputies who simultaneously hold eminent posts in the structures of executive power. And the undoubted record holder among them is A. Kh. Zaveryukha: If one is to believe the electronic registration, he did not manage to attend a single session. Slightly behind him are two other deputy prime ministers-A.B. Chubays (attended four sessions out of 50) and A.N. Shokhin (six sessions). Minister of Culture Ye.Yu. Sidorov as a deputy attended seven sessions, Minister of Justice Yu.Kh. Kalmykov--nine, and Minister of Labor G.G. Melikyan--10. Added to this group of deputies are A.L. Adamishin, first deputy minister of foreign affairs (he was at six sessions out of 50) and V.P. Kvasov, leader of the government apparatus (he was at eight sessions). Two other "risk groups" consisting of deputies who also seem to be engaged on the outside (entrepreneurs and eminent scholars) are more disciplined. Most frequently absent is academician-economist N.Ya. Petrakov (he attended only 12 sessions). In this position the journalist has a right to ask a number of rhetorical questions. Why, for example, do the voters need deputies who do not attend sessions? Does their behavior not contradict the spirit and letter of the Constitution, which says that "deputies of the state Duma work on a permanent professional basis"? Finally, for what services do the absentee deputies enjoy the rights, privileges, and benefits granted to members of parliament? It is not mandatory to answer these questions. Even before the elections it was clear that the deputy prime ministers and ministers would not be going to the sessions in the Duma. And why they were elected is a question not for them but for the voters. But God be with them, the ministers--at least they have other duties that also are for the state. Moreover, they do not receive deputy wages. It is more difficult to understand the "free politicians," especially the leaders of factions and parties, who do not grace the Duma with their attention either. About half of the plenary sessions were missed by Ye.T. Gaydar, G.A. Yavlinskiy, and V.P. Lukin, and more than half--by B.G. Fedorov. Understandably, leaders of parties, factions, and deputy groups have other business than sitting in parliament, but none of them was forced to do this, and even today it is not too late to refuse the mandate. The "continuous absence" of a number of deputies at plenary sessions is, incidentally, only the surface. As it turned out in the case with Andrey Kozyrev, attendance registered by the electronic system is sometimes worse than out-and-out failure to show up. According to the figures from the registration the deputy minister was at that morning meeting on 13 April, although no one within the walls of the Duma saw him or could have seen him. It turns out that this is a fairly simple natural miracle: A.V. Kozyrev turned his deputy card over to his colleague in the faction, who not only marks the minister as present but also, possibly, votes for him. (The OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer could give the name of the deputy who has Kozyrev's card in his pocket, but is refraining from this because of ethical reasons.) This is an undoubted violation of the regulations of the state Duma, not to mention propriety. Unfortunately, turning their cards over to someone else has become a bad habit. The pathetic explanation: "Where is the Duma subcommittee on ethics looking!"--would sound like a weak report on inoffensive pranks. For the essence of the matter is that the fictional, "electronic" presence of the deputies raises doubts about the results of the voting. More than once already the chairman has garnered the votes he lacks literally one by one. In such cases one or two fictional votes could bring about the most "fatal" decisions.
