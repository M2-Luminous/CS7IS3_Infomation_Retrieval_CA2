Are you the head of a toothless tiger? [Klepsch] I think that this is an old prejudice that is about 10 or 12 years old. The people in question have not realized what has meanwhile changed in the European Union. They have not taken note of the Maastricht Treaty and its implementation. The European Parliament has received essential concessions to its political power. In the future, the EU Commission will be dependent on it. The European Parliament must appoint the Commission and it may dissolve it. It may check on it, and it will do so. The European Parliament is involved in legislation, and all treaties with third parties that have political, economic, and financial importance must be ratified by the European Parliament. [Oberhauser] Nevertheless, I would like to stick to my previous question. Of course, you must defend the Parliament, but is it not true that, in reality, decisions are made in the Commission and in the Council -- that is, far away from Parliament? [Klepsch] No, this is really not the case. Ever since I have held this office, we have had the so-called prelogue, this is, the Council president, the Commission president, and I myself meet at least once a month to discuss the pending decisions, and the Parliament is quite involved within the framework of the treaty. This is also assured by the Court of Justice, which we can turn to if the treaty is not observed. [Oberhauser] In the period coming up to the referendum on 12 June, Austrian television is airing the so-called Europa-Forum. Yesterday's Europa-Forum was watched by almost 2 million people in Austria. This broadcast gave rise to 370 telephone calls -- people, callers, who wanted to know details. Here one of the major issues was the question of participating in decisionmaking, that is, the great uncertainty whether a small country like Austria actually has any way to have its say in this Parliament and in the European Union. [Klepsch] The EU member states all have the same rights, and the same goes for the deputies. Of course, in the Parliament it will be of decisive importance which groups the Austrian deputies join and how these groups exert their influence. I can only tell you that the two large groups, the socialist group and the group of the European People's Party, which have had contact with observers from Austria for quite some time, are very interested in seeing a contribution by the Austrian deputies, because the tradition of Austria's democratic structures is an advantage for us. [Oberhauser] Let us assume that this referendum will have a positive result and Austria will join the European Union. Then Austria will have about 20 or 25 deputies in this 600-person Parliament. [Klepsch] Correct. [Oberhauser] How are they supposed to participate in decisionmaking? Are you not throwing a bit of sand into the Austrians' eyes? [Klepsch] In this Parliament, decisions are made with the absolute majority of the legal number of members. No country has a majority there. All of them are far from a majority. [Oberhauser] But there are big and small countries, are there not? [Klepsch] There are big and small countries, but there are also big and small groups, and it depends on the material contributions of the individual deputies, because in the European Parliament the most important persons are the rapporteurs, who know specific issues very well and whom their groups follow. It is a question of the reputation that these people enjoy, and I am firmly convinced that Austria will send qualified deputies, who will have an important say in their respective groups. [Oberhauser] This is the catch-word, and I do not want to link my next question with any specific names or persons and certainly not with any specific Austrians. On 12 June, new elections for the European Parliament will also be held. As president of this Parliament, do you not have -- at least to a certain extent -- the problem that the European Parliament is increasingly becoming the side-track for parliamentarians who are not successful in their homelands anymore? [Klepsch] Precisely the opposite is true. It may have been true at the beginning, when the deputies were sent to the European Parliament by the national parliaments, depending on their services and their reputation. Nowadays, however, the deputies are elected directly, and they must face an election and, above all, they must campaign for votes. This is possible only if they make it clear that they have the competence to fulfill their tasks. I am not worried at all. We will have a great renewal of the Parliament. More than 50 percent of the deputies will be new in Parliament. This is a great restructuring, but I think it is necessary, because the change in generations that is taking place in the member countries everywhere will also gain shape here. [Oberhauser] As I said before, the referendum in Austria will be held in less than 14 days. The result will be narrow, as many people have been assuming over the past few days. What would happen, President Klepsch, if the referendum in Austria resulted in a no? Would this lead to a reaction by the European Union along the line of: Well, then let them stay where they are, or would this have other consequences? [Klepsch] I think the former will be the consequence, because it is clear that the question about a long period of negotiations, during which 12 countries were persuaded to agree to the conditions that the Austrians posed -- and the negotiations were very tough.... [sentence incomplete as heard] If one now rejects these -- well, there are enough other would-be members. I think that, at the moment, we have another six applications for membership on our table, who would get priority if the Austrians say no. However, I do not believe that this will happen. I trust the Austrians. [Oberhauser] Are you an opinion researcher? [Klepsch] No, I am not an opinion researcher, but I have a number of friends and acquaintances here in Austria, and I get the impression that they are clear-headed enough to think of our future, of our common future, which we can only cope with together. [Oberhauser] Mr. President, is this attitude of: Well, then let them stay where they are, not an enormously arrogant position? Since you spoke of democracy and responsibility before, should it not also be in the interest of the European Union to create a really united Europe -- and this would include all, the Austrians, the Swiss, and, at some time in the future, also the former Eastern Bloc? [Klepsch] Of course, the Swiss have already applied for membership. They just do not want to negotiate about it at the moment, because the Swiss Government, the Swiss parties, do not know how to push through the results of the negotiations because of the Swiss Constitution. However, they have not withdrawn their application. They know that they have to work together with us. They are all welcome, but the precondition for them all is that they are a liberal rule-of-law state, that they have a pluralist democratic system, a market economy system with a social basis, and that they are willing to share equal rights and duties with the others. These are the preconditions for entering the European Union, and Austria is a country that would be welcome. [Oberhauser] You elegantly evaded my question just now. Even if the referendum were to end negatively, should it not also be in the interest of the European Union to have -- let us stay with Austria -- Austria in it, even if, at the moment, the people are of a different view? [Klepsch] Well, fine, but one has to see that there is a certain sequence to the events. We have to take another step in the European Union. In 1996 we will discuss the further progress of the European Union, and there is the question of whether Austria will be with us and discuss the matters together with us, or whether it wants to negotiate membership afterwards, under the new conditions. The second thing that one has to see is that there are many other countries that want to join and that will discuss their application for membership before Austria. [Oberhauser] One question in conclusion: If the referendum results in a yes on 12 June, as you expect, will you then be able to stick to the schedule of joining the European Union on 1 January 1995? I am thinking of the ratification in the 12 member countries, which is necessary. [Klepsch] Well, as regards Austria, I think that this is very likely and possible. I have inquired about the preparations in Germany, for instance. They have a complicated Constitution, as some other member states, but the schedule of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat is sufficient to achieve the goal in December. [Oberhauser] Thank you very much for visiting us.
