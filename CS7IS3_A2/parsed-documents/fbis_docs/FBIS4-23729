This was revealed by CNE chairman Dr. Brazao Mazula. He said the CNE's decision is irreversible and does not depend on the political parties' approval. Many opposition parties publicly opposed the use of computers in obtaining election results, alleging that they could be manipulated and that Mozambicans did not have enough experience in their use.
