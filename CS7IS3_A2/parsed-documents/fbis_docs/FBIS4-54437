Kovac `Increasing' AU2804123594 Prague CTK in English 1055 GMT 28 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2804123594 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava April 28 (CTK) -- The pressure exerted by the opposition on parliament to dismiss Deputy Premier Roman Kovac is increasing. The dismissal was proposed on Wednesday [27 April] by Dusan Masiar, a deputy for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), who is supported by 35 deputies. The opposition accuses Kovac of being incompetent both as deputy premier and from the moral point of view, and of corruption attempts. Peter Sokol, adviser to the opposition Slovak National Party (SNS) said at a SNS press conference today that Kovac was morally incompetent mainly due to his previous "commitment". As deputy premier in the previous government of ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar, Roman Kovac was one of the protagonists of the then coalition agreement between the HZDS and the SNS, Sokol said. According to Sokol, Kovac pushed for the joint of his post of vice-premier with the seat of health minister, and promoted himself to this post. Parliamentary deputies refused to include the proposal to dismiss Roman Kovac into the agenda of the parliamentary session. However, Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic (HZDS) announced he would convoke an extraordinary session to discuss this point immediately after the end of the current regular session. SNS leaders also criticised former SNS leader and present chairman of the National Democratic Party-New Alternative Ludovit Cernak.
