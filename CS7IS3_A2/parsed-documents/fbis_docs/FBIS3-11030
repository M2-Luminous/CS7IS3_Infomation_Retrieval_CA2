Carlos Larreategui, minister secretary general of public administration, made this announcement and pointed out that the TSE's decision is "an attack on democracy" stemming from a "conspiracy" of the electoral interests of two opposition parties, namely the Social Christian Party (PSC) and the Democratic Left (ID). In the first public reaction by a government official after the TSE decision was revealed, Larreategui said that President Duran-Ballen, who is touring Japan and China, will address his compatriots on 16 March from Tokyo on the decision made by the top electoral tribunal. Vice President Alberto Dahik, the acting chief of state, is meeting with several ministers and other officials to discuss the situation. The plebiscite requested by Duran-Ballen sought to consult Ecuadorans on the reelection of the president and other public officials, which is currently banned by the Constitution, and also on the term of the mandate and the powers that parliament members should have, among other issues.
