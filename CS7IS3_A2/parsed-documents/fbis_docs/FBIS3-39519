FBIS3-39519 "drweu033_k_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-033 Document Type:Daily Report 17 Feb 1994 PORTUGAL * Negotiations Seen Only Solution in Angola 94P20378B 94P20378B Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] Writing in the 29 January Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO, Jaime Nogueira Pinto accuses unidentified Portuguese government officials of ignoring the fact that Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) can resist "indefinitely" the Angolan Government's attacks, and also of believing that the South African elections can significantly modify the situation in Angola. Such an attitude, Nogueira Pinto contends, "cannot stand up to serious and objective analysis." In fact, the responsibility for continued warfare must be attributed to the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the so-called military bourgeoisie, the hardline nucleus of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA), which is earning huge commissions on military purchases, Nogueira Pinto maintains. In fact, this is the faction that rejects a negotiated peace with UNITA--since it would mean a loss of power--even as it is loath to lose the "respectability" laboriously won in the Washington talks. Hence, the continous "provocations" against Savimbi in spite of U.S. warnings to Luanda about renewed military escalation. Lisbon's interests in Angola will obviously be served by the reestablishment of a just and fair peace, to be achieved only through compromise and power sharing, Nogueira Pinto concludes.
