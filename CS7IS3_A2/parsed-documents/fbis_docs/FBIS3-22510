But there are very few hospitals, either public or private, that are prepared to treat eye disorders. Moreover, there is a shortage of equipment used in conducting eye examinations, treating eye diseases, and performing eye operations. There is also a lack of technical equipment used in analyzing things to find the causes of the eye disorders. Because of this, those who need immediate medical attention for an eye disorder risk damaging their eyes because they can't obtain emergency treatment. They might even go blind. Besides this, another very serious problem concerning this is that there is a shortage of eye specialists or ophthalmologists. In Chiang Mai, there are only ten ophthalmologists and 12 others who are interns or who are studying to be ophthalmologists. Looking at the number of hospitals that have the capabilities to treat eye disorders, it can be seen that there are only two such hospitals in the north. One is the Maharat Hospital in Chiang Mai City, a public hospital that the people refer to as the "Flower Garden Hospital." The other is the Chiang Mai Saint Peter's Hospital, which is the first private optometrical hospital. This is now the most modern facility in the north. [passage omitted] Dr. Phithak Kitcharoen, the director of Saint Peter's Hospital, is serving society in cooperation with the Lomoson Foundation and various other organizations in the form of funds to aid people with eye disorders. [passage omitted] Saint Peter's Hospital has mobilized a number of elderly ophthalmologists and some modern equipment and provides service like a hotel. From a business standpoint, it will be a long time before the hospital breaks even. This hospital has 23 rooms and 30 beds, including deluxe, special, and ordinary rooms. Within several months of opening, it was crowded with patients even though it provided services 24 hours a day. Thus, administrators had to mobilize another 15 million baht in order to install additional modern equipment. Based on hospital reports, this hospital has treated patients from throughout the country, not just the 17 northern provinces. All of those who have come here for treatment have serious disorders. This is a sign that government units must quickly take steps to deal with this situation before it is too late. [passage omitted] Dr. Phithak said that eye disorders are very worrisome today. This includes cataracts and glaucoma. In particular, the eyes of a large number of farmers have been damaged by paddy ears or leaves of certain plants without these people being aware of the danger. When their eyes become irritated, they rub them or wash them with water. When their eyes start to hurt a lot, they go to a local hospital for treatment. [passage omitted]
