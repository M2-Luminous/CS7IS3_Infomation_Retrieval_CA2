However, now let's see how Berlusconi's political day went. Mario De Scalzi reports: [De Scalzi] Berlusconi is a little closer to reaching his goal, and perhaps the decisions concerning the appointments in the new government could be only a few hours away. However, as far as the most delicate question -- who will be in charge at the Interior Ministry -- is concerned, the prime minister-designate must place his trust in the mediation of President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. This was the explicit request made by Umberto Bossi, who tomorrow may go and meet the president. Today it was Berlusconi's turn to meet the president. Officially the visit was made in order to update Scalfaro on the progress of his negotiations to form a government. The meeting lasted over two hours, so it is difficult to believe that the subject of the Interior Ministry was not touched upon. A number of rumors are circulating in the press; one maintains that the Interior Ministry will be given to Berlusconi on an interim basis, and another says that this most delicate post in the government will be assigned to a technocrat. The name of the head of the police, Vincenzo Parisi, has been mentioned. Late this evening Berlusconi denied that he had ever bartered with the Northern League on the question of the ministries. He also assured Bossi, who fears that any government would be chosen solely by the prime minister. [Begin Berlusconi recording] As far as I am concerned, I will do all I can to make sure that we have the best government possible in this situation. Naturally, we must be realistic and take into account the fact that the chosen government will have to obtain the approval of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. In other words it will not be a government made up of the prime minister's men, as some have suggested. We must form a government which obtains a consensus, and which is able to convince the allies of the Freedom Alliance of its capabilities.
