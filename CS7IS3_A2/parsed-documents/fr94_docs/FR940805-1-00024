FR940805-1-00024 FR940805-1-00004 I. Introduction On October 22, 1993, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) issued Order No. 561 1 in which the Commission promulgated regulations pertaining to its jurisdiction over oil pipelines under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) 2 to fulfill the requirements of Title XVIII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Act of 1992). 3 1 Revisions to Oil Pipeline Regulations pursuant to Energy Policy Act, Order No. 561, 58 FR 58,753 (November 4, 1993), III FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶30,985 (1993), order on reh'g and clarification, Order No. 561&hyph;A, issued contemporaneously with this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. 2 49 U.S.C. app. 1 (1988). 3 42 U.S.C.A. 7172 note (West Supp. 1993). In Order No. 561, the Commission adopted a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for oil pipelines. This methodology is an indexing system to establish ceilings on oil pipeline rates. The Commission, however, will also permit, under defined circumstances, the use of two alternative methodologies. Those are the use of a cost-of-service methodology and the use of settlement rates. In addition, in Order No. 561, the Commission continued its policy of allowing an oil pipeline ``to attempt to show that it lacks significant market power in the market in which it proposes to charge market-based rates.'' 4 4 18 CFR 342.4(b), to be effective January 1, 1995. Also, on October 22, 1993, the Commission issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) about market-based rates for oil pipelines. 5 In the NOI, the Commission first inquired whether it should continue to permit oil pipelines to seek market-based rates on a showing that they do not have significant market power in the relevant markets. The Commission also inquired about how it should make a market power determination and, in that connection, raised a number of substantive and procedural issues. The Commission's intent was to adopt standards to be used in determining whether an oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets, if consensus existed as to the standards. The Commission received comments from fifteen commenters listed in the Appendix. 6 The present Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) as set forth and discussed below is the Commission's response to the NOI. In brief, the Commission is proposing to adopt procedural rules governing an oil pipeline's application for a Commission finding that the oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets. The Commission is not proposing to adopt any substantive rules governing the making of that finding. 5 Market-Based Ratemaking for Oil Pipelines, Notice of Inquiry, 58 FR 58,814 (November 4, 1993), IV FERC Stats. & Regs. Notices ¶35,527 (October 22, 1993). 6 The motions to file comments and reply comments in the NOI out-of-time are granted. II. Public Reporting Requirement The Commission estimates the public reporting burden for this collection of information under the proposed rule will increase the existing reporting burden associated with FERC&hyph;550 by an estimated 500 hours annually,_an average of 250 hours per response based on an estimated 2 responses. The information filed by the oil pipelines will be collected by the Commission under FERC&hyph;550 ``Oil Pipeline Rates: Tariff Filings''. FERC&hyph;550 is a designation covering oil pipeline tariff filings made to the Commission. The estimates include the time for reviewing instructions, researching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The current annual reporting burden is 5,350 hours based on an estimated 535 responses from approximately 140 respondents. Interested persons may send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of this information collection, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415]; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB (Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission).
