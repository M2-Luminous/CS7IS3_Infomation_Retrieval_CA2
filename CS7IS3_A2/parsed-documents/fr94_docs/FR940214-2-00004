FR940214-2-00004 FR940214-2-00002 Petitioners also claim that in the preliminary results of the changed circumstances review, the Department failed to consider Rotem as a new business entity because the Department was only looking at industrial phosphoric acid. Petitioners argue that the proper legal standard for determining successorship is whether the ``resulting operation'' of the acquiring company is essentially similar to its predecessor.'' See Brass Sheet and Strip preliminary results. Therefore, the merged Rotem should be examined with respect to its overall operations, not just its operations with respect to the subject merchandise. Petitioners argue that since Rotem's operations are not the same as they were prior to the merger with respect to all types of merchandise, Rotem should not be treated as a successor to Negev. In response to petitioners' argument that Rotem has become an integrated producer of phosphoric acid, respondent claims that Negev's production of the subject merchandise was in fact fully integrated before the merger. Although the merger further integrated the production of fertilizer grade acid, no changes have occurred with regard to the production of the subject merchandise. Department's Position: We disagree with petitioners' assertion that the proper legal standard for determining successorship is whether the acquiring company is similar to its predecessor with respect to its overall operations. In the preliminary results for Brass Sheet and Strip, the Department found that ``concerning production and sales of brass sheet and strip,'' the acquiring company was operating essentially as the same business entity as its predecessor. See Brass Sheet and Strip from Canada; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, (57 FR 5128, 5129; February 12, 1992). Moreover, in the final results for Brass Sheet and Strip, the Department agreed that since respondent's business operation was essentially the same as that of its predecessor ``with regard to the production of brass sheet and strip,'' the acquiring company was essentially the same operation as its predecessor. See Brass Sheet and Strip from Canada; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, (57 FR 20460, 20462; May 13, 1992). Thus, in this review, the Department has applied the same standard for determining successorship as the standard which was applied in the preliminary and final results of Brass Sheet and Strip. Insofar as no explicit legal standard for determining successorship is provided by the statute or the Department's regulations, the Department has discretion in deciding how to determine whether one company is a successor to another for purposes of the antidumping duty law. In Brass Sheet and Strip, the Department examined the described factors in terms of the operations which produce the subject merchandise. This has continued to be our approach in the instant review. The operation producing the subject merchandise is the appropriate level at which to focus our analysis because under the antidumping duty laws, we are examining pricing practices with respect to the subject merchandise. For example, in this case, the antidumping duty order applies only to industrial phosphoric acid and reviews are conducted only on sales of this merchandise. Thus it follows that an inquiry into the validity of a claim of successorship to a respondent company should focus on that company's sales and production of the merchandise encompassed by the order. Comment 2: Petitioners claim that when examining the four elements for determining successorship: (1) Management, (2) production facilities, (3) supplier relationships, and (4) customer base, Rotem's operations are not a continuation of Negev's operations. With regard to management, petitioners argue that with the resulting changes in the board of directors and the production management, there is a new and different management team in charge. Petitioners claim that there has not been a continuation of the former Negev management in the new Rotem.
