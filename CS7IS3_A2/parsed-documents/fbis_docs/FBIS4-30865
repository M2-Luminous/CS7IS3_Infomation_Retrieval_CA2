In an interview to the [Bratislava] UJ SZO on 25 May, Duray said: "Through its legitimate representatives, the Hungarian community wishes to participate in drawing up the agreement. We reject all such steps that would exclude our direct participation.... There are two alternatives. One is that we become part of bilateral talks and, in this case, naturally, we accept the mediating role of a third party. As a second solution, we consider it more important and necessary to create a system of agreements within the given country, in our case between the Hungarian minority and the government," Duray said.
