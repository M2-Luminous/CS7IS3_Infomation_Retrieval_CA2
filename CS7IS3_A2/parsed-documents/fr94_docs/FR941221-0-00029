SUMMARY: This document amends the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regulations regarding National Service Life Insurance (NSLI) to provide that when an interest rate change is required on an NSLI variable rate loan the effective date of the new interest rate will be on or after the first day of October on which the rate change is made in the insurance automatic data processing system, and that such new rate shall remain in effect for not less than one year after the date of establishment. This action is being taken to allow sufficient time to make all necessary modifications to the Insurance ADP system without any adverse impact on NSLI policyholders and VA. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Gregory Hosmer, Senior Insurance Specialist/Attorney, Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office and Insurance Center, P.O. Box 8079, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19101, (215) 951&hyph;5710. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On page 45254 of the Federal Register of September 1, 1994, VA published a proposed regulatory amendment to provide that when an interest rate change is required on an NSLI variable rate loan the effective date of the new interest rate will be on or after the first day of October on which the rate change is made in the Insurance Automatic Data Processing system, and that such new rate shall remain in effect for not less than one year after the date of establishment. Interested parties were given 30 days in which to submit written comments, suggestions or objections regarding the proposed amendment. No written comments were received and the proposed amendment is hereby adopted without change as set forth below. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs hereby certifies that this final regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this final regulation is, therefore, exempt from the initial and final regulatory analyses requirements in sections 603 and 604. The reason for this certification is that this final regulation will affect only certain Government life insurance policyholders. It will, therefore, have no significant direct impact on small entities in terms of compliance costs, paperwork requirements, or effects on competition. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number for this regulation is 64.103. List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 8 National Service Life Insurance. Approved: December 7, 1994.
