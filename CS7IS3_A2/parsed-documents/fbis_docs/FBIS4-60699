It said that these directives affect 16 places, including three properties belonging to the Egyptian Army which should have been returned to the Sudanese Government after the departure of the British-Egyptian occupying force at Sudan's independence in 1956. The other 13 areas were leased to the (?Irrigation Department) and to an Arab-Egyptian company which the government assigned for Egyptian and other resident communities in 1958. The Ministry added in its statement that these places were unoccupied for a long period and claims that some families were evicted on the eve of the festival 'Id al-Adha are pure and unfounded distortions indulged in by newspapers. The ministry stressed that these directives were routine and also affected citizens, as well as Sudanese and foreign institutions. [passage omitted]
