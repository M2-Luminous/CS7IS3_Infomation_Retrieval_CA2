Many believe that it is unfair. How do you view that campaign? [Mashariqah] The campaign some elements in the U.S. Administration launched against Syria was undoubtedly unfair. It sought to inflict harm on Syria and its policy through accusing it of failure to fight drugs. It also aimed to destroy Syrian-American relations and put pressure on Syria to dissuade it from taking the stance it is assuming on the peace process and its fixed principles. That campaign sought also to belittle the outcome of the Geneva summit meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton and inhibit the impetus it gave to the peace process. The manifest fact is that Syria is making efforts in cooperation with the Lebanese authorities to fight poppy and other drug farming, particularly in the Lebanese area of al-Biqa'. Syria has issued many legislations and laws to fight drugs, including the infliction of the severest punishments on whoever farms, manufactures, or smuggles narcotics. Syria's drug-fighting efforts seemed very satisfying to the United Nations, as represented in the regional committee on fighting drugs, which selected Damascus as a venue for its 30th session. The committee's representative saw that Syria's drug-fighting efforts are worthy of praise. The goal of this campaign is to put pressure on Syria and force it to relinquish its solid stance and just issues, which were recognized by international legitimacy, that seek to establish a just and comprehensive peace in the region. But Syria's stance and its just claims cannot be the subject of one-upmanship. [Al-Sa'id] Can this campaign be viewed as a sign of pressure on Syria, particularly since it was launched just before Christopher's tour of the region? [Mashariqah] Putting Syria's name on the list of states that fail to fight drugs is merely extortion to drive it to accept Israeli conditions in the peace process. Syria always reiterates that it rejects extortion and will not tolerate one-upmanship when it comes to its basic issues. There is no way that Syria will relinquish its rights; it is determined to hold on to basic principles concerning Arab rights and claims. Pressure will only enhance Syria's insistence on these rights and on defending them. All methods and pressure will not succeed to force it off its course or make it back down on its approach to defend Arab rights and issues. [Al-Sa'id] The Geneva summit, held between presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Clinton on 16 January, managed to shed light on the fact that the Syrian role is the key to peace in the Middle East. How can the obstacles placed by Israel to block a comprehensive and just peace in the region be overcome? [Mashariqah] The success of the Geneva summit in January between presidents al-Asad and Clinton was great. It drew the attention of various Arab and world political circles and it was reported by all print and broadcast media in detail. These media focused on the summit's effectiveness and positive results. President al-Asad went to Geneva to remove Zionism's allegations and falsifications that cast doubt on Syria's desire for peace. He stressed that a just and comprehensive peace is an irreversible strategic option for Syria. The Geneva summit has turned over a new page in the bilateral relations between Damascus and Washington and enhanced the great role of Syria and its president. The U.S. President became certain that Syria's pan-Arab role is unique and that Syria's influence in events at the regional level cannot be bypassed. The summit's atmosphere was positive and the Americans asserted that they will make sincere efforts to achieve a tangible progress in the peace process. Obviously, Israel did not like the atmosphere that prevailed at the summit or the results. So it began to raise doubts, disseminate fabricated lies, and show reservations to circumvent the outcome of the Geneva summit, absolve itself from the requirements of the peace process, and diminish the world's serious stance on achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region, especially that of the United States. Syria has always stressed its enthusiasm about the peace process and ensuring that it achieves its goals by bringing about a just and comprehensive peace that will restore Arab rights and territories. As far as Syria is concerned, peace is an irreversible strategic option. If the United States makes a sincere effort to make tangible progress in the peace process, as President Clinton promised at the Geneva summit, and plays the role of an impartial mediator, the process can achieve its desired goals according to international legitimacy resolutions. [Al-Sa'id] What about the methods the Israeli Government uses in its dealings with the peace process? [Mashariqah] The methods of the Israeli Government affirm that it tends to stall, delay, and weasel its way out of discussing the basic issues that lead to establishing a just and permanent peace and that were stipulated by the principles of international legitimacy and the UN resolutions. This peace is based on retrieving the occupied Arab territories and the national rights of the Palestinian Arab people. In addition, the current attempts to proceed with partial and unilateral solutions could create obstacles before a just and comprehensive peace is realized, which was the objective of the Madrid conference and the negotiations that followed it in Washington. The maneuvers and practices of the Israeli Government are preventing the establishment of the desired peace. If the Israeli Government continues its methods, it will make these real opportunities for peace hit a dead end. Syria wants peace. What is important now is to use logic in all matters. Logic dictates that we have an international resolution that stipulates a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Syria adheres to the peace process in accordance with the bases and grounds of the Madrid peace process. These bases concentrate on international legitimacy represented in Resolutions 242 and 338, as well as the land-for-peace formula. [Al-Sa'id] There are some sides rushing to normalize relations with Israel and lift the boycott before establishing peace. What do you think about this? [Mashariqah] The Arab boycott of Israel was an Arab decision made by the Arab League at that time to confront Israel's aggressive policy and expansionist ambitions. If this decision is to be reviewed, only the side that passed it can do so when it finds a need for this. The reality is that the reasons that the boycott decision was made still exist. The Arab territories are occupied, national rights are usurped, and Israel does not want to establish just and comprehensive peace in accordance with the international legitimacy resolutions. In the Washington peace talks, it is resorting to procrastination, deception, and wasting time. At the same time, it continues to build its settlements and commit crimes and massacres, one after the other, against the Arab citizens in the occupied territories. It wants land and peace. It wants peace for peace. This is how it wants to normalize relations with the Arabs. It wants control and influence. It wants to hegemonize over the Arab region and control its resources. It wants to realize its strategies in any way possible so that the whole Arab region will submit to it in the end. What stands in the way of Israel's dreams is Syria's firm and principled stance in confronting its maneuvers and tricks, as well as its adherence to the basic principles of the peace process, which stem from international legitimacy and implementation of the latter's resolutions. [Al-Sa'id] Inter-Arab disarray has weakened the position of Arab negotiators with Israel. In your view, how can solidarity be restored among Arabs? [Mashariqah] Disarray has indeed weakened the position of Arab negotiators. This is what Israel has been eager to achieve so that it could negotiate with this or that Arab side alone, wrestle as many concessions as it could, strip the peace process of the required momentum, and shatter the hopes peace-loving elements in the region and in the world have pinned on that process. From the outset, Syria has been careful to sustain Arab solidarity and keep up coordination among the negotiating Arab delegations. It believed in the need for a comprehensive and just solution that guarantees the restoration of Arab rights and lands as a natural prologue for stability and peace in the region. Syria has not ceased to exert sincere efforts to restore Arab solidarity. This solidarity enhances the position of Arab negotiators and foils Israel's procrastination, which seeks to ruin the peaceful process. [Al-Sa'id] How do you view Israel's attempt to promote a Middle Eastern market through which it can control the region? [Mashariqah] Since it was planted in the heart of the Arab homeland, Israel has pursued an aggressive expansionist policy and a strategy that seeks to control the entire Arab region with its political, economic, military, and cultural capabilities. Nothing has changed in Israel's policy and strategy. Its talk about peace is just a maneuver. Israel does not want peace; it is far from binding itself to the principles of a just and comprehensive peace as specified by the resolutions of international legitimacy. It is trying to make negotiations lose their vigor; it wastes time and effort at the Washington talks to make the process lose its momentum. Israel wants to normalize relations with Arabs and wants peace for peace. In other words, it wants Arabs to surrender to its will because it wants land and peace, control and influence, and seeks to subjugate the region to its will, policy, and strategy. Its promotion of the idea of a Middle East market falls in this context. What shatters Israel's dreams is Syria's solid stance regarding its maneuvers and the Arab masses' determination to hold onto their rights and claims against Israel's schemes and procrastination. [Al-Sa'id] How can Arab relations be developed in the face of the so-called new world order? [Mashariqah] There is no new world order; there are international changes and developments that led to the disintegration of the Socialist bloc in Eastern Europe and the collapse of the Soviet Union and, consequently, the emergence of the unipolar trend in international relations. These changes have not reached their ultimate form and developments are continuing. Hence, we cannot talk of a developed new world order. At any rate, developing Arab relations and enhancing Arab solidarity are for the good of the Arab nation. They will help it cope with international developments and defend its rights and existence by confronting threats. The same thing goes for relations with Islamic states.
