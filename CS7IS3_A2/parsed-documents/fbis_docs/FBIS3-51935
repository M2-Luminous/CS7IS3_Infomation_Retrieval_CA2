Governor-general Sir Clement Arrindell, delivering the traditional throne speech at the opening of a new session of parliament, said particular attention would be paid to the special needs of low wage earners, the unemployed, senior citizens, women and young people. "We will strengthen mechanisms aimed at ensuring that the fruits of economic expansion are equitably shared and enjoyed by all categories of persons in the society," Sir Clement told the National Assembly. "We will also continue to implement a variety of programmes .... To provide a social safety net for the protection of lower income groups," the head of state added. As Sir Clement spoke, loud explosions could be heard outside as the police fired stun grenades to keep back a crowd of opposition supporters calling for new elections. The four elected St Kitts-Nevis Labour Party MPs boycotted the ceremony. [passage omitted]
