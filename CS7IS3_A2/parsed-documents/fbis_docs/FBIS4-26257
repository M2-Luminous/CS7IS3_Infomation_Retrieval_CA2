On the afternoon of 7 June, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, and other provincial leaders, including Liu Shanxiang and Guo Shichang, heard reports on popularization of the public bidding system and the unhealthy trends in the construction market given by the provincial and Shijiazhuang city construction committees, construction industry bureaus, and bidding offices. Chen Weigao pointed out: Construction and decoration trades have made important contributions to Hebei's urban construction and construction of key projects, but some architectural and construction units have conducted trade between power and money when contracting construction projects because the construction market has yet to be fully cultivated, the mechanism of market competition has yet to be standardized, the laws and regulations for the trades are imperfect, and management of the trades is still weak. This has not only brought about tremendous economic losses to the state and turned a number of important projects into high-priced and low-quality projects with hidden danger. But it has also led some cadres to the road of crimes, such as bribery and embezzlement. This has become a conspicuous problem in the anticorruption struggle. For this reason, in our effort to oppose corruption, advocate honesty, and correct the unhealthy trends of some trades, we should pay attention to this problem. Cheng Weigao emphasized: To make the work successful, we should coordinate the endeavors to build the market, strengthen management of public bidding work, establish the market competition mechanism, and strengthen the supervision and management of the market with those to oppose corruption and advocate honesty, check unhealthy trends, and investigate and handle major and serious cases. He called for efforts to start with five aspects of work. First, we should strengthen the fundamental managerial work for construction projects. We should clarify who are to hold the responsibilities, implement the project report system, screen and approve the projects strictly based on their planning, designing, and construction procedures, make all construction units implement the public bidding system, and strengthen the supervision and management of the quality after the projects are started. Second, the public bidding system should be persistently applied to all construction and decoration projects. The extremely small number of projects to which the system cannot be applied due to special reasons should be screened and approved by authorized departments. Projects for which bids are to be negotiated should be screened and approved by authorized departments before bids are determined. In the process of inviting and entering bids, government administrative departments are prohibited from giving intervention, and leading cadres are prohibited from giving hints on or forcing the designation of the construction units by giving approvals or admonitions. Construction units which give pressure on architectural units in the name leading cadres and intervene in the bidding procedures, once discovered, should be disqualified from the construction and dispelled from the province if they come from other provinces. Construction licenses will not be issued to the architectural units which do not invite bids or negotiate bids without approval. Third, focusing on promoting the public bidding system, we should establish and improve the compatible construction market mechanism as well as laws and regulations. We should also establish and improve bidding organizations, appraisal organizations, and intermediary organizations. Fourth, in the process of inviting and entering bids, it is strictly forbidden to give parties and gifts or to offer sight-seeing tours in the name of observation. Fifth, we should investigate and handle major and serious cases. When construction investment is found to be greatly disparate from the construction results, we should strengthen auditing and inspection of them and sternly deal with the people who have abused power to extort money and take and ask for bribes.
