Voters will almost certainly remove the present coalition, so the real question is whether the Hungarian Socialists or the Free Democrats get the authority to replace them, Kuncze said. The SZDSZ has a good chance and is attracting growing support, he added. Some television programmes were openly biased against certain parties, Kuncze claimed. The SZDSZ would follow a different government policy and would involve the future opposition more. His party wants to see more control for Parliament over the Cabinet. He said that expecting miracles from the elections was dangerous for the stability of the country and blamed the MSZP for doing nothing to protect people from illusory hopes. He also promised that between the first and second round of the elections the SZDSZ would not expand inter-party cooperation beyond the liberal bloc. The Boross-Moravcik meeting showed continuity, he said: the Slovaks were ready to improve bilateral relations.
