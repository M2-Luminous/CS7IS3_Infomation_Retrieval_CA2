The task has been a mammoth one. What usually takes other countries four and a half years to organize had to be completed in just four months. Inevitably, then, there had to be problems, and problems there were. In the studio with me is Judge Johann Kriegler and Advocate Dikgang Moseneke from the IEC. Good evening, gentlemen, and welcome. How far are we from getting the final results? [Kriegler] As near as we can possibly be, and as short as possible. [Nashokwe] Timeframe? [Kriegler] We've never been prepared to commit ourselves to a time frame. As long as it takes to do it legitimately and thoroughly. [Mashokwe] Two days? Three days? [Kriegler] We've never been prepared to commit ourselves to a timeframe. We'll take as long as it takes to do it so that the people are satisfied that we've done it. [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, what it is that the IEC has done wrongly? The country is waiting. [Moseneke] Well, let me tell you what I'm prepared to say. The judge has said a little less, and guardedly so. I want to say to the people out there that we're working around the clock. Remember, we're getting results coming through from all quarters of our country. We're getting results from the north end of Natal such as Jozini, to the southernmost parts of this country. From the northern Cape, from wherever else you can think of. Whereas in the past elections were decentralized, the results came from constituencies, now they have to come to one central point and be allocated to all the parties, and there are many, as you know. So we have made sure that everything comes to the center, and once it is here at the center, we have to allocate the results. I want to leave much more hope out there at home. What I'm going to say to you is, that results will be out in a way that will not affect... [Mashokwe, interrupting] When? [Moseneke] Listen to me, listen to me. The results will be out in a way that will not affect the presidential inauguration on Monday, which must, as you know, be preceeded by the sitting of the National Assembly on Monday...I'm sorry, let me correct that -- the presidential inauguration is on Tuesday the 10th, National Assembly will sit on Monday the 9th. The provincial assemblies may sit on Saturday, and clearly -- now you should use your common sense -- we're going to make sure that results are there avaialble to keep all these processes in place. [Mashokwe] What was the delay all about? [Moseneke] Well, let me tell you. You know that Natal has just finished counting. Now the parties out there are present, they have to make sure that they go through the processes and they are bickering among themselves, and we have to allow that whole process. Do you know that at Nasrec [exhibition center] the results have actually just come through in the course of this early evening? Big voting station, over 34 counting stations. We're to allow the parties to debate the issues, to make the tallies, and we still have to reconcile them. Think about that. [Moseneke] Did you not have a problem with the computer, Judge Kriegler? [Kriegler] We had a problem with the computer, and the problem was that we were trying to keep the people happy. Instead of just going for totals, we tried to feed into the media 3,000 votes at a time from each counting station, and this complicated the issue to a much greater extent than we had anticipated. [Mashokwe] For about 20 minutes, the report says, somebody must have fiddled with your computer. How could that have been possible and what kind of fiddling are we talking about? Who is affected? Which parties are affected by this? [Kriegler] I'm not at liberty to disclose that. I think it would be unfair to the parties... [Mashokwe] But are there parties that have been affected? [Kriegler] There are parties that were temporarily affected until shortly afterwards. We picked it up. [Moseneke] It is important, I think, to support the judge there, and to say almost instantly our computer experts were quite sharp, were able to determine the difficultes in a very short space of time, just a matter of hours, and I want to say to you that the integrity of most of the figures, of the results, have not been tampered with. They are entirely intact. You will see as and when the results move on, you'll notice that the changes are very slight, and, you know, these changes are limited to just a few parties. So in that way there is no reason for concern whatsoever. What is important is that the IEC once again has managed to detect the problem, and to solve it. [Mashokwe] The leaders have already accepted defeat and others have made victory statements, and yet you're talking about provincial tallies. Is the integrity of the result not going to be questioned by the delays that you're causing? By the fact that you're not able to deliver the final package? We've had so many problems... [Kriegler] Let's get this one clear. From the beginning we were given 10 days to get the results out. That's the time at our disposal. It's always been... [Mashokwe, interrupting] You're not dragging your feet because you have 10 days? [Kriegler] Not on your life. We've made it clear from the beginning, it's going to take time. Let me add, you know, it's not just doing a bit of simple arithmetic. There are a very large number of objections and complaints that we've got to deal with, and we're dealing with those as efficiently and as quickly and as fairly as is humanly possible. There are thousands of complaints that have got to be dealt with. [Mashokwe] Talking about complaints, Judge Kriegler, the dispute from KwaZulu-Natal, ANC blaming it on the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], the IFP also countering. Has this been sorted out? [Kriegler] The complaints as such? Some of the disputes have been sorted out at the correct level, namely, by the parties concerned. Yes. Some of them certainly do remain, in fact a substantial number still remain for us to determine, if necessary. [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, give me your understanding of an unfree and unfair election, taking into consideration the scenario we've been through, with all the problems we've gone through. [Moseneke] Well, I don't think we should exaggerate the problems. I think we should remember one important characteristic of free and fair elections... [Mashokwe, interrupting] Unfree and unfair. [Moseneke] You want an unfree and an unfair one? Well, I could tell you what is free and fair, and you can make the deduction if you will. My job is to deliver a free and fair election. Now look, obviously if not everybody is allowed or given the opportunity to cast a vote, that would go to the heart of the matter. If there would be no fairness, in regard to treatment of the parties -- all have to be given equal opportunity and equal chance in the process. Ideally you'd want to have informed voters, and if the bulk of your votes are not informed, they probably would be affected in their choices. A matter about which not much can always be done; and you'd want to hope that all the parties, all the people voting, would not be subjected to intimidation, to violence, to any threat of future adverse consequences. And the results must be properly determined and made known publicly. [Mashokwe] Some of the problems that you've had here, like the shortage of ballot boxes -- a million somewhere in warehouses -- are the kind of problems that one would say your administration will have detected, at least if you were efficient. [Kriegler] You give us four years, and we'll do that. And let me tell you, the next time round it will be much better. Let's make one point clear. A first-time election is always difficult, even in a small country. We're a large country, and it was exceedingly difficult, and we never made any bones about that. And particularly, I want to add to what my friend Dikgang said. Part of fairness is that it is perceived and felt by the people as being their election. You've got to involve the people in the business of the election, and that means you've got to involve people who haven't had experience.... [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, what is it that you would have done differently if you were to be given the same task again? [Moseneke] Well, there are a few things. The first of these would be, I hope we will have a voter registration. A roll is critical, it's essential. It's the basis of your planning. You'll realize that there was no voters' roll. You never could accurately determine how many people were there in the country. It affects where you place your voting stations. The second thing is, I think the preparations for the next elections should start now. I think you need several years. You don't need four months. Perhaps let me stop immediately to say, I think it is a near miracle what we have achieved. In four months when we were appointed, not even a chair we had. From the very beginning, right through to what you are looking at now, you have the results, you're having a new president, you're having a democracy at your doorstep. We made all that possible. We've employed over, what, 300, 400 [figure as heard] South Africans, and got them out there to do the job themselves. So as and when.... [Mashokwe, interrupting] And then to leave us with the burden of all these problems that.... [Moseneke, interrupting] No, no, no, not at all. We've delivered to you an election which substantially had all the features that allowed our people to be able to make choices. You must not confuse exaggerated statements that are made all the time with the substance of the task. Ordinary South Africans went out there to count the votes. They conducted the elections. You saw them, as monitors. It was a people's election. They went out there to do it -- not perfectly, but still, they did it, and next time around it must be better. I'm sure it will be better. [Mashokwe] Judge Kriegler, final result? Are you prepared to give us an indication? [Kriegler] In good time for the presidential inauguration and as soon as it is ready. [Mashokwe] Judge Kriegler, Advocate Dikgang Moseneke, thanks for your time, and thanks for talking to us.
