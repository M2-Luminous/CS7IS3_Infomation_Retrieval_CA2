Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin in an interview with our reporter Jack Katzenell described the lifting of the embargo as a very important decision. [Begin recording] [Beilin] Of course, it has a symbolic effect, but it has also a very realistic impact because it will enable us to participate in bids of selling arms to Britain, which will include British components, and that can happen only when the embargo is lifted, and when the British can sell us those components. [Katzenell] So, do you think that this embargo, which has lasted 12 years, has it done Israel a great deal of harm, or has it been mainly a kind of slap in the face, something moral or symbolic? [Beilin] Both. This embargo was decided upon during the war in Lebanon in 1982. It was a European decision, and only Britain decided to continue the embargo. In our visits to London and the meetings with British officials, we raised this issue. I raised it with Secretary Hurd exactly two weeks ago, and I said to him that it is really inexplicable to continue the embargo after the agreement which has been signed between us and the PLO, and against the background of the development towards this in the Middle East, and I believe that those talks with the British helped us in putting an end to this embargo.
