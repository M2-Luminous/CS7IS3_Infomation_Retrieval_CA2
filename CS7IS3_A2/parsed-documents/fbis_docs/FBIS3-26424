Lt. Gen. Shih Tzuo-ching, deputy director of the Political Warfare Department of the Ministry of National Defense, told a press conference that because of the malfeasance of a handful of officers, "the military's image has been marred and the nation's interest harmed." Several military officers and arms brokers have been detained for being involved in the murder of Navy Captain Yin Ching-feng, whose body was uncovered on Dec. 10. Yin was responsible for the navy's arms acquisition unit. The ministry organized a special task force a week after Yin's body was discovered, but doubts over the role of the ad hoc group have since mounted because little progress has been reported in clearing the web of irregularities surrounding the incident. Shih denied rumors that the military has been trying to keep a low profile on the case because many more ranking officers have been implicated. "No direct evidence is available that can lead to some suspects being charged," he said. While pledging to bring the case to its just conclusion, Shih said the Defense Ministry is reviewing its arms procurement system to prevent similar scandals in the future.
