The draft agreement signed by Marcel Roulet and Helmut Ricke, the two groups' presidents, provides that both companies will own equal shares of the new entity, the name, legal form and capital of which still remain to be determined. In principle, it should be operational by 1995; by then, it should achieve sales of about 10 billion francs [Fr] with 4,000 employees. Its sphere of activity will extend from data network services (X.25, frame relay, etc.) to VSATs [very-small-aperture terminals], including international leased lines, international virtual private (voice-data) networks, and value-added services. From this point of view, the two partners will endow the joint venture, Telecom with the activities of Transpac and its European subsidiaries and with some parts of FCR [France Cables et Radio]; and Deutsche Telekom with Datex-P, the German X.25 data network operator, and with other unidentified entities. As for Eunetcom, the two operators' jointly-owned subsidiary dedicated to outsourcing for large multinational networks, "it is destined to be integrated into the new joint company under forms that remain to be defined," Marcel Roulet indicated, making a point of adding: "The new company will be in a position to offer services covering a single need of its clients, who will not necessarily be large multinational companies, whereas Eunetcom and its rivals, Unisource or Syncordia, aimed to take responsibility for all the telecommunication needs of very large clients." For reasons of compatibility with Community law, consumer services--.e.g the centralization of international switched telephone traffic, and mobile communication services--are excluded from the alliance for the time being. Also excluded is Eucom, another joint structure working essentially in data interchange for the transportation and tourism sectors. Nothing else is certain. "The announcement of this framework agreement has more to do with political management than with true business management where announcements deal with firmly established facts," Jean-Pierre Chamoux estimated, adding: "Per se, this agreement is good because it will enable the two operators to gain experience in the international sector while sharing risks. But, in the short term, they have nothing to oppose to third parties. Therefore, what is involved today is a pact rather than a true business project." As a result, many questions are being raised. The first one is that of the position of community authorities, whose green light is required. Preliminary contacts are said to have taken place between the two presidents and Jacques Delors, the European Commission president. "But the matter will be officially referred to Brussels only when our plans begin to materialize," Helmut Ricke stated. Another pending question is that of the future of Transpac and its role in the new setup. "Transpac will be the French correspondent of the joint subsidiary, and its mission will be to harmonize operating policies with Datex-P," Marcel Roulet explained. But Transpac, which has a wide business experience, has invested a lot on the international market, contrary to Datex-P, a mere division of Deutsche Telekom which never ventured outside Germany. Besides, the French-German axis needs to be strengthened: first in Europe, where the two allies might pull along in their wake the Belgian operator Belgacom (the choice of Brussels as headquarters for the future company can be interpreted as a covert advance in this respect) and the Italian company Stet [Telephone Finance Corporation], which already worked with France Telecom in Argentina and wishes to expand on the international market; above all, in the United States, "where we must absolutely have a partner in order to offer a good range of services to our clients. Negotiations are in progress, in particular with AT&T," Helmut Ricke acknowledged. As for BT [British Telecom], the large European rival of the two national operators, the CEO [chief executive officer] of which, Ian Vallance, already denounced their alliance as anticompetitive to the extent that telephone services and infrastructures remain under a monopoly both in France and in Germany, will it go so far as to file a complaint with the Brussels Commission? At any rate, it is likely to try and obtain that the Commission increase its pressure on France and Germany to make them decontrol their infrastructures. Services for Large Accounts Once united, the two partners' activities should yield a single line of products and services representing a "seamless" network offer, with genuine one-stop shopping--at least in France and Germany; at best in Europe--and centralized billing. But uniting means changing, even relinquishing part of what already exists. First, cultural and organizational discrepancies between technical and management teams must be erased, as well as incompatibilities between interfaces, equipment, and management systems, and tariff differences, etc., so as to achieve a uniform offer. Each type of service that has to be merged will bring its share of constraints. But the time and cost required for this integration should be reasonable considering the structural similarity of the products involved. Merging the Transpac and Datex-P packet-switching services should be easy. Through its German subsidiary, Info-AG, Transpac has acquired a solid experience. In both cases, X.25 is the protocol used, the 64-bit segment is the billing unit. The frame-relay openings and protocols attempted on both sides remain marginal. There remains to establish a direct interconnection system less expensive than the one used on the Transpac Europe network. Transpac already offers a single contract and single billing for international services at 1,000 francs [Fr] per month per contract, and Fr200 per month per gate per subscriber, with calls billed at Fr0.32 per kilobyte (Fr0.057 for local calls). In principle, the French-German X.25 connection should get more favorable tariff conditions already in 1995. For the planned merger of international leased lines (LSI), conditions will be less favorable. Although France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom significantly lowered the prices of their national and international lines, the difference with operators such as C&W or BT remains noticeable, especially in the case of the German company. The latter privileged its 64-kbps [kilobits per second] virtual line service on an ISDN [integrated services digital network] B-channel at the expense of traditional leased lines which are twice as expensive. France Telecom announced that it will offer a similar service in 1994, under the label Transgroupe, to build virtual voice-data networks. By 1995, these two ISDN services may be interconnected! Transgroupe might replace Colisee International on the French-German axis, just as it is expected to replace it on Colisee Numeris. Although conditional, the two national operators' intention to build an "Intelligent Network" on a joint platform confirms this trend.
