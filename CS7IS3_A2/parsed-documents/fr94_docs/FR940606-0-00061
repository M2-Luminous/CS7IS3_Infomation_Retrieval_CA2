(c) Relocation assistance for displaced persons. A ``displaced person'' (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601&hyph;4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24. A ``displaced person'' shall be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;19), and, if the representative comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment to be provided to a minority person is located in an area of minority concentration, such person also shall be given, if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas. (d) Real property acquisition requirements. The acquisition of real property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements described in 49 CFR part 24, subpart B. (e) Appeals. A person who disagrees with the Agency's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a ``displaced person,'' or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is found to be eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the Agency. A person who is dissatisfied with the Agency's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Field Office. (f) Responsibility of Agency. (1) The Agency shall certify (i.e., provide assurance of compliance as required by 49 CFR part 24) that it will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section, and shall ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the Agency to comply. (2) The cost of relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project costs. Such costs, however, may be paid from local funds or funds available from other sources. (3) The Agency shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with these provisions. The Agency shall maintain data on the race, ethnic, gender, and disability status of displaced persons. (g) Definition of displaced person.

Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of: (A) The tenant's monthly rent before execution of the agreement and estimated average monthly utility costs; or (B) 30 percent of gross household income; or (ii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either: (A) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied unit, any increased housing costs and incidental expenses; or
