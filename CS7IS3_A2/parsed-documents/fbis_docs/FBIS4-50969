One-third of state-owned enterprises are obviously suffering from losses, one-third are facing latent losses, and only one-third are really making profits. This is the current common appraisal. Loss-making state-owned enterprises with independent accounting amounted to 11,453, accounting for 31.8 percent of the total. A comrade in the State Council pointed out: The serious deficits in state-owned enterprises have caused them economic losses, brought about big difficulties to state and local revenues, directly affected sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu, kuai su, jian kang, 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] economic development, and affected the smooth carrying out of enterprise reform. Politically, enterprise deficits, their inability to pay their employees' wages, and the decline in the employees' living standards have seriously affected social stability. The people throughout the country are concerned about making up state-owned enterprises' deficits. The government and enterprises are considering how to change this situation and we are very clear that this situation must not remain any longer. Introduction of Foreign Capital Yields Good Results In Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, there are 37 state-owned enterprises directly under the city's jurisdiction. Thirteen of these enterprises were making losses, most of them were only making meager profits, and only three of them were making profits of more than 1 million yuan. The loss-making enterprises either had stopped their production for years or were in a state of semi-production. Some could not repay their debts or their profits could not offset the interest on loans. These enterprises could not make up their deficits. In August 1992, the Quanzhou City authorities sold 60 percent of the assets of these enterprises to the Hong Kong China Strategic Investment Company Limited, which became the main stockholder. After a year of joint venture, these enterprises saw tremendous changes. According to statistics at the end of 1993, the sales volume in these 37 enterprises increased by 15.28 percent over the previous year; their taxes paid to the government increased by 48 percent; their profits rose by 4.4 times; and they repaid special loans of 3,027 yuan [figure as published]. Their losses were cleared and their profits increased by a wide margin. In 1994, these enterprises have continued to register a steady growth. Why is it that after foreign capital was introduced, these enterprises were so greatly different from before? The chairman of these joint-venture enterprises gave the following six reasons: With the introduction of foreign capital, there is a clear distinction between management and ownership and between responsibility and duty; these enterprises can obtain foreign exchange funds for their technical transformation; they can introduce advanced foreign technology and scientific managerial methods; they can explore the international market by means of the foreign side's relations with other countries, their broad channels, and their responsive information; they can put their stocks in overseas listings and open the way for raising capital abroad; and they have established an effective supervisory mechanism. Many people in economic circles say that the participation of foreign investors in the formation of limited shareholding companies with state-owned enterprises is an effective way of transforming state-owned enterprises, making up their deficits, and improving their vitality; this bears practical significance in helping small and medium state-owned enterprises out of their predicaments. Hopwever, in the course of implementation there is a need to assess state-owned assets rationally to prevent them from being sold at low prices or being allowed to drain away. Whether or not the stocks of a joint-venture enterprise should be held by the foreign investor depends on the specific situation. We should not link an assets transfer to the political and social system but should regard it as a normal practice in the market economy. Selling assets to foreign investors for joint-venture purposes is not an individual case. The Hong Kong China Strategic Investment Company Limited alone pooled capital with 102 light industrial enterprises in Dalian and dozens of enterprises in Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Wuxi in running joint-venture enterprises in these cities, thus enlivening state-owned enterprises there. People in economic circles call this a "China Strategic practice" which switches the transformation of enterprises' operational mechanism to the transfer of state property rights. This is a more thorough way of transforming enterprises' operational mechanisms and serves as a foundation for the establishment of a new enterprise system. Orienting Enterprises Toward the Market Gives Much Hope Some enterprise deficits in the 1980's were the "after effects" of the traditional planned economy; in the 1990's, many enterprises' deficits are the results of their "inability to adapt" to the market economy. A state-owned machine-building enterprise in northeast China has incurred losses for many consecutive years. Its staff members and workers, having nothing to do, will usually sit in the sun and play cards in the factory compound, waiting for state relief. A small factory of a similar type in south China held a trade fair in the city in which the enterprise is located. Within a few days, purchase orders worth tens of millions of yuan were signed. The enterprise staff members and workers in the northeast remained indifferent to what was happening around them. There is a similar example in Jiangxi. A ramie spinning factory in this province has adopted the same method for 10 years, regardless of market changes. It has finally changed from a profitable factory into a loss-making one. Refusing to adjust production in accordance with market changes is an important reason why many state-owned enterprises have incurred losses. The Shanxi Dazhong Machine-Building Factory is a military industrial enterprise which used to manufacture one type of product. It suffered from losses for six consecutive years from 1986 to 1992 and finally found itself in a predicament. In 1992 it started adjusting its leading group. As soon as the new factory director assumed office, he led the employees in breaking away from the traditional planned economy and a closed military industrial structure. They removed the barrier between the military industry and the market, used the market for guidance, adjusted the product mix, and concentrated on manufacturing gas stoves, textile winders [luo tong ji 4820 4592 2623], and other civilian products. As a result, they stopped the factory's deficits within four months. The Beijing Wristwatch Factory freed itself from its loss-making predicament because it "always remembered the market, attentively watched the market, and adapted its products to the market." They adjusted the factory's operational strategy and product mix, switched from manufacturing single-function to multi-function wristwatches, and reformed their management system, investment orientation, product design, trial production, and reward methods. The period for developing new products was shortened from six to two months and wristwatch models increased from the previous dozens to more than 200. The factory reduced its losses by some 7 million yuan in 1992 and made up its deficits and began to make profits in 1993. Managerial personnel from some state-owned enterprises which had seen improvement said with deep feeling: In the past we had blind faith in plans and ignored the market role and, as a result, we were abandoned by the market and found the going tough. We now trust the market and feel that it can provide prompt information. Thus, enterprises can have impetus and methods. Invigorating the Tertiary Industry and Supplementing the Secondary Industry Overstaffed administrations, applying for relief when facing a small problem, and complaining when there is no problem are important reasons why state-owned enterprises have incurred losses. When inspecting a coal mine, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji said: To make up deficits, increase profits, and free itself from its predicament, an enterprise must tap its potential, reduce its personnel, and develop a diversified economy and the tertiary industry. Shanxi's Yungang Coal Mine was engaged mainly in mining but it was overstaffed. For many years, everyone in this mine had eaten from the state's big pot. Before 1991, it incurred deficits for many consecutive years. What was to be done? It worked out the following method: It fully used the surplus personnel to develop the tertiary industry and a diversified economy and supplement the secondary industry, with the aim of making up deficits. It divided the personnel into three groups: One-third continued to carry out coal production, one-third engaged in providing service for production and life, and one-third engaged in the tertiary industry and a diversified economy. It also formed seven companies which had their own system and independent management, thus separating them from the coal mine. The surplus personnel were given jobs through various channels. After a year of practice, the coal mine began to make up deficits. The profits gained from the tertiary industry and diversified economy contributed to the coal mine's turn for the better. The Dalian Heavy Machine-Building Factory--a key enterprise in the state's heavy machine-building industry--also suffered serious losses. In making up the losses, it did not lay any of its personnel off or shift the burden to society but used its personnel, labor force, and capital in the commercial and service fields and for tertiary industrial development. This helped invigorate its dormant capital and boost the surplus personnel's initiative. The profits gained from the tertiary industry and other diversified operations amounted to 7.7 million yuan in 1992 and topped 10 million yuan in 1993. Invigorating the tertiary industry and supplementing the secondary industry are good methods for enterprises to make up deficits and increase profits. These methods have been implemented without affecting the enterprises' employees' stability or increasing social burdens. These methods have practical significance and provide us with the following enlightenment: The market economic structure is now being established. If we continue to stick to the old conventions and restrict ourselves within the limits of the secondary industry, we will have no way out. Breaking through industrial restrictions and coping with market demands can turn surplus personnel into useful assets. Macrocontrol and Regulation Enliven the Infrastructure It is undeniable that some state-owned enterprises' deficits have resulted from faults in macropolicies or ineffective macrocontrol and regulation. There are many such examples. The economic returns of some household appliance enterprises are low because there is too much duplicate manufacture and the markets are limited. So, quite a proportion of production remains idle and, due to the "bottleneck" restrictions of basic facilities and basic industries, many enterprises cannot bring their productivity into full play. About one-third of China's productivity is wasted because of power shortages or power supply restrictions. Inadequate transport facilities have caused stagnation in the transportation of raw materials from hinterland provinces and have made it impossible for coastal areas to display their processing capacity and market role. Due to funds shortages, many enterprises cannot buy raw or semifinished materials and have thus stopped their production. Last year, one-third of light industrial, textile, and chemical industrial enterprises in Chongqing City stopped production or were in a state of semi-production; and enterprises which had stopped production or were in a state of semi-production had more than 300,000 employees. Obviously, to make up these losses, the state should bring into play macrocontrol and regulation or draw up a rational macropolicy. To control investments in fixed assets and adjust the investment structure, investments should be oriented to "bottleneck" industries and enterprises' technical transformation and duplicate manufacture should be stopped. Strict control should be exercised over capital investments and the release of loans. Limited funds should be used flexibly to effectively support enterprise development. The prices of raw and semiprocessed materials should be increased appropriately. All these are indispensable for establishing a new market economic structure and promoting economic development. However, these must be processed during an appropriate period and the impetus of adjustment must be properly controlled. The state has now introduced quite a number of specially targeted policies while encouraging the development of "bottleneck" industries; it has made headway in forming the financial and taxation macrocontrol structure. This is aimed at creating conditions for state-owned enterprises to make up their deficits. Only when the state has done well in exercising macrocontrol and regulation will enterprises grow stronger and enjoy healthy and reliable development. Apart from using the above methods to make up their deficits, many enterprises, proceeding from their specific conditions, have created other methods. For example, the Tianjin No. 1 Wool Spinning Factory stopped its production for rectification; the Beijing No. 2 Wristwatch Factory transformed itself from an industrial enterprise into a commercial enterprise; the Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory introduced an integration method; the Handan Steel Corporation introduced a cost accounting system related to the market economy; Fujian carried out technical transformation; and Liaoning suspended, closed, merged, and transferred the production in loss-making enterprises. They all made remarkable advances not only in making up their deficits but also in increasing their profits. These facts suggest that, like mutual promotion and restraint between the five elements in nature, enterprises have the methods to remedy their losses. This is called "the law is stronger than the outlaws." There are many new methods for us to explore in making up deficits, such as by introducing reform, applying the market mechanism, improving management, and using science and technology.
