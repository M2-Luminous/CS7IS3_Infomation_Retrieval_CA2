FR940110-2-00098 FR940110-2-00075 Instructions for Part II_Partnership Agreement Form Partners must submit a signed Partnership Agreement Form and enclose it with the application. As indicated in 34 CFR 472.2, it is essential that the partners sign and submit this document in order for their application to be considered complete. If the agreement is retyped, the applicant should make sure that none of the wording is changed. Any changes in wording could alter the meaning of the agreement and thus render the application ineligible. Any reference in the application to an organization as a partner in the project is considered to mean a bona fide partner in the partnership who must sign the partnership agreement. If the document is not signed by all organizations identified as partners and submitted with the application or if the wording is changed and alters the meaning of the agreement, the Secretary will return the application without further consideration for funding pursuant to 34 CFR 75.216. Preference is given under this program to an application that includes one or more small businesses as a partner. For the purpose of this program, to claim a small business preference, the applicant must certify which of the partner enterprises is a small business under the Small Business Administration's Size Standards: Final and Interim Final Rules (13 CFR part 121) and furnish the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code in the Final and Interim Final Rules within which each such enterprise classifies itself.
