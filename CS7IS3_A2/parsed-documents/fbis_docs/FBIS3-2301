Jardines company secretary Neil McNamara told AFP that talks with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) for an exemption from the British colony's takeover code were still underway. But he would neither confirm nor deny whether a delisting of any or all of the six Jardines-controlled companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange might result if the exemption fails to come through. "I think it it's premature to speculate on any outcome of discussions," McNamara said. "When one discusses something with the SFC, it's preferable that it be kept confidential while the discussions are ongoing. The takeover-code issue stems from Jardines' bombshell announcement in 1984 that it would register in another British colony, Bermuda, before Hong Kong is returned to China in 1997. It now wants to be subject exclusively to Bermuda's takeover code when it takes effect in July this year -- thus avoiding the legal uncertainties of a post-1997 Hong Kong. In particular, the Bermuda code would allow Jardines to resist a hostile takeover attempt in the Bermuda courts and, in the case of a final appeal, to the Privy Council in London. "It's a preference to be regulated under the British corporate system," McNamara said. "That's been said before." Hong Kong's EASTERN EXPRESS newspaper, without quoting sources, said Tuesday that Jardines' board would discuss this week whether to delist in Hong Kong -- a move that could wipe off 6.7 percent of the market's capitalization. The report had little effect on the price of Jardines' flagship stock, Jardine Matheson (Holdings) Ltd., which in afternoon trading was up 50 cents at 66 Hong Kong dollars (8.51 US). The Jardines stable is to announce 1993 results over a one- week period that begins March 17 with Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd. The SFC declined to comment in detail on its talks with Jardines, besides stating that the Hong Kong takeover code still applies to the group. "Our over-riding principle is to seek to protect the interest of investors and to maintain the credibility of Hong Kong as an international financial center," an SFC spokesman added. There was also no comment from stock exchange's listings division, which requires 90 days' notice of any delisting. Founded by two Scots in 1832 to sell Indian opium to China, Jardines remains Hong Kong's most pervasive conglomerate, involved in almost every sector from real estate and stockbroking to supermarkets and parking lots. China has made no secret of its distaste for Jardines. Besides occasionally harping on its opium-trading origins, it has lashed out at its biggest shareholder, the Keswick family, for supporting Governor Chris Patten's efforts to introduce more democracy in Hong Kong before 1997. The last time Jardines faced a hostile takeover was in May 1988, when four tycoons led by Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. chairman Li Ka- shing -- who enjoys privileged access to Beijing's communist leaders -- moved in on Hongkong Land. They succeeded in acquring eight percent before Li agreed not to pounce on any Jardines company for seven years -- a period that expires in April 1995. Besides Jardine Matheson (Holdings) and Dairy Farm, other listed Jardine companies are Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd., Jardine International Motor Holdings Ltd., Mandarin Oriental International Ltd. and Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd.
