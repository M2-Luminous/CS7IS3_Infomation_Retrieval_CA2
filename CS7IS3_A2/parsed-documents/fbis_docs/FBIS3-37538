This is based on certificates of inspection issued by the defense forces headquarters on 1 and 16 February. The Riigikogu state defense commission cannot accept the defective weapons which arrived as part of the arms deal, as a gift to the Republic of Estonia. This is what a statement says, signed by both Rein Helme, chairman of the Riigikogu state defense commission, and his deputy Peeter Lorents. The statement was released after the commission's closed sitting today. The sitting heard explanations from Foreign Minister Juri Luik, Defense Minister Indrek Kannik, and Defense Forces Commander Aleksandr Einseln and discussed assessments made by experts at the defense forces' headquarters. State Secretary Ulo Kaevats had provided his explanations in writing. The Estonian Government concluded an arms deal with TAAS Israeli Industries Ltd on 7 January of last year and the Riigikogu ratified it on 15 December. According to the agreement, the TAAS firm pledges to sell to Estonia various defense products and services. The arms deal contract stipulates that the Israeli TAAS firm guarantees the reliability of the products and effectiveness of materials. The total arms deal amounts to over 49 million U.S. dollars, over 680 million Estonian kroons, and Estonia is to pay this amount in (?eight) installments.
