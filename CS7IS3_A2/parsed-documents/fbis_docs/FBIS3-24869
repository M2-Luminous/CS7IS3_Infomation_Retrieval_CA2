The declaration was issued by the Portuguese Foreign Ministry: The Angolan Government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] have agreed on principles which will govern UNITA's participation in the Angolan national police. This agreement constitutes an important success for peace in Angola. Although the government and UNITA had genuine concerns on this issue at the beginning, both sides continued with their efforts in good faith to find mutually acceptable solutions, thus demonstrating their political desire to bring peace to Angola. A lot has already been achieved in Lusaka. The government and UNITA have reached agreements on various difficult and complex issues, including the restablishment of a verifiable cease-fire, the confinement and disarmament of UNITA military forces, the conclusion of the training of the Angolan Armed Forces, and the integration of demobilized troops into civilain society. The present agreement on police issues means that both sides have overcome another important landmark toward a just and lasting peace. The government and UNITA have now begun to debate national reconciliation and it is our belief that they will be able to carry out this task with the same political courage and the same spirit and consensus needed to reach an agreement. The peace process, which began in Bicesse and which people--particularly the Angolan people--have awaited for so long, has now started to become a reality. Thus, we call on all parties to exercise maximun restraint, taking into account what has already been achieved in Lusaka and to halt all military activities because they can undermine the hopes of the Angolan people and the international community concerning the establishment of peace in Angola. There is no military solution for the Angolan problem. We believe the time has come to consider measures which will translate the true progress achieved in Lusaka into a lasting peace in Angola. Although the principal responsibility for peace rests with UNITA and the government, the international community has an important role to play in supporting the maintenance of peace and in responding to the many humanitarian needs facing Angola. It is our hope and conviction that working jointly, we shall finally be able to bring the reward of peace to the Angolan people.
