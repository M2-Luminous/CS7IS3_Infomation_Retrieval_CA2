The center said the infected person is around 20 years old, a seaman, who got infected through sexual contact abroad. The man has a family whose members are not infected. The center said 5 HIV-positive persons registered in Lithuania earlier already have AIDS. Children were born to two AIDS carriers. No presence of the AIDS virus was found in the children although the conception occurred when the parents were already infected. Four out of 21 registered AIDS-infected people already died, but AIDS was the cause of death only in two cases. Experts say that each HIV-positive person is surrounded by some 50 to 100 potential AIDS carriers, therefore the number of people infected with AIDS in Lithuania may be greater than indicated by official statistics.
