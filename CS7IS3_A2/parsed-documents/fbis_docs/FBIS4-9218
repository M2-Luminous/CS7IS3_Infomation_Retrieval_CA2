"We cannot add a (politically) unstable country to (those multi-national organizations)," Dienstbier said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. Russia, if it becomes a member of those organizations, will not work as reinforcing security in Europe, but rather will become a disturbing factor, he said. Dienstbier is in Japan to attend a symposium cosponsored by the United Nations University and a non-governmental organization. Pointing out that there is danger of a revival of a policy favoring great powers in Russia, the Czech Republic will continue monitoring movements toward democracy under the regime of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic became independent states with the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia Federation in January 1993 following the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991. The former Warsaw Pact nations led by the former Soviet Union invaded the Czechoslovakian capital of Prague in 1968 to crush a reform movement there. In August 1993, Yeltsin flew to Prague, now the Czech capital, to sign friendship treaties with Czech and Slovak counterparts, but neither of treaty includes a direct apology for the 1968 invasion. Dienstbier served as foreign minister for the former Czechoslovakia from December 1989 to June 1992. He said the republic will keep a close watch on how Russia will establish relations with other former Soviet republics as a test case to see its policy toward the middle European nations. On Czech politics, he predicted that people will voice opposition to the present government led by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus in the expected election of the upper senate chamber within this year. On relations with the Slovak Republic, he said it is possible for the two republics to unite again in line with expansion of a unification of European nations.
