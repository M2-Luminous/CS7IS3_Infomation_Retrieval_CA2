The centre, an independent research and information U.S. based group monitoring all 220 countries and regions of the world, said both China and India have entered into an irreversible process of absolute economic progress bringing a greater quality of life for its citizens. It said both India and China have great potential in exploring the economic exchanges together. So far bilateral trade between the two countries is still low, diplomats in the Chinese Embassy said. Their bilateral trade in 1993 amounted to 670 million U.S. dollars in India's favour. The report said India's present export growing speed of an average 20 percent will enable it to reach over 90 billion dollars in next six years and the imports are poised to grow at an equal speed. It said the Chinese exports, at the present growth rate, will cross 200 billion U.S. dollar mark in six years, adding that when combined with Hong Kong's, the exports will be well over 425 billion dollars. The bilateral trade will not only create huge and unprecedented opportunities for both countries' businesses and investors, but also bring about a greater economic and geo-political stability in the region, the report said.
