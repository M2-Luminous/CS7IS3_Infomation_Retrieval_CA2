The maintenance of political stability as it has been in the past has become a prerequisite for ensuring success in the renovation process. Political stability is also an essential factor in broadening international relations and attracting foreign investment capital. Political stability prevents people from losing confidence in the party and state. The past few years have seen changes for the better in the organization and mode of operations of the party and state. Political and social organizations have developed in a more diversified fashion and their social character and dynamism have increased. The process of democratization has been initiated within the party and in society. Democracy has become more lively in political, cultural, and ideological activities. The roles of the National Assembly, various mass organizations, and the mass media have increased sharply. Without our economic renovation achievements, the aforementioned achievements would have been impossible. Recent achievements in economic renovation have emerged as the most prominent ones. It is because of economic renovation that we have maintained political stability and renovated our political system in accordance with economic development requirements. Our achievements in maintaining political stability and renovating the political system are the result not only of economic renovation, but of other important factors as well: -- The role of various factors in the political system, especially the role of our party, which has been quick to come up with a correct renovation policy that suits the objective reality and meets the aspirations of the masses, and which knows how to undertake renovation in accordance with principles and appropriate steps. -- Our people and our nation have a tradition of following the party. They voluntarily recognize party leadership. They do not want political instability or the collapse of the socialist regime. All of our people desire political stability so they can "earn their living," achieve economic development, and improve their livelihood. They do not want political pluralism or multiparty opposition, as this will only create social disturbances. -- Our Army and security forces are also loyal to the party and the people. They have a lot of experience in defending the fatherland and maintaining political security, public order, and safety. They are taking the initiative in effectively fighting attempts at "peaceful evolution" by hostile forces. In addition to the achievements we have already made, there are many issues yet to be tackled: -- Recent economic achievements have only been preliminary. The market economy has just taken shape. Efforts to set a socialist course for the market economy are still uncertain and unclear, both in theory and practice. There is no way that the development of the market economy and the multisector economy can avoid creating an impact on the social and class structure, thereby affecting the political system. It is likely to create new complications in the political field. In addition, hostile forces are exploiting our effort to open ourselves economically and culturally to carry out sabotage activities aimed at creating political instability conducive to a change in our political course. -- Our state's ability to regulate and manage the market economy is still poor and weak, thus creating occasional confusion in the socioeconomic situation and encouraging activities that violate the law and good ethics (including tax evasion, production of fake goods, embezzlement, smuggling, and so forth). This only benefits opportunists and speculators who work hand-in-glove with degenerate officials in various state agencies. It should be noted that this is the main cause of corruption and smuggling. -- A segment of our people -- including cadres, party members, and especially our youth -- have not firmly grasped the real concept of the socialist ideal and orientation. -- Renovation in the organization and activities of the party, state, and mass organizations has not been effective. Likewise, renovation of the political system has not paralleled that of the economic domain, especially the strengthening of organizations and mechanisms. It can be said that bureaucratism and cumbersomeness are still prevalent in our state apparatuses. Our legal system is still poor and inconsistent, while law enforcement is carried out loosely, thus encouraging violations of laws and regulations. -- Our party activities to promote the market economy are inconsistent, while many issues related to the building of a law-governed state have not been resolved. The working mechanism designed to delegate authority and define duties and responsibilities between the law-building, law enforcement, and administrative agencies in the market economic system has not been fully established. -- A number of adverse factors have emerged that may cause political instability and promote the schemes of "peaceful evolution," sabotage, rebellion, and overthrow being carried out by reactionary forces at home and abroad. We should not belittle these factors. Instead, we should carefully study their complexity, dangers, and consequences in order to formulate active measures to prevent, overcome, and stop them. Through our efforts to maintain political stability and renovate our political system in past years, we have drawn on some experiences and deem it necessary to carry out the following tasks: 1. Resolutely maintain party leadership while renovating party activities; reject political pluralism and the multiparty system, because this will allow the enemies of the class struggle to have a chance to compete with our party, thereby causing political instability and rebellion against our system. 2. Strive to combine correctly the economic renovation task with that of renovating the political system, taking the former as the main task. 3. Continue to take economic renovation as a basis for developing the economy and resolving various pressing problems in people's daily lives. Through these tasks, we will be able to restore people's confidence in the party while promoting ideological and psychological work. 4. Strive to resolve various social issues to create healthy social conditions for renovating and stabilizing the political system. To attain this goal, we must strive to: overcome promptly such pressing problems as corruption and smuggling; prevent decadent culture from coming into our country in various forms; oppose social injustice; create more jobs for the people; narrow the gap between rich and poor; settle the land problem in the countryside satisfactorily to prevent "serious causes" that may create social conflict; strengthen vigilance against the "peaceful evolution" scheme; and foil resolutely all sabotage and rebellious activities by reactionary forces at home and abroad.
