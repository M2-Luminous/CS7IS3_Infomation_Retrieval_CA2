The Time Has Come To Climb Down From the Tanks and To Work Normally"] [Text] When things are going badly in the country, and the ruling party leads the economy and social relations into a dead end, the people suffer national humiliation, and a considerable part of the voters rush into the arms of extreme rightists or leftists. Such is the long-standing law of political life and, while this has happened here for the first time, this is still not a reason for hysterics. As went the politics (and there were warnings about this more than once), so went the results of the elections. In the course of two years, after the victory over the putsch, which, it would seem, opened unprecedented prospects for social progress, the country went downhill faster and faster, and at the same time the process became more and more unmanageable. I got the firm impression that over the last year the higher leadership and its immediate circle, and the executive and legislative authorities of the economy, almost stopped working completely on other substantive matters and switched over to political confrontations. They followed one after the other, right up to the culmination--the dissolution of parliament, street fights, the tank firing on the White House, and the December elections. Elections that, according to the party rolls, brought success to V. Zhirinovskiy--an extreme nationalist--which stunned the people, but if we speak in the vernacular--it brought success to the fascists. (It would be interesting to know who from his close circle contrived to convince the president that, despite the worsening economic decline, crime, corruption, and general desolation, he and his supporters would absolutely win in the parliamentary elections, and whether these liars and sycophants are still in his retinue?) For me, the events of December 1993 proved to be, perhaps, especially impressive--over the period of my life I have seen the successful movement of fascism to power for a second time already. (It happened that I lived with my parents in Germany, who were there on official business from 1930 to 1935; I saw a lot, and, naturally I heard a lot, and I understood quite a lot, for my 13 years, in this highly politicized situation. I understood, in particular, how horrible crimes are committed under the cloak of lofty words, and that even highly placed politicians commit fatal mistakes and stupidities out of hand. I understood how even an ordinary citizen who is good-natured in his personal life is transformed into a fanatic, with eyes that are glazed over with zeal, who is ready for any crimes in the service of the fuhrer, and how this then leads step by step to bloody slaughter. It also did not bypass my generation, including me personally. On the eve of fascism in Germany, an economic crisis was raging, as it is here now also; the majority was destitute, a handful of rich men was bursting with wealth, the authority of the leadership was rapidly falling, the people were suffering from poverty and from national humiliation, the politicians were bogged down in a struggle for power and in a game of brute instincts, inflaming the nationalism of the lumpenized layer of the population.) I shudder inside thinking that I will have occasion to see all of this and, what is more, to live through it a second time. I am somehow not reassured by talk that, it is said, after a final vote count Zhirinovsky does not have a relative majority in the Duma and in general has nobody in the Federation Council. This is self-deception, and an attempt to conceal the main point. And it consists in the fact that numerous mistakes and a thoughtless and untalented policy has led to the fact that fascism has appeared among us, which today already has become an appreciable political force that has acquired not only millions of supporters among the voters, but also support (or at least the sympathy) in important state structures, foreign ties, and important sources of financing inside the country and, perhaps, abroad as well. This is an event that is radically changing the political landscape and the political climate in the country. It also has an appreciable influence on our international position and on the attitude toward us in the world. We are again becoming a source of international danger for others, or, at a minimum, a pretext for someone to retain nuclear weapons and for someone, nevertheless, to squeeze into NATO. And many have refused, or will refuse at least some of the already planned reductions in military expenditures. In short, we have gotten ourselves into a mess along all lines. Only a blind man could fail to see all of this. And it will hardly be possible to shake up this change even after the replacement of the leadership of Ostankino. I am somehow also not reassured by positive statements that Zhirinovskiy will get on with Yeltsin beautifully--if this occurs, this means that I (like a majority of the others) erred severely either in Vladimir Volfovich or in Boris Nikolayevich. The situation is being complicated by the fact that the Communist Party, and the Agrarian Union (the other pole of the political spectrum that is getting stronger), which has joined it, have not yet made a determination on a fundamental question--whether they will be leftist or rightist parties. I personally think that besides a move toward a social-democratic platform, that they have no independent political future, but they, after all, might judge entirely differently. A lot has already been written on the subject of the elections and Zhirinovskiy, and I would not like to repeat myself, including the fact that, as I surmised, in spite of his personal desires, Gaydar, his team, his benefactors, and his economic policy have become the godfather of our homegrown fascism. Therefore, I will turn to the answer to the question raised in the headline. I am profoundly convinced that we are not doomed to fascism. There is a solution. It lies in the unity of all democratic forces and in a broad democratic coalition. (Somehow it turned out in previous years that our "primary" democrats in a purely Bolshevist way beat on potential allies most zealously of all, almost not touching their most bitter enemies.) But only a sincere, really honest, and a mandatory public admission of the mistakes made in the two years can become the condition for such a unity and coalition (otherwise nobody will believe anybody). And, moreover, unity on a new radically revised platform--economic and political (unity and coalition are otherwise inconceivable)--none of the sensible economists will agree to participate in a continuation of the ruinous monetarist experiments of Gaydar, Boris Fedorov, and Jeffrey Sachs). With respect to economics, not being a professional, I will limit myself to only several passing remarks. Can it really be that difficult, if this is really desired, to gain an understanding of these price spirals and impetuous grabbing, and to set up a barrier against depredation, irresponsibility, and sometimes even simply stupidity. And to conduct intelligent measures (but again not requisition measures, but with the help of taxes, privileges, the removal of excessive rights of officials, and privatization somewhere, and so on) that are able to bring life to a civilized form, when we would be able to do everything in full view of the people, not allow anyone to produce [as published] and at least more or less specifically, but without deceit and demagogy, establish dates when the situation will begin to improve. It is necessary to see clearly that the solution to the crisis does not lie in a monetarist focus, but in a growth in production--but this is precisely where almost nothing in fact was done. A revision of the tax system is necessary so that it does not impede production, but encourages it, and a system for extending credits and a broader and more sensible involvement of foreign investments. We should not encourage laziness in the domestic producer who hopes as before to live without being in a hurry and exerting himself, owing to the fact that, as before, he will fleece his consumer. It is necessary to protect oneself from foreign competition on a scale that is reasonable and advantageous to the country, without losing sight of the fact that the ultimate objective will be the widest possible free trade. Otherwise, we will die as suppliers of raw materials. A well-thought-out industrial policy is needed (a kind of elaboration of this has been started), as well as a system of measures that will bring a real revolution in agriculture. Today, in this transition period to a market, the government, the state, and local authorities must in this sense rely not on the "invisible hand" of Adam Smith, which, it is said, will do everything itself under price liberalization, but to work by the sweat of the brow, as is being done in South Korea, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, and other countries where there is a serious resolve to forge ahead. I will not write anymore about economics--I am confident that the subject has been adequately developed by G. Yavlinskiy, N. Petrakov, O. Bogomolov, and also the department of economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, to which in these two years, unfortunately, no one found the time to listen. I heard with hope that recently the prime minister and his deputies are beginning to incline to the side of a true economic policy. But I will talk about social programs in more detail. In many of them during the Bolshevist years that we are damning (frequently for a reason), we nevertheless set an example for the developed world. But now we are shamefully going back--in education, in health services, and in people's access to culture. In contrast to many countries of the West, property polarization is taking place, and together with it--a dangerous social tension (also a feeding ground for fascism). Previously, the privileges of the leadership were concealed (with which, judging by his recent television interview, the president reconciled himself), and now--even its pay. You learn with amazement that the director of an average-sized plant can set a salary for himself of a couple and even dozens of millions of rubles a month. Any transparency has been deliberately covered here. As for the "lower levels," it would seem that not even an objective is being established to create a decent subsistence minimum for current conditions, guaranteed humane living conditions for old age and disability, and even for burials that are worthy of a person, and not for cattle dying on the roadside. Transportation, communications, and other services have become luxury items that are accessible only to the wealthiest, without any justification. Rents in the city are increasing astronomically, and many cities, nonetheless, are falling into decay. It is nonetheless impossible to compel the government to analyze this ratcheting of prices and unrestrained inflation in the whole system and to set a barrier against depredation, irresponsibility, and sometimes also simple stupidity, but to implement intelligent measures (again not requisition measures, but with the help of taxes, privileges, withdrawal of excessive rights of officials, somewhere privatization, and so on) that are capable of arranging life in a civilized form, when we would be able to do everything in full view of the people, not permit anyone to be arbitrary, and more or less specifically, but without deceit and demagogy, to establish dates when the situation will begin to improve. I want to say something about policy. First about domestic policy. A little more than two years were actually lost, despite the unique conditions that developed after the defeat of the putsch (in the sense of the development of democracy). If anyone thinks that the Constitution, which was adopted without the consideration of a fourth of the voters, is democratic and legitimate--this is a dubious proposition. In order to make it such, we will probably have to do a lot of sweating yet. But what is to be said about the much-promised, but already forgotten, legal reform that would guarantee life for every one of us in a genuine rule-of-law state? Which implies both democratism of the legal process and an inexorable struggle with crime and corruption--without the latter we will have neither a normal economy nor simply a normal life. Putting political life in good order, of course, will require a lot of other things. I will restrict myself simply to naming them in some degree. Normal political parties must finally appear, with clear political platforms. A much improved election law, which was not concocted in a slapdash way, is needed. I am not talking now about such great tasks for us as a rational system of relations of the center, regions, and local self-government. As well as a normally working parliament and government that are smaller in number, but better in ability. The time has come to climb down from the tanks and engage in professional and normal work honestly and diligently every day. Now about foreign policy. Whether we like it or not, Russia will remain a great power. And it cannot get away from its share of responsibility (of course, together with other powers) for international affairs, including for the very important and very responsible task of restructuring the entire system of international relations after the end of the Cold War, for the creation of regional security systems, especially in regions contiguous to us--in Europe, in southern and eastern Asia, in the northern part of the Pacific Ocean, and for the demilitarization of international relations. We played a decisive role in stopping the Cold War, we organized cooperation with the major countries of the world, and we can resolve these problems. Not assenting to the West in everything, of course, displaying will and persistence, and when necessary--initiative as well. It is necessary, it is true, to react quickly and with adequate resolve to the irresponsible twaddle of some of the Russian politicians who are appearing in the arena--given all of its foolishness, this political idle talk could do considerable damage to Russia's national interests. We still do not have a well-balanced concept nor a consistent policy in countries of the so-called near abroad--but, after all, this is our main priority today. Russia, perhaps, is the only one of the former republics of the USSR that can both "exist by itself" and even prosper, ensuring its own security, normal economic activity, and even a certain increase in the standard of living of the people (if, of course, the plundering of national property is stopped). However, everything is possible in a friendly environment! In a hostile one, it will be even more difficult for great Russia to live than in the Cold War years. The former Soviet Union was born out of an empire, and for a long time it was a totalitarian empire itself, which made it intolerable even for Russia, which declared its own sovereignty in 1990. The other republics felt the yoke of imperial oppression even more. We, like they, have a vital need of normal relations. One of the conditions is for us, Russians, to convince our neighbors that Russia has no kinds of imperial claims with respect to them, and to convince them not with words (who believes words today!), but with deeds. Then, the natural tendencies toward integration will begin to work in full force, as they began to work after the Second World War in Western Europe. And out of something that is illusory and neutral, the CIS will become a reality, ensuring the mutual interests of economic development, security, and cultural and human relations, with the full stability of independent states. And it is entirely impermissible to make up for obsequiousness to the West with pressure, and even rudeness, with respect to our neighbors. To sacrifice the prospect of improving relations and a genuine alliance with them for the sake of being witty about Crimea, and in order to be reputed to be a jingo patriot, is unworthy of every true patriot of Russia. And, finally--every nation (and its leader as well) should imagine how it wants to see its future and its objectives. The replacement of the "developed structure of socialism" by the "developed structure of capitalism," for heaven's sake, does not accomplish this task. Every Russian--both the ordinary citizen and the leader--wants to know, and has a right to know, where we are heading today. The democratic coalition should explain this to him truthfully, simply, and clearly. Especially because there is a good future before our country, if its people work honestly and manage the affairs of state skillfully. Few other states have such natural and intellectual resources, and such cultural, industrial, and agricultural potential. The matter today really lies in proper policy and leadership, and first and foremost in them. This is the most reliable antidote against fascism. Somehow, no one has yet gone from a normal, good life to fascism.
