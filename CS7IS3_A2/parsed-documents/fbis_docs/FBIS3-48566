The motion, submitted last December by the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was rejected at an upper house plenary session by a vote of 130 against and 106 for. Some members of ruling Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ] were expected to support the motion, but they voted against it or were absent from the vote, resulting in the rejection. Several SDP members played a key role in voting down government- proposed political reform bills last Friday, refusing to obey the party leadership and joining the opposition in voting against the bills. A censure motion was last cast in June 1992 against Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in connection with the nation's cooperation in U.N. peacekeeping operations. That motion was also voted down. The LDP cast censure motions against Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Hata and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata last December after the government accepted a proposal to partially open Japan's markets to foreign-made rice. The proposal was made as part of final negotiations in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). It calls for Japan to open 4 to 8 percent of its domestic rice market as "minimum access" for imports in exchange for a six-year moratorium for replacing all import restrictions with tariffs. The upper house had delayed deliberation on the motions to concentrate on political reform bills. It did not take a vote on the motion against the foreign minister.
