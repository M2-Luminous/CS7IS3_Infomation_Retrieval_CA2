"Foreign hegemonic leaders and their domestic lackeys are spreading again reports on the danger of dictatorship, that the premier is not bearable for abroad and for the `sobered-up' society and that he is allegedly unbearable even for the Hungarian partners, that the situation demands a complaisant and servile `expert' government which would `listen' more to the great-Hungarian and Czechoslovakist advice," Huska says. "It contradicts the Czech interests because (the current Slovak Government) does not want to accept the forged balance of the Czechoslovak State Bank which made Slovakia a debtor instead of creditor. The attack on the inconvenient government is also a punishment for the fact that we dared to emancipate ourselves," he states. According to Huska, "the great power vacuum awakened the egoistic ambitions of our southern neighbor. It is blindly striding towards the vision of at first a `mid-sized' and then a Great Hungary. Should we create because of these unruly interests a less resistant government?" "The American senators and congressmen for the Democratic Party told us openly in early December that the only reasonable policy is not to comply with foreign hunger for territory, it is a radical, unyielding, transformation-minded government which defends the interests of the Slovak society. They told us that when up against foreign interests, the most successful and efficient are unyielding and incorruptible authorities," Huska claims. "The stability of the Slovak Government system is the supreme priority of our freedom, it means more than anything else for us," Huska concludes.
