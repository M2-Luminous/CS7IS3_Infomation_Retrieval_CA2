The ministers also reaffirmed support for signing a partnership agreement with the former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia. Deputy Greek Economy Minister Ioannis Papandoniou, presenting results of the meeting, acknowledged that: "These past weeks, economic evolution in Russia raises certain questions." Reformers recently quit the new conservative government in Moscow, throwing into doubt the future of free-market reforms initiated by President Boris Yeltsin. But Brittan, European Commissioner in charge of trade policy, said: "95 percent" of the problems over the accord with Russia have been resolved. Although issues to do with trade in nuclear products and financial aid still remained outstanding, he said, the Commission would do as much as possible to finalize negotiations. Brittan said the decision to support an agreement with Slovenia was of "capital importance" and sent an important signal to other ex-Yugoslav republics. The Council also backed signing a free-trade agreement with the Baltic countries "with an eye to a future association agreement," Papandoniou said.
