Michio Watanabe's [former deputy prime minister and foreign minister] home camp, the Watanabe faction, was like a hornet's nest from the morning of 24 February. At a meeting of faction officials in the morning, Bunmei Ibuki, a close associate of Watanabe, was indignant. He exclaimed: "If he is going to cooperate with Prime Minister Hosokawa, I am going to leave the LDP and form a new party." Watanabe faction officials were bombarded with inquiries about the truth of the reported meeting. Antipathy to Watanabe surged inside the LDP in the belief that the reported top secret meeting "demonstrates the close relation between Mr. Watanabe and the Hosokawa administration through his intimate links with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa." LDP leaders were critical, saying: "Mr. Watanabe should take into consideration his position in the party in what he does." Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of LDP Political Reform Headquarters, spoke to a general meeting of the Mitsuzuka faction on the same day. He said: "Right now, we should act consistently as an opposition party. It is important to proceed by taking into account the overall situation." Mitsuzuka also told reporters: "This is a critical period for Mr. Watanabe. I believe he will act maturely." He offered this comment to preempt possible action on the part of Watanabe. Meanwhile, Watanabe flatly denied reports of the meeting with the prime minister, calling it "an illusory meeting." At the general meeting of his faction at noon on 24 February, Watanabe said: "There is nothing wrong with the No. 1 party, the LDP, exercising a certain measure of influence over the administration." His comments argued the case for the importance of unity in national politics. However, he said emphatically: "It is completely improbable that I would split the party, or leave you all to join the cabinet." There is strong speculation in the LDP the meeting is evidence that "Prime Minister Hosokawa aims to bring Mr. Watanabe into the cabinet; he is sounding him out about the post of deputy prime minister or finance minister." It is believed that Watanabe does not actually plan to join the cabinet, but by agreeing to meet with the prime minister, "he intends to demonstrate his powerful political influence." However, according to a Watanabe faction official, Watanabe did not act entirely innocently at the faction's general meeting. He reported Watanabe as saying: "Now you all know my worth." However, it is also true that this reported secret meeting with the "enemy's commander" -- Prime Minister Hosokawa -- represents a serious setback to "calls for Michi's [Michio Watanabe] leadership," which have been quite prevalent among the electoral reform-shy factions in the LDP. At a time when there are persistent rumors of a "new Watanabe party" to be formed through cooperation between Ozawa and Watanabe in anticipation of the political realignment expected after the implementation of political reforms, the Watanabe faction is deeply concerned "this has given rise to unnecessary suspicions, and added fuel to rumors about the formation of a new party." Many believe, "this does not do any good at all for Mr. Watanabe."
