S. Koltunov, S. M. Baranov, and T. P. Zharova; UDC 545.799.3] [Abstract] In previous study [cf. 937M0174G] of the reaction kinetics of Np(VI) with isopropylhydrazine it was demonstrated the reactivity of the latter lies somewhere between that of hydrazine and ethylhydrazine, depending on the corresponding dampening of the positive inductive effect in the series methyl- ethyl-propyl. The present work is a further study of the relationship between reactivity and induction effect of the radical substituent in the hydrazine molecule, using ter- butylhydrazine. The reaction rate constant is 518 mole[.sup]0.1[/]/liter[.sup]0.1[/]min. at 25� C and ionic strength � = 2. Activation energy and entropy are E = 61 kJ/mole and �S[.sup]*[/] = 60 J/moleK. A correlation was found to exist between the Np(VI)-hydrazine reaction rate constant and the Taft induction constant. Figure 1; references 14: 11 Russian, 3 Western.
