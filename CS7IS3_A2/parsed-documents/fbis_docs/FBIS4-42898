Shortly before the elections, the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] presented its own candidate: SPOe caucus leader Peter Ambrozy. The SPOe, fulfilling the condition imposed earlier by FPOe Chairman Joerg Haider [that the SPOe, as the party with the highest number of votes, must present the proposal to elect Zernatto], presented Zernatto as its candidate for governor. The FPOe supports the principle that the party with the most votes should provide the head of government, FPOe caucus leader Martin Strutz said, justifying the FPOe's election proposal. After an interruption in the meeting, Ambrozy himself made it clear that he is not available as a candidate. He called himself one of the builders of the SPOe-OeVP coalition; therefore, he will abide by this agreement and exercise his personal right to renounce running for governor. Christof Zernatto was elected provincial governor with 20 of the 36 votes cast. On 13 ballots -- as many as the FPOe has seats in the Landtag -- the name "Ambrozy" was written; three votes were invalid. Michael Ausserwinkler, Dietfried Haller (both SPOe), and Robert Lutschounig (OeVP) were sworn in as new government members. Karin Achatz (SPOe), Joerg Freunschlag, and Mathias Reichold (both FPOe) were already members of the Carinthian land government during the previous legislative period. In his government statement, Zernatto noted that all three political parties have made mistakes over the past three weeks, and this has confirmed one argument: Carinthia needs political unity more than ever before. Therefore, confidence-building measures should be implemented step by step.
