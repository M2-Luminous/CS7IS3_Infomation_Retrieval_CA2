This indicates that the U.S. nuclear policy toward North Korea has changed considerably, which attracts the people's attention. Such a position by the U.S. Government has been disclosed on many occasions, but it did not attract attention because it was expressed ambiguously. Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of State, has recently expressed the U.S. position clearly and concretely. The U.S. Government has clearly expressed its position opposing the replacement of fuel rods at North Korean nuclear reactors because, although the United States has been continuing negotiations with North Korea for the past ten months to freeze North Korea's nuclear development, it believes North Korea would continue developing nuclear weapons. Therefore, it seems the United States has decided to prevent North Korea from replacing fuel rods in order to block its nuclear development. After the second round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks in Geneva on 19 July 1993, Robert Gallucci said that he would oppose North Korea's extraction of plutonium. Also, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry recently said that we must not allow North Korea to extract plutonium again by replacing nuclear fuel at the nuclear reactors. In U.S.-North Korean unofficial contacts slated for either 28 or 29 April in New York, the U.S. Government is likely to convey its position to North Korea that it withdraws the demand for the exchange of special envoys between the North and South, and that it opposes North Korea's replacing fuel rods at its nuclear reactors. It is very significant militarily that the United States has informed North Korea of its intention to oppose the replacing of fuel rods at nuclear reactors. When nuclear fuel is replaced, the operation of the nuclear reactors are suspended. After the reactor core cools down, the used fuel is removed when the fuel rods are replaced. The United States has so far considered carrying out a preventive strike against North Korean nuclear facilities if its diplomatic efforts to settle the nuclear issue fail, but has stated that there are many difficulties because a strike against active nuclear reactors would cause the vast proliferation of radiation.
