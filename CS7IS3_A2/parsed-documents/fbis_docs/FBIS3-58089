The ground-breaking work had already been done, and one was considered a progressive if one accepted the results. The supporters of Taisto Sinisalo (the Stalinists) took care of the movement's details, as they had seized the initiative in the civil war raging within the Communist Party. The struggle over administrative control of the universities yielded a feel for the practical side of the revolution. Many a middle-class youth briefly thrust himself into the front lines of the revolution, became frustrated and withdrew, and today reminisces over these days, either with humor or wistful longing. But not Pekka Tiainen. His story was different, because he was more diligent than the others. Vietnam and Das Kapital Pekka Tiainen's father was the head of Savonlinna's Telephone Company and represented the Conservative Party as a city councilman, and his mother was a registered nurse. The atmosphere in their home was described as open and liberal. As a young man, Tiainen was interested in chess, athletics, and hiking. There were some Social Democratic and Conservative youth groups in the school, but the other students laughed at them behind their backs. Matters took a different turn in 1965, when the United States started to bomb North Vietnam. U.S. imperialism was soon condemned at the Savonlinna Upper Secondary School. At the same time, communism, which previously had been taboo, became a subject of interest. The goings-on evoked an interest within Tiainen to know more. Before matriculating at the University of Helsinki, he had waded through Allardt's book, Sociology, and he had also familiarized himself with Marx's Das Kapital, which was a book that many a good Marxist never had the energy to peruse. During the summers, Tiainen had also traveled in Europe. The nights spent on the dirt floor of the subway construction site in Munich, in the company of foreign workers, introduced him to the life of the proletariat. Ideology and Practice At the university, Tiainen realized that his opinions coincided with the views of the communists on various matters. Almost immediately, he joined the Academic Socialist Association. In connection with the support collections during the strike winter of 1971, Tiainen saw how the intelligentsia could join forces with the working class at the front lines of the struggle, and in the summer of that year, he joined the Viisikulma Section of the Communist Party. The student communes in that part of the city ensured a Stalinist majority in the section. Of the Stalinist students, some focused on the revolution, others on changing scientific research according to Marxist dogma, while some others concentrated on their studies. Tiainen had all three impulses. He was both a diligent study group member and an energetic party activist, as well as a conscientious student. Tiainen did not become a front-line scientist, but neither did he become a Stalinist dogmatic, nor a political organization leader. Instead of taking part in the struggle between political factions, he was interested in the economy, and such a man is of limited use in a war. Tiainen's best period as a member of the Communist Party came about 20 years ago, when, based on demands voiced by the Communist Party in the USSR, an attempt was made to join the warring factions together. While preparing economic and employment policy analyses for the party, Tiainen tried to find issues that the factions agreed on and avoided controversial subjects. Everybody acknowledged Tiainen's contributions. Major and Minor Issues As a member of the feisty Communist Workers' Party, Tiainen is now one of the last real Leninists. He is not driven by an unquenchable revolutionary zeal. When asked, he certainly supports the revolution, but he prefers to talk about his bailiwick, the economy, and avoids Marxist argot. The election campaign is conducted under the auspices of the Potemkin village organization, "The Popular Front Against the EC." During the campaign, Tiainen's speeches have been lacking in vision, as his vision is socialism, a subject he prefers to avoid. Tiainen's membership in the last group of Leninists is due to his perseverance and serious nature. These are his basic character traits. After deciding to become a Leninist, he never changed his mind, even after nations crumbled, but would rather be the last Leninist. It is unavoidable for such a person to end up in the minority within the minority, especially when he always ends up defending the right of each minority to remain with the organization. One is hard-pressed to consider Tiainen's political career as an indication of any particular talent as a statesman. On the other hand, Tiainen has finally been able to achieve a role of political leadership within the Communist Workers' Party. In other organizations, the comrades soon realized that, in his vision, he, in spite of his perseverance and seriousness, has difficulties in separating major and minor issues from each other. This third basic character trait was well known by the Vantaa Municipal Council, where it is told that the meeting hall became empty each time Tiainen stepped to the rostrum. This can also be gleaned from his curriculum vitae, distributed for the presidential campaign, which, in its 13 pages, contains everything, including data processing extension courses. Tiainen's characteristics have been useful in his research work. His analyses have been met with uniform praise, as they do not omit a single point of view. But if one attempts to see the larger picture, it is deleterious even for a researcher to get bogged down in details. Tiainen's doctoral thesis is living proof of that, as it promises to be scientifically meritorious, as soon as the professors are able dig out the hidden gems. Pekka Tiainen Pekka Tapio Tiainen was born in Helsinki on 3 August 1951. In 1956, the family moved to Savonlinna. Tiainen graduated from Savonlinna Upper Secondary School in 1970. He received his Licentiate in Political Science from the University of Helsinki in 1983, majoring in economics. He is in the process of completing his doctoral thesis regarding the factors of economic growth in Finland in the 20th century. Tiainen's professional career has been as a special researcher at the Ministry of Labor, to which position he was appointed in 1982. Before that, he conducted research at, among other places, the Environmental Protection Department of the Interior Ministry and the bank Kansallispankki. He is considered one of the country's foremost experts on employment issues, and the list of studies prepared by him is impressive. Tiainen was a member of the Finnish Communist Party during the period 1971-88, and since then he has been a member of the Communist Workers' Party. While a member of the Finnish Communist Party, he held various positions on a local and district level, and within the minority faction of the Communist Party, he was subsequently a substitute member of the Central Committee and a member of the Economic Policy Section. He currently serves as vice chairman of the Communist Workers' Party. Tiainen was a member of the Vantaa Municipal Council during the period of 1984-92, first as a representative of the Finnish People's Democratic League (SKDL) and later representing Democratic Alternative (DEVA). Tiainen's military rank is lieutenant. He separated from the church in 1969. Tiainen has been married since 1976. His wife Ritva is employed as a social worker in an institution. They have a 15-year-old son and a 11-year-old daughter. The family lives in Lansimaki in Vantaa. Tiainen's hobbies are chess and running--he runs a few thousand kilometers a year.
