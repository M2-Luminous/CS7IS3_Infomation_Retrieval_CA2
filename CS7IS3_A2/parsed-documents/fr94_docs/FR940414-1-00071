For those facilities estimated to incur significant economic impacts under Option 3 and concentrated in the institutional/commercial market, EPA next analyzed usage of the 272 PAIs. This analysis found that the PAI used most frequently by impacted facilities primarily in the I/C market is PAI 56, Hyamine 3500; over 66 percent of these 102 impacted facilities use this PAI. Although several other PAIs were also found to be used with some frequency by the impacted facilities primarily in the I/C market, none were used by more than 30 percent of these facilities, or well less than half the frequency of use for PAI 56. Taking into account both the high frequency of use of Hyamine 3500 (PAI 56) and the fact that the pounds removed are virtually unchanged by excluding the exterior sanitizer wastestreams (19 additional lb-eq), the Agency decided to examine less stringent requirements with respect to PAI 56 in its efforts to moderate economic impacts of Option 3 on facilities in the I/C market. In the EIA for the pesticide manufacturers effluent guidelines, EPA defined markets of competing PAIs. This market definition is more detailed than the broad markets listed in the Survey. For example, not all pesticides used in the agricultural market compete with each other. Pesticides used as herbicides on corn do not compete with pesticides used as fungicides on apples. Pesticide markets were therefore defined as clusters of PAIs that are substitutes in a specific end-use (e.g., herbicides on corn). The list of 272 PAIs were mapped into 57 separate clusters along with other non-272 PAIs with which they compete and are presented in Appendix F of the EIA. PAI 56 is a member of cluster R&hyph;4 which is defined as: ``Sanitizers for use in dairies, food processing, restaurants, and air treatment''. PAIs from the original list of 272 that are included in this cluster are: Hyamine 2389 (PAI 162), methyl benzethonium chloride (PAI 159), Hyamine 1622 (PAI 105), Hyamine 3500 (PAI 56), oxine-sulfate (PAI 51), and Hydroxyethyl amino ethanol (HAE) (PAI 36).
