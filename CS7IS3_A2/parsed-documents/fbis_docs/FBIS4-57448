FBIS4-57448 "drlat097_r_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-097 Daily Report 7 May 1994 Peru Fujimori Charged With `Politicizing' Military Fujimori Charged With `Politicizing' Military PY1805145894 Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 7 May 94 p 4 PY1805145894 Lima LA REPUBLICA Spanish BFN [Text] On 6 May, [Democratic Leftist Movement] Congressman Henry Pease demanded that President Alberto Fujimori "take his hands off the Armed Forces, and refrain from politicizing them" to promote his campaign for reelection, as this greatly harms the country. On 18 May, he announced he will insist on his demand for an explanation of what happened at the settlement of Querecotillo in Piura, where Peruvian Army General Raul Diez, commander of the 1st Infantry Division [as published], reportedly got involved in an impassioned public harangue in favor of Fujimori. Pease commented that this is not an isolated case, as there are several proofs attesting to the government's move in that direction, as evinced by the persecution and punishment of retired members of the military who have criticized his administration. "I am going to insist on my request. The defense minister must explain what has happened. The entire country is awaiting a response to this request," he said, in an angry tone. He went on to say that rather than request that sanctions be applied against the military who go out canvassing for votes, he demanded explanations. "The entire country, and especially the Querotillo settlement, deserves an explanation of what has happened," he said. Pease further stated that the rules of the game ought to be clear in the next election campaign, and that events such as this one should not occur as they inflict much damage to the country. "It is not incumbent upon the Armed Forces to compete with political parties, as they should abstain from participating in the process. That is not their function," he noted. He also criticized the ruling party for defeating the motion to summon the defense minister to Congress to brief it on what has happened. "The majority decided not to summon him because they do not want to do anything that may imply they are controlling the government. This is why they voted down the request that the foreign minister appear before Congress to explain the censorship that the president enforced on a foreign correspondent," he remarked. Pease recalled that Fujimori himself ordered the erasure of some images that had been filmed by a journalist when he visited Yanamayo penitentiary in Puno. "What international prestige are we talking about when press freedom is restricted in such a way? It is preposterous, as that is censorship," he exclaimed. Concerning National Tax Administration Superintendency superintendent's unexpected resignation, Pease noted that this type of state agency must maintain good administration in order to prevent maladjustments. Pease noted that this unexpected replacement may represent a political maneuver to reassign a good professional like Sandro Fuentes to another area, where he may be required for the electoral campaign. Pease pointed out: "The management of governmental administration must not become involved in political maneuvering. It is necessary to take the country into account, and not to have basic aspects in Peru's life become involved in political chicanery."
