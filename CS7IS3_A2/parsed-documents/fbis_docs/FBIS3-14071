This will be added to a large record containing scores and even hundreds of resolutions that tell the history of the Palestine question, the most tragic event in human history, in which right and injustice fiercely conflict with each other. Right has nothing except shouts of justice and legitimacy, while injustice has a sword and the ability to kill and can create a river of blood and tears and a lot of agony. The massacre that occurred at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque is not the first and it will not be the last. At last, the resolution, which consists of a preamble and five clauses, was issued. During its lengthy and difficult delivery, many things happened, foremost of which is the continued killing of Palestinians, not only at the hands of the settlers, but also at the hands of the Israeli Army forces themselves. This added to the atmosphere of procrastination, pressure, and threat the United States is exercising in its capacity as the leader of the world and the major sponsor of the peace process. As a result, the United States refused to vote on two very important clauses. The first clause is mentioned in the preamble. It stipulates the need to provide protection for our Palestinian people. The second clause stipulates Israeli withdrawal from the territories Israel occupied in June 1979, including Jerusalem. O brothers, the refusal of the United States to vote on these two clauses has serious implications, foremost of which is the U.S. retreat from its previous positions, decisions, and assurances regarding the Palestine question and the core of the conflict. It is a retreat from the issue of land, which is the subject of the conflict and from the Palestinian people's security that is the main element in this conflict. Taking the Israeli viewpoint, it becomes clear that Israel is trying to tell us: We slaughter you. We protect you. You have no choice. As for the U.S. viewpoint, which is identical to this, it is telling us: You have negotiations ahead of you. Everything is decided at the negotiating table, even your life itself. This is the most heinous form of injustice. It is the quarrelsomeness of the idiot force that leaves no room for right. It is a flagrant injustice that tells us: See you at the next massacre. In this terrible context, the Palestine question, also known as the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Middle East issue, will continue to be watered with its own blood and fed from its great pain, and to glow above and beneath ashes as a result of this blatant injustice, overall despair, and this full bias in accordance with which the United States moves to protect the Israeli killer from the efforts he exerted in killing the Palestinian victim. God is great, the earth was shaken, and the heavens moved as a result of this grave injustice, the tyranny of force, and the murder of peace on the land of peace. However, brothers, we know injustice is the spark of every revolution, the tyranny of force is the beginning of every explosion, and the disdain of the blood of innocent people is the curse no one will escape. And soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take. [Koranic verse] We go back to politics and say: Will UN Security Council Resolution No. 904 be turned into tangible and concrete measures? Will the settlers leave Hebron? Will the criminal settlers be disarmed? Will the vanguards of the UN protection force arrive in the Palestinian land? This is an urgent time for these questions, especially since the U.S. Administration did not approve the passing of the UN Security Council resolution on the massacre until after it obtained assurances from the Arab cordon states to resume the negotiations in April. This requires a maximum degree of Arab awareness, caution, and coordination, which we hope will be achieved during the meeting the Arab cordon states will hold soon on the foreign ministers' level. Brothers, still, we should say that every Palestinian wound, regardless of how painful it is, can be endured by our great struggler people if this wound illuminates our nation's conscience, and gives it a new incentive to rise above its internal differences, wounds, and transient contradictions. We wholeheartedly hope that all this will be achieved because the alternative is the recurrence of the tragedy. The nation that disdains its people's blood encourages others to disdain it. It is a revolution until victory!
