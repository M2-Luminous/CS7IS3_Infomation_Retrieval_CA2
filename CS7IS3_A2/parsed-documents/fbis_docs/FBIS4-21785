Vivekanand] [Excerpts] Amman--Twenty-three people charged with plotting and carrying out attacks aimed at destabilising internal security will be put on trial in mid-April, official sources said Sunday. [passage omitted] At least six of the suspects have confessed to have planted the explosive devices that went off at the Rivoli and Salwa theatres as well as others which were discovered at a supermarket outside Amman and the Zahran cinema, local reports said. [passage omitted] The sources said most of them are from lower middle class families and some of them would be charged as accessories before and after the crime. It was not clear from the reports how many of the suspects knew each other. They were all said to have worked separately, as small groups, unaware of each other, under the guidance of one or more people. According to the reports, one of the suspects, Muhammad 'Adaribah, told interrogators that he tried and failed to plant a bomb at the Rivoli, in downtown Amman, one week before the Jan. 26 blast. The device, described as a time-bomb that actually went off inside the theatre at midnoon, was planted by another suspect, Yasin Zahrah, the reports said. Seven people were injured in the blast. The youth who planted the bomb which was discovered and defused at Amman's Zahran cinema was identified as Samir Ahmad, who told police that he was asked to plant the bomb by Muhammad Shihadah, a construction material salesman from the al-Baq'ah refugee camp. Mr. Ahmad was reported to have met Mr. Shihadah, described as an Arab Afghan, in front of the al-Husayni Mosque in downtown Amman to inform him that he had planted the bomb inside the theatre. Mr. Shihadah, who is also under detention, was also implicated in the al-Zarqa' bombing by the man who confessed to have planted the device, 'Id Jahalin, a 30-year-old plumber from al-Baq'ah. Mr. Jahalin lost his limbs in the explosion when the bomb exploded prematurely. His confession from his hospital bed is believed to have been the most significant breakthrough in the case. The suspects also took interrogators to 'Akrush Supermarket in Safut, which straddles the main road between Amman and al-Baq'ah camp, and reenacted the planting of the device which was discovered and defused there a few days before the Rivoli blast. Mr. Zahrah, the man who reportedly confessed to the Rivoli explosion, was also identified as the one who planted the bomb at the supermarket. Another target of the suspects was the sprawling Housing Bank complex in the heart of Amman, according to the reports. Some of the suspects showed interrogators how ``they cased the joint to determine where to plant the bombs'' but no explosives were actually placed in the complex. Apart from Mr. 'Adaribah, Mr. Zahrah, Mr. Ahmad, Mr. Shihadah and Mr. Jahalin, other suspects identified by name included Hasan Hamdan and Sulayman Biyah. All the bombs were said to have used crude technology widely employed by the Afghan rebels in their battle against the Red Army and Soviet-supported government soldiers in Afghanistan. The bombing case is the second known organised sabotage attributed to ``Arab Afghans'' in Jordan. In 1991, members of a group called ``Jaysh Muhammad (Muhammad's Army)'' made up mostly of Afghan returnees were arrested following a series of attacks and foiled attempts against night-clubs, cinemas, liquor shops and security officers as well as government buildings and diplomatic missions. Eighteen of them were tried and convicted; eight of them, two in absentia, were given the death sentence, and others were jailed for terms ranging from two years to 15 years. [passage omitted]
