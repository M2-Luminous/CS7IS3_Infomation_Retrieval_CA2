Who's At the Helm?": "Of the Competitors, We're the Assistants..."; first paragraph is source introduction before Yaropolov's piece] [Text] The negotiations between Russia and the United States on cooperation in space may wind up with a decision to create a joint orbital space station. That aim evokes differing assessments from specialists. The capabilities and infrastructure of the domestic space sector could be destroyed if Russia accepts NASA's proposal with regard to an international space station project. The development of the Alpha station, mainly with U.S. equipment and in cooperation with Europe, Japan, and Canada, could reduce us -- with two modules and a transport craft -- to a "second-string player." But it is Russia who is creating a space infrastructure for the United States, and that 3-3.5 years earlier than they had planned to do it on their own. But their attempts, which have cost them almost $10 billion, have not been successful. The future station, built and serviced with the American space shuttles, can fly with an orbital inclination of 57�, and maybe even 51�. Consequently, it will not fly over all of Russia, as had been planned for our Mir-2 station. Recall that Mir-2 was supposed to lift off in 1997, to an orbit of 65�, which would make it possible to continue remote sensing of the ground. The Alpha enables survey of no more than 5 percent of our country. The United States will have the opportunity to use the orbital complex in its entirety. But no one knows yet whether Russian cosmonauts will get to operate the Alpha at all. The fact is that all the know-how with regard to the development of the orbital station has been valued at $800 million. Even though Russia herself invested tens of billions of rubles in that technology at a time when the ruble and the dollar were almost equivalent. But since the whole station will go for roughly $40 billion and will be operated by the project participants on a percentage basis, according to how much was contributed, Russia's operating time will be no more than 10 days a year. When you recall that we have obligations to France in the manned program, then it's not clear at all for whom or for what purpose we will be creating Alpha. Besides, Russian industry will lose vitally important orders. And the unique Cosmonaut Training Center in Zvezdnyy Gorodok will become virtually unnecessary -- the crews will start training in the States. And the Flight Control Center, with all its expensive equipment and highly skilled specialists, will lose its significance.
