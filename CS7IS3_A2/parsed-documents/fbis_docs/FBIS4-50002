Sino-U.S. relations should be improved, for this is required for world peace and stability. At the beginning of the meeting, President Jiang Zemin extended a welcome to Kissinger for making another trip to China. He said: Dr. Kissinger has always worked unswervingly and vigorously to develop Sino-U.S. relations with the foresight of a strategist and the courage of a statesman. This is commendable. He said: After the end of the cold war, the trend of multipolarization in the world has been intensifying, and the international situation as a whole is moving toward a relaxation; economic interests are becoming the main factor having a bearing on international relations. The universal desire of the people of all countries is seeking a relaxation, cooperation, and progress. However, the end of the cold war has not brought about universal peace for the people of the world. Turbulence and unceasing military conflicts have continued in many regions. This situation cannot but draw the universal concern of the people of the world. He stressed: "China and the United States, as two powers having a considerable influence on the world, bear an important responsibility for the future of the world and the destiny of mankind. We should do something for the people of the world." After reviewing the course of the development of Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang Zemin pointed out: Confrontation between China and the United States will do no one any good, but the development of cooperation between the two countries will benefit the peoples of the two countries and the people of the world. Although there are some disputes, some problems, and differences between the two countries, in the final analysis, efforts should be made to improve relations between them. This is required for world peace and stability. Jiang Zemin said: Practice demonstrates fully that Sino-U.S. relations have not been merely limited to bilateral ties but are closely related to the international situation. In the past, Sino- U.S. relations developed more smoothly whenever both sides were able to overcome their differences in social systems and value concepts, and when they proceeded from their common interests, developed mutually beneficial cooperation, and continually expanded common points on the basis of mutual respect, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, and treated each other on an equal footing. However, Sino-U.S. relations met with difficulties or setbacks or even regressed whenever these principles were violated, differences over ideology were stressed, the other side's interests were ignored, views were imposed on others, or sanctions and pressure were applied. These historical lessons are very profound. Jiang Zemin stressed: A good opportunity has presented itself for the development of Sino-U.S. relations. It is hoped that both sides will grasp the opportunity, respect each other, seek common ground while reserving differences, and work together on the basis of the principles set out by the three Sino-U.S. communiques, so as to enable their relations to develop on a healthy and normal track. Kissinger said: The maintaining of good relations between the United States and China is very important to peace and stability in Asia as well as in the world. He said that he has always been against the use of the most-favored-nation trading status as a means to exert pressure on China and that he is also against putting pressure on China. He expressed the hope of seeing greater improvements in U.S.-Sino relations. According to a Chinese official, the meeting took place in a cordial and friendly atmosphere. Present at the meeting were Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation; Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, and others.
