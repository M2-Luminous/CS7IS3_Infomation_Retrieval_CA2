[Begin recording] [Fujimori] I hope that Mr. Watson -- who knows Peru because he was ambassador here during a very difficult period, during the previous administration -- will objectively evaluate the situation, the progress that has been made in the antiterrorist struggle, and the respect there is for human rights, with the exception of isolated cases that might have taken place. I sincerely hope that the assistance that has previously been promised by the United States will be released. [Reporter] There are reports that the talks on the Lima Convention between the Peruvian and Chilean negotiators have been suspended. What can you tell us about this? [Fujimori] These negotiations are alternatively taking place in Santiago and Lima. I hope they continue. I think that some progress has been made. Some details have yet to be worked out. [Reporter] Are there some discrepancies yet, Mr. President? [Fujimori] Some points I consider details still remain. We hope that the interests of both sides can be fully served. [Reporter] In your speech at the Plaza de Armas on the anniversary of the city, you said that the [word indistinct] of Decree 776 divides the country and that it is necessary, in order not to deprive the municipalities of authority, to repair that damage. Is this going to be considered? [Fujimori] Municipal autonomy has not been lessened at all. What happens is that the tax reform has objectives. We have always said, I believe with the support of the country, that the General Sales Tax must be the most important tax. This is a strictly technical opinion. It has nothing to do with some interpretations of this. I have been surprised to find that some provincial mayors have complained about this when the fact is that they will be able to double or triple their revenues because of the Municipal Compensation Fund.
