Furthermore, those who did not take part in electing its members are even less satisfied with them. It would seem that they have no cause to complain: they got the individuals for whom they voted. But in our opinion that is too superficial an explanation. Without going into the issue in detail here, let us simply note the following: if the election were held right now only 75 percent of those who went to the polls on 12 December would vote the same way again, 14 percent would vote differently, and 11 percent are unsure how they would vote now. All things change, but we are going to have to travel with the current Russian parliament for quite some time and in an unknown direction. In light of that St. Petersburg residents' assessment of the election success of one of the Duma's key players -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy -- is very curious. Of all voters in St. Petersburg only 9 percent are of the opinion that his success event will help improve the state of affairs in Russia. The same percentage is also found among those who actually voted. Yet their numbers should be significantly larger (recall that the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia won 17 percent of the vote in St. Petersburg). Can it be that these people are now free of his spell? At this time it is difficult to answer that question. We are still seeing the phenomenon of respondents' cunning evasion of answers to direct questions such as: "Did you personally vote for Zhirinovskiy?" As this phenomenon was first detected during pre-election polls of public opinion and also cropped up in polls taken the day of the election, it cannot be attributed to a reaction by LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] supporters to the storm of revelations about the Liberal Democrat leader after 12 December (one scenario that has been offered: many people have had their eyes opened and are now ashamed to admit their political shortsightedness). St. Petersburg residents' attitudes toward the prospect of the current Cabinet of Ministers receiving a vote of no confidence appear to be quite undetermined. It seems the issue has lost some of its urgency for the time being. As for the personal ratings of current and former members of the government, it turns out that the politicians who are leaving the scene have a higher degree of public support than the ones who remain.
