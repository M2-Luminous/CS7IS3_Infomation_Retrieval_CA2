FBIS4-33859 "drlat113_t_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-113 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 Venezuela Transportation Sector Strike Suspended 10 Days Transportation Sector Strike Suspended 10 Days PA1006190394 Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 10 Jun 94 PA1006190394 Caracas Union Radio Network Spanish BFN [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] [Text] The staggered transportation strikes were suspended once the government appointed a commission to mediate the conflict. This was reported by Simon Ladera, president of the Union of Independent Vehicles, who added that the union's intention is not to exert any type of pressure on the commission. Thus, there is a 10-day truce in the strike. Ladera asserted that the suspension of the strike is not a reaction to the Transportation and Communication Ministry's alleged threats to revoke independent vehicle licenses. The union leader also recommended that Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom take charge of security or, better yet, that he should take charge of the insecurity in the country because more drivers are being killed by criminals every day and the government is taking no steps to end the situation.
