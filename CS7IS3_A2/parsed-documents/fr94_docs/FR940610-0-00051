The added and revised provisions read as follows: §1.170A&hyph;12 Valuation of a remainder interest in real property for contributions made after July 31, 1969. (a)␣*␣*␣* (3)␣*␣*␣*␣Except as provided in §1.7520&hyph;3(b) of this chapter, for transfers of remainder interests after April 30, 1989, the present value of the remainder interest is determined under §25.2512&hyph;5 of this chapter by use of the interest rate component on the date the interest is transferred unless an election is made under section 7520 and §1.7520&hyph;2 of this chapter to compute the present value of the interest transferred by use of the interest rate component for either of the 2 months preceding the month in which the interest is transferred.␣*␣*␣* (b) Valuation of a remainder interest following only one life _(1) General rule. The value of a remainder interest in real property following only one life is determined under the rules provided in §20.2031&hyph;7 (or for certain prior periods, §20.2031&hyph;7A) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations), using the interest rate and life contingencies prescribed for the date of the gift. See, however, §1.7520&hyph;3(b) (relating to exceptions to the use of prescribed tables under certain circumstances). However, if any part of the real property is subject to exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence, the special factor determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be used in valuing the remainder interest in that part. Further, if any part of the property is subject to depletion of its natural resources, such depletion is taken into account in determining the value of the remainder interest. (2) Computation of depreciation factor. If the valuation of the remainder interest in depreciable property is dependent upon the continuation of one life, a special factor must be used. The factor determined under this paragraph (b)(2) is carried to the fifth decimal place. The special factor is to be computed on the basis of the interest rate and life contingencies prescribed in §20.2031&hyph;7 (or for certain prior periods, §20.2031&hyph;7A) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) and on the assumption that the property depreciates on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. For transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, special factors for determining the present value of a remainder interest following one life and an example describing the computation are contained in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1459, ``Actuarial Values, Gamma Volume,'' (8&hyph;89). This publication is no longer available for purchase from the Superintendent of Documents. However, it may be obtained by requesting a copy from: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IRS Publication 1459), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. See, however, §1.7520&hyph;3(b) (relating to exceptions to the use of prescribed tables under certain circumstances). Otherwise, in the case of the valuation of a remainder interest following one life, the special factor may be obtained through use of the following formula:
