Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Nankang Software Industry Park, Premier Lien Chan said the park is expected to provide a good environment for the research and development of computer software in Taiwan. The park in suburban Taipei is part of a government five-year plan to raise Taiwan's annual computer software production to NT [New Taiwan] $90 billion (U.S.$3.34 billion) from the current NT$26 billion (U.S.$98.11 million), Lien said. "We hope local business groups will invest in the park to help boost the growth of the promising industry and make Taiwan one of the world's major software development centers," Lien said. Construction of the 4.03-hectare park, scheduled to be completed in 1995, will cost an estimated NT$9 billion (U.S.$339.62 million). The land is owned by the state-run Taiwan Fertilizer Corp., but the Shih Cheng Development Co., a joint venture of several private business groups, is a major investor in the project. Shih Cheng promised to build first-rate plants and other related facilities in the park, which will be able to accommodate more than 150 software companies. The park will be administered by a special committee to be formed by senior executives from Shih Cheng and companies investing in the park instead of being managed by government authorities as the Hsinchu science-based industrial park in northern Taiwan. Nevertheless, the government will invest billions of dollars in constructing transport and telecommunications facilities inside the park and its surrounding areas to help attract investors to the park, ranking officials said.
