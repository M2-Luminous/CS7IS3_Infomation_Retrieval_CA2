Along with the signing of a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two states, a package of agreements on cooperation between the military structures of Russia and Georgia is also expected to be discussed and signed. Much attention at the talks is to be given to matters concerning the status of and conditions for the functioning of Russian border troops. Expert opinion is that the prospective conclusion of Russo- Georgian military agreements does not mean the establishment of any military-political alliance between Russia and Georgia against Abkhazia. The interests of both Abkhazia and South Ossetia are to be taken into account during the discussion of cooperation-related matters between the two states. The problem of reaching mutual understanding over the question of carrying out peacekeeeping operations in Abkhazia with the use of a peacekeeping force under U.N. auspices will be one of important aspects of the forthcoming talks.
