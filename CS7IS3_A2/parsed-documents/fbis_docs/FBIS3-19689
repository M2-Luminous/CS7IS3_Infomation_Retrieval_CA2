This is the result of a representative poll by the Allensbach Public Opinion Research Institute. Nevertheless, given a choice between Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union) and Rudolf Scharping, his challengers from the Social Democratic Party of Germany, 63 percent would choose Kohl and only 23 percent Scharping. More than two-thirds (68 percent) of those polled demand from the Federal Government "massive support" for German exports. "Not as the chief seller. But we want more political support as chief establisher of contacts," Tyll Necker, president of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said yesterday at the presentation of the "elite panel" ordered by the economic magazine CAPITAL. "The government is to reestablish equal starting opportunities in international competition," Necker said in an interview with DIE WELT. An essential part of the economic problems are homemade because of the cost crisis, the excessive regulations, and the skepticism concerning technology: "The others have become better and we have become more expensive." Six of 10 of the 650 polled managers are, however, also of the view that the Germans are "too naive and clumsy" in foreign business. A total of 52 percent of the German managers think that Germany has fallen back in technology. Germany's economic prospects are assessed largely positively: 42 percent (40 percent in September 1993) in the old laender and 39 percent (30) in the new laender expect the economic development to recover. In the view of 66 percent of the managers, the FRG will play a greater role in international politics in the future. A total of 78 percent of those polled think that "fear of a stronger Germany is unfounded." Good relations with the United States (97 percent) and with France (95 percent) are cited as the two most important foreign policy goals. In an international comparison of salaries for 1993 the German managers occupied first place with an average annual gross income of 443,000 marks (including a percentage of annual profits).
