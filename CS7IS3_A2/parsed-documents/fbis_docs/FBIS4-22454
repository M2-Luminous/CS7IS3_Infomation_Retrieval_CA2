The mayors of Moscow and St. Petersburg, the chief of the administration of Yekaterinburg, and the largest Russian importers have spoken out against the introduction of unprecedentedly high import duties that violate the existing system for supplying large cities with food. Yesterday they appealed to the president and prime minister to abolish as "ill-considered and unsubstantiated" the government decree concerning the introduction of new customs duties on foodstuffs. The mayors of Moscow and St. Petersburg, Yuriy Luzhkov and Anatoliy Sobchak, and also the chief of the administration of Yekaterinburg, Aleksandr Chernetskiy, in an open letter to the president stated that the decision to introduce duties on foodstuffs would inevitably lead to a sharp reduction of import deliveries of food products and, consequently, to a considerable increase in their prices within the country. The leaders of the three largest cities of Russia think that the goal set with the introduction of customs duties on food shipped into Russia--to protect and support the domestic producer of agricultural products--will not be achieved and instead of that the food market in large cities will decrease to dangerous levels. In the opinion of experts, the government, hiding behind the idea of the need to protect national producers, is deliberately provoking a new wave of inflation that will begin with a sharp increase in prices for imported food, and following inevitably after that will be higher prices for domestic food products as well. Since the level of self-provision of food in Russia has not even reached 90 percent, a reduction of imports could place the largest Russian cities on the brink of famine. Of course, after a certain time interval importers would adapt to the new conditions, but this would be done mainly through their reorientation toward purchasing low-quality goods from less developed countries. In parallel with this, prices of Western European goods, which now dominate on the markets of the large Russian cities, would increase by no less than one-third. In any case the Russian consumers stand to lose. A similar demand--to abolish import duties on foodstuffs--was submitted to the president and government by the 12 largest importers, including the Eksportkhleb Association, the Menatep Trading House, the Eksimer, Medeya, and Kontinent joint-stock companies, and the Agrointorg VTO [foreign trade association]. The traders are also demanding that their import contracts paid for before 15 March be exempted from the decree. In this case, if the government does not soften its position, large food importers, about whose financial might nobody had any doubts even a week ago, could end up on the verge of bankruptcy. At the present time the majority of large importers have in hand paid contracts for the delivery of goods not only in March, but up until the end of April. These contracts have been used as a basis for concluding agreements with large buyers. Dissolving them will entail payment of immense fines by import firms. Since all the traders are working using credit resources, delay in paying interest automatically bankrupts them. According to available information, in recent days representatives of importers have been conducting active negotiations with a number of highly placed members of the government in order to achieve a softening of the conditions for the introduction of the new rates. It is quite possible that at Viktor Chernomyrdin's meeting with Boris Yeltsin in Sochi they will also discuss the question of changing import conditions. Here, if one takes into account the broad reaction evoked by the introduction of duties on food, one can quite possibly expect that the president's reaction (and, in concert, that of the government) will be positive.
