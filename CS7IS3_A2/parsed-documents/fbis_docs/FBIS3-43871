A source monitoring the Lusaka talks told the Portuguese news agency, LUSA, that UNITA has questioned the government's failure to specifically state what posts will be filled by UNITA members. UNITA wants to know how many generals, captains, and agents will form part of the police, and what percentage of each of those posts will be accorded to the organization.
