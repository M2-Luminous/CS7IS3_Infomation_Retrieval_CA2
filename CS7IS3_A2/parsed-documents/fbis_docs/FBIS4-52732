This will be based on conditions ratified under the GATT agreements which stipulate equal treatment for all countries that are members of the World Trade Organization. He said that governments in the past have solved the problem through the liberalization of various kinds of businesses. [Begin Suphachai recording] It is our intention. The removal of clauses under the Amity Treaty from the National Executive Council Announcement No 281 is due to the fact under Announcement No 281, we have to treat every country equally. This is because of the agreements of the World Trade Organization, as we are a member of the organization, and so is the United States. The United States must understand this very well, and there should not be any problem. As for the next step, we will have to clarify with the United States that in future, it won't be the only country that enjoys all those special privileges. [End recording]
