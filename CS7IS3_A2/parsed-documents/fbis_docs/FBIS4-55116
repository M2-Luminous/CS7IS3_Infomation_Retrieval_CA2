The chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party damaged a neck vertebra and broke his wrist in a car crash late on Thursday. "Although Horn can already walk with help, he cannot yet leave the hospital as he would like to. The more rest he gets, the more likely his medical treatment will be successful. What is certain: He needs no surgery in his present condition. In my opinion, he cannot be released from hospital before Wednesday," Dobai said. According to VASARNAPI HIREK (SUNDAY NEWS), doctors will decide on Wednesday whether the politician can leave the hospital on Thursday or Friday.
