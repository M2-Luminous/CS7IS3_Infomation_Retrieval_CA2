The remarks by U.S. elements in Washington to the effect that the arrangement with Syria will necessitate a phased Israeli withdrawal from the security zone to be carried out over several years have reached senior SLA officers and caused much concern. In conversations with senior officers at the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Northern Command, SLA Commander Antoine Lahd's aides voiced serious anxiety over the possibility of being deserted by Israel. An SLA officer has told IDF commanders: "We are afraid you will leave us, and we will become a target for the Lebanese and the Syrians." Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, the Northern Command commander, and brigadier General Gabi Ashkenazi, chief of the Liaison Unit With Lebanon, apprised their interlocutors of the remarks of Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, who said during a tour of Qiryat Shemona three weeks ago that Israel will not desert its allies in south Lebanon. The SLA has been apprised of the basic conditions for any possible arrangement in south Lebanon and of the Israeli demand to guarantee the local residents' safety.
