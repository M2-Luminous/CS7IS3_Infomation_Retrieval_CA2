As some cases involved public security personnel, the Central Commission of Political Science and Law, the Public Security Ministry, and other departments recently have stressed that public security personnel are strictly banned from getting involving in economic disputes and using their powers to arrest people illegally. According to reports, the Public Security Ministry has sensed the serious consequences of the involvement of public security organs and policemen in kidnapping hostages, and has demanded that public security departments at various levels view the solemn handling of this lawbreaking and discipline-violating behavior as one of the important contents of the anitcorruption drive and the rectification of law enforcement work within public security departments. The procuratorial organs, which have jurisdiction over the investigation and handling of "hostage-type" cases, also have removed various obstacles and have actively handled these kinds of cases, viewing them as a key area. The "hostage-type" cases first appeared in the middle of the 1980's, and have increased greatly in the 1990's. According to statistics provided by the Guangdong provincial procuratorial organs, from 1990 to 1992 the incidence of such cases increased 52 percent. Information from Shanghai shows that in the first quarter of last year, cases classified as of the "hostage type" exceeded by 50 percent the total number of such cases in the previous year. These are just the figures of cases for which files have been opened by the procuratorial organs, and the "hostage-type" cases for which files could not be opened should be even more. The "hostage-type" cases were caused mainly by disputes in commercial and trading activities, and kidnapping a hostage was the last resort to force someone to pay an outstanding debt. Those who were kidnapped were from different walks of life. Judged in terms of status, they included factory heads; managers; deputies to people's congresses; members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; soldiers; and businessmen from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. Judged from the angle of age, they included babies several months old and elderly people of advanced age. Judged from the relations of those involved in debts, they included parents, wives, sons, daughters, inferiors, relatives, and good friends. As has been pointed out, among those who participated in kidnapping activities were many party and government officials, as well as cadres and policemen from public security and judicial departments. There is a high-sounding excuse for them to get involved in the "hostage-type" cases: Investigating economic crime. Thus, there is a legal cover for kidnapping hostages -- arresting lawbreaking elements -- and there is a dignified package for forcing someone to pay an outstanding debt -- recovering economic losses. A relevant person analyzed the situation and said that there are profound and complicated economic and social reasons behind the "hostage phenomenon." One main reason is that the development of the commodity economy has greatly increased commercial and trading activities in the community, and the laws and regulations, as well as law enforcement and supervision work, have failed to keep pace. In some localities, it is difficult to file a lawsuit, and in particular, it is very difficult to open a file for a case that does not involve a large amount of debt, while it is difficult to carry out the verdicts in some cases. Some creditors find that their legitimate rights are not protected, so they must look for another way to regain their loans as quickly as possible. Local protectionism is the reason for some government and judicial organs to get involved in economic disputes arbitrarily and to abuse their powers by detaining people illegally. Under the current system, a local government has the power to allocate finance to local public security organs, procuratorial organs, and law courts; as a result, they have to listen to the orders of the local government, and must be responsible to the local government instead of to the law. Local interests are involved in various economic disputes, and the "hostage phenomena" all exhibit one common feature: Most of the kidnappers come from the economically undeveloped districts or even poverty-stricken districts, and they badly needed their loans returned because they lacked money. Some local party leaders would often think of using the power of government and judicial departments to detain hostages in the name of "handling cases" so as to retrieve the outstanding amount of money.
