The shelling which shook the city and sent people scuttling indoors at 4:30 p.m. took place just a day after the city's airport was placed under UN control. Alarm sirens screeched and an ambulance raced to the site of the attack but no immediate information was available on possible casualties. Bosnian Serbs are dug into positions some 10 kilometres (six miles) from the city. Troops from the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) officially took control Tuesday of the airport some 15 kilometres (10 miles) outside the city in order to airlift aid to some 700,000 hungry civilians. It was not immediately known whether or not the airport had been hit.
