The shadowy National Action, which operates from post boxes in Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne, launched a "White Australia-SA [South Africa] Solidarity" campaign in its latest newsletter. "In response to appeals for help from our brother nation, the Afrikanners of SA, National Action has decided to assist in fund-raising for the nationalist AWB," the National Action News said in an editorial. Donors are asked to send money to a bank account in the name of the AWB Wenkommando [Victory Commando] in Ventersdorp in the western Transvaal. The group is also offering White Australia-SA Solidarity T-shirts, bearing the swastika-like symbol of the AWB. National Action, which is virulently opposed to Asian immigration into Australia, is one of a number of rightwing groups which operate of the fringes of Australian society. In recent months it has published a series of articles promoting a "boerestaat" [Boer homeland] in SA and its possible connection with right-wing SA backers has attracted the attention of Australian police. A police spokesman said yesterday the force was looking seriously at the AWB fund-raising appeal as a possible contravention of the Crime (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act of 1978. The Act makes it an offence for anyone in Australia to raise money or give money that will be used to incite fear or death or violence in the people of any foreign country.
