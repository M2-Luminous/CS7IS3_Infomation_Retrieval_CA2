Conclusion EPA concludes, consistent with the Administration Wetlands Plan and as detailed in the response to comments above, that the proposed rule would result in avoidable and unmitigated adverse impacts to wetlands in Alaska. Existing flexibility in applying the requirements of the Section 404 regulatory program in combination with actions being implemented as a result of the Administration's Wetlands Plan are effective in addressing Alaskan concerns with the Section 404 program and the State's climatological and physiographic circumstances. Furthermore, the Alaskan stakeholders and public who participated in the Alaska Wetlands Initiative have helped to define these specific concerns and to recommend ways of addressing them in an environmentally appropriate manner. List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 230 Environmental protection, Alaska, Water pollution control, Wetlands. Dated: May 12, 1994. Carol M. Browner, Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency. Accordingly, the proposed rule to amend 40 CFR part 230, ``Exception from Wetlands Mitigation Sequence for Alaska,'' published at 57 FR 52716 (November 4, 1992), is withdrawn.
