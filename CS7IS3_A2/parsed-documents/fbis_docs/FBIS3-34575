The Alliance of the Palestinian Forces has held a meeting in which it discussed the latest political developments given the determination of 'Arafat and his team to plunge deeper into the quagmire of the liquidatory Oslo-Washington agreement and to make concession after concession in order to meet the Zionist enemy leaders' conditions, the latest of which was 'Arafat's declaration in Davos that he had no intention of establishing a Palestinian state, but that he was working to establish a confederation with Jordan. On the occasion of the beginning of the 75th month of the intifadah, which coincides with the arrival of the blessed month of Ramadan, the Alliance of the Palestinian Forces extends its greetings and appreciation to the sons of the brave intifadah, who are stepping up their heroic deeds in the face of the growing violence of the enemy's soldiers and its herds of settlers. This is, in fact, a practical retaliation in order to topple the Gaza-Jericho agreement and to continue and escalate the intifadah against the invaders. In light of these developments, the Alliance of the Palestinian Forces assert that the Palestine question is not the property of 'Arafat and his men and, therefore, he cannot do with it whatever he wishes because it belongs to the Palestinian people and their national forces, who reject liquidatory solutions, and who struggle to achieve our people's goals of repatriation, self-determination, and full national independence. What 'Arafat says basically means an annexation by Jordan of the partial self-rule authority, which is being rejected by the overwhelming majority of the sons of our Palestinian people. This statement is aimed at reassuring the Zionist enemy. 'Arafat no longer speaks for or expresses the will of the Palestinian people. Therefore, his opinions and positions are no longer binding on our people. The alliance again urges the sons of the Arab and Islamic nations, as well as all the forces that love freedom and peace, to take practical positions in support of our people's legitimate rights and to put an end to the rampage of Zionism, which uses the defeatism of 'Arafat and his team -- this only represents a slight minority of our people inside and outside the occupied homeland -- as a pretext to entrench its occupation of the Palestinian and Arab territories. The alliance urges the exposure of the United States' use of double standards and the extension of all sorts of support to the Zionist enemy in order to develop its military arsenal and to consider the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories as disputed territories. The alliance will resolutely continue its policy to topple the Oslo-Washington agreement, strip 'Arafat and his team of their popular legitimacy, rebuild the PLO's institutions on democratic bases, and secure every means to prolong and escalate the brave intifadah and its unity under the banner of the unified national and Islamic unity of the intifadah.
