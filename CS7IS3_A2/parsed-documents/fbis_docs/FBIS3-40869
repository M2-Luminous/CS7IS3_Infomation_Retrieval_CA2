GOLKAR's present position as single majority was decided by voters who channeled their political rights through GOLKAR. It is not true that its position could plunge Indonesia into a culture of "dictatorship of the majority and tyranny of the minority." "There is no need to worry about a single majority. The people elected GOLKAR because they accepted GOLKAR's program," Harmoko told reporters who stopped him at the Department of Information on Tuesday [11 January]. According to Harmoko, each sociopolitical organization must fight in the general elections to win a majority. "That is true everywhere in the world. Although there may be only two or three sociopolitical organizations, there is certain to be a battle to win a majority. GOLKAR fully realizes that its position as single majority is the will of the voting public. Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, former GOLKAR DPP secretary general, expressed a similar view when asked for comment. "What is expected? A single majority is the result of general elections. Show me a country anywhere that does not have a single majority," Sarwono said following a national PROKASIH [Clean River Program] working meeting at the Department of Home Affairs. "It is more unlikely that election results would be divided among sociopolitical organizations to give the appearance of democracy." When asked about the statement of Megawati Sukarnoputri, general chairperson of the PDI [Indonesian Democratic Party] DPP, who said she worried that the ideas and zeal of the single majority could plunge Indonesia into a culture of dictatorship of the majority and tyranny of the minority, Harmoko stated there is no need for such worry. "GOLKAR continues to promote deliberation to achieve consensus, in legislatures as well as in other institutions. GOLKAR continues to promote Pancasila [ideology of the Indonesian state] democracy," Harmoko said. As for Sarwono, he replied concisely, "I do not understand why Ms. Mega said that." Please Do So Harmoko acknowledged that the tour he made of the provinces after being elected GOLKAR DPP general chairman was an effort to maintain GOLKAR's position as single majority. However, he rejected the statement that GOLKAR's present majority position is only quantitative and not yet qualitative. "What GOLKAR has been fighting for qualitatively and quantitatively is in accordance with applicable laws. We have never done anything in the elections that is not `sympathetic,'" Harmoko said. In her speech on the 21st anniversary of the PDI, Megawati had also called for reconsideration of whether the term `single majority' is consistent with the 1945 Constitution. When the statement was passed on to Harmoko, the GOLKAR DPP general chairman replied, "How can the will of the people be misinterpreted as inconsistent with the 1945 Constitution? That is not true. How can it be contrary to the 1945 Constitution for the political rights of the people to be channeled through one party? That is not true. What are the arguments?" "If another sociopolitical organization wants to be the `single majority,' please let them do so. It is natural that each sociopolitical organization would want to do that. If the people then elect GOLKAR, it cannot be stopped," he said. The GOLKAR general chairman denied that GOLKAR's victory in the general elections was because of support by GOLKAR external elements, including the "superstructure." Not Contradictory Meanwhile, Dr. Albert Hasibuan, S.H. [Master of Laws], and Martin Hutabarat, who were contacted separated, said that the existence of a single majority will not lead to a political culture of "dictatorship of the majority and tyranny of the minority" that would be contradictory to the spirit of deliberation and consensus. Such a spirit of deliberation and consensus is very dependent on the spirit of state administrators and leaders of sociopolitical organizations and not on the existence of a single majority. "The desire of a party to get the most votes is natural. Just think of the alternative: If a party does not want to be a `single majority,' it must hold back lest it get the most votes. Would that not make it difficult for the party itself?" asked Albert Hasibuan, who is general chairman of the LPPH (Institute for the Publicizing and Study of Law). Therefore, said Hasibuan, it is the right of every organization participating in general elections to win a single majority by democratic means. Hasibuan surmised that the recent emergence of discussion was prompted by suspicion that a single majority will create a monopoly in decisionmaking. Under Pancasila democracy, however, a decision does not depend on the existence of a single majority but on the rightness of the issue for which a decision must be made. According to Hasibuan, it would be better if statements on single majority were put in the context of dialectic dynamics, so that everyone would try to move the next general elections toward being more democratic. The important things are that democracy be adhered to and that votes are not "engineered." Strengthening of Legal Institutions Like Hasibuan, Martin Hutabarat believes that the principles of deliberation and consensus and of single majority are two different things. Deliberation and consensus is a decisionmaking method, while single majority is the goal of an election participant organization for the sake of ensuring the stability of development. Hutabarat said that a single majority does not automatically lead to "dictatorship of the majority and tyranny of the minority," which would ultimately neglect the deliberation and consensus principle. "That depends on the spirit of state administrators. Do they want to maintain a spirit of family and of deliberation and consensus, or not?" Hutabarat asked. Nevertheless, Hutabarat said, it is not enough to depend on the spirit of state administrators. Therefore, the support of other elements is needed if the spirit of state administrators is to be maintained. This includes, for example, openness of the press, which has been actively promoting issues of openness and transparency. According to Hutabarat, another element is the strengthening of legal institutions, such as state administrative jurisprudence and the National Commission on Basic Human Rights. "For example, if a person is dismissed from his job because he joined the PDI, he can now appeal that decision to the PTUN [State Administrative Court]. That is a control that prevents state administrators from acting arbitrarily," he said. No Conditions Meanwhile, two DPR members from other factions, namely Ali Hardi Kiaidemak of the FPP [Development Unity Faction] and Y.B. Wiyanjono of the F-PDI [PDI Faction] said in separate interviews that the idea and spirit of single majority are acceptable for all political parties as long as there are no conditions. If the situation is otherwise, however, the worry over dictatorship of the majority and tyranny of the minority is justifiable. According to Kiaidemak, all political parties have the desire to be big, but that desire should not bring about practices outside the democratic concept. He said he is confident that as long as all political players adhere to the democratic concept, a single majority will not bring forth a terrible dictatorship or tyranny. Wiyanjono, however, said that if the single majority sets conditions, as it does now, he is confident that sooner or later it will create an unhealthy political climate. This is particularly true if it produces a tendency toward unfairness to other political parties. "Thus, I support what Megawati said," Wiyanjono said. Through spokesman Taheri Noor, the ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] Faction stressed that the single majority issue depends on the aspect from which it is viewed. If seen from the liberal aspect, a single majority admittedly could create dictatorship and tyranny. If viewed from the aspect of Pancasila, however, that will not happen. "Therefore, we must establish the concept or point of view of single majority. We should not hastily draw conclusions that could produce a high level of polemic," said Taheri. Under the Pancasila concept there is no such term as "dictatorship" or "tyranny." There is only deliberation and consensus, which can be achieved despite the existence of a single majority. Therefore, the single majority must be retained. Interferes With Consensus On the other hand, political observer Dr. Afan Gaffar stressed that the single majority idea clearly can interfere with the process of achieving consensus through deliberation. The majority party will use every means to achieve victory for its programs, especially those related to political interests. On the other side, minority parties will find it difficult to present proposals. "A single majority is still needed, however, and everyone has the right to be the single majority. In fact, if GOLKAR wins only 40 percent of the vote in the next general elections, it will still be the majority sociopolitical organization. That will be especially true if it is supported by 100 DPR members from the ABRI Faction," said the instructor from the staff of the UGM [Gadjah Mada University] Sociology and Political Science Faculty. "Actually, a party's becoming a single majority is not a problem, as long as it is done democratically. In other words, there should be no voting fraud or holding of seminars on how to vote that profit only a particular party," he said. In this connection, Afan Gaffar feels that there is indeed a need to revise the implementation of general elections, because although there have been improvements in quality since 1971, the improvements have not been significant. Under revised general election implementation, it is hoped that each sociopolitical organization will be able to do its utmost to seek voter support, consistent with existing political norms and ethics. "The question is whether GOLKAR will want to approve changes in the general election law, which has benefited GOLKAR," Afan Gaffar said.
