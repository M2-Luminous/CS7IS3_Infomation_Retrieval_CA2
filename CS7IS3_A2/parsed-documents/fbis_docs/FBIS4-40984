It was Carter who assumed the mission of intermediary between Pyongyang and the world community after the DPRK announced its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. His unprecedented eight-hour conversation with Kim Il-song, the DPRK leader, resulted in Pyongyang's proposals for settling the crisis, which Carter took to Seoul and Washington. We are talking, in particular, of a proposal to reduce the troops of each of the Korean states by 100,000 men. The DPRK seems to be abandoning its former demands for the unconditional withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and would now like their numerical strength to be reduced in the same proportion as the troops of the North and the South. In agreeing to a meeting with the South Korean president, Kim Il-song would like Washington to act as intermediary if the DPRK fails to find a common language with South Korea. Finally, the chief point. Kim Il-song, according to Carter, will agree to freeze his nuclear program while "conscientious talks" are under way, and has promised not to remove the IAEA inspectors from the nuclear installation and to maintain in working order the monitoring equipment installed there. In return he would like to receive international assistance in making the full switch from a graphite reactor to a light-water reactor. Official Washington has not gone into raptures over these proposals. It has been declared that the United States will not cease its efforts to introduce sanctions against the DPRK until real progress has been made on the nuclear problem. According to Gallucci, Pyongyang's fulfillment of a number of conditions remains the key point. Above all, its pledge not to process nuclear fuel, as well as permission for international inspections of DPRK nuclear installations. If these demands are met, Washington will agree to holding a third round of talks with the DPRK. Despite the emphasized restraint, a sigh of relief is clearly audible in all this. For, as the mutual threats escalated, the situation was getting increasingly out of control. Many people were losing their nerve. Witness the Japanese prime minister's strange statement, to say the least, that his country possesses everything necessary to create nuclear weapons! Yet the idea of sanctions was clearly on the skids owing to the position of China and, partly, of Russia, which reckoned (not without grounds, as we see) that far from all means of persuasion had been used. President Clinton was finding himself in a rather foolish situation: Having raised his hand, he clearly could not strike. This cannot pass without hurting the reputation of a world leader. The situation is still not entirely clear, and it is too soon to sum up results. But if the DPRK now permits inspections and, simultaneously, achieves the realization of even some of its proposals, then Pyongyang will be the obvious winner. If we forget about the high moral ground, then the North Korean politicians have played their game brilliantly. After escalating the situation to the limit, they have promised to sacrifice their nuclear program in exchange for de facto recognition of the DPRK. You can be confident that it will not even occur to anybody in the next few years to put pressure on North Korea over human rights observance or anything else. In politicians' brains it is being imprinted: Do not touch the DPRK, and nothing will threaten the nonproliferation treaty. Pyongyang is not being original in this. It has played the game which Soviet diplomacy also played repeatedly and with success in unforgettable times. The object of the deal here is not nuclear might. The chief thing here is unpredictability in the eyes of the other people in the game. It seems that even now that the Cold War has vanished into the past it is possible to sell your own unpredictability quite well....
