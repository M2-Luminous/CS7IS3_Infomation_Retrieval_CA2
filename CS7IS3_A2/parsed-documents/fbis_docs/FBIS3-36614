However, he refuted the allegations by certain media that this could lead to a merging between the special services and to establishment of a "super department" like the Ministry of Security and Interior Affairs. The Ministry of Security and Interior Affairs was set up in early 1993 on the initiative of former Security Chief Viktor Barannikov under the presidential decree. However, this ministry was soon abolished by the president himself under the Constitutional Court's resolution. The Security Council's official believes that it would be preliminary to discuss possible composition of the "community of special services." According to certain media, the leaders of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal Agency of Governmental Communications and Information, the Main Department of Defense, the president's Security Service, the Intelligence Department of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff and chiefs of the departments which are to be created on the basis of the reorganized Interior Ministry will be included in this body. According to the Security Council's official, it is unlikely that the Russian president will make a practical move towards the coordinating body's establishment. "It is necessary to determine exactly the authority of each integral part of the new body before this happens," the official emphasized.
