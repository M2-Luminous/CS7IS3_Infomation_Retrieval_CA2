This is a new turning point in the U.S.' handling of its relations with China since the "4 June" incident of 1989. Beijing gave a prompt response. The PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement yesterday expressing its welcome for the decision, also pointing out that Sino-American relations face a favorable historic opportunity and that China will continue to adopt measures to develop relations between the two countries. Clinton's decision met the expectations of all quarters, because facts have clearly shown that if the United States continued to apply pressure on the pretext of human rights issues, China would never accept it. If China took retaliatory action, the attack on the United States would not be insignificant. Apart from the United States, Hong Kong's import and export trade would also suffer great setbacks, and even Southeast Asian countries would be generally harmed. A wise man never takes a decision which harms others but does not benefit himself, let alone injures himself. Recently, more and more figures in U.S. financial and economic circles and congressmen have successively issued warnings to Clinton urging him not to act rashly in dealing with China's MFN. The focus of the U.S. economic recovery is centered on the Asia-Pacific region and depends on the vast market of 21st century China, a country with a population of 1.2 billion. [sentence as published] After China rejoins the GATT, large numbers of American products will be exported to China. Under the principle of fair competition, Sino-American trade will develop further. This will also be beneficial to reducing the U.S. trade deficit. The United States is hoping for the expansion of China's vast market America's Boeing and the computer, electronic component, telecommunications, and petrochemical industries are placing high hopes on the expansion of China's vast markets. If the vast market of 1.2 billion with unlimited potential was lost because of the so-called "human rights" issue, leading to a great increase in unemployment, it would have been too late for the decision maker to repent. The change in the situation is independent of man's will. China's political and economic position in the present-day Asia- Pacific region and in the world can no longer be wantonly manipulated by foreign countries. It is incompatible with reason to link human rights with MFN status. It could never hold ground in the international community. The fact is, in the past five years since the "4 June" incident, China has opened its door wider to the outside world and has done more to develop its economy and stabilize its society. Public sentiment has become calm. The advanced nations of the West, Southeast Asian countries, East European countries, Russia, and other countries have been competing with one another to develop economic and trade relations with China. Some figures inside the American government have also realized that it is impossible to continue to use human rights issues to put pressure on China. Clinton's announcement of the delinkage of MFN status renewal from the human rights issue is a wise decision. Instead of him losing face, it is beneficial to enhancing his prestige. New development in relations between the two countries Clinton's decision has also shown that relations among nations cannot be separated from mutual benefits in practice. If the current close economic relations between China and the United States deteriorated because of their dispute over human rights, and both sides suffered because of this, the American people would never support it. On the contrary, if the human rights issue, a hindrance to relations between the two countries, is removed, the development of Sino-American relations will embark on a new and easy path. Recently, the international community has attached importance to the development of China's relations with the four central Asian countries and the improvement in Sino-Ukrainian and Sino-Russian relations. China and Russia are two big nations after all. Of course, the development of China's relations with the central Asian countries and Russia is not targeted at any third country. However, the new cooperation between China and Russia in economics, culture, and science and technology will be further strengthened through Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's visit to China and President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia in September. This is an undeniable trend. Under such a new world situation, no one can tolerate human rights elements undermining Sino-American relations and harming U.S. interests. Is this not clear enough?
