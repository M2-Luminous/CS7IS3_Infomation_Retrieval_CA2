According to Academician I.I. Lishtvin, secretary of the Belarusian Academy of Sciences and director of the Institute for Ecology and Use of Natural Resources, this is connected not only with the aftermath of the catastrophe at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. We have already interfered in biological processes of nature to such an extent that further development of civilization requires special measures. Thus, for instance, while reclaiming a marsh, nobody thought about the harm to the atmosphere -- 1 hectare of marsh equalizes 5 hectares of forests for absorbing pollutants from the atmosphere. Purity of the atmosphere is an issue of great importance especially now, when the stream of cars used in the Republic has increased.
