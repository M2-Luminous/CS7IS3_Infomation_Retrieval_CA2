In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a new major license for the existing Beaver Falls Hydroelectric Project, located on Beaver Falls Creek near the city of Ketchikan, in the First Judicial District of Alaska. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Forest Service, Ketchikan Ranger District, have prepared a Final Environmental Assessment (FEA) for the project that analyzes existing and potential future environmental impacts of the existing project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the FEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
