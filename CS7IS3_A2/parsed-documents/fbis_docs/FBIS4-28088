Security Council, according to a government survey released Saturday [4 June]. The survey conducted by the Foreign Ministry showed 58.9 percent of respondents knew that Japan's permanent membership is being discussed in connection with the reorganization of the Security Council. The poll also found that 52.9 percent think Japan should hold a permanent seat on the council, while 14.8 percent think otherwise. The survey, conducted between late January and February on a sample of 2,000 people aged 20 years or older, is the first of its kind conducted by the ministry. Of those polled, 1,420 replied, ministry officials said. The officials expressed relief over the results of the survey, saying that public interest has been high ever since the government began stepping up debate on the issue last July. Among those supporting Japan's permanent membership, 41.2 percent said that as an economic superpower Japan should actively participate in building world peace, according to the survey. Another 27.5 percent replied that permanent membership by Japan, a nonnuclear state which professes pacifism, would contribute to world peace, while 25 percent said it is strange that Japan cannot contribute its opinions on important decision-making in the U.N. when it is making great financial contributions. Also among the supporters, 41.2 percent said Japan should make contributions as much as possible, including participation in U.N. peacekeeping activities, within the limits of its war-renouncing Constitution. But 38.8 percent said that although Japan should make the utmost in contributions within constitutional limits, it should not make any military contributions, including joining peacekeeping activities. Of those opposed to Japan's permanent membership, 60.7 percent replied that Japan should not take part in making decisions on international peacekeeping which involves military might, while 36.9 percent expressed concern over the greater responsibilities of becoming a permanent member, according to the poll. Also, 20.2 percent said Japan is not great enough as a nation to become a permanent member.
