"To open a discussion on the operation of that base in Honduras, a forum [foro] is needed because Palmerola is under Honduran jurisdiction. It is based on an agreement that never went to (the National) Congress, that is why it must be rectified," he said. According to Reina, the agreement was not sent to Congress because at that time world tensions were very great, but now that there is a time of peace, international cooperation must be used to defend the national interests and to defend the country from such scourges as drug trafficking in the world. The president affirmed that during U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's recent visit to Honduras, the most important topic discussed was the role the country will have at the regional level in the fight against drug trafficking, an area of action in which the nation is at the forefront and serves as an example. He denied the action means a greater presence of foreign troops in the country. He said there will be more dialogue, adding that on other occasions, Cubans have come to the country even though Honduras does not have diplomatic relations with their country and no one complained, as it is being planned now with the possible arrival of the Southern Command Marines [as published]. "I think drug traffickers have been gradually increasing their presence in Honduras. This is a very grave and serious problem. All countries need help and the Central American isthmus, with an important geopolitical position, needs a lot of aid in this regard," Reina added. Reina attributed to "a misunderstanding" the fact that the statements by Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar and William Perry did not coincide on the issue of the transfer of troops from Panama to Honduras. While Perry said this possibility is being considered, Paz Aguilar said this issue "was not addressed" in the recent meeting they held in Palmerola. Asked whether Honduras would support an invasion of Haiti, a topic which it was speculated he discussed with Perry, Reina said "I will never express support for an invasion of any Latin American country, take my word." He said he would not support the measure, even if the United Nations decided on it, because he does not agree with the invasion of countries.
