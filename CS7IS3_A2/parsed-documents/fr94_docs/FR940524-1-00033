IV. Discussion of Proposed Rule_Testing of Particulate Filters The BOM was solely responsible for testing and approving respirators until 1972. In 1972, the existing rules and procedures in 30 CFR part 11 for approval of respiratory protective devices, or respirators, were published jointly by the BOM and NIOSH. Since 1974, the Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration (MSHA's predecessor agency), MSHA, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have regulated the selection, use, and maintenance of respirators in the workplace under their enforcement authorities. With this redesignation of the requirements for the certification of respirators, NIOSH is deleting §§11.2 and 11.21 because these sections of part 11 have been superseded by OSHA's and MSHA's respirator workplace regulations. Also, the codification of the redesignated sections into a non-hyphenated numbering system results in the deletion of several ``general heading'' sections that contain no substantive requirements. These include §§11.85, 11.102, 11.124, 11.140, and 11.162. Existing subpart M of part 11 (§§11.170 through 11.183&hyph;7) addresses the requirements for pesticide respirators. The proposal eliminates this category and the tests specific to it, leaving subpart M reserved. The proposal also eliminates all references to subpart M and pesticides as a classification for approval. Manufacturers can continue to manufacture and market respirators labelled for use as pesticide respirators, as well as other contaminant classifications, based on the testing performed under the proposed filter penetration test. NIOSH, however, would discontinue issuance of certifications that classify these respirators as suitable for use against a specific particulate. The proposed test would provide a suitable determination as to the effectiveness of the filter element in removing particulates from the ambient air, regardless of the contaminant. The existing test requirements in §§11.124&hyph;21 through 11.124&hyph;24 specify a person wearing the respirator to be exposed to an abrasive blasting environment in which the blasting agent is composed of 99+ percent free silica (SiO 2 ). The purpose of this requirement was to determine the adequacy of protection provided in such environments. Over the past two decades, NIOSH has not conducted these tests which would pose known or potential health risks of exposure to fractured crystalline silica to prospective test subjects. These tests have been replaced administratively. This policy will remain in effect until these regulatory requirements are addressed in a later module. The proposed 42 CFR part 84 regulation is generally consistent with the current MSHA and NIOSH respirator approval program, placing responsibility for certifying most respirators with NIOSH. MSHA and NIOSH would continue to jointly review and approve respirators used for mine emergencies, mine rescue, and the associated service-life plans, users' manuals, and other documentation. Among the types of devices for which this role is particularly important are self-contained self-rescue devices. This preserves MSHA's current role in the certification of certain respirators whose unique use in mining is an important part of safeguarding the health and safety of miners. In addition, MSHA would continue to test electrical and electronic components of respirators for use in potentially explosive atmospheres in underground gassy mines and issue a separate MSHA approval under 30 CFR part 18 for such respirators. In implementing the proposed regulation, NIOSH and MSHA will develop a new Memorandum of Understanding which will reflect administrative matters related to respirator approval, including immediate notification to MSHA of field complaints and identified deficiencies concerning approved respirators. With the transfer of part 11 from title 30 to part 84 of title 42, MSHA and NIOSH would no longer process applications for new approvals or extensions of approval of respirators under part 11 provisions. All applications received after the effective date of part 84 will be considered as applications for a new or extension of approval under part 84. NIOSH realizes that with this step in the development of part 84, some of the respirators that are currently approved would need to be modified to meet the new requirements, while some would not. Additionally, with each step in the modular rulemaking approach being pursued, an increasing number of respirator designs will be affected by the new regulation. NIOSH realizes that the incremental implementation of improved test and performance requirements could cause some confusion as to which respirators have demonstrated performance to the improved requirements. To address this possibility, the Institute intends to continue issuing new and extension of approval numbers in the same format designation (TC number) as issued under existing part 11 for those respirator types whose technical requirements for approval under part 84 have not been modified from existing part 11. A new approval number series will be initiated for the products whose technical requirements have been upgraded under part 84. By checking the approval number, respirator users will be able to quickly and easily distinguish those products that have demonstrated the improved performance requirements of the new part 84 from those that have demonstrated compliance with only the existing part 11 standard. The Institute further intends to issue public notices of the new approval designations to be used for the products demonstrating improved performance to alert users that such improved standards are available. Section-by-Section Discussion All sections redesignated to 42 CFR part 84 without modification from 30 CFR part 11 are not included in this discussion of the proposed rule. The sections redesignated without modification will be revised, where appropriate, to: (1) remove references to MSHA, except for those related to certain mining applications, (2) update the NIOSH certifying organization to the Certification and Quality Assurance Branch, Division of Safety Research, NIOSH, 944 Chestnut Ridge Road, Morgantown, West Virginia 26505&hyph;2888, (3) remove references to subpart M, pesticide respirators, and tests for protection during abrasive blasting, and (4) correct nonsubstantive typographical errors and reference the new part 84 section designations. The sections redesignated without modification are as follows: 84.1, 84.3, 84.11, 84.12, 84.21, 84.22, 84.30, 84.31, 84.32, 84.34, 84.35, 84.36, 84.40, 84.41, 84.42, 84.43, 84.50, 84.51, 84.53, 84.60, 84.62, 84.63, 84.64, 84.65, 84.66, 84.70, 84.71, 84.72, 84.73, 84.74, 84.75, 84.76, 84.77, 84.78, 84.79, 84.80, 84.81, 84.82, 84.83, 84.84, 84.85, 84.86, 84.87, 84.88, 84.89, 84.90, 84.91, 84.92, 84.93, 84.94, 84.95, 84.96, 84.97, 84.98, 84.99, 84.100, 84.101, 84.102, 84.103, 84.104, 84.110, 84.111, 84.112, 84.113, 84.114, 84.115, 84.116, 84.117, 84.118, 84.119, 84.120, 84.121, 84.122, 84.123, 84.124, 84.126, 84.130, 84.131, 84.132, 84.133, 84.134, 84.135, 84.136, 84.137, 84.138, 84.139, 84.140, 84.141, 84.142, 84.143, 84.144, 84.145, 84.146, 84.147, 84.148, 84.149, 84.150, 84.151, 84.152, 84.153, 84.154, 84.155, 84.156, 84.157, 84.158, 84.159, 84.160, 84.161, 84.162, 84.163, 84.172, 84.173, 84.174, 84.175, 84.176, 84.178, 84.179, 84.186, 84.190, 84.191, 84.192, 84.193, 84.194, 84.195, 84.196, 84.197, 84.198, 84.199, 84.200, 84.201, 84.202, 84.204, 84.205, 84.207, 84.250, 84.251, 84.252, 84.253, 84.254, 84.255, 84.256, 84.257, and 84.258. These sections, and revisions of these sections, will be subject to public comment in future rulemaking. The following section-by-section analysis discusses each new or revised section to 42 CFR part 84. All part and section references for part 11 are to Title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations (30 CFR). All part and section references for part 84 are to Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations (42 CFR). Subpart A_General Provisions Section 84.2␣Definitions This section would be redesignated and revised from the existing §11.3. The existing definitions for ``air contamination level'', ``Bureau'', ``concentration limits for radionuclides'', ``DOP'', ``MESA'', ``pesticide'', ``radionuclides'', and ``smoke'' would be deleted. These terms are used in provisions that are modified or deleted as a result of the filter penetration test changes being proposed. These definitions would, therefore, become unnecessary. The existing definition for ``Testing and Certification Laboratory'' would be modified to reflect the present name of the organization as the ``Certification and Quality Assurance Branch.''
