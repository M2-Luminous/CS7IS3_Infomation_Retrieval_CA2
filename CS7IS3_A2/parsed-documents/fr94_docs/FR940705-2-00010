Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested parties may obtain copies of the technical specifications for this proposed FIPS for Application Profile for the Government Information Locator Service (GILS) from Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), Computer Systems Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Building, Room B&hyph;64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975&hyph;2816.
