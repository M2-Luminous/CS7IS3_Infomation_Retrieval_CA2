"These actions come from sectors that have yet to understand the role of the new society and the democracy being experienced in the country," Monterrey told LA PRENSA GRAFICA. Monterrey said that for the past 20 days he has been receiving threatening phone calls and communiques both at his office and home. He added that investigations are being conducted to find out who is responsible. The PNC director said that some of the threats have already been carried out, indicating that 15 days ago he was the target of an attack from which he emerged unharmed. As a result of this, he has been forced to take security measures. "I have never in my life had to use bodyguards; I have never even been armed. Unfortunately, I will have to take some precautions so as not to ignore these threats," he added. Monterrey said the PCN has acted firmly against kidnappers, drug traffickers, car theft gangs, and individuals who have been illegally using weapons, so some of these sectors might be responsible for the threats. Monterrey denied that the PNC is becoming militarized, and he said the best witness of the process is Onusal [UN Observers For El Salvador], whose members have participated in the evaluation of the personnel joining the PNC. He explained that, up to the PNC's 13th graduation class, the PNC filled 20 percent of the openings with individuals who had been members of the National Police, as was established in the Peace Agreements, but that from then on, these individuals have not joined the PNC. Nevertheless, the director of the PNC, which was established by the Peace Agreements, said that at this 20th recruitment call the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] has been unable to complete its 20 percent, although it still has time to fill it. According to Monterrey, the middle level ranks of the PNC are filled by persons who have obtained the best scores in their evaluations, so now there can be no discrimination. The PNC is carrying out its functions in 12 of the country's 14 departments, and it is estimated that by the end of October it will be doing so throughout the country with 5,700 members. President Alfredo Cristiani has rejected FMLN charges that the government is trying to militarize the PNC and proposed the creation of a commission to verify this. Cristiani said the government and the FMLN agreed over the weekend that the demobilization of the National Police will be extended until 31 March 1995, because the PNC is still unable to face the increase in crime. He added that they also agreed that an additional number of former National Police members, in excess of the 20 percent established by the Peace Agreements, can enter the PNC following an evaluation and training.
