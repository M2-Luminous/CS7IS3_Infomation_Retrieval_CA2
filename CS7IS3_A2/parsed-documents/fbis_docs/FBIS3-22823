However, taking inflation into account, the figure represents a decrease in real terms, Francois Godet, deputy secretary general of the Federal Military Department (DMF), told ATS. Since 1987's record figure (Sf578.3 million), the amount of arms exports has fallen each year. Mr. Godet says that this downward trend can be explained by the increased arms sales by "threshold countries," such as the former Communist countries in Eastern Europe. European Union as the Main Customer In 1993, Switzerland's biggest individual customer was Malaysia, with sales amounting to Sf50.7 million. Germany ranked second (Sf41.5 million), followed by Saudi Arabia (Sf36.9 million). From a geographical point of view, the European Union is the main purchaser of Swiss arms at Sf79.1 million, followed by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, both totaling Sf45 million. Other major customers include Sweden and Singapore (Sf16 million each), Canada (11.9 million), the United States (Sf8.6 million), Austria (Sf7.6 million), the Philippines (Sf4.1 million), the Netherlands (Sf3.8 million), and Brazil (Sf1.4 million). The smallest customer was Estonia, which spent Sf21 [as received] for explosives and chemicals for civil use.
