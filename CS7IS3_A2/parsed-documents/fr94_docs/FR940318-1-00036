FR940318-1-00036 FR940318-1-00013 4. Demonstration As noted, the initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). Alternatively, the State must show that attainment by December 31, 1994 is impracticable. In the General Preamble, EPA recommended that the attainment demonstrations for the initial moderate areas follow existing modeling guidelines for PM 10 or, if appropriate, be developed consistent with the supplemental attainment demonstration policy issued for initial areas (see 57 FR 13539). Wyoming conducted an attainment demonstration using dispersion modeling in combination with receptor modeling for Sheridan. The State submitted the PM 10 modeling protocol to EPA on July 12, 1988. The submittal included an explanation justifying the protocol, as follows: since the PM 10 data collected during the 11 quarters prior to development of the initial modeling protocol were in compliance with the 24-hour PM 10 standard, the Division did not find it necessary to model for the 24-hour standard. 5 In fact, a violation of the 24-hour PM 10 NAAQS has not been monitored in this area. 6 A single exceedence of 198 μg/m3 was monitored on November 12, 1991. However, data results (Attachment 6 of the Appendix to the SIP) showed that, even with the ``gray zone'' allowance, the annual PM 10 standard had been violated. (The ``gray zone'' allowance refers to a 20 percent overestimation of PM 10 concentrations resulting from design flaws in the pre-1987 non-reference Sierra Anderson SA321A sampler; the problem was resolved when the sampler was modified and became the SA321B.) This explained the reasoning for the State's decision to focus on the annual standard, and for the annual PM 10 standard of 50 μg/m3 becoming the controlling standard. EPA responded to the State on October 26, 1988 supporting this approach. 5 The Act requires demonstration of attainment by December 31, 1994. However, when this SIP was submitted, the Group I requirements called for attainment demonstration in 1989, with maintenance through 1994. Although the State did submit additional information in response to the Clean Air Act Amendments, the demonstration of attainment did not change. EPA believes, however, that since the Wyoming DEQ has shown maintenance of the NAAQS through 1994, the State has met the requirements to show attainment by December 31, 1994. 6 EPA does not anticipate much change in population, based upon population data for Sheridan County submitted by DEQ on November 8, 1991. The data were obtained from the January 1988 and July 1991 reports from the Department of Administration and Information, Division of Economic Analysis, ``Wyoming Population and Employment Forecast Report.'' The population forecast including the years 1986 (population = 26,449) through 1994 (population = 24,209), indicates that Sheridan County will not reach the 1986 population until the year 2004. After having examined the impact of growth on the 24-hour PM 10 NAAQS, the Division is confident of maintenance of the standard. The demonstration for the annual standard indicates that the NAAQS for PM 10 will be attained by 1989 in Sheridan, Wyoming, and maintained. 7 Maintenance of the standard was addressed in the Division's December 20, 1989 letter to EPA. The annual PM 10 NAAQS standard will be attained when the expected annual arithmetic mean concentration is less than or equal to 50 μg/m3. The original demonstration predicted that the annual design concentration in the attainment year of 1989 would be 48.8 μg/m3 (Control Option # 6, 1989 SIP). The revised attainment demonstration submitted in March 1990, predicted an annual concentration of 46 μg/m3, demonstrating attainment of the annual PM 10 NAAQS. The control strategy used to achieve the annual design concentration is summarized in the section titled ``RACM (including RACT).'' As discussed, because there have been no violations of the 24-hour PM 10 standard in Sheridan, an attainment analysis of the 24-hour standard was not performed. EPA believes that the controls adopted to protect the annual standard are sufficient to maintain the 24-hour standard. For a more detailed description of the attainment demonstration and the control strategies used, see the TSD accompanying this document. 7 See footnote 5. 5. PM 10 Precursors The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM 10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels in excess of the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). The General Preamble contains guidance addressing how EPA intends to implement section 189(e) (57 FR 13539&hyph;13540 and 13541&hyph;13542).
