Oudejans report: "Netherlands Adopts Wait-And-See Attitude Toward Mexico"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Netherlands companies are also showing increasing interest in Mexico, it emerged last week during the three-day working visit to Mexico by Economics Minister J.E. Andriessen. "We see Mexico as a country in the process of stabilization which offers ever greater growth potential," the minister said there. The ministry likes to visit Mexico, although the country is number 40 in the list of the Netherlands's trading partners. Andriessen's previous visit was in November 1991, while his secretary of state, Yvonne van Rooy, led a trade mission to Mexico only a year ago. In his meetings last week with President Salinas and other key figures in various ministries and large Mexican companies, the minister had a long shopping list with him. To mention a few things: Martinair wants to acquire landing rights, while Van Ommeren has shown an interest in providing container processing in the Mexican harbors which are to be privatized this year. Aircraft manufacturer Fokker is positive about potential sales to Mexican airlines, but sees problems in financing possible orders. Schiphol is involved in the plans to expand the international airport in Mexico City, while there are also plans to build a new airport just outside the city. In turn, the Netherlands Government wants to provide assistance in developing the harbor in the coastal town of Veracruz. Cooperation on the governmental level is also being sought in the field of medical technology and, in the spring, a return visit by a delegation from the Mexican Energy Ministry is expected to examine how coal gasification is conducted in the Netherlands. There are opportunities to spare, above all in the infrastructure where large investments are expected in the coming years in NAFTA's wake. Various Netherlands engineering consulting firms have already become involved in this sector. In addition Andriessen thinks there are opportunities for Mexican industry to set up a European distribution center in the Netherlands. [passage omitted]
