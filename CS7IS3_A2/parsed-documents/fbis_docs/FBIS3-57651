Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Kot, Commander in Chief of the Russian Air Force, Discusses Some Results of Last Year's Combat Training and Aviators' Tasks This Year"] [Text] [Kot] I will not hide the fact that last year was a difficult one for us. Not everything was done as we planned and as we would have liked. Nonetheless there is some cause for satisfaction. I think that the main task was accomplished: The combat readiness of the Air Force matches the requirements of the time. The High Command focused its main efforts on implementing the plan for the organizational development of the Air Force, which made provision for improving the organizational structure and the command and control system, and on creating combat ready aviation groupings on Russia's new borders. A fundamentally new approach to the use of the Air Force was sought. It was essential to arrive at a balanced ratio between combat and support components. To some extent we have achieved this. [Babichev] It was pointed out when the Defense Ministry summed up the results of 1993 that flying time had dropped in the Air Force. What impact has this had on the state of combat readiness? [Kot] The country's economic difficulties have affected the combat readiness of the Air Force and the Armed Forces as a whole. Irregular supplies of fuel and lack of the requisite quantity of spare parts prevented the flight training plan from being implemented in full. But when talking about figures for overall flying time you must bear in mind that in this period there has been a tremendous drop in the number of Air Force personnel, flight personnel included. The size of the aircraft pool has dropped as a result of obsolete aircraft being removed from the arsenal. You could not therefore have expected overall flying time -- compared with last year -- to remain the same with that kind of reorganization of the Air Force. Nonetheless throughout the past year we tried to keep personnel's air combat proficiency at the requisite level. Exercises conducted in conjunction with other branches of the Armed Forces demonstrated that we were successful in this. As well as tackling combat training tasks last year military-transport pilots transported over 10,000 [as published] people and over 11,000 tonnes of national economic freight. We delivered technological equipment to the Surgut oil men, metal working machines to the Norilsk mining and metallurgical combine, and humanitarian freight from Germany. Residents of various parts of the country experienced military-transport aviation's aid. Logged flying hours and lasting skills have always been the basis of successful flight operations. Regrettably, pilots' average flying time is in fact a long way from well-founded norms. I myself am a pilot and know where this can lead. Nonetheless, in 1993 we managed to somewhat reduce the number of air crashes. While being aware of the acuteness of problems of material and technical support for the Air Force and their adverse effect on flight safety, I must admit that they are not responsible for the chronic accident rate. Most of the accidents in the air could have been averted had personnel acted competently. Accidents and crashes are primarily due to flagrant deviations from procedures for organizing flights and carrying out missions. When analyzing the results of the year we would note that, despite all the difficulties inherent in the situation, around 90 percent of aviation regiments operated accident-free. The Air Force High Command has not created any special conditions for them. This convinces us that it is possible to avoid accidents and disasters when flying. All that is needed is systematic preventive work by all categories of airmen. [Babichev] You broached the question of the reduction in personnel. It is a topical subject, one that worries many people, sometimes giving rise not only to well-founded demands, but also to misinterpretation.... [Kot] That's true. I would like to point out right away that it is primarily the Air Force managerial apparatus that is being cut back. Authorized strength has been cut by 34,200 servicemen in total. The Air Force remembers the grim wholesale cadre cuts during the late fifties and early sixties. The result being thousands of shattered lives and a drastic slowdown in aircraft development. It subsequently took the Air Force almost 25 years to take wing again. The present reduction in officer cadres has had virtually no impact on the activity of combined formations and units. It is primarily officers who have completed their legally prescribed term of service and who are socially secure who are being discharged. We are not ordering those people to stay on if they have decided to leave military service for some reason and find themselves a post in civilian structures. Admittedly, there are fewer of them around now. The reverse is already starting to happen. Many people have become disenchanted after working or attempting to work for commercial structures and are asking to be reinstated in the ranks of the Armed Forces. [Babichev] What is the reason for this, in your view? [Kot] I primarily think that this is happening because officers are more secure than they were before and, second, it is hard for a military man -- after several years serving in a team of officers where he always met with understanding, experienced mutual assistance, and felt confident in the future -- to get accustomed to new relationships, different ways of achieving objectives, and the individualism that exists in a civilian environment. Part of my job is to talk to officers who have had an opportunity to compare life in and outside the Army. Many of them are profoundly convinced that by no means everyone can find a niche on civvy street. We take an understanding view of those who are determined to continue serving in the Air Force. When thinking about the future of the Air Force, we pay particular attention to young officers. Despite the acute housing problems almost every one of them, on entering a line unit after graduating from school, gets a place in an officers' hostel. Where possible family men are given apartments. What is more a relocation allowance -- which did not previously exist -- to some extent helps overcome material difficulties. [Babichev] The problem of servicemen's social security has always been among the most acute. Not least for those returning home from nearby foreign countries and further afield. How do things stand now in the Air Force with the troop withdrawal? What has been done for the "returnees"? [Kot] In 1993 around 200 units were withdrawn from nearby foreign countries and further afield, including two formation command elements, four combined formation command elements, 17 Air Force regiments, and support units. People's futures and tremendous work involved in accommodating the withdrawn units and personnel and preserving the tremendous material assets and equipment lie behind these figures. We are doing everything to ensure that every servicemen feels that there is a reception waiting for him at home. Thus, in the past year around 6,000 apartments have been built under the capital construction plan, over 900 finished apartments have been bought with state budget money, over 200 with extrabudgetary funds, and over 600 apartments procured through foreign firms' efforts. While aware that these figures will not alleviate the acuteness of the housing problem, we are working for the future. The situation is as follows: At the beginning of 1994 families without apartments total around 30,000 people. [Babichev] Viktor Sevastyanovich, in the new year of 1994, it is evidently not only the housing problem that is worrying Air Force command. What else affects combat readiness? [Kot] We are most concerned over the good repair of the aircraft fleet and the problem of further improving aviation technology and arms. The drop in defense order appropriations and the lag in the indexation of the allocated funds are forcing us to seek new approaches to resolving these problems. We are focusing our main efforts on top-priority developments of fifth-generation aviation complexes and buying spare parts to maintain the aircraft fleet in a state of good repair. We are not complaining about the problems, but seeking ways to resolve them. The leadership of the Air Force High Command realizes the importance and complexity of the tasks set by the defense minister for the new training year and is taking steps to carry them out.
