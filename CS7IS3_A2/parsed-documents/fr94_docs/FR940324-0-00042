FR940324-0-00042 FR940324-0-00018 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Parts 204 and 282 [Docket No. 930639&hyph;4074; I.D. 012194B] RIN 0648&hyph;AE18 South Pacific Tuna Fisheries AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NMFS adopts the interim final rule implementing revisions to the annexes to the Treaty on Fisheries Between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America (Treaty) as final with one change. As a result of public comments, NMFS hereby modifies the definition of Treaty. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 24, 1994. ADDRESSES: Requests for license applications, copies of the Treaty and Annexes, and further information should be addressed to Anneka W. Bane, Acting Director, Southwest Region, NMFS, 501 W. Ocean Blvd., suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Svein Fougner, (310) 980&hyph;4034. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The background and specifics of the Treaty have been published (54 FR 4033, January 27, 1989; 56 FR 19312, April 26, 1991; 58 FR 33565, June 18, 1993) and are not repeated here. The South Pacific Tuna Act, 16 U.S.C. Chapter 16C (Act), authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to issue regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes and objectives of the Treaty. The Treaty was signed in 1987 by the United States and member states of the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA). The 16 island nations participating under the Treaty and collectively referred to as the Pacific Island Parties are Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Republic of Kiribati, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Republic of Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Republic of Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Kingdom of Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Western Samoa. The Treaty authorizes U.S. tuna vessels to fish within fishing zones of a large region of the South Pacific. NMFS is responsible for most of the day-to-day operational aspects of the United States obligations under the Treaty; the Department of State is responsible for the formal country-to-country contacts under the Treaty. On May 13, 1992, negotiations were concluded to amend and extend for 10 years: (1) The Annexes to the Treaty, and (2) schedule 2 to Annex II of the Treaty. On June 18, 1993, NMFS published an interim final rule that implemented the May 1992 amendments (58 FR 33565). This rule adopts as final the interim final rule published on June 18, 1993, with one minor change regarding the definition of Treaty. This change was suggested based on public comment and is described below. Comments and Responses The only comment on the interim final rule was received from the Department of State. The commenter pointed out that the Annexes to the Treaty were not amended on May 13, 1992, as implied in the definition of Treaty as revised by NMFS's interim final rule; only the negotiations were concluded. He suggested deleting the reference to May 13, 1992, in the new definition of Treaty. NMFS agrees and has deleted the date from the definition. (Subsequently, the Annex revisions were ratified, effective June 15, 1993). Classification Because it involves a foreign affairs function of the United States, this action is not subject to section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act. Thus, this rule may be made immediately effective. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 282 Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Treaties.
