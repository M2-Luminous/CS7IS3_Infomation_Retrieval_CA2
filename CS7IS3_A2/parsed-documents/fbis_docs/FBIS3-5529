Christopher's three-day visit will be the first direct high-level contact between Tokyo and Washington after U.S. President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa jointly announced the collapse of bilateral trade framework negotiations in Washington last month. The failure of the talks, aimed at redressing the huge trade imbalance, prompted the U.S. Government to take tough actions against Japan, including an executive order to reinstate a 1988 trade law. The Super 301 measure gives the U.S. Administration broad powers to impose sanctions against countries it judges to have unfair trade practices. While U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said in announcing the step that the U.S. is not "designating or identifying any practice of any country today," the action is widely said to be targeting Japan to press it into reducing its more than 60 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. Reinstatement of Super 301 was reportedly considered by U.S. officials as soon as bilateral trade talks broke down on February 11. While voicing conern over such "unilateral" moves in the wake of the just-concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, the Japanese Government, at least on surface, reacted calmly, saying it was expected because Clinton had hinted of a reinstatement since his presidential election campaign. Tokyo and Washington, failing to close the gap on the concept of "objective criteria" to measure the penetration of imports into Japanese markets, are now in a cooling-off period. Japan, under pressure from the U.S. and Europe to open its markets to reduce its growing current account and trade surpluses, is currently making strenuous efforts to hammer out a package of voluntary market-opening measures by the end of the month. When Christopher meets Japanese leaders, including Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, probably on Thursday, bilateral economic problems, including the failed framework talks, are likely to be high on the agenda, Foreign Ministry sources said. The Japanese side is expected to explain the upcoming market- opening package and seek U.S. understanding, while expressing concern over the reinstatement of Super 301, according to sources. "I think there are great attentions to what Christopher has to say concerning the framework talks," a senior ministry official said. "But frankly, I don't think there will be any new moves as a result of the visit," the official said on condition of anonymity. As ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said, it may be difficult to offer Christopher "concrete ideas " about the market-opening package although the cabinet ministers meet Wednesday to map it out. "The government does need a bit more time before it is able to make an announcement on the complete action to be taken," Terada said. With no immediate breakthrough likely in the economic arena, the Japanese officials hope to deflect focus on economic and trade issues and instead shed more light on two other aspects of bilateral relations, the political and security fields. "It's a good opportunity to show that Japan-U.S. relations do not simply revolve around economic matters," another senior ministry official said. Terada said that economic and trade problems are "just one of the agenda items" and that Christopher's visit provides "ample opportunity to exchange views on the international situation." Hosokawa and Christopher are likely to discuss China, since the secretary of state will fly to Beijing after leaving Tokyo on Friday and Hosokawa is scheduled to visit China from March 19 to 21, he said. Christopher and Japanese leaders are expected to reaffirm the importance of bilateral security arrangements and reconfirm cooperation in solving problems involving North Korea's nuclear development. Japan and the U.S. are also expected to hold the first "two- plus-two" security talks, with undersecretary of defense Frank Wisner accompanying Christopher. Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi will join Hata. Christopher will also attend an international conference on aid to Cambodia on Thursday and deliver a speech to business leaders Friday. This will be Christopher's third trip to Japan. He visited Tokyo last April to attend the Group of Seven (G-7) ministerial conference on aid to Russia and last July for the G-7 summit meeting.
