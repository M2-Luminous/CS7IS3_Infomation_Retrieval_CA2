National states that these tariff sheets are filed in compliance with the order issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``Commission'') on May 4, 1994. National states that an earlier compliance filing was rejected by the Commission in a letter order issued on June 10, 1994. National states that it proposes to allocate to its customers their share of the fixed take-or-pay charges collected from National by CNG Transmission Corporation (``CNG'') and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (``Tennessee'') using the 1988 and 1992 WRQ components which it states is the closest measure on National's system that approximates the Tennessee and CNG flowthrough methodologies. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 or 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 or 385.214). All such motions to intervene or protest should be filed on or before June 28, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
