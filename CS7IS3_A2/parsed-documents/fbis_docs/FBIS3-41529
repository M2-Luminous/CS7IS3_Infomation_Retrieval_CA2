The representatives of the NEPA [National Environmental Protection Act] coalition filed suit three years ago with a U.S. court calling for environmental impact studies to be undertaken at the U.S. military facilities at Atsugi and Yokosuka in Kanagawa Prefecture and Iwakuni in Yamaguchi Prefecture. They had called for the study to be ordered in accordance with the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), a U.S. law that requires environmental impact studies on federal projects. But the U.S. federal district court in Washington ruled last November that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing in seeking remedies from U.S. courts. The ruling followed the U.S. Navy counsel's argument that NEPA does not extend to overseas U.S. military operations. NEPA coalition representatives said the decision was taken because the chances of an appeals court overturning the November ruling appeared dim. They said the coalition would continue seeking ways to get the U.S. Navy to reduce noise emitted by planes simulating carrier landings and takeoffs at the airfield.
