Czaczkowska and Jan Bazyl Lipszyc: "Summit Meeting After Rosati's Resignation; Popiwek--A Political Issue"] [Text] The government coalition met a double defeat on Thursday [7 April]: It did not override the president's veto, and, second, the summit meeting of the president, the prime minister, and the head of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] will be held only after the coalition officially abandons the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati for the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister. On Thursday, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy, who paid a visit to the president, made efforts to organize such a meeting. Perhaps as soon as today the Sejm will discuss the new bill on wage control. The New Bill as Soon as Today? The coalition is of the opinion that the president's rejection of the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] law was a political decision. The opposition claims that it voted against it because it was a bad law. The president's veto was not rejected because the only deputies who voted against it were those of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the SLD--and not all of them at that. The deputies of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] voted contrary to the coalition's decisions, and a substantial number of the PSL deputies did not take part in the ballot at all. Before the voting, Prime Minister Waldemar Palwak said that the debate on the law was a discussion "over who is who on the political scene." When it turned out that the result of the voting was negative for the government and the coalition, he did not respond to the question of whether the government already had another bill on wage controls and, if so, when it would be submitted in the Sejm. Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy said that, if the Sejm decided to shorten the legislative procedures, the new bill might be discussed as early as today. "I am counting on a responsible attitude of the managers of enterprises, on trade unions, when they have thought this issue over," the prime minister appealed and asked not to dramatize the situation. Marek Borowski still maintains his opinion that the president's veto was of a political, not a substantive, nature. He said: "It is some kind of a success for the president; however, it may turn into his failure if the government and the coalition close ranks and are able to oppose the destructive activities of Lech Walesa. As a result of this, further such successes by the president will be impossible, and the coalition will be strengthened. The president has decided to make himself felt on the political scene in a manner that is detrimental to the economy." According to Marek Borowski, the government must start controlling wage increases with other methods, which are more time-consuming and more difficult than the popiwek. Treasury Partnerships may be controlled directly, other state-run enterprises through fiscal offices. "This calls for firm action by the government, and it is more inconvenient for enterprises; however, in this situation, there is no better solution. This is a challenge for the government and the coalition," stated Borowski. President's Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski said that if the Sejm amends the new popiwek law, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the president will then sign this law. A Meeting Yes, Rosati No While visiting the president, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy tried to arrange a summit meeting between the coalition and the president; he also attempted to persuade the president to sign the budget law. After the talk, Andrzej Drzycimski once again declared on behalf of the president the desire to meet with the coalition leaders. However, the condition for such a talk was "an unequivocal decision concerning the candidacy of Rosati"--that is, abandoning it, as well as "joint topics"--the name of a new candidate for deputy prime minister. "Rosati is out of the question," Drzycimski repeated once again. "The president should be consulted on the new candidacy before it is announced to the public," the spokesman said. "If one wants to obtain the acceptance of a candidacy, it is customary to hold such consultations." Following the meeting with the president, Jozef Oleksy said that the "summit" meeting is possible "any day now." "The date of the meeting is not up to us," stated Drzycimski. It seems that the conditions necessary for holding this meeting may be met no sooner than next week. The president wants to talk with politicians who think seriously about the country's affairs. Seriously, he explained--that is when they do not call one another names. During the talk with the president, Oleksy proposed holding meetings with "the leading people" in the country, not in order to make decisions but to agree on a joint opinion. Drzycimski explained that the president believes that the meetings among the leading politicians should be held within constitutional bodies, such as the National Security Council, for instance. He recalled that the law on the general defense duty had gotten stuck in the government. It is worth recalling that the bill was drafted by the military specialists from the General Headquarters. It seems that its first chapter, which defines, among other things, the powers of the president in the area of controlling the issues of the state's defense, prepared in line with the Belweder's suggestions, would probably be unacceptable for the present coalition. According to Drzycimski, the president has not yet decided whether to sign the budget law and the electoral law to gmina [smallest administrative units] councils. The Sejm speaker feels that the president will most likely not sign the latter. The Defeat of the Coalition The PSL deputies agreed that the result of the voting on the president's veto was a definite defeat for the coalition. Roman Jagielinski said that the defeat was caused by the fact that some SLD as well as PSL deputies were not entirely convinced that this law was right; in the previous voting, they were forced to support this law, even though in the election campaign both parties were against the popiwek. "The president's decision was political, and we gave him good reason to make such a decision by extending wage control to the private sector," Jagielinski stated. "We should draw the following conclusion from this: It is necessary to close our ranks because there is no alternative to the coalition. Then this defeat will turn out to be beneficial to us." "The irresponsible statements that a new law will be forwarded to the Sejm are the worst. As a result of them, wages will go up very fast," fears Maciej Manicki, who, along with other OPZZ deputies, supported the president's veto in the Sejm ballot. According to him, the unionists did not vote like the rest of the coalition because they had much more important issues in mind than merely the game played between the Belweder and the government. It was a law that was supposed to be retroactive--from 1 April--and was thus a violation of the law. "The Constitutional Tribunal would immediately query it, so it was better to put an end to it today," Manicki believes. According to him, the fact that the union's deputies voted differently will cause friction within the SLD Club; however, it will only be temporary. He also draws attention to the fact that as many as 20 PSL deputies did not vote at all. "This was a bad law, and the opposition voted against it in the previous voting," said Andrzej Potocki, of the Democratic Union [UD]. "No one should have expected that we would change our minds. We do not side with anyone in the dispute between the coalition and the president." According to Andrzej Potocki, before the debate, the coalition did not try to speak with the opposition or try to persuade it to change its opinion. He said that, if a new bill is submitted that would not have all of the defects found in the rejected law, UD might support it because it believes that it is necessary to curb wage increases.
