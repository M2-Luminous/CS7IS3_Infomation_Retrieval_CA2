The Japanese media gave high coverage of the statement and it became a political issue in the Diet causing a serious controversy. Both opposition and ruling parties of Japan strongly opposed the Japanese Government's opinion. Forced to retreat, the Japanese Foreign Ministry deleted the clause from the statement without making a juridical judgment and said: "The use of nuclear weapons may not conform with the humanitarian spirit, which is the basis of international law, due to the fatal destruction and massacre power." This was the conclusion made by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Foreign Minister Kakizawa Koji after being denounced by the Diet. However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry is not changing its previous stance that it is legal according to international law. The Japanese Foreign Ministry asserts: "As long as there is no treaty prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons, as in the case of biochemical weapons, the use of nuclear weapons is not against international law." However, this is only the pretext and the real reason is that "if Japan admits that the use of nuclear weapons is illegal, the precondition of Japan's security safeguard would be destroyed since Japan depends on the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty as far as nuclear deterrence capability is concerned." Taking into account the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the Japanese Government has in fact told the allies on various official and unofficial occasions since the sixties that the use of nuclear weapons is not against the law. However, things have changed since the end of the Cold War. Russia has withdrawn its nuclear weapons, which it had aimed at the United States and UK, and the United States and Russia have begun to abolish strategic nuclear arms. The North Korean nuclear is the biggest issue now. Foreign Minister Kakizawa is silent to the opposition party's question: "Does it mean it is not against international law for North Korea to use nuclear weapons?" It is clearly anachronistic that the Japanese foreign minister is insisting on the old assertion to justify the use of nuclear weapons. It also shows that Japan's diplomacy has ignored the sentiment of its people and the diplomats only count efficiency and national interests. This makes us suspect the Japanese Government's hidden intention. Despite the fact that the Japanese people are allergic to nuclear weapons because Japan is the first country in the world to be bombed by atomic bombs, the Japanese Government is insisting on legalizing the use of nuclear weapons instead of drawing up a treaty to prohibit the use or overall ban on nuclear tests. It is indeed unreasonable. We would like to believe that the Japanese Foreign Ministry's assertion is to provide itself with a basis for possessing nuclear weapons in case of an emergency.
