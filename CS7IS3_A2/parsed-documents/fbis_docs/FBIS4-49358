They said in the letter that "cancelling China's MFN status would hurt American business interests and opportunities in Chinese markets as well as American general interests in Asia." They expressed their strong support for the unconditional renewal of MFN status to China and pointed out that the MFN should not be linked to human rights. They said they have been very pleased to realize that the U.S. and China have been improving their cooperation and mutual understanding on many issues. "We have been very proud to witness that China has been working with the U.S. on many of these issues and providing significant contributions to human civilization on this earth," they also said. They noted that "we continue to believe a view, shared by many outstanding Americans, that a good relationship between the U.S. and China will continue to serve the best national interests of these two great countries."
