At a conference in Budapest, EU Agriculture Commissioner Rene Steichen warned that excessive price subsidies led to expensive over-production, as it had in West Europe. A text of his speech was made available here. Steichen said the Union was ready to support agricultural reform in East Europe, but also intended to protect EU farmers against floods of cheap agricultural imports from the region.
