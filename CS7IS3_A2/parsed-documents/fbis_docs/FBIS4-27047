The aim of the tour is to strengthen economic cooperation with the three countries, particularly Germany its main economic and commerical partner in Europe, said Li in a brief press conference before leaving. "During my visit (to Germany) I will sign some contracts and letters of intent," he added. He said he would also have an exchange of views with leaders in all three countries on the international situation, but did not elaborate. It is the second major European tour Li has undertaken in the past two and a half years. Early in 1992 he visited Spain, Portugal, Italy and Switzwerland. "China attaches great importance to its relations with European countries," said Li. Due to serious heart problems Li, 65, did not travel abroad last year. But in May this year he undertook a 10-day tour of centrial Asian countries. "I have completely recovered. I work eight hours a day, sometimes longer," he said. During his absence vice-prime minister Zhu Rongji will be in charge of the government.

Mr Li blamed Britain for the strained relations over the question of Hong Kong. He said he hoped Sino-British economic and trade relations would develop, but it was not possible to free them from the adverse effects of the cool political relationship. Mr Li, who was speaking at a news conference before leaving for a visit to Austria, Germany, and Romania, pointedly praised Germany for its long-standing cooperation with China."]
