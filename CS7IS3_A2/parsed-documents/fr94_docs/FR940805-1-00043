FR940805-1-00043 FR940805-1-00008 Section 51.360(a)(5) states that in order for an owner to receive a waiver, repairs on vehicles newer than 1980 models must be performed by recognized repair technicians. Repairs by non-technicians can be applied toward the waiver limit only if the vehicle was manufactured prior to 1980. Under the Minnesota I/M program, repairs by non-technicians can be applied towards the waiver limit for any vehicle subject to the I/M program (i.e. 1976 model year and newer). The USEPA has advised MPCA that the Statute and Rules must be amended to only allow repairs by non-technicians for vehicles manufactured between 1976 and 1979 to be applied towards the waiver limit. In the July 5, 1994 letter from Charles Williams, Commissioner, MPCA commits to taking the necessary actions to amend the Statute and Rules so that they are consistent with the I/M final rule. USEPA proposes to conditionally approve the SIP based on this commitment. MPCA must submit these amendments as a SIP revision within one year of final conditional approval. Section 51.360(a)(6) establishes the minimum repair expenditure that vehicle owners must incur in order to qualify for a waiver under basic I/M programs. In basic I/M programs, owners must expend a minimum of $75 for pre-1981 vehicles and $200 for 1981 and later vehicles. Minnesota statute 116.62 Subdivision 5(c) establishes expenditure limits of $75 for pre-1981 vehicles and $200 for 1981 and later vehicles, but imposes no requirement for a minimum repair expense to qualify for a waiver. The USEPA has advised the State that the statutory minimum expenditure limits must be amended so that they are consistent with the final Federal regulations and vehicle owners are required to present proof of repair expenditures before a waiver can be granted. In a letter to Regional Administrator Adamkus, the MPCA commits to take the necessary action to amend the State's statutes and rules for waivers so that they are consistent with the I/M final rule. USEPA proposes to conditionally approve the SIP based on this commitment. MPCA must submit these amendments as a SIP revision within one year of final conditional approval. Section 51.360(a)(9) allows time extensions up to the length of the inspection cycle to be granted to vehicle owners when repairs are needed on a vehicle in the case of economic hardship, but the extension can only be granted one time for a vehicle and the extension must be tracked and reported by the program. Minnesota grants temporary extensions, which are valid for only 30 days, under three circumstances: (1) when a vehicle will not be available for inspection during the 90-day period before registration expiration; (2) a vehicle has failed the initial inspection and additional time is needed for repair and reinspection; and (3) the vehicle registration has been expired for at least 12 months or more. Although the Federal rule only allows for extensions in cases of economic hardship, the State has successfully tracked the number of vehicles issued temporary extensions and those vehicles which have violated the terms of the extension. Minnesota estimates that between July 1, 1992 and June 30, 1993, approximately 50,000 vehicle owners were issued temporary extensions. MPCA estimates that to date, approximately 10,000 vehicles or less are non-compliant. These 10,000 non-compliant vehicles represent approximately 1 percent of the total number of vehicles subject to the I/M program requirements. The non-compliant vehicles are accounted for in the Mobile 5a modeling results submitted by the State which demonstrates compliance with the basic I/M performance standard. USEPA therefore believes that the Minnesota I/M temporary extension provisions are approvable.
