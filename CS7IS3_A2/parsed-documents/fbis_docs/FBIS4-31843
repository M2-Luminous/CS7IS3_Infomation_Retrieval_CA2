The increasingly frequent artillery attacks of the Bosnian Serbs on this city support such a forecast. Even the most responsible commanders of the peacekeeping forces responsible for the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina are no longer denying that Tuzla could be the most likely next target of the military strategists in Pale. And that is only a confirmation of prior voiced reflections and pessimism of the most prestigious military commentators at an earlier date. There are several reasons why Tuzla is a real thorn in the eye of Radovan Karadzic. Neglecting the fact that the aggressor's teeth have been broken in vain on Tuzla for the last two years and that over that same period of time the region that goes with it did not lose the identity of the largest free territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is well-known that all the activities of the 2d Corps of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina are directed from that city. Only the viewers, listeners, and readers of aggressor media are still unaware of the effectiveness with which combat is being organized and waged not only defensively along lines from Orasje to Srebrenik, Kladanj, and Olovo, and on the Majevica, Ozren, and other battlefields in northeastern Bosnia, because the truth about the defeats they have experienced is carefully concealed from them. Threats From Pale The Tuzla Airport is the largest stumbling block for peace in Tuzla. All those to whom the "Serbian cause is dear" clearly and loudly oppose its being opened to traffic. Saying that that airport would be used to advance weapons, and this would be done under the patronage of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], Karadzic and his ideological-military team did not even stop short of outright threats in their "most vigorous opposition to that intention." When the first aircraft landed at Dubrave, it became evident that those were not merely empty words. One of them, a Russian plane with cargo for the peacekeeping forces, barely avoided a disaster, thanks only to the pilot's quick thinking. Whether because of the indecisiveness of the man giving the orders from the East River or for some other reason, even the Blue Helmets have not shown themselves to be any more resolute in punishing those who have been striking at their own lives. It is no wonder, then, that the airport near Tuzla has received a total of some 20 aircraft. And the threats from Pale have not been withdrawn; on the contrary, they are continuing and they are being pursued; Dubrave is an increasingly frequent target of artillery attacks, with and without aircraft. What is more, it is an open secret that Tuzla is a strong logistical center for the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Tuzla has also been the target of projectiles from Majevica in recent days. It is felt that the rebellious Serbs are firing on that city to take revenge for the defeats they have suffered on that very mountain, and the still more disastrous defeats at Konjuh and Ozren. The people of Tuzla, however, are thinking anxiously about what lies ahead for them. An announcement has come from the commander in chief of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Rasim Delic has personally confirmed this in several public statements, that a decisive offensive against Serbian support points is coming. Admiral Smith's Gloomy Forecasts It is clear even to Adm. Smith, commander of the Southern NATO Flank, that there are serious threats to Tuzla. "I already have television pictures before my eyes that will show all over the world how transport planes are burning on the Tuzla Airport or pictures about yet another massacre like the one in Sarajevo," the experienced military operative has written to his superior, General Lapresle, commander in chief of UN forces in the Balkans. The U.S. naval officer incorporated his horrible vision into a proposal for establishment of a protected no-arms zone that would embrace Tuzla and environs. The admiral's letter and appeal has so far not received a response from those who make decisions about the life and death of the Bosnian Muslims. The recent statement of Radovan Karadzic that "the United Nations is on the side of the Muslims more and more" is in turn indicative. In that accusation, the leader in Pale creates an alibi for events soon to come, which comes down to what is already familiar: They are all against us, we have to defend ourselves by every means. In that same context, Karadzic said that "he has long been thinking that some hawk would push the United States into its second Vietnam" if there is a military involvement in Bosnia. Life has been difficult in Tuzla for all of two years now, but now it is still worse. Along with the chronic shortage of food, drugs, and other essentials, the attacks have also become more frequent. To be sure, this city has already been proclaimed a protected zone in declarative terms in the United Nations, but the good that does is familiar to members of the Blue Helmets, who are mainly being put up in the Hotel Tuzla, which has holes from several direct hits from Serbian artillery. There is still time and opportunity for Tuzla to be assured a different fate from those which have been pessimistically forecast. It is well-known who is firing on this city, why, and from where....
