Political observers expect a divisive war between the armed forces of the north and the south this month because the talks held the day before yesterday in Salalah in the Sultanate of Oman failed to resolve the differences between the General People's Congress [GPC], led by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and its ally the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] on the one hand and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], of which Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid is secretary general, on the other. The YSP, however, has made a point of underscoring the importance of the Omani role and the continuation of efforts to find a solution to the Yemeni problem. A YSP official source has denied that al-Bid played down "the positive and effective role played by Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id." The source reaffirmed the importance "of the mediation of the brothers in Oman to preserve Yemen's unity." News agencies quoted one of the delegation members accompanying al-Bid as saying that "the mediation of Sultan Qabus brought nothing new and the Yemeni crisis is still continuing." He expressed appreciation for the Omani role, of which all Yemenis are proud. Yemeni political sources attribute the failure of the meeting to the "lack of adequate preparation for it" because the Omani leadership simply seized the opportunity of President Salih's visit to Oman and asked al-Bid to stop over on his way back from the United Arab Emirates [UAE] at the end of his visit to Abu-Dhabi. Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah said that the meeting succeeded in achieving some relaxation at the personal level between Salih and al-Bid but that this remains to be translated into a relaxation between the ruling coalition parties in Yemen. The Omani minister said that the efforts were focused on preventing any military confrontations or civil war in Yemen. Yemeni sources, however, say that the meeting confirmed the conviction of both sides that "any move by one side toward the other to ease the crisis would be futile" and that military confrontation cannot be avoided. The sources said that the Joint Military Committee has begun to terminate its task of separating the northern and southern armed forces and that the Jordanian and Omani officers are currently considering returning home, having themselves failed to accomplish their mission. They confirmed that the two parties to the conflict, namely the YSP and the GPC, imported $200 million worth of arms and ammunition between them during the month of March. The sources also said that the Yemeni president left the Salalah meeting angry and threatened to use force. The two parties to the conflict are now trading accusations about the failure of the Oman meeting. YSP sources say that the cause of the failure was the intransigence of President Salih and his aids and also of their ally in the ruling coalition (meaning the YRG, led by House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar), whereas GPC and YRG sources say that the failure to resolve the crisis was a result of disagreement within the YSP itself, preventing the party from taking specific stands. Although YSP sources deny such a disagreement, it seems that meetings such as the ones held in Amman and Salalah have minimized the chances of using the Jordanian and Omani cards again to settle the crisis. That only leaves the Egyptian card with Syrian participation and Gulf support. It is hoped that this card will be used very carefully through submission of specific plans for the settlement of the crisis acceptable to all Yemeni parties within the framework of the state of unity, even if that means applying the federal system. The Yemeni president and Shaykh al-Ahmar still oppose such a system but may find no alternative to it in the end.
