The leader president, may God preserve him, chaired the first meeting of the new Council of Ministers, which lasted approximately four and a half hours. During this meeting, his excellency delivered the following valuable and important speech: First, we would like to thank brother Ahmad Husayn for assuming the tasks of the prime minister over the past period. He exerted his utmost in this field. The statement of the Revolution Command Council was very clear. Our assessment was that our circumstances require this formula in terms of the presidency's relationship with the Council of Ministers, despite the fact that it will increase our burdens and cost us extra time. This, however, is required. You will continue to assume your ministerial posts, except the agriculture minister, who was previously a minister. Now, he is a comrade in the party and a governor and knows our course. The new thing, however, is the new situation. The new thing is that, as you recall, we addressed the Iraqis on one occasion and told them: You are in the last 10 days of Ramadan. Some people interpreted this by saying that these are the last 10 days and that the blockade will be lifted on 'Id al-Fitr. They also said that something would happen. I heard these interpretations from some people. Meanwhile, what we meant by the last 10 days is the fact that the largest period of time has passed and that the reward of the whole month will be gained during the last 10 days. In other words, man will either succeed or fail. The last 10 days need additional patience and efforts so that man will gain the reward of fasting during the month of Ramadan. Addressing the members of the Council of Ministers, his excellency said: In the past, ministers might have taken their time and read the newspapers before beginning work. But, now, the first thing I will do is read the newspapers after dealing with the basic components of the morning mail. As of now, every minister should be in his office at 0800. This is the first measure to be carried out by all, except the sick person, who should telephone Dr. Khalil al-Ma'muri, secretary of the Council of Ministers, to inform him that he cannot report to work at his ministry. This will help us know that he is sick, to be reassured about him, to wish him good health, and to follow up his medical situation. Those who are not sick should be present in their ministries at 0800. I do not want any other excuses. This issue has someething to do with some psychological reasons. Someone might contend that he is making field visits. Nonetheless, I would like to answer him, saying that working at his ministry is more important to me than making his field visits. I am well aware of the value of field visits. My rationale in this regard is that once the ministry employees feel that their minister reports to his ministry at 0800, they will do their utmost to be there at 0800. But, if the minister arrives at his ministry at 1100, yawning, the director general will, in his turn, report to his office, yawning at 0900. As for the ministry's under secretary, he will report to the ministry a little bit later. He might report to his office at 0930. Beginning with the chief of the Presidential Office, all Iraqi employees must report to work at 0800. There can be no excuse for those who might say that they slept late, and consequently woke up late. They have to sleep early. Those who were used to sleeping at 0200 must get used to sleeping at 0100. If they cannot sleep before 0200, they must wake up at 0500, or 0600 until they get used to sleeping early after close of business. I am not saying this out of theoretical or imaginative conceptions of my own. I have applied this myself. Sometimes, I get busy for some reason or another. The reason might not be that important. I might stay up late until 0200. Nonetheless, I get up at 0500 or 0515. Right now, we must abandon the morning sleep, and report to work at 0800 so that all employees may see us. We must revive and reactivate the state. Can we not do this? I have told you that we cannot forge legends. However, we can do this. I am pressing for early reporting to work for psychological reasons. Some of you might be working more hours than those I am demanding of them, which should begin at 0800. But what I am talking about is discipline, as well as the psychological aspect of state employees. The influence the minister has when he works a certain number of hours, or an additional number of hours is less than the influence he has when he reports to work on time. This is because in the latter case, all employees would feel that the minister reports to work on time, just like all ministry employees. What I want to discuss in this meeting -- which has no agenda -- is the living conditions of our people, and some phenomena which I noticed in the state departments in general so that the brother ministers will work toward overcoming these phenomena once we reach agreement on them. Regarding the people's standard of living, I will explain to you how I view prices so that you may not imagine that I am unaware of the minor details, and that being what I am will make me unaware of minor things in the life of the people, and that consequently, I would ask you for things that would appear illogical. Price increases, except for those of the commodities listed on the ration card, are inevitable. Why? At the beginning of the blockade, the Ministry of Trade had its own stockpiles. In the same vein, citizens had their own stockpiles. A section of the society benefiting from this situation emerged. This is natural. It happens in all wars all over the world. It happens in socialist and capitalist countries alike. That is, people benefiting from the difficulties experienced by their countries do emerge. These people take advantage of the hardships that emerge in their countries. These people have emerged because the revenues they make are less in value than the efforts made. The greater part of these revenues is deemed illegal in terms of legitimacy, fairness, and religious rulings. These people are engaged in trade, using their possessions on the market in an unnatural manner. For instance, when one of them is offered a single commodity, and he has 300 million dinars with him, when, by God, he did not have 1,000 dinars with him in the past, let us say that this commodity is a car, and that it was offered for 15 million dinars, he would say: Well, why not buy it at this price? So, these people are not engaged in exploitation only in their well-known areas. They have turned into a factor that increases the value of market commodities. I have cited this example to let you know that I am following up on people's lives. I am well aware that some people are saying that not a single dollar is being spent on agriculture. Nonetheless, there are two factors that are contributing to increases in the prices of agricultural produce. These factors have nothing to do with the traditional equation of supply and demand. The first factor concerns the comparison phenomenon, and its psychological impact. This prompts vendors to constantly demand higher prices. This is because they live in areas where they see the prices of chairs and any other commodities, for that matter, rising. Consequently, the okra vendor contends that his okra, compared to their chair, must be equal in value to the legs of the chair. That is why he demands a price equal to the value of the legs of the chair. In addition to this psychological impact, you are well aware that the components of the society influence each other. We have taught our society that all are equal in their human value, and that there is no difference between the children of a minister, and those of a peasant. In the past, people used to wonder about the wide gap existing between different classes of the society. You recall that statements to this effect were made in alleyways, houses, and rural areas. Nowadays, this statement is no longer heard. As a matter of fact, children in rural areas are telling their fathers that the children of so and so minister or merchant are wearing a certain brand of clothes, and that they want the same brand of clothes. This psychological consciousness of the importance of equality, even though when it is only in form rather than substance, also plays a basic role in price increases. This is because this increases the obligations of people who have possessions for sale. This pushes in the direction that we have just mentioned. Moreover, there is also the transport sector. We do not have new means of transport to augment the private sector's fleet, ensure adequacy in terms of transport capabilities, and allow fares to remain at certain levels, to make them stand still, or to reduce them. The number of vehicles in the country has remained unchanged, and so has the number of tires. Hence, if we only examine the transport factor, along with another factor; namely, that peasants do not all work with their own hands, particularly since many of them pay daily wages for workers, whose wages affect other workers' wages, we can come up with some conclusions. So, we can identify two factors, at least, in this regard. The first is a psychological and social factor, an indirectly economic one. The other is a directly economic factor. These two factors play a role in raising the prices of tomatoes, even though peasants are not importing chemical fertilizers for them from abroad, and although they do not pay the wages of plowing in dollars, not to mention the fact that some peasants lease their tractors and similar equipment. What I want to say to you is that I am following up things and thinking them over as much as I can. Do not imagine that I am unaware of things. I follow up people's life. I want to say that we can do something, but what is it? I prefer that we hold a dialogue about this, and that each of you makes his suggestions, hoping that you make these suggestions as brief and concise as possible. The two deputy prime ministers and the ministers presented a number of ideas and proposals which were discussed. The leader president then said: The blockade will end just as any other issue. Wars have ended and there are still other wars. The blockade started on a certain day, and there must be a day when it will end. It is clear that the remaining time is less than the time which has elapsed. I believe that the expression we used before is accurate. However, the basis which will end the blockade, keep Iraq just as its sons want it to be, and end any strong storm with the fewest possible losses or ysacrifices, with the continuation of the basic constants wished by its sons, the people of the country, lies in the people of the country themselves. The basis lies in the people of the country. The responsibility increases gradually in accordance with the level of influence and center of influence among the people of the country. It is natural that the minister's responsibility of steadfastness differs from the responsibility of others. This means that the minister's sense of responsibility and the level and size of influence differs from that of the ordinary employee or citizen in the state of Iraq. Thus, this includes members of the leadership, beginning with the ministry's under secretary, the director general, and ends with the end of the job scale. From the beginning we said that the basis that will fragment or lift the blockade is you. Why you? Because the more you increase your people's patience and ability to stand fast, the more this will be in your favor to end the blockade in an honorable way. Praise be to God that the country's capabilities, its sons' capacity, and the level of their awareness have remained intact regardless of the reckless outbursts brought about by a quick assessment, or a quick or hasty stand. I know the national essence of the people of the country. They understand that they have no other choice. This is how the situation can be decided the way we wish. The ministers, when they increase their activity in their offices and make their mental and organizational ability more efficient and more effective, will play a role in increasing the patience of the citizen, whether he is an employee or something else. It seems that some sides mobilized the people in a way which was interpreted as if the Iraqis should wait for good news, in a dramatic sense, after the meeting, the UN Security Council's meeting which was held in May. This is wrong and is contrary to our policy. Our policy says that we are working in the international arena with all our capabilities and mental abilities. However, the basis which changes the international approach is the Iraqis' position. The Iraqis weaken their position in the international arena when they grumble too much and when their balance of patience is disrupted. They weaken their position in the international community, which has a purpose. Even he who has no purpose will no longer be enthusiastic about insisting on shortening the time for lifting the blockade when he sees the people's resistance against the blockade has become weak. At any rate, when they tell you that prices are high, tell them that we are working to mitigate their impact on you. But, what is the alternative you have? Give it to us. When they tell you that prices are high, and that there must be restrictions, tell them: Okay. But ask them the following question: If we were to set the prices for tomatoes, will you refrain from buying them except at the prices set by the state, or will you carry your bags and buy them regardless of the prices set for them? But, if you want the state organs to engage in a battle with a single sector of our people, while you stand idly and buy from it, I would like to say that this is unacceptable. Similarly, it is unacceptable for some of them to utter the well-known Iraqi phrase: By God, you have the right to do so. Vendors are telling you that transportation is costly, etcetera. For those who say that they are not happy with prices, we would like to say that we are willing to transfer all powers of state organs to the concerned popular councils and neighborhood residents so that they may set their own prices and go by them. But, if they want the security organs to carry out pursuit operations, imprison people, and batter them for any violations, minor violations, when they refrain from demonstrating cooperation to promote their own interests, I would like to say that this is not going to be our own major battle. Tell them that these phenomena are harmful to us and you alike, and that what pains you pains our hearts. But, tell us what is the thing that we are withholding from you, and keeping from you in the circumstances of this crisis. Tell us what it is that we can do, and have failed to identify; that is, let us engage in a dialogue with them. We are supposed to identify proper procedures and mistakes in the suggestions that could be made by the director general or the ministry's under secretary. We must engage in a dialogue on the issues that we understand in our capacity as ministers. Likewise, we must identify proper procedures and mistakes in their conceptions. We must discuss proper measures at our council, regardless of whether they were enunciated by laymen or responsible officials. We must correct mistakes. Are you convinced that all ranking officials in the state, the party, and the society are playing their roles in terms of explaining to citizens mistakes and sound thinking in their conceptions and behavior? Are we incapable of correcting the citizens' conceptions? I would say that we are capable of doing so. Our citizens have a nationalist nature. They can hear facts, and therefore, we must clarify facts to them in order for them to be balanced. They have been used to this issue since 1969. When onions, potatoes, or tomatoes become scarce, they make an issue out of this, and when we give them a solution by the available means, all of them will stand in the right position. So, let's do so and rely on God. At the end of the meeting, specialized committees were formed to study some urgent issues. The results of their actions will be presented to the Council of Ministers soon.
