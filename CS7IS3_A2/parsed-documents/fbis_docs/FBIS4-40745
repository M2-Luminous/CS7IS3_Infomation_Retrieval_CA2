"When as many as ten explosions are registered over 24 hours, it means that bandit formations force their ideology of life to the society," he said in his interview with Interfax Saturday. At the same time Filatov pointed out that part of the society expresses its disagreement with Yeltsin's decree due to the provision on possible detention of the suspected for 30 days. He recognized that this method "has been actually taken from the decree on the state of emergency." In Filatov's opinion, those, who say that this provision of the presidential decree should be compensated in the legal sense "by removing the old fear of the people in the face of the unrestricted power of the law enforcement bodies," are quite right. Filatov believes that it is possible to achieve this involving the conciliatory commission in charge for the implementation of the Agreement on Public Accord. Filatov is known to be chairman of this commission.
