Those and other expatriates round the world were so numerous, they could influence the outcome of the election, the South African ambassador to Canada, Andre Kilian, told the VANCOUVER SUN newspaper. Large advertisements last week in United States and Canadian newspapers gave South African expatriates and refugees the locations of polling stations throughout both countries, some specially set up in centres where there are no consulates. The advertisements indicated U.S. and Canadian residents would be allowed to vote even if they had become citizens of those countries, provided they produced documentary proof they were once South Africans. Although neither embassy could give official numbers, both offered rough estimates based largely on the host governments' census data. These put the numbers of eligible South African voters at about 100,000 in each country, totalling 200,000. The sheer volume of enquiries to telephone numbers provided in the advertisements indicated a high rate of expatriate voting, the Washington and Ottawa embassies said. "I just hope we have enough ballot papers," Mr Kilian said, but added there was a "contingency plan" in case of a shortage.
