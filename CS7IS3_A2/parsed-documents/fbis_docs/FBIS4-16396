This was the theme of a news conference given today by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], in the State Duma. In a 40-minute address, he summed up his impressions of his trip to Strasbourg as a member of a Russian parliamentary delegation. In the presence of a host of media representatives, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy lashed out at the West without being too fussy over his language. If Russia joined the Council of Europe, "a struggle will be waged against us for our money," the LDPR leader claimed. Nor should Russia, in his view, cooperate with NATO. "We are glad that the country's political leadership has taken a correct step in that direction. We support the president's decision not to sign the `Partnership for Peace' program," he declared. Speaking in his usual manner, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy vented his wrath on "the Zionists and Americans." The French came in for some of his anger too for not having allowed him to travel outside Strasbourg. So did the Turks, "who hate all Slavs," and also the British, who "plundered the world first of all, yet have now become conservative, protecting their plunder, and have foisted their language on the whole world." Apart from the Third World War, which has, he claimed, already begun in Yugoslavia, the LDPR leader also predicted an imminent civil war in Russia, of which "those who are running the country today will be guilty."
