The government is displaying its power to deter any possible reaction by the Federal Police strikers. Four more helicopters are approaching the square; we can hear the noise they are making. They were overflying the National Congress esplanade and the northern area of the city, and are now heading for the Ministries Esplanade. The military sector and the government are carrying out these displays. These are Army Puma helicopters. [Station announcer] This is not common, is it, Gianoni? [Mosquera] No, normally they are only used in parades and military celebrations. Apparently the government is deploying all these forces to show that it will not accept any sort of challenge from those who are staging the strike. The government is determined to have absolute control in case anything happens. As I reported a few minutes ago, troops have been deployed here to replace those who had been stationed near Tres Poderes Square. [Announcer] Can you see any movement of federal policemen or landless farmers, or will demonstrations occur later? [Mosquera] Only a few tourists, and some members of the military police, can be seen. Civilian police and Federal Police members can no longer be seen. No demonstrators can be seen here, near Tres Poderes Square. [Announcer] What are reactions inside Congress? Despite having been on the streets, have you had the chance to hear comments from the congressmen? [Mosquera] Well, most congressmen are wondering whether the government isn't exaggerating in this case. [Announcer] We were listening to an interview inside Congress when the noise of helicopters could suddenly be heard. It attracted the attention of all who were in the building. [Mosquera] Exactly, all the journalists ran outside to see what was taking place in the square behind Congress where the national flag is located, with Planalto Palace at its left and the Federal Supreme Court to the right. [Announcer] Is Ricardo Fiuza's case still being analyzed inside Congress? A few minutes ago we could see on the internal television circuit that someone was defending Fiuza. [Mosquera] Yes. We are now nearing the Green Hall, and can see that Deputy Fiuza is now addressing the plenary session. [passage omitted]
