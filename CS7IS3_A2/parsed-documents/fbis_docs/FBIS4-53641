At the time of the Kwangju popular uprising in May, 1980, the U.S. imperialists transferred more than 70,000 puppet Army troops, some 150 tanks and armored vehicles and other equipment under their command to the military fascists to suppress the participants in the uprising. And the South Korean military fascist clique massacred over 5,000 people and wounded some 14,000 others in ten odd days. Addressing a memorial service on the 14th anniversary of the May 18 Kwangju democratic resistance held in Kwangju on May 18, the chairman of the Democratic Party urged the puppet government to probe the truth behind the Kwangju resistance, punish chief culprits in the massacre and pay adequate compensations for it.
