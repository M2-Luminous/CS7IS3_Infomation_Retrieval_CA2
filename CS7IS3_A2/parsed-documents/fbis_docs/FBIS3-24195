Funds designated for consumption during that period amounted to 611.2 billion rubles, with wages accounting for 89 percent of the total and financial assistance and special incentives accounting for 11 percent. Funds for all personnel were equivalent to 10.5 percent of the total production output. The average wage of people employed in oblast industry in November was 317,300 rubles, and the figure in the southern zone was 123,600 rubles. In December there were work stoppages in some production units at 17 industrial enterprises (3 in the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug and 14 in the south). They included the Nadezhda joint venture, the Zavod ATE joint-stock company, the Ishim Machine-Building Plant, plants of the Ishim Agricultural Machinery Production Association, the electrical machinery plant, the DSP-250 plant, and other enterprises. The main reasons were difficulties in selling products and shortages of material resources.
