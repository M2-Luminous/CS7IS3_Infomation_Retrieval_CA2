Ending up behind bars Monday were Armando Cono Lancuba, a former public prosecutor in Naples who has since been moved to Melfi, and Vito Masi, a Naples Appeals Court judge. Cono Lancuba is charged with Camorra criminal association, while Masi is charged with corruption. Naples judges also issued warrants informing 10 people that they are under investigation, and sought permission from the Lower House to arrest Giuseppe Demitry, a Socialist deputy, and Alfonso Martucci of the Liberal Party. Arrested in this morning's swoop was Alfredo Bargi, a well-known Naples lawyer and candidate with the Pact for Italy party in the March 27-28 general elections. Receiving advisory warrants were Assistant Public Prosecutor Arcibaldo Miller, who heads an investigation into health service kickbacks, and Raffaele Sapienza, a judge in Santa Maria Capua Vetere near Naples and a candidate with the Forza Italia party. All the legal figures involved are suspected of rigging Camorra trials to ensure light sentences or acquittals for mobsters in the dock. Investigators have been at work on the case for a year, helped along by Camorra boss-turned-state's evidence Pasquale Galasso, and some twenty lesser grasses. The recent decision by key boss Carmine Alfieri, believed to head one of southern Italy's biggest crime empires, to collaborate with justice, allowed investigators to corroborate some of Galasso's stories. Galasso, well-informed sources recalled today, has told judges of "a solid link between politicians wielding great power, influential magistrates such as Lancuba, known Camorra bosses such as Alfieri and Galasso himself, sectors of the Naples journalistic world, and wheeler-dealers and entrepreneurs of all types." Of the 17 arrest warrants issued today nine have been served. Today's arrest of two judges brings to four the number of Italian magistrates behind bars charged with rigging organised crime trials, with some 30 more around the country under investigation for suspected complicity with Mafia-style groups. These include Corrado Carnevale, the former president of the first section of the supreme Cassation court who earned himself the nickname of "sentence-killer" for overturning Mafia sentences on formal quibbles. In a statement issued later Monday evening, Naples' Chief Prosecutor Antonio Cordova deplored information leaks which could jeopardise "extremely delicate investigations." Cordova was particularly irked by disclosures that his assistant Arcibaldo Miller, who heads key investigations into Naples' kickback scandals, had received an advisory warrant. This warrant is sent to inform people that they are being investigated in connection with a crime. It does not imply that an arrest warrant is on the way. "This office," said Cordova in his statement, "can only imagine that the spread of this news is likely to cast serious shadows over the enquiry into the Naples `tangentopoli' [bribe city] just at a point in time when it has entered its most important point, allowing the system of political-institutional corruption to be rooted out and overturned thanks to the extraordinary commitment of that group of colleagues which Miller coordinates and will continue to coordinate."
