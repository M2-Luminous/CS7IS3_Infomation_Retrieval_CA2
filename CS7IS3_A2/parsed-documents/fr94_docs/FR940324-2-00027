FR940324-2-00027 FR940324-2-00016 Northwest estimates a construction cost of $3,118,100, which would be installed and paid for pursuant to a facilities agreement with DA and the facilities reimbursement provisions of Northwest's tariff. Northwest estimates the net present value of the future revenues projected to be generated as a result of the proposed facilities of $4.6 million which would exceed the incremental cost of service of approximately $2.9 million. Northwest states that no significant impact on its system peak day deliveries is projected to result from the installation of the proposed facilities. It is indicated that, because DA elected to extend its existing firm transportation agreements with Northwest, the existing firm contract delivery obligations would remain the same.

[Docket No. CP94&hyph;278&hyph;000] Take notice that on March 10, 1994, Arkla Energy Resources Company (AER), 1600 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;278&hyph;000 a request pursuant to ยง157.205 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) for authorization to abandon and relocate certain facilities in Oklahoma and Louisiana, under AER's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;384&hyph;000 and CP82&hyph;384&hyph;001 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Specifically, AER proposes to (1) abandon in place 8 miles of 6-inch Line 634&hyph;2 and eight domestic delivery taps in Hughes County, Oklahoma; and (2) abandon in place 1.9 miles of 4-inch Line FM&hyph;27 and three domestic delivery taps and relocate one rural industrial tap, all in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana. AER states that it proposes to cut, cap and fill the abandoned pipelines with water and that it would remove all above ground facilities. AER states that the pipelines were used to provide service to 11 domestic and one industrial customer of Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company (ALG). AER asserts that nine domestic customers have or would convert to alternate fuels and have given AER written releases. AER further asserts that ALG would construct 1800 feet of plastic pipeline from its existing Gulftown Rural Extension to serve the remaining two domestic customers. AER would continue service to ALG's industrial customer by relocating the meter and ALG would construct a distribution line to the industrial customer, it is stated. AER maintains that it has provided notice of the proposed abandonments to the Oklahoma Corporate Commission and the Louisiana Public Service Commission.
