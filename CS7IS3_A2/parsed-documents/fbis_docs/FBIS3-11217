This poll was done BEFORE Andres Pastrana entered the campaign and announced his platform. We wanted to take the pulse of public opinion just before his campaign began, and then measure it again in a few weeks so we can evaluate the impact of the official start of his campaign. Also, while the poll was being conducted (which took a week because it used personal interviews) and the results analyzed, Colombian politics was suddenly jolted. Alvaro Gomez announced that he was putting aside his antipathy toward the Pastrana family and joining the Pastranist bandwagon; Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, a former member of the Constituent Congress, entered the campaign as a candidate for the Liberal Party primary; and another hopeful, Gloria Gaitan, made use of the door Lleras had opened to join in the liberal contest. In order to reflect part of these sudden changes, EL TIEMPO asked the CNC [National Survey Center] to conduct a telephone poll in Colombia's five largest cities to investigate the liberal primary results with the two new candidates included. If the liberal primary to select a single presidential candidate were held today, the results would be: Ernesto Samper, 54 percent; Humberto de la Calle, 14 percent; Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, 12 percent; Carlos Lemos Simmonds, 8 percent; David Turbay, 3 percent; and Rodolfo Gonzalez and Gloria Gaitan, each with 1 percent. Lleras de la Fuente's impact is considerable, especially in Bogota, where he would get his highest percentage: 18 percent. In Barranquilla, though, he would only get 4 percent. Judging by former polls, Lleras would take some votes from Lemos, something from Samper, and a little from De la Calle. But he also attracts new votes from people who said they would vote for none of the candidates or did not know for whom they would vote. The First Round Like the poll results broadcast in recent days by the major radio stations, this poll shows that the presidential race is no longer tied between Samper and Pastrana. Samper gets 39 percent of the votes, and Pastrana, 32 percent. This seven-point difference is significant, as the margin of error is 3.1 percent. In third place is Antonio Navarro, the Democratic/Alliance M-19 candidate with 11 percent, followed by Miguel Maza Marquez with 4 percent. Regina Betancourt is next with 3 percent; then Enrique Parejo, 2 percent; Gabriel Melo, 1 percent; and Rodrigo Marin and Juan Diego Jaramillo, less than 1 percent each. Samper is strongest in midsized cities, where he gets 46 percent. Pastrana's support, though, is spread proportionally among small, midsized, and large cities. Navarro gets most of his support in small cities, where he wins 15 percent. Maza is stronger in large and midsized cities; Parejo, in large cities. The fact that the poll included Barranquilla and Santa Marta among large and midsized cities explains why the latter two candidates, both from the coast, did well there. As in former polls, this shows that Samper has a considerable edge among men and people over 40. If only women and young people voted, Pastrana would catch up to Samper. Navarro also does better with the 18 to 24 age group. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |First Presidential Round | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Candidate |Percentage | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Samper |39 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pastrana |32 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Navarro |11 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Maza |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Regina |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Parejo |2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Melo |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Marin |under 1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jaramillo |under 1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |None of the above |5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Do not know; did not answer |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Second Presidential Round | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Candidate |Percentage | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Samper |49 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pastrana |40 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other |12 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The most striking fact is the great difference among social classes. Pastrana leads Samper by 25 percent in the upper classes; Samper leads by 9 points among the middle classes, and the two candidates are virtually tied among voters from the lowest classes. Looking at the results by party, both Pastrana and Samper pick up votes from members of the opposing parties. Nine percent of the conservatives say they will vote for Samper, and 12 percent of the liberals say they will vote for Pastrana. Still, Pastrana does better than all his rivals with people who say they have no party affilation; 35 percent say they will vote for Pastrana. Why Did Samper Go Up? "Please think about what you know, have heard, and have seen that Andres Pastrana has done in the last three months, and tell me if at this time you feel more inclined, less inclined, or equally inclined to vote for him than you were three months ago," the people surveyed were asked. The same question was asked about Ernesto Samper. The answers show the shift. Twenty-seven percent said they were more inclined to vote for Andres and 30 percent less inclined, giving him a 3 percent negative balance. Perhaps that is the cost of starting his campaign late. Samper, though, has 35 percent more inclined and 21 percent less inclined, a positive balance of 14 points. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |During the last three months, have you changed your mind about voting for: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Candidate |More inclined (pe-|Less inclined (pe-|No change (percen-| | |rcent) |rcent) |t) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Samper |35 |21 |29 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pastrana |27 |30 |27 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Some political analysts say Samper's considerable gain is due to the intense work done by the Liberal Party machinery since the beginning of the year, aiming at the parliamentary elections. There are 134 candidates for the Senate and 302 candidates for the Chamber: 436 liberal candidates mobilizing thousands of people in support of their party. That has to help the candidate with the best chance of winning the Liberal Party primary. The Samper campaign takes the view that Samper's central message, the fight against unemployment, has now taken hold of people, and more people now think this candidate is the one who would best deal with unemployment. In this poll, the problem most citizens cited as the leading problem is unemployment (56 percent), followed by lack of safety for the population, with 14 percent (most frequently mentioned in large cities and by people from the lowest social classes), and guerrilla violence (11 percent). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |What do you think is the nation's top problem? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Unemployment |56 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Citizens' safety |14 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Guerrillas |11 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Education |6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Drug traffic |5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Housing |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Health care |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Do not know; did not answer |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- According to Pastrana's campaign managers, things will change after the congressional elections, as the liberal machinery's activity will decline. There is also a broad group of undecided voters, among whom, according to their research, Pastrana has more support. They say that after a few weeks of campaigning, many of these undecided voters will decide to support the New Democratic Force candidate. Perhaps also for the reasons stated above, Samper appears to have a 9 percent edge over Pastrana in a possible second round. What Do They Want Changed? In general, when asked if they prefer change or continuity in government policies, people generally say they want change. And, according to this poll, a considerable majority would like a change in direction in some specific policies: social policy, dealings with the guerrillas, and privatization of state enterprises. In the first case, 60 percent of the Colombian people would like the next president to change social policy, while 28 percent would like the same policy to continue. Sixty-three percent want a change in the method of dealing with the guerrillas, and 29 percent would like the present course to continue. A similar pattern is seen with the privatization of state enterprises (see table). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |On which of the following issues would you like the next president to cont-| |inue Gaviria's policy, and which you like to be changed? | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Issue |Continue () |Change () |Do not know; did | | | | |not answer () | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Handling of the e-|35 |59 |7 | |conomy | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |International rel-|44 |44 |12 | |ations | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Handling of the g-|29 |63 |8 | |uerrillas | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Handling of the d-|43 |50 |8 | |rug traffic | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Social policy |28 |60 |12 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Privatization of |27 |63 |11 | |state enterprises | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Change in handling the guerrillas is desired most in large cities. Where the most people would like a change in social policy is in large and small cities. On the economy, the majority, 59 percent, would like new strategies, but 35 percent want continuity. International relations and the handling of the drug traffic is where most people would like the next government to maintain the current president's policy. Characteristics Even though the trend shows Samper ahead of Pastrana, when people describe the candidates' characteristics, they see in each of them particular strengths and weaknesses (see table). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Of the two leading candidates, in whom do you think the following charact-| |eristics most predominate? | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Characteristic|Pastrana () |Samper () |Both () |Neither () | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Experience |29 |46 |12 |6 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Leadership |35 |41 |11 |4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Honesty |26 |33 |17 |14 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Understanding |30 |34 |15 |9 | |of people's p-| | | | | |roblems | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Intelligence |25 |34 |27 |4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Credibility |31 |37 |13 |10 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ability to so-|29 |36 |19 |9 | |lve the count-| | | | | |ry's problems | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Samper's best recognized characteristic, compared with Pastrana, is experience. On this point the liberal has a 17-point advantage over his rival. The quality most people attribute to Pastrana is leadership. Where he is closest to his rival is his understanding of ordinary people's problems; on this point, they are practically tied, taking the margin of error into account. When people are asked what they want of their president, the first thing they mention is honesty (32 percent); then an ability to solve people's problems (25 percent); experience (19 percent); and intelligence (12 percent). Strangely, leadership is not one of the top-priority qualities. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |What do you think is the principal characteristic Colombia's next president | |needs to have? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Quality |Percentage | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Honesty |32 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Problem-solving ability |25 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Experience |19 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Intelligence |12 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Leadership |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Credibility |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Understanding |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Polling Date This poll was conducted for EL TIEMPO by the CNC among 1,100 people who said they are going to vote in the upcoming presidential elections. A random sample of households was chosen in four large cities: Bogota, Cali, Medellin, and Barranquilla; six midsized cities: Santa Marta, Ibague, Pereira, Cucuta, Pasto, and Villavicencio; and 12 small cities: Yarumal, Sogamoso, Zipaquira, Lorica, Fundacion, La Dorada, Buenaventura, San Jose de Isnos, Santander de Quilichao, Floridablanca, Cordoba (Bolivar), and Calarca. The interviews were conducted in person between 6 and 10 February. An EL TIEMPO reporter accompanied a CNC interviewer for one day in Bogota and interviewed some of the persons polled in greater depth. This poll's maximum margin of error is 3.1 percent. This means that if a candidate gets 30 percent in the poll, in reality his vote may be between 27 and 33 percent. Because of the last-minute changes in Liberal Party primary candidates, EL TIEMPO asked the CNC to do a new poll to measure voting intentions with the new range of candidates. This poll was done on 16 and 17 February by telephone. Six hundred people chosen at random were called in Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga. In this survey, the margin of error is 4.1 percent.
