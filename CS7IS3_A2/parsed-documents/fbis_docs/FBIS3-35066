He demanded that Iraq accede to a long-term monitoring and inspection program before the sanctions are lifted. Taking into account the fact the 30-state aggression on Iraq had set out to achieve the objective of keeping Iraq from developing an arms industry so that the Zionists maintain their edge, we are bound to conclude that the attacks on Iraq were stage managed in order to attack Iraq's force and prevent it from posing any threat to Zionism. That was the true motive behind the aggression on Iraq. However, the war the United States launched on Iraq and the subsequent sanctions and inspection have failed to advance the goal Washington had in mind. The waffler Clinton's statements may then be explained as follows: No nation on earth will voluntarily surrender its power and weapons that it is supposed to use as a deterrent against its enemies. There is only one way whereby a given nation will be forced into capitulation and disarmament, and that is total war and occupation -- elements that were lacking in the aggression on Iraq, because the war was technologically-based and involved no confrontation. Throughout history whenever Iraq came under siege, blockades have been shown to be less than foolproof. It has also been shown that a siege of a country that has borders with six countries cannot possibly be one hundred percent effective. What the present crisis boils down to is that the United States wants Iraq to make concessions that it could not force on it through war. The war, whose real "hero" the war criminal George Bush fell from power, had more in common with fantasy than reality. In their attitude toward Iraq, the United States and the West find themselves in a unique, unfamiliar situation. For them, war means their adversary's outright capitulation. Consider Germany and Japan, among others. For the first time ever, the West has faced a unique and special situation of its kind -- one in which the adversary has not been browbeaten into submission. This is despite the fact that that the adversary's forces were forced into a withdrawal, and, by Western standards, were at a qualitative disadvantage. The West miscalculated. The victory claimed by the criminal Bush merely drove Iraqi forces from the governorate of Kuwait. However, that victory has failed to destroy the adversary's force or subjugate it. It is an established fact that it was the United States that brought the hostilities to a halt. It shied away from sending its combat troops deep inside Iraq, a substantial part of whose armed forces remained intact. The result waffler Clinton would have liked the 1991 war to produce was a far cry from how it actually turned out. In the conventional terms of war and defeat, that war failed to turn out to the waffler Clinton's satisfaction. In conventional terms, the West is incapable of engaging in close combat, occupying enemy territory, or scouring every inch of territory for weapons to destroy them. The waffler Clinton and the West are betting on the sanctions to realize their ambitions in Iraq. We doubt that the sanctions will deliver the goods.
