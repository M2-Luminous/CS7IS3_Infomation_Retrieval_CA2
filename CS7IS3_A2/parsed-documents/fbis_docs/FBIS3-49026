FBIS3-49026 "dreeu002_p_94006" FBIS-EEU-94-002 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Jan 1994 POLAND _o_Minister Presents Copyright Law to Parliament 94P20164A 94P20164A Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] In presenting the draft of a new copyright law to the Sejm on 18 November, Polish Minister of Culture Kazimierz Dejmek argued that the existing 1952 law is outdated and that the new law takes into account current technologies and economic realities. KRONIKA SEJMOWA of 24 November reported Dejmek's remarks to the effect that the draft contained improvements over the previous version, which he said had been revised to make Polish law more compatible with European and world standards. This, Dejmak predicted, will make participation in international copyright agreements possible and "will enable Poland to fulfill obligations resulting from previous accords, in particular those resulting from the trade treaties with the U.S." Dejmek said, according to the KRONIKA SEJMOWA report, that the law was designed to provide equal protection to authors and artists, as well as to the producers and distributors of cultural products. He also noted that the law delegates oversight responsibilities to professional organizations of authors, artists, performers, and producers, while at the same time exercising control over them by licensing requirements. To mitigate the negative impact of the illicit copying of cultural products, the law provides that losses due to such pirated production will be compensated by fees on blank tapes and videocassettes. Zdzislaw Podkanski, a spokesman for one of the parties in the governing coalition, the Polish Peasant Party (PSL), said that the copyright law would bring economic as well as cultural benefits. According to Podkanski, the new law both "meets the expectations of the artistic associations and satisfies the requirements of international pacts and treaties." He also endorsed the law's criminal penalties, which he said should serve to deter "pirating" of copyrighted materials. Jerzy Zdrada of the opposition Democratic Union described the existing Polish copyright law as "anachronistic" because it "does not reflect the standard legal practice of the European Union and the United States." The failure to change the old law until now, he charged, has impeded domestic scientific, technological, and cultural activities and hampered international trade relations. He said that the new law, which is based on West European models, should rectify this situation. Speaking for the opposition Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN), Deputy Janusz Koza regretted that the copyright law had not been passed earlier because "every day of delay causes great losses for the state treasury, businesses, and individuals." He complained that, currently, the illegal production of tapes, videocassettes, and computer software is encouraged by "the impunity of pirates." These pirates, he said, penetrate not only the domestic market but also "markets of neighboring countries." They pay "neither taxes nor duties" and, selling their products at much lower prices, "they ruin legitimate businesses."
