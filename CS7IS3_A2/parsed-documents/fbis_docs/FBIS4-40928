Churkin is just back from Geneva where a meeting between the leaders of the warring parties and the main intermediaries in the Bosnian settlement was to be held. The attempt to resume the cease-fire talks has failed because of the stance of the Bosnian Moslem leaders. The latter claim that the Serbs have not fulfilled their obligations with regard to Gorazde. Moslems demand the withdrawal of Serbian troops from Gorazde. "On Saturday [4 June], Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of the UN secretary-general, arrived at the conclusion that the Serbs have fulfilled all the conditions with regard to Gorazde. The Moslem leaders, however, decided that this was not enough to resume the talks," Churkin said. He said that he was sorry that the Bosnian Moslem leaders assumed such a position on the resumption of the Geneva talks. It is so important to ensure a reliable ceasefire that the parties drawn into the Bosnian conflict should revise their own positions in the name of the resumption of the talks, he went on.
