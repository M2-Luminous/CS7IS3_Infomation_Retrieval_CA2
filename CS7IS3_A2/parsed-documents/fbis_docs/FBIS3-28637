The North Koreans are paying special attention to making a large waterproof glass coffin which will preserve Kim's body in the hall's mausoleum, he added. The glass coffin will be 10 meters long and 10 meters wide, and kept in an underground mausoleum 30 meters deep for permanent preservation of Kim's body, which will automatically rise to the ground for public displays. To prevent the body from decaying, the coffin will be placed five to six meters from the walls of the mausoleum, the source said. In October last year, eight North Koreans secretly visited Beijing to meet five Chinese technicians who took part in making the glass coffin for the late Mao Zedong. North Korea is using Chokwang Trading Co. in Macao, one of its foreign trade bases in Asia, to procure the materials needed in the mausoleum and glass coffin such as wood, special steel plates, copper pipes and marble, he said. Last October and in early February, Korea Taesong Trading Co., one of North Korea's leading trading houses in Pyongyang, contacted a building supplies firm in Hong kong while opening a letter of credit for 300,000 U.S. dollars to purchase the materials, he added. Negotiations with the Hong Kong firm are proceeding smoothly and if its initial shipment to the port of Hungnam in North Korea is successful, there will be second and third shipments from the firm, he said.
