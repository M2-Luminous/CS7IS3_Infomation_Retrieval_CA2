The three-day conference, sponsored by China Textile Trade Association, is being attended by 295 representatives from 13 countries and regions. The conference will cover the study of the developing trend of the industry and materials, theoretical study of the structures of wool and other animals' fabric and manufacturing technologies of wool. Representatives of 18 well-known companies from abroad will lecture on technologies of advanced wool textile equipment. Wool textile industries have been set up throughout China, which has 35,000 mechanical looms and 3.3 million wool spindles. China's wool textile industry has been developing rapidly since 1979, when China initiated its opening-up policy. During 1981 and 1992, the number of wool spindles in China increased more than two fold, 5.5 times the number of 1980. The number is still growing, at the rate of 225,000 annually. In 1992, the country produced 338 million meters of woolen goods. At the same time, China's output of sheep's wool, rabbit fur and yak fur have all become the greatest in the world in recent years. China now accounts for 50 percent of the world's total output of sheep's wool, 90 percent of rabbit fur and about 85 percent of yak fur. Even so, China still needs to import large amounts of wool every year. China is keen on exchanges and cooperation with other countries in the world, officials of the China textile trade association said. Officials from the International Wool Secretariat, Australia and New Zealand are attending the conference.
