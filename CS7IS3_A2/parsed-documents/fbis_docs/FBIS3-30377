Pittner and P. Weiss. We interviewed Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] Chairman Peter Weiss and sought a response to this statement. [Gembicky] Suggestions have also been made in connection with the statement by the deputy prime minister that, in the wake of the Slovak National Party [SNS], there could also be a split, provoked from the outside, within the SDL. Do you think they are realistic? [Weiss] Such statements testify to the lack of matter-of-fact arguments and the political uncertainty arising from the ratio of votes in parliament--75:75. They also testify to the political methods that are part and parcel of the HZDS--that is, it gains a serious partner not on the basis of a political agreement but by indulging in deception, bringing discredit, engaging in corruption, exerting pressure, and causing disintegration. However, the gentlemen from the HZDS are mistaken if they think they will succeed in breaking up our party the way they did the SNS--by corruption that even the nationalists' representatives themselves did not try to hide. We did not enter into politics with grand slogans only to swap them at the appropriate moment for lucrative posts for a few months. [Gembicky] What is the fundamental difference between your own and the government's draft amendment to the law on large privatization? Is a compromise between the two drafts possible? [Weiss] During the talks with HZDS representatives, we strove to ensure that the rational core of the government draft amendment would be enhanced in the Privatization Committee by utilizing the new elements from our draft in the new version of the law that would be submitted by the group of deputies. Thus, there would be no need to comment on each version of the draft law. This version, which was drafted by Mr. Tomecko and J. Plesnik, has been prepared, but the HZDS rejected this course of action. One obstacle, apart from other problems, is that the privatization minister and the president of the National Property Fund [FNM] are one and the same person and that the finance minister and the chairman of the FNM Supervisory Council are also one and the same. The fact that the government does not want to pull back from this concentration of power is an indication of its unequivocal intention to carry out privatization on the basis of political criteria. If the government draft law on large privatization is approved, there is a risk that it will become infested with corruption. Privatization will not be sufficiently under the supervision of either parliament or the public. The result could be such a structure of owners--and also their interlinking to the state administration--that it would take a whole generation for us to extricate ourselves from such a social mechanism. Therefore, the HZDS deputies who raise their hands in favor of this amendment will bear an extraordinary, perhaps historical, responsibility. If ownership relations in this country are changed by such a method, the kind of political regime I am concerned about will evolve here. [Gembicky] There is also anxiety among the leadership of your party that, when important decisions are being made in parliament, the coalition could put pressure on you via the issue of returning the former Communist Party of Slovakia's property. Is this anxiety warranted? [Weiss] Representatives from the Christian Social Union came out with the first wave of speculation. There is no reason for me, as the party chairman, to be anxious about anything. I have never done anything at variance with the law. This is a purely legal dispute. We proceed from the fact that it is absurd to interpret the resolution of the former Federal Government and Constitutional Law No. 496/90 in such a way that we should again return what we have already handed over to the state. It will merely depend on the proper course of action by the state bodies. If anyone succumbs to the illusion that it is possible to exert pressure on the SDL due to this case, he is gravely mistaken. [Gembicky] What do you think of the scenario put forward by the government coalition, a scenario that envisages, first, the approval of a new agenda, proposed by it, for the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NR SR], then the approval of a law on deputies, and, finally, the approval of a constitutional law on the transfer to a chancellory or presidential system? [Weiss] We have seen how the HZDS leadership has managed to discipline and tame the SNS Deputies' Club. Its fundamental objective could consist of a return to the old idea of adopting a retroactive law according to which those who had resigned from their original deputies' clubs or had founded independent clubs would have to leave parliament, and substitute deputies would take their place. This would restore the ratio of forces that existed in parliament in January 1993, and only one or two votes would be missing for a constitutional majority. The beauty of this is also that the law would be valid only from 1 January 1993 and that it would not extend back to 1992, when two independent deputies also "appeared." However, it would affect the Knazkoites [supporters of Alliance of Slovak Democrats Chairman Milan Knazko] or, as the case may be, the Cernakites [supporters of SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak]. If only one or two votes were lacking for a constitutional majority, the methods tried and tested with the SNS would begin to be utilized. Then, if 90 votes were obtained in the NR SR, it would be possible to initiate a constitutional change, perhaps not for a chancellory but directly for a presidential system. I personally do not consider this scenario to be likely because its implementation would testify to the catastrophic level of the legal knowledge of those deputies who would vote for such a retroactive law. [Gembicky] Realistically, however, what could stand in the way of this idea being put forward? [Weiss] Respect for the principles of a law-governed state. Let us not punish the deputies who resigned from the HZDS Club or other clubs, even though we may have a different political and moral view of this, for something that was not at variance with the valid law when they did it. [Gembicky] Would the SDL also be willing to cooperate with the SNS National Democratic Club in the event the extraordinary assembly in Zilina drives its members into the opposition? [Weiss] It is never good to exclude anyone from cooperation in advance. If the situation referred to in your question arises, this will depend primarily on the club's program and on its specific political stances. [Gembicky] From your point of view, what do you think of the recommendation made by the president to form a broad government coalition, and what is your reaction to the firm rejection of this idea by the HZDS district assemblies? For example, do you agree with their demands for the resignations of M. Zemko and P. Demes from the Office of the President? What do you say to their challenge that the deputies from the independent club give up their deputies' mandates in favor of the HZDS? [Weiss] All of the demands made at the HZDS district assemblies are an expression of the governing movement's dominant social character. This movement is, more and more obviously, dividing into two streams. A stronger and therefore more dominant stream and a weak stream. This dominant stream, from which eight deputies have distanced themselves by their resignations from the movement, is made up of people who perceive politics as an instrument for satisfying their egoistic group or personal interests. These people, although they are often not up to their jobs, in fact comprise the most intrinsic part of the state administration and are "attached" to privatization projects. Therefore, they have an absolutely natural interest in boosting the power of the HZDS and, if possible, power that they would not have to share with anyone. These people are allergic to all supervision and to criticism of their course of action. They are assuming the right to determine who has an opinion or who must not have one. They are assuming the right to tell the president who he can and cannot have in his office merely because they have a personal aversion to someone or because they disagree with his political views. These elements of political impropriety, which we made substantial use of in the far-off times of the former regime, are incongruous in a democratic society and will increase tension and arouse anxiety about where the HZDS is heading. [Gembicky] Despite what you have said about the HZDS, there are reports directly from the prime minister's circle that he has been successfully working on 15 SDL deputies who would support the HZDS at a critical moment. Five of them apparently are even supposed to be sure things. Do you know anything about such fishing in your territorial waters? [Weiss] The prime minister more and more evidently is relying not on the quality of his economic policy and his good image abroad, but on destabilizing other deputies' clubs. I know that such attempts are being made against the SDL. Our deputies have told me this. However, the SDL is made of different stuff than part of the SNS, which fell apart under well-known circumstances. We are not intellectually or morally as bad as some people would like to think. The policy based on subversion and disintegration is destroying Slovakia. Those who rely on it, like the proverbial drowning man clutching at a straw, may, in the end, become victims of it themselves.
