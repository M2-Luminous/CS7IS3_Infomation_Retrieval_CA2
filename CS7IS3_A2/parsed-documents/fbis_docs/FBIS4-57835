The election results out of Trinidad and Tobago indicate that the People's National Movement [PNM] and the United National Congress have retained their seats. Commenting on the outcome, Prime Minister Patrick Manning expressed satisfaction with the way things went: [Begin recording] [Manning] Over time, over the next year or two, as we come into a general election, and as things improve, as they undoubtedly will, you will see a considerable improvement in the position. The poll is low. There is voter apathy at this time because, to a large extent, we are at the midpoint in our five-year period of office. And again, because people saw no real threat to the ruling party, either in Laventille West or in (Cocorite River) Valley. All in all, I think we have done very well. I want to congratulate all parties in this election. Campaign elections were clean. Elections were incident-free except for one incident that had potential danger, but did not materialize, a couple days ago. If I told you that I was unhappy with the way things had gone, I would be less than honest. [Unidentified reporter] One of the elements in this election has been the question of the low poll. There was very low response by the electorate, by the people who were eligible to vote for the Laventille West constituency. What do you see as accounting for this? [Unidentified interviewee] Maybe a lot of them did not take the by-election too seriously. But I know that there are a number of (PNM) people who did not go out to vote today. And there is no indication that (PNM is not Laventille or Laventille is not PNM; Laventille is still very much PNM). [Reporter] Right through the campaign, you would say that you were confident of victory. [Inteviewee] Yes, right through, I was. [end recording] Meanwhile, the opposition National Alliance for Reconstruction also commented on its defeat: [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We have been around to nearly all the polling divisions in the constituencies that took part in this election and it was quite obvious to me, and even from the reports of my election agents, that most of the people who came out to vote were senior people, and in some instances, they actually had to be helped to get into the polling station. It also tells me that the ruling party barely knows where its support is, and they go out to pull that support out, and in fact, they are pulling out senior people. They have not been able to capture the imagination of the younger voters. I think it should be a concern of all political parties because it means that the young people seem to be disillusioned with the political process. [end recording]
