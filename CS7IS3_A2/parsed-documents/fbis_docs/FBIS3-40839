The Congress (I) leaders have accused Chief Minister Jayalalitha of being a rebel and a dictator, while her supporters have accused Governor Reddy to running a parallel government in the state. Chief Minister Jayalalitha started a new dispute recently. This fight will now not limited to Tamil Nadu; it will effect other states also. Governor Reddy is also playing a role in this dispute, however, this is the first time that the governors are feeling that chief ministers may try to undermine their authority. According to tradition, the governor of a state is the ex-officio chancellor of the state university, and he has the right to appoint chancellors and deputy chancellors to the university. He also presides over the university's graduation ceremonies. A while back, when the position of chancellor at Madras University was vacated, names of three persons were sent to Governor Channa Reddy. Mr. Reddy rejected the three names. Chief Minister Jayalalitha made this minor incident a case of prestige and dispute and presented a controversial legislation in the vidhan sabha. This legislation asks for transferring the rights as the chancellor from the governor to the chief minister. It is important to mention here that the prime minister and not the governor will be the ex-officio chancellor according to the proposed legislation, and vice chancellors of the 13 universities in the state would be appointed by the chief minister on recommendation by a three-member committee. One of the three members would be appointed by the chief minister as the ex-officio chancellor. The state education minister would be the vice chancellor of nine of the state universities. The health minister would be the vice chancellor of the state medical college, and the agricultural minister and the animal husbandry minister will be the vice chancellors of the agricultural college and veterinary science college respectively. Thus, to avenge the rejection of the names proposed by her, Jayalalitha is trying to change the Constitution. It is a well-known fact that the dispute between the two started the day Dr. Channa Reddy arrived in Tamil Nadu as the governor. Although the governor is a senior Congress (I) leader, Ms. Jayalalitha is very apprehensive of him. Chief Minister Jayalalitha was not worried while she worked with the former Tamil Nadu governor, Bhisham Narayan Singh. At this time, Jayalalitha's star in Tamil Nadu politics is on the rise. Both opposition parties in Tamil Nadu are in bad shape. The Pradesh Congress (I) is weak because of the internal strife in it, and DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam], her major opponent party, has also split in to two factions. The Congress (I) and DMK are so weak in Tamil Nadu that they are trying to save their existence. As the result of all these developments, Jayalalitha and her party have become stronger than ever. However, by starting this fight with Dr. Channa Reddy, Jayalalitha has initiated a new dispute. Recently, a representative of Jayalalitha had accused Governor Reddy in Delhi of running a parallel government in the state. She accused that Dr. Reddy had taken steps to question various decisions made by the elected ADMK [Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] government. He is also accused of delaying the session of the vidhan sabha for two months. He had called the vidhan sabha only after the state had the prime minister and the president interfere. The governor delayed a file requesting extension of the chief secretary's appointment, and instigated the Jayalalitha government by rejecting the proposed names for the position of vice chancellors. She further accused him of breaking rules by establishing a relief fund for the Maharashtra earthquake victims. A traditional relief fund under the chief minister is already there. Meanwhile the Tamil Nadu Congress (I) Committee has accused Jayalalitha of treason and has demanded her dismissal. Mr. K. Ramamurthy, the state Congress (I) president, says that the ADMK government is acting as if Tamil Nadu was a separate island and not a part of the Indian Union. He said that the government was trying hard to insult the position of the governor. He also said that the governor's photograph was deliberately removed from the state vidhan sabha diary. This is the first time when the state Congress (I) president has openly demanded dismissal of Jayalalitha's government. Jayalalitha is suffering all these problems because of her support for the no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha against the prime minister last year. However, the situation of Tamil Nadu's Congress (I) Party and the DMK party is very weak. There is no political power in Tamil Nadu to challenge Jayalalitha until the next election.
