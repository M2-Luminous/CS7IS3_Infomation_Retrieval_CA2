FR940503-1-00061 FR940503-1-00012 Background On December 15, 1993 the EPA Administrator issued the final regulations implementing the reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping programs (the Final Rule), as prescribed by section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act (the Act). See 59 FR 7716 (February 16, 1994). Under the final rule, compliance by refiners and importers with certain reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping standards is measured against baselines that are intended to reflect 1990 gasoline quality. Domestic refiners are required to establish individual refinery baselines of the quality and quantity of the gasoline that was produced by the refiner in 1990. Domestic refinery baselines must be calculated using, in hierarchical order based on the availability of data, 1990 gasoline test data (Method 1), 1990 blendstock test data (Method 2), or post-1990 blendstock and/or gasoline test data (Method 3). Under the rule, domestic importers of foreign-refined gasoline are treated differently. They are required to establish baselines of the quality and quantity of 1990 gasoline that they import using 1990 gasoline test data (Method 1) if available. If Method 1 data are not available, importers are assigned a baseline approximating average gasoline quality in the United States in 1990_the statutory baseline. 1 EPA anticipates that most importers, like most domestic refiners, lack the actual 1990 testing data necessary to establish a baseline using Method 1. As a result, EPA expects most importers will be assigned the statutory baseline, with the consequence that most gasoline produced at foreign refineries will be evaluated using the statutory baseline. The baseline-setting scheme is specified in 40 CFR 80.91 through 80.93 and is discussed in the Preamble to the final rule at 59 FR 7791 (February 16, 1994). 1 The ``statutory'' baseline is calculated pursuant to section 211(k)(10)(B) of the Act which defines the statutory baseline for summertime gasoline and instructs the Administrator to establish the properties of the statutory baseline for wintertime gasoline based on average 1990 qualities of wintertime gasoline. EPA's Final Rule specifies the properties of the statutory baseline for wintertime gasoline in §80.45(b)(2), and annual statutory baseline gasoline properties in §80.91(c)(5). Before January 1, 1998, refiners and importers have the option of certifying reformulated gasoline using either the ``simple'' model or ``early use of the complex model.'' Under either of these reformulated gasoline certification approaches, compliance with certain standards is determined in relation to the baseline established for each refinery or importer. Under the simple model, the annual average levels for sulfur, T&hyph;90, and olefins are limited to each refinery's or importer's baseline levels for these parameters. 2 Under early use of the complex model (in contrast to mandatory use of the complex model beginning in 1998) refinery- or importer-specific standards for VOC, toxics, and NO X emissions performance are set in part using refiner or importer baseline levels for sulfur, T&hyph;90, and olefins. 3 2 The reformulated gasoline ``simple'' model requirements include standards for oxygen, benzene, RVP, and toxics emissions which are unrelated to refinery or importer baselines, in addition to standards for sulfur, T&hyph;90, and olefins which are in relation to refinery or importer baselines. See §§80.41 (a) and (b). 3 Under early use of the ``complex'' model, a refiner or importer calculates refinery- or importer-specific standards for VOC, toxics, and NO X emissions performance by using the complex model to evaluate a gasoline with ``simple'' model values for benzene, RVP, oxygen, and aromatics, and the refiner's or importer's individual baseline values for sulfur, T&hyph;90, and olefins. See §80.41(j). Beginning on January 1, 1998, only the complex model may be used to certify reformulated gasoline, and the basis for all compliance with the reformulated gasoline complex model standards is determined in relation to 1990 statutory baseline gasoline. See §§80.41(i)(2)&hyph;(i)(3). As a result, beginning in 1998 refiner or importer baselines are no longer relevant to determining compliance with reformulated gasoline standards. Compliance with the standards for conventional gasoline (the ``anti-dumping'' standards) is measured against refinery or importer baselines beginning in January 1995 and thereafter. See §80.101. As a result of the baseline-setting requirements of the final rule discussed above, domestic refiners would determine compliance with the anti-dumping standards in relation to refinery-specific baselines, while most or all importers of gasoline produced at foreign refineries would determine compliance in relation to the statutory baseline.
