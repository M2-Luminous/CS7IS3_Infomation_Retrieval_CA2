As President Lamine Zeroual continues his dialogue contacts with the political parties -- yesterday he met with representatives of the National Liberation Front [FLN] and Hamas [Islamic Society Movement] -- the prime minister, the interior minister, and the secretary general of the Trade Unions Federation continue their campaign against dialogue and have proposed new ideas about formation of militias and distribution of arms to the public, that is to supporters of the regime, to break the intensity of the dual confrontation between the Army and the armed organizations and turn that into a multiple confrontation in which civilian sectors of the population would take part. In a statement it issued yesterday after meeting with President Zeroual, Hamas said that the Algerian president confirmed that the political dialogue which he started about a week ago will include leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. It added that President Zeroual reaffirmed his determination to hold a serious dialogue without excluding any party and without any pressures, and that he also emphasized that the Army will respect any decisions made by the political authority to ensure success of the dialogue. That implies a denial of last week's reprts about differences between President Zeroual and some Army commanders. Despite that denial, informed sources have stressed that such differences did occur during the military command's three-day meeting 10 days ago. However, there are those who say that both sides in the end agreed on a compromise solution based on combining what may be achieved through security confrontation and what may be achieved through serious dialogue with all parties, and agreed that if the recent security campaign achieves tangible results, it will enable the regime to negotiate from a position of strength and will restore the state's lost prestige.
