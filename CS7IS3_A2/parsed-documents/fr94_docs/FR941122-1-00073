FR941122-1-00073 FR941122-1-00017 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 641 [Docket No. 941113&hyph;4313; I.D. 110194A] Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: In accordance with the framework procedure for adjusting management measures of the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP), NMFS proposes to reduce the bag limit for red snapper to zero for the operator and crew of a vessel operating as a charter vessel or headboat; reduce the daily bag limit for red snapper to five for other persons subject to the bag limit; and increase the minimum allowable size of red snapper, currently 14 inches (35.6 cm), to 15 inches (38.1 cm) for persons subject to the bag limit. NMFS also proposes to delay the opening of the commercial fishery for red snapper until February 24, 1995. NMFS intends that these management measure adjustments, if adopted in final, become effective January 1, 1995, the beginning of the new fishing year. The intended effects of this rule are to prevent overfishing of red snapper and to ensure that the commercial red snapper fishery is open when demand for fresh fish is at its highest. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before December 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on the proposed rule must be sent to Robert Sadler, Southeast Region, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive N., St. Petersburg, FL 33702. Requests for copies of the framework regulatory amendment, which includes an environmental assessment and a regulatory impact review, and for copies of a minority report submitted by five Council members, should be sent to the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, 5401 W. Kennedy Boulevard, suite 331, Tampa, FL 33609&hyph;2486. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis is available from the Southeast Regional Office at the above address.
