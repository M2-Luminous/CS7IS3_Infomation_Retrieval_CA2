Figueroa noted that during his official visit to Argentina he reviewed this sensitive issue with his Argentine counterpart, Guido Di Tella, on 8 June and both arrived at the following conclusion: "We, the governments, already have done our part." The foreign ministers now believe it all depends on the Congresses. When CLARIN asked him if his remarks meant that he ruled out the possibility of resorting to arbitration, as established in the 1984 Peace and Friendship Treaty, Figueroa -- visibly annoyed -- responded: "I did not say that, but we do not rule out any possible solution ... all possibilities remain open." During a news conference at the National Foreign Service Institute [ISEN], Figueroa, who was joined by Di Tella, Argentine Ambassador to Chile Eduardo Iglesias, and Chilean Ambassador to Argentina Eduardo Rodriguez, stressed that the Argentine Government does not believe Chile would ultimately ask for arbitration as compensation for a possible adverse ruling in the Laguna del Desierto arbitration. This possibility had been discussed at ISEN by Foreign Ministry Secretary General Andres Cisneros and prompted an information request by Peronist Santa Cruz Deputy Rafael Flores, one of the rebels preventing the discussion of the Continental Glaciers agreement. Without citing any names, Figueroa noted: "There cannot be any other official message from the Argentine Government but the one voiced by Di Tella." High-ranking Foreign Ministry officials speculate that after November, when the arbitration court will issue a ruling on the Laguna del Desierto case surely favoring the Argentine position, Chile reportedly will seek arbitration on the Continental Glaciers to compensate for this possible diplomatic defeat.
