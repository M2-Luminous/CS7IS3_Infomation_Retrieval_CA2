The plan was presented at a recent meeting with chairmen of the people's committees of Hanoi and Haiphong Cities and of Quang Ninh, Ha Bac, and Hai Hung Provinces. Under the plan, the cities of Hanoi, Haiphong, and Ha Long of Quang Ninh Province will play a strategically important role in the socioeconomic stabilization and development program for the Bac Bo lowlands and the country as a whole. Hanoi, Haiphong, and Ha Long will become the entrances to the Bac Bo lowlands and key industrial centers. These cities show great potential in tourism, mineral resources, manpower, and sea-based economy. They also create many favorable conditions for exploiting and upgrading local sea port facilties to the same standards set by other sea ports in a number of Southeast Asian countries.
