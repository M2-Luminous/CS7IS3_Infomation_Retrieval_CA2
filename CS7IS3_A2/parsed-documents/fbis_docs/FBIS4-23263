FBIS4-23263 "drafr106_e_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-106 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Niger Labor Unions Embark on `Indefinite Strike' Labor Unions Embark on `Indefinite Strike' AB0106223294 Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French 1200 GMT 1 Jun 94 AB0106223294 Niamey Voix du Sahel Network French BFN [Excerpts] Niger workers of the public sector this morning embarked on their first general, indefinite strike at the request of the Federation of Labor Unions of Niger [USTN]. Parastatals will not follow the indefinite strike, but they will experience disruptions in labor through periodic strikes. The USTN is demanding, among other things, the abrogation of a decree regulating strikes in the civil service and a 30- to 50-percent increase in salary. Several people in Niamey and in the provinces have condemned this indefinite strike, which they say will be suicidal for educational institutions in Niger. These institutions run the risk of experiencing three invalid academic years within four. In a communique issued yesterday evening, the government spokesman condemned the intransigence of the labor union and threatened to enforce the existing laws on any worker who will not report for work. However, the government confirmed its readiness to create the conditions for a sincere partnership. Here is the minister of communications, Massaoudou Hassoumi: [Begin Hassoumi recording] [passage omitted] Out of the seven-point demands there was total agreement on five, a partial agreement on one point, and a disagreement on one point. The calm which prevailed throughout the negotiations, and the impression created that both sides admit to important results having been achieved, did not hint that the labor union was going to maintain its indefinite strike order. The government reiterates its readiness to create conditions for a sincere partnership. However, in the face of the labor union's intransigence to maintain its strike order, the government reaffirms its firm determination to strictly enforce provisions regulating strikes. It calls on workers who care for the future for the future of our country to report for work. Thank you. [end recording]
