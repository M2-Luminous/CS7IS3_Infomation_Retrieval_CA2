Speaking in Johannesburg on Monday, negotiations services division director David Hartridge said the terms of tariff preferences for developing countries in GATT had been exaggerated. "Those developing countries which have grown fastest are those most exposed to world markets," he said. "Preferences can be withheld from any country and can be withdrawn at any time, and they have tended to be least generous for products where developing countries are competitive suppliers." South Africa has considered seeking a reclassification of its GATT status as a developed-country to a developing-country as its economy is heavily dependent upon primary exports and imports of capital goods. However, he said that some sectors of the country's economy were highly competitive, and it had advanced infrastructure and strong financial and educational institutions. The United States and other developed countries have resisted South Africa's reclassification as it is one of the world's top 30 trading nations. Mr Hartridge said instead South Africa should seek to integrate itself more fully in the world economy through increasing trade liberalisation. "The best strategy might be to strengthen bilateral relationships with major trading partners... rather than to rely on developing-country status as a claim to preferential treatment." The country would not only enjoy better access to foreign markets but also, more importantly, the beneficial effects of competition and stable trade policies on the efficiency of the economy. The GATT Secretariat has estimated South Africa's average tariff reduction, according to its offer, would be 28 per cent and the tariff structure considerably simplified. Mr Hartridge said this would greatly benenfit the country's manufacturing sector: "It is very hard to plan and cost production when the price of essential imports can be raised at any time in response to demands for protection from inefficient local suppliers."
