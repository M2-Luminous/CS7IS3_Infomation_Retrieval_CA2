But before answering journalists' questions, the Ukrainian Supreme Council chairman reported on the future activities of the parliament. In particular, this relates to the introduction of changes and amendments to the Law on Local Councils and Self-Government, aimed at defining equal subordination of council chairmen, as well as the need to more accurately define the electoral procedures and counting of votes to select the winners. It has been planned to focus the future work of the parliament on economic issues. Parliament will hear a report by the Cabinet of Ministers on the current situation, in order to reduce risk and simultaneously define the starting point for the new authorities. Oleksandr Moroz is to deliver a report on the problems of stabilizing the economic situation, and to define the main directions for parliament action. Only following that, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk will submit to the Supreme Council for approval the candidate for prime minister, whose plan for action would be able to confirm all decisions by the Supreme Council. All this is being done, Oleksandr Moroz noted, so that both legislative and executive authorities bear responsibility for the coordination of actions of the Supreme Council and the Cabinet of Ministers. Oleksandr Moroz also voiced his support for amplifying functions and broadening the powers of the Cabinet of Ministers. Of course, there were tricky questions and smart answers as well. Here is the quintessence. Read and judge for yourself: [Correspondent] If the Cabinet of Ministers and the prime minister obtained broader executive powers than its current ones, this would mean taking them away from the president. What functions, in your opinion, should the head of state have? [Moroz] He should represent Ukraine so that it does not lose its image before the world community as a member of international organizations, in issues concerning nuclear weapons, or trade relations. The president must defend Ukraine's image. Regarding internal affairs, the president is not able to concentrate on executive functions, he must hand them over to the Cabinet of Ministers. Yet, the president should be a guarantor of the Constitution, he should prevent any violations. [Correspondent] Currently, there is an opinion that it is inexpedient to form a government before electing the president. What is your standpoint on this issue? [Moroz] The point is not to form the government, but to appoint the prime minister. No one can be sure that the president will be elected. [Correspondent] But there is a constitutional provision saying the new president presents the candidate for prime minister. [Moroz] No. It has been written in the Constitution that the president presents the prime minister. If the Supreme Council approves him in three days from now, it will do the same in three weeks. [Correspondent] You are not campaigning much for yourself. Perhaps you need to meet with company staffs more often? Is it important for you to participate in the presidential campaign? [Moroz] My main task was to begin the Supreme Council's work. When I was in the hospital, I was actively campaigning for myself among the medical personnel. In general, I could put it this way: "I am not asking you to vote for me, but for the man you trust. I am not seeking power, but my goal is to become the president." I will be holding meetings with staffs. [Correspondent] It has been rumored that if you do not become the president, you will begin a battle against the presidency. Is that so? [Moroz] No. The main point is to find within society the optimum correlations between powers and functions of different authorities. In Germany, for instance, all this was done, I would say, in an intelligent manner. I would also like us to define everything in an optimum way, so that hair does not stand on end on heads of people supporting the division of power.... [Correspondent] In which office do you think you would feel better -- that of Supreme Council chairman, or president? [Moroz] I cannot say which role is better: I became the chairman quite recently, and I have not yet worked as the president. Therefore, I will answer this question later. [Correspondent] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said that he would hold consultations concerning the candidacy for prime minister. Has this taken place, and has the candidacy been approved? [Moroz] Yes. Leonid Kravchuk attended the Supreme Council session. Six names were discussed, and we agreed on two of them. But since the president is to name them, I will not do it. [Correspondent] Do you consider it necessary that a presidential candidate submit his income declaration? [Moroz] Of course, this is a norm of the law, and I have complied with it. As a matter of fact, my declaration has not stunned anybody. [Correspondent] If this is not a secret, what is your salary? [Moroz] I have not yet received it, but it approximately amounts to 2-2.5 million [currency not specified]. [Correspondent] President Kravchuk has recently said that he does not see poorly dressed or hungry people in Ukraine... [Moroz] There is nothing strange about this if someone stays among well-dressed and well-fed people. However, a theater actress lives in my building. Her pension is not enough to make ends meet. I help her with food that I grow on my countryside farm. It is difficult for her to receive such help, and it is also difficult for me that I must help her in such a way. [Correspondent] If Kravchuk and Kuchma advance to the second round of elections, for whom will you vote? [Moroz] I will tell you that after 26 June, when they advance to the second round. [Correspondent] What, in your opinion, will be the results of the 24 July elections for Ukrainian people's deputies in 112 constituencies? [Moroz] I believe that the current proportions among forces in the Supreme Council will be preserved. However, deputies will not be elected everywhere. Perhaps we will have around 60-70 people elected. [Correspondent] You have four grandchildren. Have you already built, for example, a cottage for them? [Moroz] I feel shameful that I have not done anything like that for them. I recall when I was removing couch-grass from my farm, I told to myself that socialism can be built together, but a cottage just alone. [Correspondent] Deputies are supposed to put into shape their working relations with the Supreme Council. How will they provide for themselves, will their salary be raised? [Moroz] Cheap deputies may cost the state a lot. Their current salary amounts to 1.3-1.5 million [currency not specified]. One must take it into account that there is no housing for them in Kiev, they live in hotels. Their families live separately, which means additional expenses. Perhaps, considering all this, deputies' salaries will be raised. But, we will publish everything to avoid speculations. In general, prices must be brought in line with wages, because the artificially suppressed inflation will explode anyway. [Correspondent] There is a talk that legislation depriving deputies of immunity is already being drafted in parliament. [Moroz] According to the Law on Deputy Status, a deputy is an immune person. If a deputy violates the law, however, he must be accountable not as a deputy, but as a citizen. All citizens are equal before the law. [Correspondent] Do you need your own team of people, and according to what principle do you select them? [Moroz] I need a team, and the principle is the ability to objectively assess processes. Based on my experience as Socialist Party leader, where we have different people, very different, and where I have probably lost more health than in any other work, I know that discrepancies in opinions are not important to me, but causes are. [Correspondent] Would it not be more expedient for parliament to elect the president? [Moroz] These elections must be held according to current legislation. In general, I think that it would be better to elect the president not in direct elections, but by, for example, a congress of councils of all levels, which would have a higher level of legitimacy. This congress of councils of all levels, not the parliament, could also adopt amendments to the Constitution. The Constitution would then be protected. In general, one must first adopt an amendment to the Constitution, and then an appropriate law, not to the contrary, as was the case before. [Correspondent] Do you think that the state should assist the press, which is currently in a very difficult situation? [Moroz] Attacks on the press began as early as 1986 in the Soviet Union, and due to inertia, it still continues. But, it is the reader who must be protected, so that subscription fees for a publication he needs do not ruin his family budget. Currently, many people do not subscribe to anything, because their wages do not allow for that. I believe that not publications, but the Communication Ministry must be subsidized, and then all publications will have equal conditions before the readers. [Correspondent] What periodic publications do you like? [Moroz] I like those I can read without glasses. But speaking seriously, I like all of them, there are different things in different newspapers. There are papers that publish some things I already know. This is not interesting. Currently, I flip through approximately 15 publications, most of all those dealing with politics and authorities, reviews, and commentaries. [Correspondent] Have you read the latest stories concerning Kravchuk? [Moroz] About Kravchuk? I know more about him than the authors of those stories. I do not read them. Rada Havrylivna, Shcherbytskyy's [former first secretary of the Ukrainian SSR Communist Party] wife, has presented me with a book about him. I started to read it, and I understood that the author based his position on Shcherbytskyy's. I put the book aside. Perhaps I will read it one day. [Correspondent] You once said that no political force is putting pressure on you. What if one does, how will you react? [Moroz] Adequately. I understand what you are trying to say: Apparently, the communists are putting pressure on me. So are other forces. In general, there is no majority in parliament, and I will do everything to maintain this situation. I believe that my goal is to consolidate all forces. [Correspondent] Do you personally make decisions, or is common opinion a stimulus for you? [Moroz] There are various approaches. When I see that someone's proposal has more merit, I support it. As a rule, however, the majority of people do not accept progressive decisions, at least, not immediately. So one must convince them. I am accused of having dangerous intentions, for example, in my program. My positions are criticized, but when I ask which ones in particular, my accusers cannot answer, because they have not read my program. They say that I am an enemy of Ukraine, of the state and the people. These allegations are groundless. I stand for the protection of our social achievements: the guaranteed rights to work, education, health care, and cultural development. History must not be distorted, this will do no good. We were celebrating the 50th anniversary of setting up the second front, and we had even forgotten to invite members of the anti-Nazi coalition. Events are being seen in a different light now, even though there are no grounds for that to be the case. [Correspondent] Are you going to visit the Crimea? [Moroz] Yes. But before that, I want to do some preliminary work. Besides, the Crimean problem is not as acute as it is being portrayed by certain media. Regarding the Crimea, the main thing is to prevent the use of force. All problems must be resolved in a political manner.
