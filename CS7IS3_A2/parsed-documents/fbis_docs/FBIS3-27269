The Economic Ministry recently proposed that direct shipping links between specific ports in special zones in Taiwan and Mainland China be allowed, first to reduce transportation cost and time mainly for mainland-bound shipping from Taiwan and vice versa. But in a study report released Thursday, MAC said the cost of direct shipping links between specified ports or cities across the Strait is virtually the same as the cost of across-the-board direct shipping links between Taiwan and the mainland. The council argued that cross-Strait direct shipping links will be most likely accompanied by several major problems. These include Taiwan's greater reliance on Mainland China on the economic and trade front, a more rampant smuggling of Mainland Chinese products, and the illegal entry of mainlanders into Taiwan.
