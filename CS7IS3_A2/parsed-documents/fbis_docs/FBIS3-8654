An official source from the Vidin police announced this at a news conference today. Following questioning, 18 of the 21 persons were released. The three remaining in custody for further questioning are the ship's captain Kostadin Stoyanov, 39, from Ruse; the captain's first mate, Atanas Denchev, also from Ruse; and the engineer, Dimitur Krumov. The only woman found on board was the wife of one of the members of the crew and holds a seaman's passport, Nikolay Dechev, chief of the Vidin police, announced at the news conference. In my personal opinion, the story of the hijacking of the Khan Kubrat by armed persons is a put-on, he added. The regional police chief said that the entire operation of detaining the vessel at 1500 on 13 March was carried out superbly and that the organization had worked perfectly. The National Investigation Service opened an investigation into the case on 8 March, and its investigations will extend to several regions: Vidin, Pleven, Blagoevgrad, and Ruse. Nikolay Dechev believes that the investigation into the Khan Kubrat incident will be concluded fairly soon.
