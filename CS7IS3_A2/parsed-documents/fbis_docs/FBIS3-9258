War Crimes Commission, at least 55,000 war crimes have been committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, TANJUG has learnt at the Information Center of the Serbian Council (ICSC) on Tuesday. Most of these crimes were committed against Serb civilians in Croatia, the ICSC said. It is estimated that a lot more crimes have in fact been committed because, according to a statement of Chairman of the U.N. War Crimes Commission Cherif Bassiouni, not all rapes have been reported nor have all mass graves been investigated. Many crimes are still undiscovered, especially in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, where fierce Moslem-Croat clashes have been underway for already a year and the conflicting sides have been accussing each other of intentional destruction of settlements, massacres of civilians and torture of prisoners. The commission of U.N. experts for war crimes on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, set up two years ago on the basis of U.N. Security Council Resolution 780, has not managed to carry out the expected investigation but has only managed to gather documentation. As the commission's mandate expires on April 30, it will not [words indistinct] in eastern Slavonia, on the territory of the Republic of Serb Krajina, which has been planned for April 10. The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 in Serb ancestral lands in the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia in response to Croatia's violent secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and its attempt to downgrade the Serbs to a national minority. On March 20, Croatia sent a protest letter to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali claiming that the commission was "discontinuing work" and that this was "sabotage against the investigation on the principal war criminals," a description reserved by the Croatian propaganda for Serbs. Zagreb had intentionally falsified facts because, above all, the commision was not discontinuing work but its mandate was expiring and thus the task it was entrusted to do was being wrapped up regardless of the fact commission had carried it out. Besides, due to financial and technical reasons the commission postponed the beginning of the investigation. Croatia thus gained time and with the expiration of the commission's mandate, managed to avoid an international inquiry into the deaths of the victims buried on its territory. "We have reliably established that there are 87 graves where murdered Serbs have been buried in Croatia," an ICSC official Vojin Dabic told TANJUG and added that the Serb side had undisputable evidence for this. This evidence was recognized zy the commission's secretary Julio Baez, during his visit on March 10, he said. Dabic added that the ICSC has reliable information that Croats have ploughed over some graves on their territory, such as the one in Pakracka Poljana in western Slavonia, ahead of the arrival of U.N. commission experts, in order to hide traces of the crime. That is precisely why we have to find out where the remains of the Serb victims have been moved, he said.
