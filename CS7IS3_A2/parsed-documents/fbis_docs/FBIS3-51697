"The make quick incursions using light planes to collect drugs, usually from clandestine airstrips," Soliz said. The secretary told journalists that the police are unable to interdict those flights because they are small, random, difficult to detect, and do not follow a set timetable. Soliz Valenzuela said the constant violation of Bolivian airspace occurs because the borders are long and "difficult to control." He said: "The presence of Colombian drug cartels in Bolivia is of obvious concern because they encourage cocaine paste production." He added, however, that our authorities are doing everything necessary to prevent it from getting out of control. Asked about reports on abuses involving DEA agents, Soliz said there are no specific reports that can be investigated. "Reports are made in general terms. No one has mentioned names or specific cases, otherwise we would have acted immediately and punished those responsible," Soliz said. He said the government does not know how many DEA agents operate in the country. "I will ask the DEA coordinator in the country for a complete report to find out how many operate in Bolivia," Soliz concluded.
