At the end of more than three hours of talks, UDMR President Bela Marko was kind enough to answer several questions from journalists. First, he referred to a list of documents presented by the UDMR to the president. [Marko] "This list actually contains a number of older UDMR documents as well as several more recent documents, including a draft bill on national minorities and autonomous communities worked out by the UDMR and already submitted to the Chamber of Deputies. Consequently, I actually put forth the idea that this package of documents, this list, contains all the more important problems of the minorities in Romania and of the Hungarian minority in Romania; on the other hand, in addition to problems, it also offers solutions to these problems, through the draft bill, that is, solutions to a number of concrete issues. "Of course, the package presented to the president also includes our position regarding the recommendations of the Council of Europe, since the majority of these recommendations coincide with the problems raised in the UDMR memorandum, namely, the problem of the law on education -- or rather the problem of the chapter of that draft bill on education dealing with instruction in the language of the minorities, which has not yet been discussed or approved by the Education Commission of the Chamber of Deputies -- the problem of the law on minorities, the problem of church assets and religious schools, as well as other concrete problems that could have been solved without too much delay, such as the situation of the people imprisoned in the wake of the December 1989 events in Harghita County and of the events of March 1990 in Targu Mures; despite the promises of the representatives of the government and of the institutions of the executive power in Romania, these problems have not yet been solved." [Announcer] Bela Marko was asked about President Ion Iliescu's reaction to the UDMR's proposals: [Marko] "I must point out that we have very different positions on a number of major problems. At the same time, we conducted a rather thorough dialogue on all the problems raised today and we reached the conclusion that the presidency will examine the list of documents presented by us, with the promise that conclusions will be drawn on these matters. However, I would like to emphasize that our positions are very different on the majority of the problems discussed." [Announcer] The UDMR president was asked by journalists to elaborate on the aide memoire sent by the UDMR to the Council of Europe. [Marko] "The aide memoire assesses the current situation, since four months have elapsed since Romania's admission to the Council of Europe and, despite the fact that the Council's people will check on Romania's compliance with these criteria within six months, for the time being we note that no progress has been made in the past four months in terms of complying with those criteria."
