The meeting lasted more than an hour. During the meeting the head of the Israeli Government, who was a combat general in the recent past, set out the main principles of Israel's military doctrine. Theoretically Israel's defensive strategy corresponds to a considerable degree with our own doctrine -- both of them are based on defense, the Russian minister pointed out. The only difference is that we mould our defenses in different ways. Their effectiveness depends on equipment which both armies use. Pavel Grachev stressed that the Russian leadership attaches special importance to the achievement of peace in the Near East since this region is in direct proximity to Russia's borders. Failure to settle Near East problems could have unpredictable consequences, including ethnic and religious ones, for the entire world, including Russia. In this connection it is essential to make every effort to bring about a political settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. This can only be achieved through joint efforts. Pavel Grachev noted the importance of varied, including military, cooperation between Russia and Israel. Naturally, he said, from the results of the first meeting we cannot examine the possibilities opening up before us in detail. But a mechanism for implementing these plans already exists: a military attache from Israel is already working in Moscow, at the end of April or beginning of May the apparatus of a Russian military attache will be working in Israel. We shall charge them with working out the relevant program, Grachev said. Today our guest in his capacity as minister of defense has invited me to make an official visit to Israel, and there we shall outline a plan for our future bilateral relations in the military field. Israel's prime minister stated that the Russian leadership, and first and foremost Russian President Boris Yeltsin, had assured him that Russia is striving to achieve the establishment of peace in the Near East. This striving, Y. Rabin said, we also share, although we have different contacts and relations with the third parties. When the aims are identical, however, corresponding interests also emerge that will, I hope, lead to the successful completion of the Arab-Israeli talks. After the meeting Yitzhaq Rabin delivered a lecture to an audience at the Academy of the General Staff on the subject of military doctrine in Israel.
