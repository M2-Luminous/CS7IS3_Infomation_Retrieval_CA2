In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR, these sources said France supports in principle inspections on land, saying this will ease the economic burden on Jordan caused by ship inspections in the Red Sea. These sources called for expediting measures to end the restrictions imposed on free navigation into the Port of al-'Aqabah, and pointed out His Majesty King Husayn's position on this subject, which calls for lifting and easing these measures before Jordan returns to the negotiations table. The sources emphasized that France has held several contacts with Jordan on this issue in its capacity as a country directly concerned in this subject, in addition to contacts France has conducted with European countries and the United States in order to reach an agreement on the ideal way to carry out inspections and ease the burden on Jordan.
