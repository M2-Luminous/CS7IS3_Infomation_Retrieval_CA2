Northern Laos is rich in lignite -- the first deposit found has a lignite reserve of the same amount found at Thailand's Mae Mo mine in Lampang Province. Yet, there are still many more lignite deposits in Laos believed to be larger than what has been found in Thailand. The assessment was made by a subsidiary of the Ngan Thawi Group in Hongsa of Laos whose lignite mine can generate power for over 60 years. Also based on the old French maps, Laos has iron ore deposits in Luang Nam Tha; zinc and copper mines in Xieng Khouang; and gems, especially a large amount of blue sapphires, in Bokeo. The central part of the country is covered with forests and water sources suitable for building hydroelectric dams. The Nam Ngum hydroelectric dam is now providing electricity for Thailand. In southern Laos, there are oil deposits and forests and water sources, good for the construction of a hydroelectric dam. There are already two dams there -- Nam Theun 1 and Nam Theun 2. There is a vast area still untapped, and it is possible that there are abundant resources in the area. Dr. Wiraphong noted that, from assessments, the potential of Laos' energy production could turn the country into one of richest in terms of economic potential since that means the 4 million inhabitants of Laos can export 20,000 megawatts of power annually, in other words, a highest per capita income. The country would become "a second Brunei." That is why Laos is focussing on investment in energy development. The program is incorporated in the fourth national economic and social development plan, which will begin on 1 January 1995. Based on the assessment, the best way to earn an income for the country and to attain an economic stability is through exports of energy. Meanwhile, Thailand would be a major customer of Laos, because Thailand can no longer expand production of energy, while demand is always increasing. Thailand therefore needs a power supply from Laos. Anyway, Dr. Wiraphong said he prefers to see Thailand buying power from Laos for direct consumption instead of buying bunker oil from Saudi Arabia for power production. By importing power from Laos, Thailand is helping a brother country. The money spent will remain circulated within the region and could one day return to Thailand. In conclusion, he said: "Whether Laos would be successful in economic development and become a second Brunei also depends on Thailand, since Thailand will be the sole country to buy electricity and power from Laos. Vietnam is self-sufficient in this area and can rely on local production; the same is true for China. The customer of Laos is Thailand."
