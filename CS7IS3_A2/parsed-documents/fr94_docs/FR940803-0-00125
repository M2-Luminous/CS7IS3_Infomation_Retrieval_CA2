FR940803-0-00125 FR940803-0-00040 (6) For the purposes of calculating a base level fuel economy value, if the only vehicle configuration(s) within the base level are vehicle configuration(s) which are intended for sale at high altitude, the Administrator may use fuel economy data from tests conducted on these vehicle configuration(s) at high altitude to calculate the fuel economy for the base level. (7) For alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel automobiles the procedures of paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section shall be used to calculate two separate sets of city, highway, and combined fuel economy values for each base level. (i) Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy values from the tests performed using gasoline or diesel test fuel. (ii) Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy values from the tests performed using alcohol or natural gas test fuel. (b) For each model type, as determined by the Administrator, a city, highway, and combined fuel economy value will be calculated by using the projected sales and fuel economy values for each base level within the model type. (1) If the Administrator determines that automobiles intended for sale in the State of California are likely to exhibit significant differences in fuel economy from those intended for sale in other states, he will calculate fuel economy values for each model type for vehicles intended for sale in California and for each model type for vehicles intended for sale in the rest of the states. (2) The sales fraction for each base level is calculated by dividing the projected sales of the base level within the model type by the projected sales of the model type and rounding the quotient to the nearest 0.0001. (3) The city fuel economy values of the model type (calculated to the nearest 0.0001 mpg) are determined by dividing one by a sum of terms, each of which corresponds to a base level and which is a fraction determined by dividing: (i) The sales fraction of a base level; by (ii) The city fuel economy value for the respective base level. (4) The procedure specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section is repeated in an analogous manner to determine the highway and combined fuel economy values for the model type. (5) For alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel automobiles the procedures of paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section shall be used to calculate two separate sets of city, highway, and combined fuel economy values for each model type. (i) Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy values from the tests performed using gasoline or diesel test fuel. (ii) Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy values from the tests performed using alcohol or natural gas test fuel. 19. A new §600.209&hyph;95 is added to subpart C to read as follows: §600.209&hyph;95 Calculation of fuel economy values for labeling. (a) For the purposes of calculating the city model type fuel economy value for labeling the manufacturer shall: (1)(i) For general labels for gasoline-fueled, diesel-fueled, alcohol-fueled, and natural gas-fueled automobiles multiply the city model type fuel economy value determined in §600.207 (b), by 0.90, rounding the product to the nearest whole mpg; or (ii) For general labels for alcohol dual fuel and natural gas dual fuel automobiles: (A) Multiply the city model type fuel economy calculated from the tests performed using gasoline or diesel test fuel as determined in §600.207 (b)(5)(i) by 0.90, rounding the product to the nearest whole mpg; and (B) Multiply the city model type fuel economy calculated from the tests performed using alcohol or natural gas test fuel as determined in §600.207 (b)(5)(ii) by 0.90, rounding the product to the nearest whole mpg; or (2)(i) For specific labels for gasoline-fueled, diesel-fueled, alcohol-fueled, and natural gas-fueled automobiles, multiply the city model type fuel economy value determined in §600.206 (a)(2)(iii), by 0.90, rounding the product to the nearest whole mpg; or (ii) For specific labels for alcohol dual fuel and natural gas dual fuel automobiles: (A) Multiply the city model type fuel economy calculated from the tests performed using gasoline or diesel test fuel as determined in §600.206 (a)(2)(iii) and (4)(i) by 0.90, rounding the product to the nearest whole mpg; and (B) Multiply the city model type fuel economy calculated from the tests performed using alcohol or natural gas test fuel as determined in §600.206 (a)(2)(iii) and (4)(ii) by 0.90, rounding the product to the nearest whole mpg. (b) For the purposes of calculating the highway model type fuel economy value for labeling the manufacturer shall: (1)(i) For general labels for gasoline-fueled, diesel-fueled, alcohol-fueled, and natural gas-fueled automobiles, multiply the highway model type fuel economy value determined in §600.207 (b), by 0.78, rounding the product to the nearest whole mpg; or (ii) For general labels for alcohol dual fuel and natural gas dual fuel automobiles: (A) Multiply the highway model type fuel economy calculated from the tests performed using gasoline or diesel test fuel as determined in §600.207 (b)(5)(i) by 0.78, rounding the product to the nearest whole mpg; and (B) Multiply the highway model type fuel economy calculated from the tests performed using alcohol or natural gas test fuel as determined in §600.207 (b)(5)(ii) by 0.78, rounding the product to the nearest whole mpg; or
