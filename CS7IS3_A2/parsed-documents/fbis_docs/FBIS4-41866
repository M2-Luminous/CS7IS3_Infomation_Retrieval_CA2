Terekhov and others] [Text] Russia pins hopes on negotiations on the nuclear theme between the United States and North Korea, due to begin in Geneva, but still wants an international conference on the issue. "Moscow's proposal to that effect is still on the agenda", the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has told Interfax. He was speaking in Moscow on Tuesday after talks with his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen. Kozyrev said "Russia and China are unanimous that to ensure the non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula political solutions must be found." "Our Chinese counterparts have taken interest in Russia's proposal to convene an international conference. They have the intention to consider the most suitable conditions, when they take shape, in order to return to that idea once again", Kozyrev said. Qian Qichen said that China and Russia's great interest in resolving the problem stems from their geographic proximity to the Korean Peninsula. "We wish to see the success of the forthcoming US-North-Korean talks. As for Russia's proposal to convene an international conference, China has responded to it with understanding. We believe, however, that proposal can materialize only when there are appropriate favorable conditions for it." Kozyrev said that Russian-Chinese relations were on the ascent. "That upward trend will reach a culmination when China's Premier [as received] Jiang Zemin visits Russia in the autumn. During that visit at least five or six agreements, including a major political treaty will be signed", he said. Kozyrev said he was certain that the Chinese Premier's visit to Russia would become "a land-mark event in fostering neighborly and friendly relations and partnership between the Russia and China." After the foreign ministers ended the talks their deputies Aleksandr Panov and Dai Bingguo initialled an agreement on the Russian-Chinese state border in the West and signed a protocol of cooperation in the field of information exchanges between the Russian and Chinese foreign ministries. Kozyrev's Political Advisor Galina Sidorova told Interfax that during the talks with Kozyrev Qian Quichen said he was satisfied with partnership established between Russia and the Western countries and NATO. Kozyrev stressed that Russia was developing partnership both with the West and the East, including China. Such relations will help to strengthen international security, are not aimed against the interests of any third countries and reflect the special situation of Russia as a great European power, Sidorova said.
