The courageous Libyan people are advancing along the road chosen by them, not yielding to the pressure of the imperialists.

The Korean people will, in the future, too, make active efforts to upgrade the friendly relations with the Libyan people. MINJU CHOSON in a by-lined article says the Korean people wish the Libyan people greater success in their efforts to build a new society.
