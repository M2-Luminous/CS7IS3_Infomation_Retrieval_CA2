In this regard, top officials of the four economic organizations pointed out that "it is a big shock to the economic world because there were signs that the Japanese economy was about to begin recovering from stagnation and that the yen exchange rate was becoming stable," (according to Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations). The top officials demanded that the government take concrete measures, including income tax reduction and deregulation, to reduce Japan's trade surplus. They also asked the monetary authorities to strongly intervene in the money market. Chairman Toyoda also said: "An appropriate level of the yen- dollar exchange rate is between Y110 and Y120. Actual gross national product for fiscal 1994 will drop by 0.8 percent if the exchange rate of Y100 to the dollar continues for a year." Ken Hayami, chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations, stressed: "We may even have industrial stagnation, increased unemployment, and social unrest if we allow yen's abnormally high value, which does not reflect the actual economic conditions." Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber o Commerce and Industry, expressed his concern, saying that "it will be a serious blow to small-to-medium-sized enterprises." Yu Hayami, representative secretary of the Japanese Association of Corporate Executives, stated: "The dollar fell against all currencies as a result of apprehension about possible inflation in the United States and other things. Even the United States cannot tolerate the dollar's further decline."
