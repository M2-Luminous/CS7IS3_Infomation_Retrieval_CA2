In a free and easy atmosphere, the minister briefed journalists about the problems with which the personnel of Ukraine's Armed Forces are confronted. Analyzing the past year, the minister listed, among positive aspects, the fact that the Armed Forces have finally received their Military Doctrine, specified their numerical strength, and appointed Armed Forces Day -- 6 December. Over the last year, the Supreme Council, president, and government issued about 100 laws, decrees, edicts, and directive dealing with the army. Temporary statutes for the troops were adopted. Much has been done for the reduction of the Armed Forces. While at the end of 1991, there were 726,000 military formations, their number has now decreased by one-third. The reduction will continue. By the end of 1995, the Armed Forces will have 450,000 servicemen. By now, 603 tanks, 630 infantry fighting vehicles [IFV] and armored personnel carriers, as well as 750 helicopters and aircraft have been scrapped. By the end of 1995, Ukraine will have up to 4,080 tanks, 5,050 IFV, 4,040 units of artillery, and 1,090 aircraft. Ukraine is fulfilling a peace-keeping mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Recently, the Supreme Council adopted a decision to increase the numerical strength of the Ukrainian battalion there to 1,220 persons. In this connection, yet another battalion is being brought up to strength and contracts are being concluded with servicemen. This means that regular-service soldiers will not be enlisted for this subdivision. The defense minister expressed surprise that parents are asking their sons to be sent precisely to that dangerous region. "Perhaps, because their income is greater than yours," suggested one of the journalists. The minister made a calculation: "If a soldier receives between $500 and $600 a month, whereas the minister's salary is $67, the reason for the enthusiasm may well be understood." The army still has no single command system. When it is created, and this will take place between 1995 and 1996, the air-defense and air force troops will be unified. At present, the army is in the process of introducing the Ukrainian language. At any rate, the orderly officers in subunits report in the state language, and the combat training also proceeds with the help of the Ukrainian language. The problem lies in assimilating the military terminology. The minister fully supported the Ukrainian president's concluding the tripartite agreement, because nuclear warheads are deployed in our troops, but they are controlled and also serviced outside Ukraine. Why should Ukraine need weapons, which cannot help, but only create problems, which cannot be resolved by us. Isn't it better to transfer them away from Ukraine? All the more so since the state will receive compensation for them. At the same time, Ukraine remains a great space-missile power. We have everything necessary for creating missiles, which may be launched into space. We are capable of launching artificial satellites for communication purposes, for agricultural needs, and, it goes without saying, for resolving military problems. The minister also touched upon numerous questions of military building and answered journalists' questions.
