FR940207-1-00057 FR940207-1-00013 EPA recognized that the UMTRCA regulatory scheme encompasses a design standard. EPA made minor amendments to this scheme to better facilitate implementation of the regulation without fundamentally altering the current method of compliance. Subpart D, as amended, requires site control to be carried out in accordance with a written tailings closure plan (radon), and in a manner which ensures that closure activities are initiated as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control of licensees). The tailings closure plan (radon), either as originally written or subsequently amended, will be incorporated into the individual site licenses, including provisions for and amendments to the milestones for control, after NRC or an affected Agreement State finds that the schedule reflects compliance as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control of the licensee). The compliance schedules are to be developed consistent with the targets set forth in the MOU as reasonably applied to the specific circumstances of each site with a goal that final closure occur by December 31, 1997, for those non-operational uranium mill tailings piles listed in the MOU between EPA, NRC and affected Agreement States (at 56 FR 67568), or seven years after the date on which the impoundments cease operation for all other piles. These schedules must include key closure milestones and other milestones which are reasonably calculated to promote timely compliance with the 20 pCi/m 2 -s flux standard. Milestones which are not reasonably calculated to advance timely compliance with the radon air emissions standard, e.g. installation of erosion protection and groundwater corrective actions, are not relevant to the tailings closure plans (radon). In addition, subpart D requires that licensees ensure that radon closure milestone activities, such as wind blown tailings retrieval and placement on the pile, interim stabilization (including dewatering or the removal of freestanding liquids and recontouring), and radon barrier construction, are undertaken to achieve compliance with, including attainment of, the 20 pCi/m 2 -s flux standard as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility. The goal of the amendments to subpart D is for existing sites, or those that become non-operational in the future, to achieve compliance as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control of licensees) within the time periods set forth in the MOU, including Attachment A thereto, and for new sites to achieve compliance no later than seven years after becoming non-operational. However, if the NRC or an Agreement State makes a finding that compliance with the 20 pCi/m 2 -s flux standard has been demonstrated through appropriate monitoring, after providing an opportunity for public participation, then the performance of the milestone(s) may be extended. If an extension is granted, then during the period of the extension, compliance with the 20 pCi/m 2 -s flux standard must be demonstrated each year. Additionally, licensees may request, based upon cost, that the final compliance date for emplacement of the permanent radon barrier, or relevant milestone set forth in the applicable license or incorporated in the (radon) tailings closure plan, be extended. The NRC or an affected Agreement State may approve such a request if it finds, after providing the opportunity for public participation, that: (1) The licensee is making good faith efforts to emplace a permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve the 20 pCi/m 2 -s flux standard; (2) such delay is consistent with the definition of ``available technology;'' and (3) such delay will not result in radon emissions that are determined to result in significant incremental risk to the public health. Such a finding should be accompanied by new deadlines which reasonably correspond to the target dates identified in Attachment A of the MOU. (56 FR 67569). EPA expects the NRC and Agreement States to act consistently with their commitment in the MOU and provide for public notice and comment on proposals or requests to (1) incorporate radon tailings closure plans or other schedules for effecting emplacement of a permanent radon barrier into licenses, and (2) amend the radon tailings closure schedules as necessary or appropriate for reasons of technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control of the licensees). Under the terms of the MOU, NRC should do so with notice timely published in the Federal Register . In addition, consistent with the MOU, members of the public may request NRC for action on these matters pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206. EPA also expects the Agreement States to provide comparable opportunities for public participation pursuant to their existing authorities and procedures.
