During a heated ANC caucus meeting on Tuesday [21 June] morning, Ramaphosa's position was strengthened when he was elected chairman of a committee to investigate the relationship between the cabinet and parliament. Caucus members accused President Nelson Mandela's government of taking decisions unilaterally and insisted that MPs have greater access to the parliamentary processes. Ramaphosa recently refused a cabinet position. Senior members of the National Party [NP] expressed their concern at the time, arguing that he was planning to frustrate the government of national unity by influencing decisions through the ANC caucus. According to reports, Ramaphosa was smarting because Thabo Mbeki was made deputy president instead of him. Apparently offered the portfolio of foreign affairs, by Mandela, he refused on grounds that he wanted to focus his energy on strengthening the ANC organizationally. He was later elected chairman of the Constitutional Assembly. The latest developments were watched with concern this week by NP members. They fear that all cabinet decisions may in future be subjected to ANC caucus approval, rendering them powerless. This, they maintain, will be "contrary to the spirit of national unity and nation-building". It was agreed between the ANC and the NP during negotiations last year that the new government would function on the basis of "power-sharing". If the balance of power is to shift to the ANC caucus, the NP will be powerless. The ANC caucus showed its muscle on Tuesday when it decided that a cabinet committee looking into the issue of a new capital for the country be disbanded. The four-man committee was appointed by Mandela and is led by Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer. The caucus insisted that a more representative committee be appointed, arguing that most members of the present committee were biased towards the Transvaal. Objections were also raised to the "untransparent" way the cabinet was functioning. MPs wanted the cabinet to seek the advice of caucus on policy issues and before any decisions were taken. Caucus chairman Mendi Msimanng released an angry statement after the meeting, demanding that a new committee investigate the location of the capital. ANC MP Raymond Suttner was reported as saying the people should be drawn into the decision-making process. "We don't want a parliament which is little more than a passive receiver of cabinet decisions." Ramaphosa called a media conference for Thursday afternoon to announce restructuring measures taken to improve the ANC organizationally. Details were not known at the time of going to press.
