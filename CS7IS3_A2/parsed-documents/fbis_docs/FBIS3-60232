State Councillor Song Jian and other leaders from the central and local governments took part in the meeting, which was sponsored by the Environmental Protection Committee of the State Council. Speaking at the meeting, Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Bureau of Environmental Protection, said that total proven coal reserves in the adjacent area of Shanxi-Shaanxi-Inner Mongolia now reach over 280 billion tons. He said that reasonable exploration of coal resources in the area is of great significance to promoting the development of the national economy. But, he added, natural conditions in the area are poor due to an overemphasis on exploration, to the detriment of environmental protection. As a result, the environment was seriously polluted in this area, with much coal wasted and a large portion of topsoil washed away, he said. He added that the central government has paid very close attention to environmental protection in developing natural resources in the area. He urged taking forceful measures to reorder coal exploration and strengthen supervision over environmental protection work in this area. In the near future, he continued, the urgent task is to clear out rivers to ensure that flood peaks pass safely in the coming year. The participants also investigated the serious soil damage in the area due to natural resource exploration.
