Kaushal chose to describe the four Pakistanis, charged under TADA [Terrorism and Disruptive Activites Prevention Act] along with two others, as highly trained and battle-hardened men who were well-versed in guerilla warfare and the use of rockets and artillery guns (courtesy the Afghan war). Khalid Pahelwan one of the four Pakistanis, is rated high in the Lahore-based outfit Islami Inquilabi Mahaz (IIM) for successfully participating in an armed attack on an Indian Army post at Mendhar in Poonch district early last year. Three others from IIM are believed to have entered India. Kaushal named them as Basharat, IIM finance secretary, Nadeem and Mohammed Farooq. It is believed Basharat and Nadeem are currently in Nepal. There is no trace of Farooq who was supposed to enter India from Bangladesh. IIM is headed by Imtiaz Ahmed Shami, a terrorist who has also seen action in Afghanistan and worked with Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). This group was sent to India by retired Pakistan army major Ehsan-ul-Haq who owns a knitwear company in Lahore. Kaushal said incriminating documents, some 16 kg of high explosives, seven electric detonators, two hand grenades, a fuse, two Pakistani passports, identification cards of health clubs in Delhi, diaries containing addresses and telephone numbers of various people in Pakistan, West Asia and United Kingdom were recovered from one of the hideouts in Dayalpura in the Gokulpuri area. The raid on the second hideout in Khureji -- from where Taimur Ali and the Bangladeshi Mohammed Raeef were nabbed -- led to the seizure of eight floppies. The documents were in compressed mode and had to be inflated before reading. The notes appeared to be taken from expert handbooks on improvised explosive devices and delivered to Pakistan for use in the Afghanistan war. The floppies contained material which, when printed, ran over 200 pages. It was all about the manufacture of disposable silencers, incendiary brick and torch, auto disablement, delay mechanism, various types of shaped charges, explosives from locally available material, the secret science of convert inks and easy production of poison. The Khureji hideout, from where a large quantity of chemicals was recovered, was being used as a laboratory for manufacturing explosive devices. According to Kaushal, the interrogation of the six revealed they had been told to establish bases in different metropolitan towns of India and then strike mainly with explosives on railway tracks, stations, bus stands, telephone lines, government and commercial buildings. They even intended to poison wells to create panic and cripple the economy by damaging the transport and communication system. They had been instructed to acquire Indian identities and merge with locals, Kaushal said. Diaries recovered from their hideouts revealed they were learning Hindi. Kaushal said Pakistan's ISI [Interservices Intelligence] was using Nepal and Bangladesh to launch subversive activities in India and was also diverting the help it obtained during the Afghan war. There had been as many as sixty explosions in the country after the demolition of the disputed Ayodhya structure, he said.
