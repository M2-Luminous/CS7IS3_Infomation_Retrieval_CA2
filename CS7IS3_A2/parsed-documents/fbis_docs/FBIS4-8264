Before being passed by parliament, the employment bill was criticized by the unions who organized an Old Town Square demonstration on March 22 to highlight their reservations against the possibility of a repeated conclusion of limited-period work contracts and an article allowing pregnant women to work night shifts. Parliament passed the bill the day after. The coalition and the Liberal Social National Party supported the bill while the opposition including the CSSD voted against it. Czech President Vaclav Havel signed the law on April 6.
