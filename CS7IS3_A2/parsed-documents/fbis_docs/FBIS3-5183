At the conference, "Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong gave a briefing of the meetings with Vietnamese leaders at which both sides informed each other about the current situation of their country, exchanged views on issues necessary for promoting friendly relations and mutual understanding, and discussed economic, investment, and trade cooperation between Vietnam and Singapore in the period to come." In response to a BANGKOK POST reporter's question regarding ASEAN membership for Vietnam, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said: [Goh Chok Tong] Singapore supports Vietnam joining ASEAN, but it should be done at the appropriate time. When that will happen depends on how Vietnam can contribute to the activities and affairs of ASEAN. I suggest that Vietnam study these programs. Vietnam is presently an observer of ASEAN, and its membership in ASEAN is only a matter of time. ASEAN opens its door to Vietnam, and only Vietnam can decide when to join. Answering a reporter of the Voice of Vietnam Radio who asked about the Vietnam-Singapore relations after the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam, he said: [Goh Chok Tong] At the moment, Singapore is Vietnam's largest trading partner, and the eighth largest investor. With the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo, we believe more American investment will come to Vietnam, not immediately, but maybe in a few years. Relations between Vietnam and Singapore have a bright future, though they only started three years ago. It was a short time, but I can affirm that our relations are excellent. Vietnam has sent many missions to Singapore to study our experience. I believe that business relations between the United States and Vietnam will also develop very well. Asked by a NHAN DAN reporter for his impression on his first visit to Vietnam, he said: [Goh Chok Tong] The visit to Vietnam reminds me of Singapore 30 years ago. I believe that Vietnam has tremendous potential for economic development. Singapore's investment in Vietnam can only develop if Vietnam achieves political stability and economic development. I believe that in the coming period, Vietnam's economy will develop strongly.
