FR940324-1-00052 FR940324-1-00019 The Council learned from a sea-sampling report in conjunction with FAAS # 7 that 95 percent by weight of the haddock caught on that trip was discarded. On that trip, a sampling of discarded fish indicated that 80 percent of the discarded haddock was sub-legal size. The Council has requested the Regional Director to gather additional information under FASS # 8 to determine whether a problem exists that requires management action. Potential Area Affected (1) The potential area of the proposed action that could be affected includes the area in and around the area known as Closed Area 1, defined at 50 CFR 651.21(a)(2) and encompassed by lines connecting the following points: (a) 40 ○53 ’ N. Latitude, 68 ○53 ’ W. Longitude; (b) 41 ○35 ’ N. Latitude, 68 ○30 ’ W. Longitude; (c) 41 ○50 ’ N. Latitude, 68 ○45 ’ W. Longitude; (d) 41 ○50 ’ N. Latitude, 69 ○00 ’ W. Longitude; (e) 41 ○30 ’ N. Latitude, 69 ○00 ’ W. Longitude; (f) 41 ○30 ’ N. Latitude, 69 ○23 ’ W. Longitude, and (a) 40 ○53 ’ N. Latitude, 68 ○53 ’ W. Longitude. Also included is the area defined by the Committee's recommendation in connection with FAAS # 7 bounded by lines connecting the following coordinates: (a) 41 ○30 ’ N. Latitude, 69 ○23 ’ W. Longitude; (b) 40 ○45 ’ N. Latitude, 68 ○45 ’ W. Longitude; (c) 40 ○45 ’ N. Latitude, 68 ○30 ’ W. Longitude; (d) 41 ○30 ’ N. Latitude, 68 ○30 ’ W. Longitude; (a) 41 ○30 ’ N. Latitude, 69 ○23 ’ W. Longitude; (2) The species that could be affected by any action would be haddock and Atlantic cod, primarily, and any other species for which fisheries are forced to move to other areas for the period of a closure. (3) The types of gear that could be affected by this action are all types of gear capable of catching groundfish, including, but not limited to, otter trawls, sink gillnets, hook gear, scallop dredge gear, traps, and any other gear types directed at haddock or that catch haddock in the area defined as a result of the fact-finding. (4) The fisheries that would be impacted are the commercial and recreational groundfish and scallop fisheries that operate in the area of the proposed action and use the gear types listed above. (5) The principal ports that would be affected are Portland, ME; Gloucester, MA; Boston, MA; New Bedford/Fairhaven, MA; and Galilee, RI. Some smaller ports near these larger ports could also be impacted. (6) The expected duration of the action is between 3 weeks and 6 months. If implemented as early as April 12, 1994, the action could last until October 9, 1994. (7) The Committee expects to recommend that those areas that are determined to have significant concentrations of spawning haddock be closed to fishing with the types of gear described in (3) above. Other actions which might be considered are implementation of any measures currently listed in the FMP and its implementing regulations, such as a minimum mesh size, etc. (8) The Council will begin analyzing the potential impacts from possible action upon publication of this notice. (9) The Council's impact analysis will be available on April 1, 1994. This meeting is accessible to people with physical disabilities.
