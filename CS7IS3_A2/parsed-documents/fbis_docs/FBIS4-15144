About 3O men of the interior ministry special forces took up station on a warship after arriving here on Tuesday, ITAR-TASS news agency said. It said top generals from army intelligence, the air force, counter-espionage and the national guard had also come. The return of Meshkov from a visit to Cyprus had been delayed for eight hours because Turkey had closed its airspace, the agency said, quoting a member of the crew on Meshkov's plane. The Crimean chief's press attache Igor Azarov told AFP that a link between the delay of the flight home and the appearance of the Ukrainian special forces "cannot be ruled out." Meshkov held a referendum last month at the same time as Ukraine's general election and won overwhelming backing for closer ties with Russia. Russians comprise 67 percent of the population in Crimea, which the then Soviet leadership transferred to Ukraine in 1954.
