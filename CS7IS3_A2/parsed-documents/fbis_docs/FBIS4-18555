Yesterday, in the National Assembly or, briefly, on the FR3 television news, he tried to step up his little declarations of intention, showing that he was in the race but without committing himself any further. "I accept the presidential risk," he said on camera. "We (the French people) feel a need for unity and cohesion." The majority needs to unite on clear and coherent ideas to steer France out of the economic impasse and avert a damaging leadership struggle. "Have I not always said that we could only succeed together? Otherwise...." Otherwise chaos will ensue. Once again, yesterday, the prime minister reaffirmed in less and less veiled terms, that it is his policy which will be judged by the French people next year. And he is hinting more and more that if this policy succeeds, the majority will remain in power, whereas, if it fails, it will have to return to the opposition. In this hypothesis, who would be in a better position than him to defend "the government's policy" before the voters in the presidential election? With regard to the CIP [Job Training Contracts] issue, Mr. Balladur, who has been given a rough ride by his political friends in the National Assembly, explained on television in the evening that the role of a prime minister was not to impose any reform, but to ensure that it was understood and adopted by the people. "There has been a misunderstanding between some young people and the government," he said. On that basis, the crucial thing was to find areas of agreement among the French people rather than cultivating "pointless divisions." The CIP was withdrawn to avoid aggravating this social tension, although the prime minister remains convinced that it could enable large numbers of young people to find their first job. Other more flexible provisions will be adopted to achieve the same goal: the reduction in unemployment. Convincing "My approach, which is primarily to listen, is the right one," Mr. Balladur said. "Violence is unacceptable," he added, and the demonstrations, in his view, were merely a pretext for some people. They are the sign "that we have problems of moral, social, and national cohesion to be tackled." But France's economy is doing better and these problems should be settled in turn. But this does not mean calling into question the five-year law on employment, as some deputies are demanding. To make progress, Mr. Balladur said, it is necessary to consult, explain, and convince. The prime minister is warning the majority but without wishing to enter into personal disputes. "I am in the habit of never judging the statements of others." But, he added, my task has been "the most difficult since the war. Today, things are going better. A great deal remains to be done, and we will not achieve anything if we spend our time fighting among ourselves."
