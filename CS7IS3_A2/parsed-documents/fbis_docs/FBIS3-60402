According to the report published by the municipal sanitation and antiepidemic department on 25 November, ever since the advent of AIDS in Beijing in 1985, 55 persons have been found infected with the virus -- 32 are foreigners, 11 are from other provinces and municipalities, and 12 are residents of Beijing. Beijing ranks third in the country in the number of persons infected with the AIDS virus. The first reported case of AIDS in our country was in Beijing; the first veneral disease patient infected with the AIDS virus was found in Beijing; and the first overseas laborer infected with the AIDS virus was also discovered in Beijing. In addition, venereal disease which had basically been eliminated in Beijing in the middle of the 1960's has revived. It is reported that about 800 new persons have suffered from venereal disease each year. Moreover, we have already found cases in which children and infants are born infected with the venereal disease. On the one hand, analysis of the reason why Beijing ranks third in the country in the number of persons infected by AIDS virus is an indication of the seriousness of the threat imposed by AIDS in Beijing. On the other hand, it also shows that the attention of municipal government, economic input, and advanced technology have made Beijing's AIDS discovering rate higher than average. According to the analysis of the sanitation and antiepidemic specialists, Beijing is a low AIDS-infected epidemic area. To prevent and control the spread of AIDS and venereal disease in an even more effective manner, Beijing took the lead in the country to set up the Beijing Association for the Prevention and Cure of Venereal Disease and AIDS on 25 November. Thus far, more than 70 units of 17 trades, including medical prevention and curing, tourism, press, and civil administration, have joined this AIDS prevention organization.
