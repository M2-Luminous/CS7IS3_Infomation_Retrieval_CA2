FBIS4-27272 "dreas105_a_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-105 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Ministry, Lawyers To Study Arbitration Access Ministry, Lawyers To Study Arbitration Access OW0106064594 Tokyo KYODO in English 0636 GMT 1 Jun 94 OW0106064594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The Justice Ministry and Japan's largest lawyers' group launched a panel Wednesday [1 June] to study U.S. and European calls to allow foreign lawyers to represent foreign firms in Japan as an arbitrator in reaching out-of-court settlements of business disputes. The panel, the study group on international arbitration representation, called its first meeting attended by representatives from the ministry and the Japan Federation of Bar Associations (JFBA), JFBA officials said. The panel is commissioned to come up with recommendations for legislative changes needed to authorize foreign lawyers to represent firms in Japan involved in business disputes and also citizens involved in international disputes on business contracts and products, they said. The Code of Civil Procedures of Japan recognizes the legal validity of out-of-court settlements of business disputes just as the validity of court rulings are upheld. However, the code's article 801 says when certain firms are represented by an agent whose qualifications do not derive from Japanese law, related parties are empowered to demand the cancellation of an out-of-court settlement. The United States and the European Union have been urging Japan to alleviate such curbs so that foreign lawyers can legally represent firms doing business with partners in Japan in seeking dispute settlements. The ministry and the JFBA compiled and submitted to the Diet an amendment bill that would lift some restrictions on foreign lawyers who wish to practice law in Japan. The panel aims to produce specific legislative recommendations in response to an earlier ministry-JFBA joint report that called for "moving toward amending the system to expedite further liberalization" on the issue of international arbitration, ministry officials said.
