Latvian volunteers blocked several buildings belonging to the Russian army and kept two Russian generals in handcuffs for several hours and showed a disgusting approach to the Russian Ambassador in Latvia. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has ordered that the Russian military transport planes, paratroopers and pilots in the republic be put to combat alert owing to the events in the Latvian capital. Kostikov has told reporters in Moscow Tuesday that should similar incidents repeat, the reaction of the president and Russia would be tougher, I would say very tough taking into account the world precedents.
