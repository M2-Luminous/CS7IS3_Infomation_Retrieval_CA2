Simplified Jurisdictional Analysis The portion of the jurisdictional determination under which governments comment on tribal jurisdiction will be substantially altered under this rule. These changes are outlined below. For approvals of all Drinking Water regulatory programs and most Clean Water programs under existing regulations, EPA will not authorize a state to operate a program without determining that the state has adequate authority to carry out those actions required to run the program. See e.g. 40 CFR 142.10 (PWS), 145.24 (UIC). This applies also to a tribe seeking program approval, and ensures that a close analysis of the legal basis of a tribe's jurisdiction will occur before program authorization. Accordingly, a separate ``TAS'' jurisdictional review is not needed to verify that a tribe meets the statutory jurisdictional requirement, and is therefore proposed to be eliminated for all programs under the Safe Drinking Water Act, and for the Clean Water Act's 404 and NPDES programs. This change would have the effect only of eliminating duplicative requirements. In no case can a tribe receive program approval until the Agency has received full and adequate input concerning the scope and extent of the tribe's jurisdiction. Moreover, EPA would expect each tribe seeking program approval to provide a precise description of the physical extent and boundaries of the area for which it seeks regulatory authority. This description should ordinarily include a map and should identify the sources or systems to be regulated by the tribe. However, for the Water Quality Standards program, there is no review of tribal civil regulatory authority as part of the standards approval process under section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act. Accordingly, for that program, a comment process would be retained. However, the Agency wishes to clarify the operation of that process by reiterating that comments must be offered in a timely manner, and, further, by specifying that where no timely comments are offered, the Agency will conclude that there is no objection to the tribal applicant's jurisdictional assertion. Moreover, to raise a competing or conflicting claim a comment must clearly explain the substance, basis, and extent of its objections. Finally, when questions are raised concerning a tribe's jurisdiction, EPA may, in its discretion, seek additional information from the tribe or the commenting party, and may consult as it sees fit with other federal agencies prior to making a determination as to tribal jurisdictional authority, but is not required to do so. Henceforth, EPA would/will no longer be required, by regulation, to consult with the Department of the Interior. Finally, the Agency notes that certain disputes concerning tribal jurisdiction may be relevant to a tribe's authority to conduct activities and obtain program approval under several environmental statutes. For example, if a tribe and a state or another tribe disagree as to the boundary of a particular tribe's reservation, each time the tribe seeks to assert authority over the disputed area, the dispute will recur. The Agency recognizes that its determinations regarding tribal jurisdiction apply only to activities within the scope of EPA programs. However, it also believes that, once it makes a jurisdictional determination in response to a tribal application regarding any EPA program, it will ordinarily make the same determination for other programs unless a subsequent application raises different legal issues. Thus, for example, once the Agency has arrived at a position concerning a boundary dispute, it will not alter that position in the absence of significant new factual or legal information. By contrast, however, a determination that a tribe has inherent jurisdiction to regulate activities in one medium might not conclusively establish its jurisdiction over activities in another medium. See generally Discussion of inherent tribal authority in Water Quality Standards Regulation, 56 FR 64877&hyph;64879. Under the new approval process, as under the old, the Agency will continue to retain authority to limit its approval of a tribal application to those land areas where the tribe has demonstrated jurisdiction. This would allow EPA to approve the portion of a tribal application covering certain areas, while withholding approval of the portion of an application addressing those land areas where tribal authority has not been satisfactorily established. See, e.g. , 53 FR 37395, 37402 (September 26, 1988) (SDWA); 54 FR 14353, 14355 (April 11, 1989) (Clean Water Act Grants); 54 FR 39097, 39102 (September 12, 1989) (Clean Water Act Water Quality Standards); 58 FR 8171, 8176 (February 11, 1993) (Clean Water Act section 404); 58 FR 67966, 67972 (Clean Water Act NPDES) (December 22, 1993). 2. Capability EPA must continue to make a separate determination of tribal capability for each program for which it approves a tribe. However, the Safe Drinking Water Act, Water Quality Standards, section 404, and NPDES regulations would be amended to conform to the CWA grant regulations, which do not specifically prescribe the material a tribe must submit to establish capability. Ordinarily, the inquiry EPA will make into the capability of any applicant, tribal or state, for a grant or program approval would be sufficient to enable the Agency to determine whether a tribe meets the statutory capability requirement. See, e.g. , 40 CFR part 31 (grant regulations applicable to states and tribes); 40 CFR 142.3 (Public Water System primary enforcement responsibility requirements at parts 141, 142 apply to tribes); 145.1(h) (Underground Injection Control requirements of parts 124, 144, 145, and 146 that apply to states generally apply to tribes). Nevertheless, EPA may request that the tribe provide a narrative statement or other documents showing that the tribe is capable of administering the program for which it is seeking approval. In evaluating tribal capability, EPA will consider: (1) The tribe's previous management experience; (2) existing environmental or public health programs administered by the tribe; (3) the mechanisms in place for carrying out the executive, legislative and judicial functions of the tribal government; (4) the relationship between regulated entities and the administrative agency of the tribal government which will be the regulator; and (5) the technical and administrative capabilities of the staff to administer and manage the program. EPA recognizes that certain tribes may not have substantial experience administering environmental programs; a lack of such experience will not preclude a tribe from demonstrating capability, so long as it shows that it has the necessary management and technical and related skills or submits a plan describing how it will acquire those skills. IV. Summary of Revised Process Under the new process, tribes will continue to seek program approvals under the authority of statutes authorizing EPA to treat eligible tribes in a manner similar to that in which it treats states. For instance, tribes seeking approval of an NPDES or Wetlands permits program will comply with the applicable provisions of 40 CFR parts 123 or 233. However, tribes will now generally be required to submit only a single application to demonstrate eligibility for the program approval, without the need for a separate application for ``TAS.'' EPA will verify that the tribe meets all statutory prerequisites for eligibility in the process of reviewing the single tribal application.
