FR940825-1-00009 FR940825-1-00002 24. ``Link'' is a connecting passageway between at ATCT and a base building. Links are usually one story in height with direct access to the exterior. 25. ``Listed'' refers to equipment or material included in a list published by an organization acceptable to the ``authority having jurisdiction'' and concerned with product evaluation, that maintains periodic inspection of listed equipment or material and whose listing states either that the equipment or material meets appropriate standards or has been tested and found suitable for use in a specified manner. 26. ``Means of Egress'' is a continuous and unobstructed way of exit travel from any point in a building or structure to a public way and consists of three separate and distinct parts: the way of exit access, the exit, and the way of exit discharge. A means of egress comprises the vertical and horizontal ways of travel and shall include intervening room spaces, doorways, hallways, corridors, passageways, balconies, ramps, stairs, enclosures, lobbies, horizontal exit, courts, and yards. 27. ``Noncombustible Construction'' is construction in which the materials have been tested in accordance with ASTM E136 and conform to the criteria contained in Section 7 of that test method (e.g., gypsum wallboard). 28. ``NRTL'' is a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory. 29. ``Opening Protectives'' are the parts of an opening in a fire barrier that ensure the integrity of the protected barrier. Opening protective fire protection ratings for different fire barrier ratings are established in NFPA 101_Life Safety Code. 30. ``Protected Construction'' is construction in which the structural members are protected from fire so that they can withstand exposure to fire for specified periods of time. 31. ``Public way'' is any street, alley, or other parcel of land open to the outside air leading to a public street, which has been deeded, dedicated, or otherwise permanently appropriated to the public for public use and which as a clear width and height of not less than 10 feet. 32. ``Shaft'' is an enclosed space extending through one or more stories of a building, connecting vertical openings in successive floors, or floors and the roof. 33. ``Smokeproof enclosure'' is an enclosed interior stairway designed to limit the infiltration of heat, smoke, and fire gases from a fire in any part of the building by either natural or mechanical means. 34. ``Story'' is that portion of a building included between the upper surface of a floor and the upper surface of the floor or roof next above. 35. ``Structural elements'' are the beams, columns, and other or similar supporting members of an ATCT. 36. ``Type of Construction Classifications'' are classifications which designate the fire resistance rating requirements of protection provided for certain types of construction, as follows: First number represents: Exterior bearing walls. Second number represents: Structural frame or columns and girders, supporting loads for more than one floor. Third number represents: Floor construction. 37. ``Type I Construction'' is that type in which the structural members, including walls, columns, beams, floors, and roofs, are of approved noncombustible or limited-combustible materials and have fire resistance ratings not less than 443 or 332 (see NFPA 220, Table 3). 38. ``Type II Construction'' is that type not qualifying as Type I construction in which the structural members, including walls, columns, beams, floors, and roofs, are of approved noncombustible or limited-combustible materials and have fire resistance ratings not less than 222, 111, or 000 (see NFPA 220, Table 3). 39. ``Type III Construction'' is that type in which exterior walls and structural members that are portions of exterior walls are of approved noncombustible or limited-combustible materials, and interior structural members, including walls, columns, beams, floors, and roofs, are wholly or partly of wood of smaller dimensions than required for Type IV construction or of approved noncombustible, limited-combustible, or other approved combustible materials. In addition, structural members have fire resistance ratings not less than 221 or 200 (see NFPA 220, Table 3). 40. ``Type IV Construction'' is that type in which exterior and interior walls and structural members that are portions of such walls are of approved noncombustible or limited-combustible materials. Other interior structural members, including columns, beams, arches, floors, and roofs, are of solid or laminated wood without concealed spaces and comply with the provisions of NFPA 220 section 3&hyph;4.2 through 3&hyph;4.6. In addition, structural members have fire resistance ratings not less than 2HH (see NFPA 220, Table 3 and section 3&hyph;4 for additional information on Type IV construction). Interior columns, arches, beams, girders, and trusses of approved materials other than wood are permitted by NFPA 220 section 3&hyph;4.1 provided they are protected to provide a fire resistance rating of not less than 1 hour. Certain concealed spaces are permitted by NFPA 220 section 3&hyph;4.4. 41. ``Vertical opening'' is an opening through a floor or roof. c. General Provisions 1. Existing ATCTs occupied at the time of adoption of this standard may remain in use provided: (a) The occupancy classification remains the same. (b) No serious life safety hazard exists that would constitute an imminent threat. 2. Federally-owned or operated ATCTs shall be provided with protection of occupants and means of egress which meets the requirements of this chapter or shall have a plan established for bringing the structure into compliance with this chapter. 3. Compliance with this standard shall not be construed as eliminating or reducing the necessity for other provisions for safety of persons using a structure under normal occupancy conditions. d. Protection of Employees During Construction and Repair Operations 1. No new ATCT under construction shall be occupied in whole or in part until all means of egress and fire protection features for that area of the structures are completed and ready for use. 2. No existing ATCT shall be occupied during repairs or alterations unless all existing means of egress and any existing fire protection features are continuously maintained, or in lieu thereof, other measures are taken which provide equivalent safety (e.g., contractor-provided fire watches). 3. No flammable or explosive substances or equipment used for repairs or alterations shall be introduced or stored in an ATCT while the ATCT is in operation, unless safeguards are provided to prevent any additional danger (e.g., contractor-provided fire watches, use of only those amounts of flammable substances in the ATCT necessary for the immediate task at hand). e. Protection for Persons With Disabilities 1. Persons who are unable to use the stairway for emergency egress and who are permitted access to the ATCT shall be restricted to the level of exit discharge only. 2. Provisions must be made for employees who are temporarily unable to use the ATCT stairway. 3. Such provisions may include: (a) requiring duties to be performed at the level of exit discharge only; or, (b) ensuring that pre-planned procedures have been established to facilitate the egress of persons with disabilities during emergencies. f. Structural and Architectural Design Requirements 1. General. The structural elements of new ATCT facilities shall be noncombustible.
