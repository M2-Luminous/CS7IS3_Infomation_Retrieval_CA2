On the eve of his departure from Port Louis, Qian Qichan discussed the situation in Africa and China's African policy in an interview with XINHUA reporters. Qian Qichen said: During the current African tour, he has been deeply impressed by the African people's new sense of awakening sparked by drastic changes in the international situation. Many African countries, while seeking economic development, have focused their attention on safeguarding national stability and at the same time, strengthened regional cooperation. Noting the establishment of security mechanisms by OAU and the breakthrough achieved in peace in South Africa, he pointed out that the struggle against foreign intervention and for national independence and sovereignty is making headway. In short, Africa is facing challenges as well as historic opportunities and is not without hopes, he added. He said: Under the new situation brought about by the end of the Cold War, regions are interrelated in their endeavor for peace and various countries have become more and more interdependent on each other in economy. World peace is inseparable from Africa's stability; and an underdeveloped African economy is not conducive to the global economic prosperity. For this reason, the international community should show concern for Africa, and the developed nations are duty-bound to help the African countries. Africa needs attention, not indifference; it needs help, not intervention. Discussing China's African policy, Qian Qichen emphasized: To strengthen unity and cooperation with the African and other developing countries is the basis of China's foreign policy. China shares much common ground with the African countries as far as the international and regional situations are concerned. China wholly respects the social system and development mode chosen by the African countries in light of their national conditions, and firmly supports the African countries' struggle to safeguard national independence and sovereignty. We support the African countries' efforts to ensure internal unity, to develop economy, and to improve the people's livelihood; and we also support the series of rational proposals by African countries for reducing and exempting debts, protecting economic interests, and strengthening South-South cooperation and South-North dialogue. On China's economic and trade relations with African, Qian Qichen said: China's economic cooperation with the African countries symbolizes the spirit of mutual benefit and assistance and common development. He added that although China's assistance to African countries is limited, it is sincere and without any political strings attached. He pointed out: Amidst constant changes in the international and African scenes, the friendship between China and Africa has withstood tests of history and become more solid. China will never forget Africa's profound sentiments of friendship in times of needs. He reiterated that regardless of changes in the international and African situations, China will never alter its principle of developing unity and cooperation with the African countries. We deeply believe that our friendship with Africa will definitely continue to grow and strengthen in the days and years to come; and the lasting, stable, and mutually beneficially friendship and cooperation between China and Africa will further solidify and develop.
