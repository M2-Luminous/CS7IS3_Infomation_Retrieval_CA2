D'Alema this morning made a spontaneous appearance, accompanied by his attorney Guido Calvi, before Public Prosecutor Vittorio Mele, to give his version of the accusations made by former Socialist Partly leader and ex-Premier Bettino Craxi on alleged under-the-table contributions to the ex-Italian Communist Party (PCI), now the PDS. Craxi recently presented a dossier to the justice department formally presenting his claims, already voiced on the floor of parliament, which must now be investigated to ascertain whether they are true or whether he should be indicted for slander. The others Craxi claims were aware of the illicit contributions included PDS secretary Achille Occhetto and PDS administrative secretary Marcello Stefanini. According to Craxi, the PCI and PDS received kickbacks for the so-called "Red Cooperatives" after they were awarded public contracts.
