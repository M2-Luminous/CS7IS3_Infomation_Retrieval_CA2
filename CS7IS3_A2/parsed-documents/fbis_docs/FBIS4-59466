This was reported by Palestinian sources yesterday. "This would be a first meeting between the PLO and Israel on this level," one of the Palestinian sources said. According to the source, the Israelis taking part in the meeting are: Eli Dayan, chairman of the Labor Knesset faction; Labor Knesset Members Yosi Katz and Avigdor Qahalani; Shim'on Shamir, formerly Israel's ambassador in Egypt; and Peace Now representative Orit Rosen. The Palestinians are represented by Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat; Hasan 'Abd-al-Rahman, PLO representative in Washington; Furayh Abu-Middayn, who was recently appointed member of the Palestinian administrative council; Ibrahim Kar'in, head of the Palestinian information office in Jerusalem; and Rahhab al-'Isawi, a Hebron University professor. The interim self government in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region will operate for a limited period, and negotiations on the final status of the territories are to begin no later than three years after the implementation of the autonomy agreement begins. The two-day "private" meeting in Vienna, however, is taking place with the full knowledge of the Israeli and the PLO leaders, the source told a REUTER correspondent. The meeting is sponsored by the Austrian Kreisky Fund. It will deal with issues such as refugees, settlements, borders, and the confederation. According to the sources, these issue were left as a basis for negotiations on the final status of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0405 GMT on 13 May carries a live telephone interview with Knesset Member Eli Dayan in Vienna. Asked to confirm the above report, Dayan says: "It is true that we are holding a meeting, but not on the issue you have mentioned. It is important to hold meetings with Palestinian representatives and see how they deal with the interim agreement." [Dayan later denies that he and the other Israelis are following instructions from the prime minister and the foreign minister to discuss the permanent arrangement. Stressing that the meeting is private, he adds: "The interim agreement says that its duration can be cut shorter since, by nature, an interim agreement is temporary. We want it to succeed and want to hear what can be done to promote the permanent arrangement, which is more stable." Dayan goes on to say that he will report to the prime minister upon his return to Israel.]
