Prime Minister Bagratyan Predicts Our Fate"] [Text] As has already been reported, participating in the discussions in the office of the Ramkavar-Azatakan of Armenia Party were not only representatives of sociopolitical organizations, members of parliament, and specialists, but also Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Grant Bagratyan. As for the political forces represented in the discussion, all of them were, to put it mildly, extremely skeptical both of the reforms and of their authors and supporters. This is apparently why the discussion amounted to only conceptual criticism. Thus in the view of the Agrarian-Democratic Party, the economic transformations are lacking an ideological concept, they do not have a social base, and the do not go beyond solving purely technical problems (Mels Mkrtchyan). And the Constitutional Law Union thinks that the theory of Jeffrey Sachs, a professor at Harvard University in the United States, is being deliberately transplanted to Armenian soil. But our shock therapy is also being carried out with local peculiarities: Instead of obedience to the law on property, we have a proliferation of clans usurping spheres of the economy. Instead of the idea of forming a national bourgeoisie proclaimed by the government, we have primitive polarization of society. In the view of the representative of the Ramkavar-Azatakan of Armenia Party, Gagik Galstyan, it is wrong to speak of the establishment of a market economy in Armenia because a transition to private property does not mean the establishment of the market. Different principles are required: In particular, competition and the corresponding pricing system, which we do not have, but still there has been a dispersion of resources, leakage of capital and cadres... Leonid Akonyan, representative of the Communist Party of Armenia, thought that for some reason the organizers and implementers of the reform equate destatization with privatization, while reforming the economy of the former GDR in Germany lasted for 10 years, and hundreds of billions of marks were allotted for these purposes. Such speedy and random privatization, in L. Akonyan's view, is merely a repetition of [word illegible] experience of voucher reforms, and that is all. While advising acceleration of privatization as a whole, quite a few critical remarks were directed against the government by a member of the Union of Merchants, Manuk Gasparyan. I think there will be an opportunity to return to his speech in one of the next few issues of GOLOS ARMENII, but now I shall discuss the speech of Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Grant Bagratyan--helmsman of the Armenian version of the reforms and a passionate champion of them. Grant Bagratyan, while recognizing that dozens of mistakes have been made during the process of reforming the economy, still sees the overall trend as positive. The prime minister did not deny the possibility of mistakes in the future because this is not a repeated process but one-time actions, and actions that affect the interests of the socium, which break down its customary way of life. The government perceives this as a natural pattern. Whether slowly or quickly, privatization will take place--the government sees as its main task making sure that this process is controllable. For a random and uncontrolled outcome caused by too much haste specifically in industry will lead to the appearance of a mass deprivatization war. With such a turn of events not only Armenia but any other state would fail to hold up on the financial or social, or moral, or political plane. Incidentally, this could be avoided if the labor collectives were certain that the changes that were made corresponded completely to the spirit and letter of the law. Well, what about the law itself? In Bagratyan's view, the legal vacuum is broad. To this day we have not defined what property is and what property is considered to be. To this day we have no law on citizenship, on deposits, on bankruptcy, we have not determined the status of public and private joint-stock companies, we have not decided the fate of productions operating at a loss.... With the reality being like this, property will be distributed and rights will be granted without determining responsibilities. As the prime minister stated, privatization is not an end in itself but the creation of a field for effective activity. And the elimination of state property is the only means. As corroboration for what he said he gave this example: When the government was analyzing budget incomes and expenditures it became clear that each year 1,700,000 tonnes of garbage are taken from the capital alone. And only 10 percent of the cost is paid from local funds and the rest comes from the budget. But this quantity of garbage does not physically exist. The prime minister was referring to the fact that the parliament absolutely does not take into account these government services-- maneuvering and balancing with state property under conditions of free prices. So during the discussion of the budget, with whose professional level Grant Bagratyan was extremely dissatisfied, they did not even raise the question of how, for example, the construction of a building is financed or how the cost of the shipment of that same garbage is determined... As the prime minister said, when creating a state it is necessary on the move to turn over the layers of a whole epoch. A pedantic, bureaucratized government could reject the process of privatization altogether, claiming, if nothing else, that it does not know to whom it should distribute the certificates. Incidentally, there are many "buts" of this kind. Even with successful privatization of 80 percent of the enterprises, the distribution of the limited centralized resources will be extremely problematic because of the lack of a mechanism for this. Take just electric energy and water... On the one hand it is necessary to proceed from the effectiveness of the output. But we must not cast privatized enterprises to the caprice of fate. Just because, say, Armelektromash is privatized this does not mean that its problems are automatically solved, and at least the supply of metal must be regulated at the state level, that is, through the efforts of the government. With all this, measures are also being taken to render assistance to privatized enterprises. Thus a club of entrepreneurs is being created and it will have the opportunity to meet regularly with the government in order to solve problems jointly. Grant Bagratyan included purely organizational problems in another group of measures. Within two or three weeks the republic will receive all kinds of vouchers. At the same time the tax and customs services are being technically re-equipped, which, in particular, will help to avoid negative occurrences in the customs system. It will also be necessary to revise the structure for administration of the economy. In general and on the whole the prime minister considers it realistic to begin the privatization of small facilities in May and enterprises in June, and also to complete some of the unpaid privatization by the beginning of September. The prime minister did not deny that there have been and will continue to be omissions here because it is not at all easy to draw up a list of 15,000 facilities... But he assures us that the plan that has been chosen, the alternatives, and also the laws that have been adopted will create better conditions in Armenia than are found in Russia. In April of last year the "Armenian" version was discussed in the Hague with the participation of the World Bank, and it gained approval. This has to do with privatization of enterprises under the conditions of the notorious 20 percent. This has to do also with the fact that the "Armenian" version to a certain degree precludes the sad Russian experience when, for example, the president of a joint-stock company, deciding to earn $2 million, sends the company's funds abroad. The unpreparedness of the corps of directors causes the prime minister to have misgivings. Nor do we have the corresponding socium, which would bring pressure to bear on the leaders of the joint-stock companies, forcing them to function effectively. In the prime minister's view, no ideology, even the very best, can provide for development of minds--this takes time. And he is afraid that this time will also provide more occasion for criticism, and it cannot be ruled out that there will be political blackmail of the government as well. But Grant Bagratyan, following Chubays' example, intends to say nothing since he is confident that he is carrying out a mission of historic significance and he must not stray from the path, for under conditions of free prices the state sector of the economy can be controlled only by political methods which, as he stated, will be manifested in one way or another. And difficulties are inevitable when establishing a market: Some enterprises will stay afloat and others will not. Even today it is possible to tell which productions and organizations will "stay afloat" and which will not, because from many signs it is already obvious who has behaved how under the conditions of free prices and the transition to the market. The Institute of Physics provides an extremely clear example. Having found a practical application for its accelerator, the institute received an order for $2 million. Other institutes have shown that they have been marking time all these years and merely reproducing outdated developments. Of course they are doomed. There is the fear that everything will be attributed to privatization. Moreover, against this background it is possible that there will be a large wave of antiprivatization, for everything that today is concealed from people's eyes by the so-called state status will come to the surface. Then it will be possible to see who is good and who is bad, who is able to work and who is not, who is stealing, who is trading, and who is speculating. There is also the danger of the appearance of the so-called "Vietnam syndrome." After the end of a military confrontation several tens of thousands of people may make claims against the society: We were in the trenches and you were dividing up the property. We must keep an eye out for a solution to this problem as well. And not only on the ideological but also on the material plane. In any case the property owner must be prepared for a year or two or more to compensate, to pay for the costs of those who are in the mountains today, who have been wounded, who have become disabled... The problem of the diaspora is not the least of the prime minister's concerns. It should not have its property rights encroached upon, and division into "akhtsarov" and natives must not be allowed. But the diaspora will have to make its way through moral and psychological discrimination and overcome a multitude of other obstacles. In other words society is faced with a harsh but necessary transformation through which it must pass. And the more quickly--the less painfully. This is why with the distribution of vouchers the government will insist parliament allow them to be bought and sold, for from now on it will be simply dangerous to adopt half-way decisions. Incidentally, with the establishment of the market, in the view of the prime minister, political passions will abate. And civil accord will be established because the new economic force will require stability, laws, and concrete actions. Privatization will also have a favorable effect on the formation of the financial market and the stabilization of the exchange rate of the dram because a new, convertible commodity will be put into circulation: the property of productions--be it territory, machine tools, equipment... Being in the best initial positions for privatization and having the best production potential, the republic, in Bagratyan's view, will soon establish itself in the region as completely successful. But under the condition that the natural course of economic transformations will not be hampered by powerful artificial factors in the form of escalation of the confrontation with Azerbaijan, etc. ...Oh, those buts! Were it not for all of them, and not only in the form of external factors, the future would look bright ahead, would it not? Alas, against the background of the current reality it is possible at least to say: Oh, it is hard to believe!...
