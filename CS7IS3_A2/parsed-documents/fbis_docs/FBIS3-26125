Yesterday morning, Jiang Qinglin expressed important views on the current work. He said: Ningde Prefecture has scaled new heights in economic development this year and made breakthrough progress in all aspects of work. This is the result of the efforts of the prefecture's people under the leadership of the prefectural party committee. On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, he expressed his thanks, regards, and Lunar New Year greetings to the cadres and masses in the entire prefecture. Jia Qinglin stressed the need to do more in this year's reform, development, and stability. On development, he pointed out: First, efforts for agricultural and rural work should not be relaxed and rural work should be focused on increasing the peasants' income. It is necessary to develop a high-yield, high-quality, and highly efficient agriculture, to optimize the agricultural structure, and to develop township and town enterprises. Second, there is a need to resolve the problems of funding and employment, to raise funds through various channels, and to encourage the private and individual economic sectors to develop further. Third, we should pay attention to economic results. The manifestation of better economic results is an increase in revenue. Fourth, we should bring the energy industry and transportation into prominence, firmly carry out the policy of five wheels rolling forward together in developing the energy industry, and wage a large-scale people's war in communications construction. Fifth, we should abide by the principle of seeking truth from facts and arrange economic development in light of our specific conditions. On reform, Jia Qinglin requested all levels of party committees and governments to carefully organize the implementation of all reform measures, to subordinate local interests to overall interests, to create a relaxed environment for reform, and to promote development by means of reform, so as to gain the people's understanding and support. On stability, Jia Qinglin pointed out the need to strengthen the unity of cadres and departments, to form great unity and a great alliance, to remove factors causing instability and disunity, to maintain the stability of the cadre contingent, and to preserve social stability. Subsequently Jia Qinglin stressed the need to carry out two types of work simultaneously and lay equal stress on them, and to resolutely carry out party building, ideological and political work, and anticorruption work. In conclusion, Jia Qinglin demanded that a good job be done for Spring Festival activities. Help should be offered to the masses so that they can resolve their actual problems. Localities should do something practical for Armed Forces units. In the meantime, leading cadres at all levels should subject themselves to an anticorruption test during the Spring Festival.
