Violent disputes have broken out in the worst-hit counties of Ybin, Neijiang and Zigong as peasants defend their functioning wells against raids from neighbouring villages according to Chen Zihua, the head of Sichuan's disaster relief office. "We immediately sent cadres to deal with the situations," he told Eastern Express. The first People's Liberation Army A-326 emergency aircraft flew into Chengdu military region airspace yesterday to begin operations, Chen said. More than 8 million people were short of drinking water as a result of the freak drought, which began in early May. Convoys of fire trucks and liquid cargo carriers began transporting large volumes of drinking water to people in affected areas on Tuesday, he said. Water pumps and well drilling equipment have been sent to areas inaccessible by vehicle or too far from available water supplies, under an operation mounted by the provincial agricultural producer goods bureau. There were no reports of deaths and the situation had been ameliorated by the measures taken, Chen said, adding that there were no plans to move people away from affected areas, a measure that Beijing municipal authorities were forced to take in late March after the city had its worst drought in a century. Sichuan authorities fear that trying to move part of the affected population, which stands at 18.4 million people in 22 counties and cities, could be impracticable and cause further unrest. Chen said the province's main cities of Chengdu and Chongqing were not short of water. Residents of Chengdu said last night that heavy rain had fallen in the afternoon, and further showers were expected today. The Sichuan vice-governor Zhang Zhongxin, has called for more help from Beijing, which has so far agreed to provide only 1.5 million renminbi (HK$1.3m [Hong Kong dollars]) in relief funds. The provincial and local governments agreed to pool together Rmb120m [renminbi] for their effort in two emergency meetings held on Saturday and Tuesday, Chen said. "The State Council only became very concerned about our situation after we reported to them on the seriousness of the conditions," he said. Drought is rare in the affected parts of Sichuan, but rainfall in the Sichuan basin during May was 80 per cent below the average of recent years. Chen said the figure was 20 per cent below the province's last "great drought" in 1969. Scorching temperatures and above-average hours of sunlight have also been blamed. While the province's massive grain harvest has already been gathered and sold, summer crops such as corn and rice were expected to suffer. "The provincial economy will definitely be affected," Chen said. [passage omitted]
