The case of the loan illegally granted by the Indonesian Development Bank (Bapindo) to Eddy Tansil, alias Tan Tju Hong, the head of the Golden Key Group, cannot be considered trivial, because it is closely tied to the credibility of national banking in the eyes of the international banking community. It is really a matter of "life or death" for national banking. What is even more disturbing is the allegation that the illegal lending, which has been going on for the past two or three years, stems from a "magic letter" from an important figure in the bureaucracy to the monetary authorities, who are also the agents for Bapindo stockholders. That is why the 1.3-trillion-rupiah illegal loan "smells of collusion". Meanwhile, the Bank of Indonesia (BI) itself, as the central bank which has the authority to oversee executor bank activities, was unable to do very much in this case. This is because the mechanism of checks and balances between the Bank of Indonesia and the Department of Finance was not running very well. But now, in this era of openness which keeps on rolling along, it seems that the monetary authorities, both the governor of the Bank of Indonesia and the minister of finance, have agreed to a thorough disclosure of non-performing loans, especially those with BUMN (State-Owned Corporate Bodies) banks. Because they are determined to carry out a thorough investigation of all non-performing loans, the monetary authorities must not fail to investigate down to its very roots the case of the loan which Bapindo illegally granted to the businessman Eddy Tansil. Whoever is behind that illegal loan must also be uncovered to public view. As a state bank, and therefore a bank belonging to the people of this country, Bapindo is obliged to disclose the problem of the 1.3-trillion-rupiah illegal loan which has now become a national problem. The people must know what is happening in the BUMN banks because in fact the funds in those state banks belong to the people. Therefore, the minister of finance and the governor of the Bank of Indonesia in the previous cabinet must give us a clear explanation of how so much credit could have been granted to this businessman whose bona fides are not so good, so that the case of the illegal loan can truly be opened up. At a hearing which Commission VII of the DPR [Parliament] specifically held with Bapindo in Jakarta on Thursday (10 February), the illegal loan could not be disclosed thoroughly. The procedure for granting the loan and the process for settling it became even murkier because it was covered up by an "explanatory veil," i.e., bank secrecy. It seems that some bankers use Banking Law Number 7 of 1992, which includes regulations about bank secrecy, as a "shield" to cover up large-scale non-performing loans. Up to now, in fact, very few large-scale non-performing loans have been thoroughly disclosed, especially if there is even a hint that these problem loans are tied to the names of certain important figures in the bureaucracy. Nobody can deny that the world of national banking is "sick" right now. The period of consolidation, part of the effort to repear the weak conditions resulting from the application of a tight-money policy, isn't even over yet, and now national banks are hit again by the disaster of trillions of rupiahs in illegal loans. To heal the national banking world again and to restore the confidence of international banking the only option for the nation's economic regulators, monetary authorities and law-enforcement agencies is to carry out a thorough investigation of the 1.3-trillion-rupiah illegal loan. Everyone thought to be involved must be scrutinized. It is important to uncover the part or the process of granting such a large-scale loan which violates the regulations or is considered illegal. The government must take a firm stand in dealing with the 1.3-trillion-rupiah illegal loan which Bapindo granted to the businessman Eddy Tansil. If it is proved that there was an important figure in the bureaucracy involved in collusion, action must be taken against him as quickly as possible, for no other reason than to restore the image of national banking in the eyes of the people of this country and of the international banking community.
