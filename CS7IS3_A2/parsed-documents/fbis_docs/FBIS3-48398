A well-informed source in North Korea's situation in China said: North Korea's large-scale operation organization, which is directed by the South Korean affairs operation team, is briskly conducting operations mainly in three districts -- Northeastern area, including Yinji City; Beijing; and Shanghai-- where ROK citizens have visited frequently. North Korea's operation agents are attracting ROK citizens by making pro-North Korean compatriots responsible for a small operation base.
