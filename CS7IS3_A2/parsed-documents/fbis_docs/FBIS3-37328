General Leonid Ivashov asked nodding at the tape recorder on the table in front of him. "Hm, hm," was the positive response. General Ivashov reached out for his packet of Monte Carlo filter cigarettes, lit one, and began to talk about his skepticism toward NATO's plan for cooperation with Russia's former allies in central and Eastern Europe. "NATO's Partnership for Peace means firstly a creeping expansion of the alliance. Second, it means that NATO's armed forces will suddenly be standing at Russia's western border," the uniformed general said, exhaling smoke into the room. There was a knock at the door. "Come in," the general growled, interrupting himself. A servant-like young man wearing a white shirt and a tie entered. He was carrying a tray with five cups of freshly made coffee and these were placed in front of those present in General Ivashov's office: two Russian generals, two Russian colonels, and one Danish journalist who would like to hear something of what people here at the Staff for the Coordination of Military Cooperation in the CIS think about security developments in Europe and why Moscow has contacted Denmark with a view to military and political cooperation. The serving of the coffee was very discreet and stylish and light years removed from what people are used to at the majority of Russian restaurants in the city. Each person present had been given a note pad; on the table there was a crystal container filled with newly sharpened green pencils, mineral water, Coca Cola, and a plate of cookies and chocolate waffles. They had really spared no effort. General Ivashov is worried that the world will again be split into military blocs in competition with each other. According to the general, NATO's military cooperation with the former Eastern European countries and the Baltic republics is directed against Russia. Joint exercises and maneuvers are not something you hold for their own sake. "I ask myself the whole time who these military efforts are directed against. Is this really necessary? It seems extremely doubtful." My question about why Russia itself does not simply sign up for NATO's Partnership for Peace gave rise first to a short silence. General Ivashov glanced at his colleague, General Viktor Koslov, and then answered hesitantly with an apologetic smile. "Russia could of course participate, but the question is whether Russia wants to. NATO's cooperation model assumes that there a first-class allies -- that is, the old members of the alliance -- and second-class allies -- those countries which must undergo a process of admission which I would not perhaps call humiliating... but which would at least mean that Russia's legal status in the alliance would for a while be lower than that of Denmark and Luxembourg," said General Ivashov, whose words were being recorded by a uniformed colonel. Here in the beautiful turquoise-colored building at Leningrad Boulevard 41 in the northern part of Moscow which was built on the initiative of Vasiliy Stalin, the dictator's son, immediately after World War II, the Warsaw Pact had its headquarters from 1955 up to its dissolution under Gorbachev. The CIS countries' defense staff moved into the aristocratic building in the spring of 1992. The thermometer on the wall outside the main entrance showed minus 17 degrees on this Tuesday morning. The armed guard stood to attention and saluted as I drove into the staff's courtyard as an official guest. The snow crunched dryly under the tires. The Russian generals think that NATO, instead of admitting Moscow's former allies by the back door, should begin strategic cooperation with the nine former Soviet republics which have joined in a collective security agreement in the CIS. It is Ivashov's view that the CIS and NATO should then jointly guarantee the security of the countries which stretch between the two blocs as a neutral belt. "For example, I believe that the Baltic countries and Poland would feel just as safe with such an arrangement," said Ivashov, who fears that an expansion of NATO to the east will lead to the formation of new military blocs. The four officers' uniforms are in contrast with the political aspect of the defense cooperation in the former Soviet Union. General Ivashov and his colleagues pushed the military aspects into the background the whole time and stressed the political aspects of cooperation. All decisions are made in line with the UN Charter and in consensus as in NATO. It is partly in this context that the recent request from Moscow to Denmark with a call for cooperation on conflict prevention and peacekeeping operations must be seen. The CIS countries are tired of being ignored by NATO and are hoping that cooperation with Denmark within the framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation council will provide a better opportunity to make their voices heard in the international arena. It is refreshing to see that there are no pictures of any bigwigs -- either old or new -- on the walls of General Ivashov's office. The only decoration -- if you can call it decoration -- is the flags of the 12 CIS countries which stand in a row on the general's desk. "The agreement on collective security in the former Soviet Union gives greater priority to political and international legal mechanisms than to the purely military aspect. Our experience shows that military intervention does not give rapid results, but rather leads a conflict into a blind alley," Ivashov said, taking a drink of coffee. The general rejected the suggestion that Moscow is driven by imperialist ambitions in the former Soviet Union. Ivashov pointed out that in the past Moscow made all the decisions alone, and that it was then up to the republics to follow orders. "It is not like that any more. The Soviet Union was a unified state. The CIS is a community of independent states. The collective security system presupposes civilized rules for interaction. Russia has no territorial claims on any country; we are all living up to our international commitments in the United Nations and the CSCE." The Soviet Union fell apart at the end of 1991. To begin with a majority of the former Soviet republics tried to retain the Soviet army as a united army. However, these attempts failed. For a while the dream of a joint supreme command under the CIS lived on. People are now trying instead to cut their coat according to their cloth and for this reason the CIS command has had its name changed to the Staff for the Coordination of Military Cooperation in the CIS. "We have now postponed the efforts to build a joint army because of economic difficulties and the political situation. Instead we are concentrating on coordination, so that individual national armies are built up according to the same principles," the general continued. A post of secretary general has been created after the NATO model and for the first six months it is being filled by a Russian diplomat, Gennadiy Shabannikov, and not by a general, as would have been natural in the old days of the Soviet Union. "We have thoroughly studied the lessons that NATO has learned and we are embracing the positive elements. However, unlike NATO we have no combat-ready troops under our command. We only have a coordinating role, we do not control armed forces, and unlike NATO we are not talking about expanding our area of responsibility," said General Ivashov, who did not shy away from commenting on new Russian comet and extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's geopolitical ambitions. With a twinkle in their eyes Ivashov and his colleagues said that at times you could be tempted to think that the West itself has invented Zhirinovskiy to frighten its citizens with the danger of fascism in Russia and to use Zhirinovskiy as a legitimate argument for expanding the NATO's area of responsibility for security policy eastward. "Zhirinovskiy's success in the elections is not linked to his geopolitical plans. He simply promised every single social group something concrete. And people believed this in the light of the difficult economic situation. He will have problems at the next elections when he will have to explain to the population why their lives have not gotten better as he promised," said General Ivashov, who asked his amanuensis to accompany me as I left through the empty marble halls. Out in the quiet park the February cold bites into your face. The fir trees are covered with snow. In the middle of the park a bird sits on the 3-foot snow drifts -- motionless despite the intense cold. What sort of bird is it that has landed here in the CIS staff's park? It looks like a raven. It is at least neither a hawk nor a dove. Those sorts of birds are no longer suitable for describing what is happening in the field of defense policy in the former Soviet Union.
