Noorani: "Why the POK"--quotation marks as published] [11 Feb p 8] [Part I] [Text] On January 29, the JKLF [Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front] leader, Mr. Amanullah Khan, tartly reminded the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mrs Benazir Bhutto, that Pakistan's persistent rejection of "the third option" of independence for Kashmir is "tantamount to denying them the very right of self-determination," a right which, he asserted, cannot be "limited, conditioned or circumscribed." But Pakistan's espousal of the right to self-determination has ever been self-servingly conditional and circumscribed. It is demanded of the part of Kashmir which, mercifully, escaped its occupation, albeit, not its repeated depredations. The right to self-determination is not recognized for Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, miscalled "Azad" (free) Kashmir. Pakistan has banned the cry of plebiscite or independence in the POK [Pakistan Occupied Kashmir]. The Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, obliges all office-bearers from the President down and all legislators to swear loyalty "to the cause of accession of the State of Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan." Islam is made the State religion (Article 3). The President and the Prime Minister must be Muslim. Plebiscite Plea The fundamental right to freedom of association is restricted to forbid the cry of a free plebiscite. The POK bans political parties which advocate independence, let alone accession to India. Article 7(2) reads thus: "No person or political party in Azad Jammu and Kashmir shall be permitted to propagate against, or take part in activities prejudicial or detrimental to, the ideology of the State's accession to Pakistan." In short, none can ask for a plebiscite as such in the POK. They can ask only for accession to Pakistan. Plebiscite is for the rest of the State. This Constitution was imposed on the POK by the former Prime Minister, Mr. Z.A. Bhutto, after he had, in a speech at the POK capital Muzaffarabad on November 7, 1973, asked the people "not to aspire for an independent status" and offered them three choices--the status quo, a full-fledged province of Pakistan, or "provincial status"--as if the territory was Pakistan's to deal with as it pleased rather than one temporarily in "its occupation pending a solution to the Kashmir dispute. In Pakistan's perception, it is the rest of the State which is "disputed territory," not the part it has grabbed. The POK's Constitution of 1974 was imposed on it. Its preamble recites that the Government of Pakistan "approved" the repeal of the 1970 Constitution "and authorized the President of Azad Jammu and Kashmir to introduce" the Constitution Bill "for consideration and passage." The document rivets the POK to Pakistan's constitutional and political system. The POK's legal status and Pakistan's conduct in respect of it over the years are surely of crucial relevance in the quest for solutions to the Kashmir question. But the POK has ever been a dark and neglected area. Pakistan has adroitly focused attention on the rest of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, which it ardently covets. That fact should not deflect one from the duty to subject the Government of India's actions to scrutiny and criticism, especially the violation of human rights and political freedom. But Pakistan's conduct in the POK should receive the same treatment. It has not, however. Pakistan resents such criticism. It resents intensely the expression Pak-Occupied Kashmir and uses blithely its coinage "Indian-Held Kashmir." If one were to take "the U.N. resolutions" by which it swears as common ground, one would find that while the legality of the accession of the State of Jammu and Kashmir was consistently and explicitly accepted in those resolutions, the expression "Pak-Occupied Kashmir" is derived from those very documents. They have a lineage in the proceedings of the Security Council at an early stage. The United States Representative, Mr. Warren Austin, said on February 4, 1948: "We must face the legal situation. The external sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir is no longer under the control of the Maharaja ... with the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India, this foreign sovereignty went over to India and is exercised by India and that is how India happens to be here as a petitioner." On January 20, 1948, the Security Council set up a three-member Commission. On April 21, 1948, the Council not only expanded its membership to five but laid down the details of a plebiscitory solution. A Plebiscite Administrator was to be nominated by the U.N. Secretary-General. Para 10(b) said: "The Plebiscite Administrator, acting as an officer of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, should have authority to nominate his assistants--and to draft regulations governing the plebiscite. Such nominees should be formally appointed and such draft regulations should be formally promulgated by the State of Jammu and Kashmir." Recognition This is an explicit recognition by the UN of: (a) the legality of Kashmir's accession to India; (b) India's external sovereignty over the State; and (c) the legal authority of the Government of the State. Hence, the formal induction of the Plebiscite Administrator by the State Government, although he was to be nominated by the UN Secretary-General. The UN Commission for India and Pakistan, acting under this mandate, arrived in the subcontinent in July, 1948. At the outset, on August 5, 1948, its members agreed that it should avoid any action which might be interpreted as signifying de facto or de jure recognition of the "Azad Kashmir Government." On August 13, 1948, the UNCIP [UN Commission for India and Pakistan] adopted a resolution embodying its proposals for a settlement. India accepted it. Pakistan did not. On December 11, 1948, the UNCIP offered proposals in amplification of the first to provide for a plebiscite. Both sides accepted it. They were formally embodied in its resolution of January 5, 1949, the parties having declared a ceasefire on New Year's Day. As Ms. Krishna Menon said in the Security Council on February 8, 1957, "the only international engagements that exist are two resolutions of the UNCIP dated August 13, 1948, and January 5, 1949. These are the engagements. If they were of a formal character, they might be treaties..." Legal Status The UNCIP had published in November, 1948, in its first interim report, the minutes of its talks with both sides. They were thus fully aware of the UNCIP's clarifications before they accepted its second resolution. It is the August 13, 1948, resolution which defined the legal status of the authorities in the POK. It provided first for a ceasefire; next, a truce agreement laying down details of troop withdrawals on both sides; and finally determination of the future status of Kashmir "in accordance with the will of the people." The word plebiscite was not used. That was done in the second resolution. While the tribesmen from Pakistan and Pakistan's troops were to be withdrawn completely, India was to withdraw only "the bulk of its forces," retaining some "to assist local authorities in the observance of law and order." That was not the only asymmetry. The existence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir was explicitly recognized and so, indeed, was the State's accession to India and assumption of "external sovereignty." Accordingly, the resolution provided that "the Government of India will undertake to ensure that the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir" will safeguard law and order "and that human and political rights will be respected." For the other part of the State, the resolution said: "Pending a final solution, the territory evacuated by the Pakistani troops will be administered by the local authorities under the surveillance of the Commission." This, the only provision for that area, is in contrast to the clear recognition of the State Government, acting under the Government of India in respect of external relations. No surveillance was provided for this part of the State. [12 Feb p 8] [Part II] [Text] The Foreign Minister of Pakistan, Sir Muhammad Zafrullah Khan, had an important meeting with the UNCIP on September 2, 1948. Its minutes have not been published. But Sardar Mohammed Ibrahim Khan, the founder-President of the "Azad Kashmir" Government, published in his informative book "The Kashmir Saga" some revealing extracts. They show that Sir Zafrullah was clearly told: "By `local authorities' we mean the Azad Kashmir people though we cannot grant recognition to the Azad Kashmir Government." These authorities "will be responsible for the maintenance of law and order and security"--only. More explicitly, "we cannot lose sight of the fact that the State of Jammu and Kashmir still exists as a legal entity. We have to respect its sovereignty." Sir Zafrullah himself had told the Commission earlier that "even his own Government had not granted legal recognition for the Azad `Government' in view of the implications which might ensue." Puppet Not long after, Pakistan recognized this puppet "Government." A new regime was imposed on the POK on June 21, 1952. Rules of Business were prescribed on October 28, Rule 5 said: "The President of Azad Kashmir Government shall hold office during the pleasure of the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference duly recognized as such by the Government of Pakistan in the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs." The Ministry's Joint Secretary could attend meetings of the Council of Ministers and "tender advice on any matter under discussion." What, one must ask, are the legal "implications" of such a set-up in the POK, which has existed for over four decades in flagrant breach of the UNCIP's resolution? On August 17, 1948, Prime Minister Nehru asked the UNCIP about the import of the reference to "the local authorities" in the POK. He was told, the minutes record, that "the phrase pending a final solution was intended to recognize the temporary nature of the administration by local authorities. Sovereignty over the territory was not to be changed." This clearly meant sovereignty of the State Government over the POK. For, it was in answer to Nehru's pointed query whether the UNCIP "envisaged any change in the status of the territory or whether it recognized the jurisdiction of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir over that territory." Equally explicit assurances were given in subsequent talks. This brings us to the nomenclature which raises the hackles of our Pakistani friends--the POK. The UNCIP resolution of August 13, 1948, spoke of "the territory evacuated by the Pakistani troops." Since the evacuation has not yet taken place, is it unfair to call it Pak-Occupied Kashmir? Especially since the UNCIP clarified to Sir Zafrullah on September 3, 1948, that "the term evacuated territory refers to those territories in the State of Jammu and Kashmir which are at present under the effective control of the Pakistan High Command." This is the nub of the matter. The legal sovereignty of the State of Jammu and Kashmir over "those territories" was recognized. So, also, the de facto position that they were "under the effective control" of the Pakistani Army. There is not much to choose between PCK (Pak-Controlled Kashmir) and POK (Pak-Occupied Kashmir). There is, however, a graver aspect, besides. Nehru wrote to the UNCIP on August 20, 1948, that its resolution of August 13, "should not be interpreted, or applied in practice, so as: (a) to bring into question the sovereignty of the Jammu and Kashmir Government over the portion of their territory evacuated by Pakistani troops; (b) to afford any recognition of the so-called `Azad Kashmir Government'; or (c) to enable this territory to be consolidated in any way during the period of truce to the disadvantage of the State." On August 25, the UNCIP assured Nehru that his interpretation "coincides with its own interpretation." These assurances were known to Pakistan when it accepted "the plebiscite resolution" of January 5, 1949. It provided that the Plebiscite Administrator "will be formally appointed to office by the Government of Jammu and Kashmir." He "shall derive from the State of Jammu and Kashmir" the requisite powers and shall report the result of the plebiscite not only to the UNCIP but also "to the Government of Jammu and Kashmir." In this, the UNCIP acted with perfect legal propriety. The legality of the State's accession to India was incontestable. That did not preclude a plebiscite, however. But among the prime causes which have rendered a plebiscite impossible is, surely, Pakistan's annexation of the POK and its policies towards the rest of the State. The war of 1965, for instance. It sought to grab it at its chosen forum, the battlefield, and failed. Aggression It seeks the same result today by a low-cost, covert operation. The POK has served as a launching pad for this aggression. It is firmly riveted to Pakistan's control through the Azad J & K Council, set up by S. 21 of the Act of 1974. It is presided over by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and comprises his five nominees, the President and Prime Minister of the POK and six representatives of the POK Assembly, elected by proportional representation. Political developments faithfully mirror those in Pakistan--Basic Democracy of Ayub Khan, Zia's Martial Law, and the rest. In December, 1993, the blasphemy laws of Pakistan were extended to the POK. The northern areas of the State have been dismembered from the POK and their status as part of the State questioned, inviting a stinging rebuff from the POK's High Court on March 8, 1993. They are ruled directly through a Chief Executive, Lt-Gen. Mohammad Shafiq, appointed by Islamabad, with a 26-member Northern Areas Council. The people have never seen elections or enjoyed political or human rights. The POK is better only in form. In 1990 the Pakistan People's Party came to power. In 1991, after Mrs Bhutto's dismissal, elections were held again which all outside the ruling party in Islamabad called "foul." The POK's Premier, Mr. M.H. Rathore, rejected the results and announced a fresh poll. On July 5, 1991, he was sacked by Islamabad, arrested after a Federal Minister and a Brigadier in the Army had inveigled him out of his residence on the pretext that the Army Chief wished to meet him. He was flown to Islamabad, put in a guest house, and beaten up. Self-Interest Let us go back to the basics. Why did Pakistan's troops enter Kashmir at all "early in May, 1948?" Purely in self-interest. The information was given belatedly to the UNCIP on July 8, 1948--not to the Security Council at all. A memo by Pakistan to the UNCIP on August 19, 1948, set out the reasons candidly. It was a perceived "threat to Pakistan's security" posed by Indian military operations against the tribesmen. "It was this which compelled the Government of Pakistan to move their troops into certain defensive positions." There they remain stay put to this day, occupying areas of the State in breach of the UNCIP's resolutions and of Pakistan's own assurances to it. In contrast to the Government in Srinagar, the regime in Muzaffarabad is one set up by Pakistan in territory it has occupied, not acquired by law. None of this minimizes the need to resolve the vexed problem of Kashmir "in accordance with the will of the people," as the 1948 resolution put it. But the contours of a solution in 1994 will necessarily be different from those that were envisaged in 1948-49 given Pakistan's concept of selective self-determination. Neither plebiscite nor independence can now be contemplated. It is not beyond the wit of man to devise a solution which satisfies the aspirations of the people within the Indian Union, redresses the grave wrongs they have suffered, and also provides for the legitimate interests of Pakistan and of the POK. *
