Salim Muhammad, a railway policeman, was in charge of security on the Cairo to Aswan train when he was shot as it left the station in Abu Mawas, in the al-Minya Province in Upper Egypt, 270 kilometres (167 miles) south of Cairo. Security services launched a manhunt, after his attacker fled the scene, the source added. Asyut is a stronghold for militants who have waged a two-year campaign to topple the secular government of President Husni Mubarak, which has left more than 400 dead, including policemen. But until recently al-Minya had not witnessed many clashes between security forces and militants.
