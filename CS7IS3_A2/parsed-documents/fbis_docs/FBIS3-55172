Two weeks ago it was announced that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had to draft the reshuffling scheme by January 6, however, TASS learned from reliable sources that on Wednesday the president returned the draft back to the prime minister for "improvement". Nobody in the entourage of the president and the prime minister agrees to elaborate. However, several officials close to Chernomyrdin hinted that there would be no major restructuring of the government. The number of ministries and department will be reduced inconsiderably, some of them would simply merge. Although head of the government administration Vladimir Kvasov confirmed that the government staff will be reduced by 20 per cent, it is still a secret how the nine deputy prime ministers will be reshuffled. It remains to guess the future composition of the government according to who of its members had already moved to their new offices in the former parliament building. As for today it is known for sure that the prime minister, as well as two of his first deputies -- Oleg Soskovets and Yegor Gaydar -- have already resettled. It is impossible to find out who else has moved to the new premises. The entourage of the prime minister recommends to wait for a corresponding presidential decree which will make it all clear. However, it is rumoured in the government circles that the prime minister would have two first deputies and two deputies. The latter may be Yuriy Yarov and Aleksandr Zaveryukha who are currently responsible for the social and agrarian policies. However, a government member who asked not to be named told TASS that the exact number of deputy prime ministers would depend on whether four of the current deputies would succeed in getting leading positions in the new legislature. The four include Vladimir Shumeyko, Sergey Shakhray, Aleksandr Shokhin and Boris Fedorov. Anatoliy Chubays will most evidently remain head of the property managing committee, but will be stripped of the post of deputy premier, according to the source. It is quite probable that Shumeyko and Shakhray will get leading positions in parliament, but the prospect is dubious for Shokhin and Fedorov. Shokhin, the chief Russian foreign debt negotiator, boasts support of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and if he ends even as the foreign trade minister this would be a sensation proving that there is a tough struggle in the Russian establishment. Fedorov, who is also the finance minister, had stated before parliamentary elections, that he would resign if his arch rival Viktor Gerashchenko, the chief banker, keeps his post. However, Chernomyrdin would hardly agree to sack Gerashchenko. In the final analysis, it is clear that the exact government reshuffling scheme has not been yet determined either by Chernomyrdin or by Yeltsin. It remains to wait until the new parliament opens its first session on January 11 and whether the deputy premiers succeed to get the positions they want there.
