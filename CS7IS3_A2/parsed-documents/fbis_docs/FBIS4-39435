Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry's Press and Information Department, stated this at a briefing today in connection with the appearance in the Russian press of articles on matters connected with exploration for and processing of resources in the Caspian Sea. However, he noted that with regard to resources in the Caspian Sea, there are extremely serious limitations on unilateral action because of the vulnerability of its ecosystems and the fact that issues concerning the extension of the national jurisdiction of the states on the Caspian coast have not been sorted out. "The danger that such action might damage the rights or interests of other Caspian states is too great. Foreign partners who reach agreement on activities of one kind or another in the Caspian should take this into account," G.Karasin stressed. The Russian diplomat added that efforts were already being made now to draw up a mechanism for regional cooperation in the Caspian. All issues relating to the use of the Caspian and its resources would be resolved under mutually acceptable conditions, within its framework. "We hope that such a mechanism will be set up in the near future. Until agreement on this is reached, unilateral actions by any Caspian state will not lead to a change in the laws operating in the Caspian and will not be recognized by Russia," G.Karasin said.
