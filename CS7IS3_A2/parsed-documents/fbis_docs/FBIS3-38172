Sources said no new appointments had yet taken place to fill the seats of deputy MIT undersecretaries Emre Taner and Ertugrul Guven. Guven was reassigned to a major European country whereas Taner will be serving in the Mediterranean region. Their new positions cannot be identified for security reasons. TDN [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] sources said the reshuffle would continue and two of the organization's most senior department chiefs will soon be reappointed as well. Intelligence sources said there was no change in the position of MIT undersecretary Sonmez Koksal. Koksal was appointed to his position last year after serving his country for years as a veteran diplomat, and there has been speculation since Prime Minister Tansu Ciller took office that he would be removed under pressure from hardliners from the military. Koksal, Turkey's permanent representative at the Council of Europe and former ambassador to Baghdad, was the first civilian to be appointed as undersecretary of the MIT. Last June, there were reports that hardline officials in the organization had arranged to undermine his position on the grounds that he represented moderation. There was speculation that Ciller was prepared to start her reshuffle in MIT by replacing Koksal with an army officer. Many of the MIT's former employees are accustomed to strict military discipline. The organization's headquarters in the Yenimahalle District in Ankara is the second facility in the world where all intelligence operatives live together. The first such example was in the former Soviet Union, where the State Security Service (KGB) literally controlled the entire daily life of its operatives. The compound is surrounded by high walls and guarded closely by civilian and military officials armed with machine guns. One of the problems for Koksal since the day of his appointment has been the past role of the organization which he heads in the buildups to military coups. Despite a law which says the MIT chief is attached to the prime minister and that the organization has no jurisdiction and is authorized only to gather intelligence and/or prevent others from doing the same on Turkey, this has not worked out in the past. Coming from within the ranks of the military, previous MIT chiefs have always known where their priorities lay. Never has any of them informed the civilian management of military preparations to take over the country. The files of all of their personnel have always been kept at the Chief of General Staff's office instead of the civilian administration. It is these files that affected their promotions and future appointments. But sources have said that, with Koksal, everything has started to change. Being a career diplomat, he spoke more freely. He always distanced himself from the mainframe military mentality. And, with his highly sophisticated behavior, he managed to work in full harmony with the civilian management.
