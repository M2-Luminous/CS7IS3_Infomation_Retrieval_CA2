Introduction We seek to expand the use of solar-derived light, heat, water and wind power and other forms of natural energy in order to reduce our reliance on nonrenewable fossil fuel energy in the 21st century. In a society with this orientation toward energy, we believe, as shown in Figure 1, that hydrogen, easily stored, transported, and converted to and from electricity, will play a crucial role as an energy medium, together with electricity produced from natural energy. Hydrogen is also converted to water when burned and can be used without disturbance to natural biosystems, while its convertibility with water provides a virtually limitless supply, as shown in Figure 2. Thus hydrogen is of interest as the ultimate fuel capable of providing long-term, mass quantity supply. A large-scale project aiming at Canadian-European utilization of electricity and hydrogen energy is already underway<sup> 1)</sup> as shown in Figure 3. As depicted in Figure 3, automobile fuel is considered one of the main ways in which hydrogen will be used. As one proposal for such, we prototyped the hydrogen rotary engine-equipped HR-X concept car (Figure 4) and showed it at the 29th Tokyo Motor Show held in Fall, 1991. The HR-X attracted considerable public interest as a vehicle that will contribute to a clean, ecological world and was subsequently shown at other events around the globe, including the June, 1992 global summit on environmental problems in Brazil. The car is increasing awareness and anticipation of hydrogen vehicles. In this paper, we discuss the background and objectives of hydrogen rotary engine (RE below) development, the advantages of using RE as hydrogen engines, the achievement of high output through a system for direct injection of hydrogen into cylinders (``direct injection'' below), and the results of our studies on emission characteristics, etc. Figure 1. Role of Hydrogen Energy Figure 2. Hydrogen Combustion and Regeneration Figure 3. Euro-Quebec Hydro-Hydrogen Project 2. Development Background and Objectives During the oil crises of the 1970s, hydrogen engines attracted the attention of specialists as alternative energy engines, and with the recent criticality of global environmental problems, they have again drawn attention from these quarters as clean engines. Research towards commercialization is continuing both in and out of Japan. According to the basic characteristics shown in Table 1, hydrogen has a high calorific value, and if operated with the same amount of air and theoretical air/fuel ratio as a gasoline engine, the calorific value with a hydrogen engine will be 15% higher than with gasoline, as shown in Figure 5. However, since the minimum ignition energy is a very low one-tenth that of gasoline, engine regions not hot enough to cause a problem in gasoline engines, such as spark plugs and exhaust valves, as well as residual exhaust gas, etc. become igniters and are believed to easily cause premature ignition, backfire, and other abnormal combustion. Since premature ignition, backfire, and other abnormal combustion occurs readily in comparison to typical gasoline engines, research on conventional hydrogen engines has reported declining output performance or structural complexity caused by countermeasures, etc.<sup> 2)3)</sup> Noting that the distinctive structure of our proprietary RE were effective in preventing abnormal hydrogen combustion, we began development of hydrogen RE as clean, high-performance automobile engines designed to support a 21st century society making use of hydrogen energy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Studies of RE Suitability For Hydrogen Combustion 3.1 Goals In general, reducing the temperature of sources of ignition is effective in preventing abnormal combustion in a hydrogen engine. For this, the hydrogen supplied and heat produced must be reduced in order to lower combustion temperatures, even at the cost of output. However, there are also examples in prior research on hydrogen engines of suppression of abnormal combustion without a reduction in hydrogen supply through the introduction of sodium-containing exhaust valves and a system for water injection within cylinders to cool sources of ignition. Evaluation of hydrogen reciprocating engines (``CE'' below) predating hydrogen RE has shown a decline in output to roughly 50% that of gasoline engines used for comparison. In hydrogen CE we evaluated, the causes thereof were shown to be restriction to a lean region with an excess air ratio (&lgr;) of 1.8 or more in order to prevent abnormal combustion, and a reduction of intake air due to the large volume occupied by the hydrogen gas fuel; both of which resulted in a reduction of heat supplied to 54% that of a gasoline engine. Consequently, we consider these 2 factors the main causes of the low hydrogen CE output. In contrast, the working chamber in an RE revolves as shown in Figure 6, and the location where intake, compression, expansion, and exhaust strokes occur differs. We believe that the relatively low temperature of the working chamber during intake and this unique structure free of high temperature exhaust valves and the like are beneficial in preventing backfire. We investigated RE suitability for hydrogen based on the above theory. This section discusses measures taken against abnormal combustion, and the next section discusses measures taken against reduction in air quantity. 3.2 Experimental Apparatus and Method A Mazda RE, model 13B (1,308 cc) and Mazda CE, model FE (1,998 cc) were used in experiments. Figure 7 shows an overview of the RE experimental apparatus used. The air intake pipes and chamber were modified for hydrogen introduction based on mass production specifications. Fuel supply systems studied were a premix system supplying previously mixed air and fuel, and an intake stroke injection system supplying hydrogen only during the intake stroke, reportedly effective in preventing backfire in hydrogen CE. The premix system supplied hydrogen through throttle valve flow, and the intake stroke injection system supplied hydrogen through a dedicated hydrogen port provided in a side housing. Hydrogen was supplied to the engines from a commercial high pressure hydrogen cylinder (15.7 MPA, 7 m<sup> 3</sup> ) after pressure reduction to 0.5 MPa by a decompression device. As shown in Table 2, hydrogen port and air intake port timing initiated hydrogen supply slightly after intake began and terminated supply after air intake ended, 20 degrees of output shaft rotation later. The CE fuel supply system used was a premix system supplying hydrogen through throttle valve flow. High tension cord shielding and narrowing of plug gaps (0.3mm) was carried out to prevent ignition by induced current, problematic in multicylinder engines. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2 Port Timing of Intake Stroke Injection System | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Air Intake Opening (ATDC)|Air Intake Closure (ABDC)| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Air |32째 |80째 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hydrogen |40째 |100째 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3.3 Experiments (1) Effect of Fuel Supply System We studied the effects of differences in fuel supply systems on output limits. Figure 8 shows the results of a comparison of a premix system and an intake stroke injection system. Since output declines with mixtures richer than the theoretical air/fuel ratio (&lgr;=1), evaluation was made up to &lgr;=1. Under full loading and with throttle valves fully open, a premix system RE was successfully operated at up to 5,000 rpm with &lgr;=1. However, output became unstable at 6,500 rpm, with &lgr;=1.4, and the excess air ratio (&lgr;) could not be reduced at higher speeds. In contrast, an intake stroke injection system RE was successfully operated at up to 6,500 rpm near &lgr;=1. We feel this is due to the production of non-uniform fuel regions with the intake stroke injection system, and a resulting weaker air/fuel ratio in mixture air near ignition sources than with premixing. The following studies were made on the intake stroke injection system, superior in output. (2) Effect of Spark Plug Heating Value We investigated the optimum spark plug heating value for hydrogen. Spark plugs were those used with ordinary gasoline specifications; leading side spark plugs (``L plugs'' below) had a heating value of 5 (heating values follow product numbers of NGK Spark Plug Co. (Inc.)) and trailing side spark plugs (``T plugs'' below) had a heating value of 10. As the hydrogen quantity was increased from leanness, which inhibits abnormal combustion, premature ignition began to occur at an excess air ratio (&lgr;) of 1.6. Figure 9 shows indicator waves for the working chamber pressure when premature ignition occurred. Premature ignition first occurred noncontinuously, gradually occurring sooner and continuously, and finally occurring continuously in the migrating working chamber, [beginning] immediately after spark plug exposure during compression. From the course of this occurrence, we surmised that spark plugs become igniters, causing premature ignition which further raises spark plug temperature, increasing the frequency and quickening the occurrence of premature ignition. To verify this theory, we investigated the relationship between premature ignition and heating values by substituting spark plugs with effectively high heating values for the low temperature spark plugs. As shown in Figure 10, the excess air ratio (&lgr;) at which premature ignition began declined after an increase in spark plug heating values from the gasoline-specification heating value of 5. As a result, we learned that normal operation is possible even at &lgr;=1 when heating values are raised to 13. Consequently, it became clear that spark plugs were the ignition source for the premature ignition in Figure 9, and that abnormal combustion can be avoided even at &lgr;=1 through the use of spark plugs with a high heating value. In supplementary experiments, we found that the heating value of L plugs affected the occurrence of premature ignition. Figure 10. Effect of Spark Plug Heating Value on Premature (3) Effect of Gas Escape From Plug Holes Though the use of spark plugs with a heating value of 13 and the adoption of an intake stroke injection system for fuel supply allowed operation at &lgr;=1 over nearly all regions, instability did at times occur during maximum output at 6,500 rpm near &lgr;=1. Accordingly, we investigated its cause using a pressure indicator diagram. Figure 11 shows changes in the indicator diagram when instability occurred. Unlike Figure 9, sudden shifts from normal combustion to premature ignition are apparent. The absence of any signs of spark plug-induced premature ignition, and the passage of apex seals over L plug holes immediately prior to the occurrence of premature ignition led us to believe that mixture air uncombusted during the compression stroke passes through L plug holes, comes in contact with hot, burning gases during the expansion stroke, and is ignited. We felt that the size and volume of L plug holes would affect the occurrence of this phenomenon and therefore investigated the effect of changing L plug hole volume by changing L plug ejection quantities. As shown in Figure 12, we learned that the excess air ratio (&lgr;) during the occurrence of output instability can be reduced by increasing the ejection quantity; that is, by decreasing L plug hole volume. Figure 11. Indicator Waves During Occurrence of Premature Figure 12. Output Limitation Due to Plug Hole Gas Escape 3.4 Combustion Performance (1) Heat Efficiency Figure 13 shows the relationship between net heat efficiency and air/fuel ratio at 1,500 rpm and respective loads of P<inf> e</inf> =0.1 MPa and P<inf> e</inf> =0.29 MPa. For P<inf> e</inf> =0.1 MPa, a peak was reached near &lgr;=3. Where heat efficiency is concerned, the leaner the mixture, the better for pumping loss and specific heat ratio, but isochorism declines and combustion deteriorates, and we believe that the balance of both sets of factors forms the peak. For P<inf> e</inf> =0.29 MPa, throttle valves were fully open at &lgr;=2.5, and a peak net heat efficiency of 28% was reached at such time. Figure 13. Heat Efficiency vs. Air/Fuel Ratio (2) Output Performance Figure 14 compares hydrogen RE and hydrogen CE at 2,500 rpm through the relationship of excess air ratio (&lgr;) and output. As the excess air ratio (&lgr;) falls, output increases. However the air/fuel ratio in the hydrogen CE could not be enriched above &lgr;=1.8 due to backfire. Higher output was obtained with the hydrogen RE, which allowed operation up to &lgr;=1. As a result, while only 50% of gasoline-specification output was obtained with the (premix system) hydrogen CE, 63% and 75% outputs were obtained with the hydrogen RE premix and intake stroke injection systems, respectively. Figure 14. Abnormal Combustion Thresholds (3) Exhaust Gas Performance Figure 15 shows the relationship between NOx and excess air ratio (&lgr;) at 1,500 rpm and respective loads of P<inf> e</inf> =0.1 MPa and P<inf> e</inf> =0.29 MPa. For P<inf> e</inf> =0.1 MPa, NOx are nearly zero above &lgr;=1.5; and for P<inf> e</inf> =0.29 MPa, nearly zero above &lgr;=2.0. Figure 15. NOx Exhaust Characteristics 3.5 Results and Issues in Suitability Testing The following was learned from our studies of RE suitability for hydrogen. (1) RE show high performance in preventing backfire and can be operated at &lgr;=1 over a broad range if spark plugs with a heating value suited to hydrogen are used. (2) While only 50% of gasoline-specification output was obtained with a premix system hydrogen CE, 63% of gasoline-specification output was obtained with a hydrogen RE. Additionally, 75% of gasoline-specification output was successfully obtained with the structurally simpler intake stroke injection system. (3) High heat efficiency and clean exhaust gas is obtained under partial loading if operation is pursued at &lgr;=2-3. From the above results, we found that hydrogen RE require no structural changes or attachment of special devices to prevent abnormal combustion near the theoretical air/fuel ratio capable of drawing maximum output; merely switching to spark plugs with a heating value suited to engine requirements is sufficient. It is thus demonstrated that RE possess a structure which is fundamentally easily adaptable to hydrogen engines, for which preventing abnormal combustion is the most important concern. Nonetheless, the 75% of gasoline-specification output obtained even through operation at the theoretical air/fuel ratio is low. Likewise, since air and hydrogen are simultaneously injected by the intake stroke injection system we studied, air quantity during intake is reduced approximately 30% by hydrogen volume, and volumetric efficiency is low. Accordingly, we report our study of a direct injection system designed to solve this problem by supplying hydrogen directly to cylinders immediately after completion of the intake stroke. 4. Development of Hydrogen RE Direct Injection Systems 4.1 Goal The decline in the volumetric efficiency of air that is the second cause of reduced hydrogen CE output depicted in Figure 5 stems from the low density that is one hydrogen characteristic indicated in Table 1, and this characteristic is likewise a cause of reduced output in hydrogen RE. Specifically, low density gaseous hydrogen occupies a large 28% volume of total gas mixture in the theoretical air/fuel ratio, in contrast to the mere 1.7% occupied by gasoline vapor. And even when the gas mixture naturally input to a premix system, in which hydrogen is mixed in the intake pipes, is considered quantitatively the same as that in a gasoline engine, the amount of air therein is far less, as shown in Figure 16. Counteractive methods for direct injection of hydrogen into the working chamber after completion of air intake have been researched<sup> 4)5)</sup> , and we investigated their effectiveness in hydrogen RE. Since the volumetric ratio of air to hydrogen in the theoretical air/fuel ratio is 72:28, mixed gas volumetric efficiency might be raised to a maximum 138% if direct injection raises the volumetric efficiency of air alone to near 100%, as shown in Figure 16. We also studied the exhaust characteristics of hydrogen fuel, reported to be completely free from conversion to noxious substances. Water is essentially the only combustion product of hydrogen, but a certain amount of lubricating oil carried into the working chamber in an actual hydrogen engine is burned and produces trace amounts of HC, CO, and CO<inf> 2</inf> . Additionally, atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen bond in the high temperatures of the working chamber, forming NOx. Our studies of hydrogen RE included exhaust characteristics of these emissions. Figure 16. Quantitative Differences in Supply By Hydrogen 4.2 Experimental Method and Apparatus In systems for direct injection of hydrogen, both low pressure direct injection (roughly 1 MPa or less) early in the compression stroke and high pressure direct injection (roughly 8-10 MPa) late in the compression stroke have been researched. In low pressure direct injection, the long duration from injection to spark provides superior mixing with air, however high pressure direct injection allows injection immediately before the spark and prevents premature ignition. As clarified in the previous section, the basic structure of the RE easily allows prevention of premature ignition, thus the need for high pressure injection is slight, and we felt that low pressure injection involving a simpler apparatus was appropriate. We therefore prototyped a hydrogen RE with a low pressure direct injection system and studied improvements in output performance. Figure 17 shows the structure and operation of the prototyped hydrogen RE with direct injection system. Atop a side housing where gasoline specifications locate an intake port is an air port for intake of air alone, and above that is an added hydrogen port. A poppet-type hydrogen valve opened and closed by the cam shaft is located in the flow of a hydrogen port opening on the wall of the working chamber for the intake stroke. As shown in Figure 18, hydrogen is injected into the working chamber for the compression stroke for an interval of approximately 90 degrees (main shaft angle) starting immediately after the end of air intake through the air port. In the left drawing of Figure 17, air is being drawn into the working chamber during the intake stroke, and the hydrogen valve is still closed. The right drawing depicts a point during the compression stroke at which the air port has closed, the hydrogen port opens, and hydrogen is being injected from the hydrogen port towards the air in the working chamber. The pressure of the injected hydrogen is 1.0 MPa or less. To discern the effect of the direct injection system, we jointly studied a premix system supplying hydrogen to an intake manifold. Figure 17. Structure and Operation of Direct Injection Figure 18. Timing of Air and Hydrogen Supply 4.3 Volumetric Efficiency Figure 19 shows a comparison of a direct injection system and a premix system through the relationship between excess air ratio (&lgr;) and volumetric efficiency. In the direct injection system, only air is input naturally from the intake port, while in the premix system, an air and hydrogen mixture is input naturally. The volumetric efficiency in both is roughly equivalent. The slightly lower air quantity in the direct injection system is ascribed to the effect of residual hydrogen in the channel from the hydrogen valve to the hydrogen port which is carried in during the intake stroke. When volumetric efficiency for hydrogen-air mixtures are compared, the difference between the direct injection system and the premix system grows with the richness of the mixture, and the direct injection system is approximately 20% greater at the theoretical air/fuel ratio. Thus we see that conversion to direct injection more strongly affects the premature ignition and abnormal combustion-determined operating threshold in hydrogen RE, where this limit extends to richness close to the theoretical air/fuel ratio. Figure 20 shows volumetric efficiency for an air-hydrogen mixture versus engine speed under full loading. Conversion to direct injection increases volumetric efficiency 20-30% at all speeds. The volumetric efficiency of a hydrogen-containing mixture in a direct injection engine thus exceeds 100% at 2,000 rpm and above. Figure 19. Volumetric Efficiency vs. Excess Air Ratio Figure 20. Volumetric Efficiency vs. Engine Revolution 4.4 Heat Efficiency Figure 21 shows changes in net heat efficiency versus excess air ratio (&lgr;) during wide open operation at 2,000 rpm. Compared to the premix system, the net heat efficiency of the direct injection system is seen to deteriorate roughly 2% in the lean region near &lgr;=2, and approximately 1% near &lgr;=1. These results are thought to show deteriorating combustion due to conversion to direct injection. To compare practical heat efficiency, Figure 22 shows changes in net heat efficiency versus net mean effective pressure. The direct injection system is somewhat worse than the premix system under low loading, but conversely better under high loading. The reason is that the direct injection system, with its high volumetric efficiency for air, operates leaner than the premix system under an identical load. We therefore feel that the decline in heat efficiency due to richness becomes a benefit in the large range of high loading. Figure 21. Heat Efficiency vs. Excess Air Ratio Figure 22. Heat Efficiency vs. Mean Effective Pressure 4.5 Output Performance (1) Excess Air Ratio Characteristics Figure 23 shows changes in net mean effective pressure versus excess air ratio (&lgr;) during wide open operation at 2,000 rpm. Net mean effective pressure peaks near &lgr;=1 for the premix system and near &lgr;=0.8 for the direct injection system. The excess air ratio (&lgr;) at which net mean effective pressure peaks is thought to be affected mainly by volumetric efficiency, air utilization, and thermal dissociation. In a premix system, as shown in Figure 19, a decline in net mean effective pressure at &lgr;<1 is thought to result from a reduction in the volumetric efficiency of air. Since there is no decline in the volumetric efficiency of air at &lgr;<1 in a direct injection system, we felt that a rich mixture benefiting thermal dissociation and air utilization would obtain peak values. In results, we obtained a 28% higher output with the direct injection system than the premix system at &lgr;=1, and 35% higher at &lgr;=0.8. In conversion to direct injection under these conditions, there was likewise no occurrence of abnormal combustion such as backfire and premature ignition, problematic in hydrogen combustion in recipro engines. Figure 23. Mean Effective Pressure vs. Excess Air Ratio (2) Revolution Speed Characteristics Figure 24 shows the relationship of net mean effective pressure to engine revolution speed during wide open operation at the theoretical air/fuel ratio. As shown in Figure 20 on the previous page, the volumetric efficiency of the entire mixture in a direct injection system was highest, exceeding 100% at revolution speeds of 2,000 rpm and above and approaching 120% at 6,000 rpm. This indicates that in engines adopting a fuel of a low density gas akin to hydrogen, conversion to direct fuel injection has an output-improving effect akin to that of supercharged systems using turbochargers, etc. That supercharge status is not achieved at 1,000 rpm is laid principally to the fact that air port timing in this engine is designed for high revolutions, and not enough air is taken in at low revolution ranges to achieve supercharging. Thus supercharging may be made possible at all revolution ranges if a variable timing air port is subsequently developed and incorporates timing matched to low revolution ranges. The above-discussed studies showed that volumetric efficiency is increased by conversion to direct injection, and as shown by net mean effective pressure in Figure 24, that wide open output is greatly improved. As a result, the 63% output of a hydrogen RE with a premix system, as compared to gasoline specifications, was improved to 87% by a direct injection system, as shown in Figure 25. Figure 24. Mean Effective Pressure vs. Engine Revolution Figure 25. Comparison of Hydrogen Engine Output Performance 4.6 Exhaust Gas Characteristics We ascertained that HC, CO, and CO<inf> 2</inf> produced by the combustion of lubricating oil carried into combustion chambers is a nearly constant, extremely low level of 1/100 or less that of gasoline engines regardless of the excess air ratio (&lgr;). Since a similar, dramatic reduction in CO<inf> 2</inf> in particular is impossible as long as gasoline or other fossil fuels are used, this is one of the most valuable benefits of hydrogen engines. Conversely, characteristics similar to those with gasoline engines were revealed for NOx, with an exhaust peak exhibited near &lgr;=1 and sharp reductions on the lean and rich sides, as shown in Figure 26. On the lean side, favorable for heat efficiency, NOx decline to a near zero level soon after an excess air ratio (&lgr;) of 1.6 is exceeded. In typical gasoline engines, a practical operating threshold at these regions due to unstable ignition and combustion, torque variation, and rapid increase in HC and CO exhaust makes operation in lean regions of very low NOx problematic. With hydrogen RE, however, there is no risk whatsoever of increased HC and CO exhaust even in operation at very lean regions, and the experiments described below revealed that stable combustion can be maintained. Figure 26. NOx Exhaust Characteristics The relationship between the excess air ratio (&lgr;) and combustion fluctuation rate was determined and the combustion stability of a hydrogen RE evaluated under operating conditions of 1,500 rpm and Pe=0.1 MPa. Combustion fluctuation rates were determined through calculation by equation (1) using pressure data measured within combustion chambers. CFR=&sgr;Pmax/PmaxM (1) CFR: combustion fluctuation rate <sup> &sgr;</sup> max: standard deviation of Pmax (350 cycles) PmaxM: mean of Pmax (350 cycles) As shown in Figure 27, the combustion fluctuation ratio increases slightly as the excess air ratio (&lgr;) grows, there is no sudden deterioration as in a gasoline engine, and commercially viable levels are achieved in a range of excess air ratio 1.6 through 5.0. We believe that such ignition and combustion stability in lean regions results from the fact that hydrogen ignites very easily and burns quickly, as shown in Table 1, Basic Properties of Hydrogen. Consequently, vehicles equipped with hydrogen RE allow lean combustion with an excess air ratio (&lgr;) of 1.6 or more over a broad operational range. Results of the above studies indicate that HC, CO and NOx emissions may all be expected to reach very low levels in the emissions of hydrogen RE-equipped vehicles. Figure 28 shows a comparison of NOx exhaust characteristics in a premix and a direct injection system. Peak NOx values were approximately 30% higher for the premix system, but NOx exhaust was somewhat greater for the direct injection system on the lean side and the rich side, where exhaust quantity was minimal. We believe that this narrowing of differences in NOx exhaust quantity versus excess air ratio (&lgr;) after conversion to direct injection results from increased non-uniformity of the excess air ratio within combustion chambers due to incomplete mixing. Figure 27. Combustion Fluctuation Rate vs. Excess Air Ratio Figure 28. NOx Exhaust Characteristics By Injection System 5. Conclusion Here we summarize the benefits held by RE when hydrogen is adopted as an automobile fuel. (1) RE have a structure suited to hydrogen combustion and allow prevention of abnormal combustion through the mere use of spark plugs with a high heating value for operation at the theoretical air/fuel ratio. (2) Wide open output can be increased 20-30% by conversion to direct hydrogen injection. A direct injection system hydrogen RE can thereby provide approximately 90% of gasoline RE output. (3) HC CO, and CO<inf> 2</inf> quantities in hydrogen RE emissions are all extremely small. NOx are also minute in lean combustion, and automobiles with quite minimal exhaust can be produced through fine control of the air/fuel ratio during operation. The results of our investigations have shown that fine fuel control, methods for mixing hydrogen and air, and other unrealized improvements to gas fuel for hydrogen RE hold adequate performance for automobile engines supporting a hydrogen-using society of the 21st century.
