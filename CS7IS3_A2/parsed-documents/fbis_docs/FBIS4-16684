The sources said that the situation in Bosnia was now critical. "There are only two options -- peace talks and an end to hostilities or a gamble on force and unending hostilities," one Russian diplomat said. Another ministry official told Interfax that "much, if not everything, will depend on the position of the Bosnian and Belgrade Serbs." "Regrettably, it is so far clear only that the Serbs are not fulfilling their commitments or putting words into action," he stressed.
