On fliers, which referred to the activities of Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] Chairman Haider in Carinthia, the common rejection of EU membership by the Greens and the FPOe was criticized. In Goldegg Castle (Salzburg) the Greens decided with 87 percent of the votes that they will definitely vote against membership. EU advocates, such as Environmental Spokeswoman Lanthgaler and Vienna City Councilor Chorherr, remained in the minority. It was clear from the very start that the speeches by Foreign Minister Mock and EU State Secretary Ederer, who were invited as guests, would not be able to change the mood. The government members pointed not only to the advantages of membership but also voiced praise: The Greens have essentially contributed to the development of an awareness for the environment. Mock stressed that neutrality will not be restricted even after the EU's institutional reform, which is planned for 1996. There are two possible scenarios: If the Western European Union [WEU] (the EU's defense alliance) develops into a collective security system along the lines of the United Nations, membership in this alliance will be possible as neutral state. Otherwise, a special referendum on neutrality would be necessary before joining the WEU. This statement aroused the displeasure of the coalition partner Social Democratic Party of Austria. Chancellor Vranitzky told KURIER: "Austria will actively participate in the establishment of a collective security system in Europe. However, there is no coercion to join the WEU. Therefore, the discussion about a special referendum on neutrality is superfluous." The reaction by Greens Federal Spokesman Pilz: "The government has already worked out a two-step plan for abolishing neutrality. The first step is joining the EU."
