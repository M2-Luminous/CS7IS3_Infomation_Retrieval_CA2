We became a quite unique experimental laboratory for a variety of advisers like Jeffrey Sachs. But there was too high a price to pay for some of those experiments--in the form of the collapse of many state enterprises, extensive unemployment, and so on. That is, more or less, the line of reasoning adopted by Grzegorz Kolodko, the new "father" of our economy. Does it signify a departure from the liberalism represented by the Gdansk school--that is, the policy we have attempted to put in practice for the past four years? Grzegorz Kolodko has a long-term concept of our future economic development. As a fertile publicist and author, he often presented and interpreted his vision for the public's benefit. It must be admitted that, despite the passage of years, his program has remained almost unchanged and is still very good. However, we still have many legitimate doubts as to whether he will be able to translate it into practical terms. The foundation of his idea is rapid production growth, which should in turn cause an increase in the national income. In the next four years, production should grow by as much as 26 percent and national income by 23 percent (that is, approximately 5.6 percent annually). We should be able to achieve this through exports, the development of the economic infrastructure (transport and communications), and an inexpensive housing-construction program. At the same time, as we carry out major capital investment projects, we should achieve a reduction of unemployment figures. Exports should be the number-one priority. They are the principal economic growth tool of any state that wants to become an economic tiger. The state must support exports through credit guarantees, export tax and tariff concessions, the development of free trade zones, and so on. The development of the infrastructure is achieved primarily through building superhighways and investing in the growth of telecommunications networks. As regards the first of these goals, Poland would find its chief opportunity by joining in the EEC Growth Initiative Scheme. I will deliberately avoid discussing the question of housing construction here because this sector was supposed to serve as the main "flywheel" of the Polish economy ever since the Gierek era. There is no doubt that a program that places such strong emphasis on capital investment and production is bound to be very expensive. Who is going to pay for it? Any major budget deficit will be made good through the issuance of special State Treasury bonds. It is envisaged that a system of incentives (based on special tax allowances) will be introduced here to encourage the public to buy these bonds. Another method, the simplest, would be to increase taxation rates. However, Grzegorz Kolodko proposes an alternative solution here: to increase the number of taxpayers in the country by, among other things, bringing the economic "gray zone" into the open and subjecting it to the normal fiscal regulations and obligations. Consequently, we can expect to see the introduction of many radical measures in this area. I must admit that this element of Kolodko's program raises the greatest doubts in observers' minds. If it does not succeed, which could happen very easily, we will have to review that section of the whole program quite radically and burden honest taxpayers with the obligation to help with the budget deficit. The expected deepening of the budget deficit will not be the result of more money having been pumped into the so-called budget-funded sectors of the economy (administration, education, health service, and so on), so the latter will not benefit from it at all. Instead of linking their pay increases to the inflation rate and reviewing their pay structure, they will be offered alternative compensatory pay in the form of "zero-interest" State Treasury bonds, which, however, will be index-linked to the movement of production prices. An additional source of budget revenues should come from, among other things, increased excise charges, the introduction of border duty (approximately $10-15 per person for crossing the state border), and the introduction of stock market tax for all investors. This last idea entails a particular risk because the proposed stock market tax would not be charged on individual transactions but on stock market investment gains. Such an unfortunate move would doubtless scare investors away from the stock market and induce them to place their money in, say, the bonds and securities market. I strongly suspect that that is what the new deputy prime minister is after: to get people to make good--at least partly--the budget deficit by buying State Treasury securities. Kolodko's concepts are not presented in the form of an official document. Nothing has yet been decided beyond the possibility of change. They are simply the new prime minister's views on the state economy, but he will doubtless set about putting them into practice. The economic reforms of the past four years have been implemented under the motto of liberalization of the market; the next four years are supposed to be devoted to the goals of production and investment. However, it is quite likely that this program will prove too hard on employees and workers of the budget-funded sectors of the economy. The populists will still have a good chance of acceding to positions of power on the pretext of creating the mythical "third way."
