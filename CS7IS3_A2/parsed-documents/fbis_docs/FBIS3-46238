Output value of products for civilian use turned out by all military industrial enterprises in the province approached 1.5 billion yuan, accounting for 75.2 percent of the total output value of these enterprises, or an increase of 12 percent over that of the previous year. Output value of products for civilian use turned out by aeronautics and astronautics industrial enterprises in the province accounted for 97 percent of their total output value. This enable these enterprises to change deficits into profits. In the transfer process, aeronautics and astronautics industrial enterprises took full advantage of their numerous talents and technologies to develop products for civilian use and readjust their product structure in line with the principles of having a high starting point, high standards, high quality, and high added value, thus initially giving rise to a number of enterprises that combine the production of military products with the production of civilian products. Last year, relatively good progress was made in the project of producing 70,000 mini-buses annually by Harbin Airplane Manufacturing Company as jointly planned by the province and Harbin city. In the first half of this year, various production lines of this company will be put sequentially under test operation and production. Thus far, civilian products turned out by Harbin Airplane Manufacturing Company and (Dongan) Engine Manufacturing Company have accounted for 98 percent and 94 percent of their total respectively. The follow-up projects transferred to produce civilian products have also been linked in a relatively good manner. Sixteen projects, including the heavy-duty vehicles for desert use, engineering machines, and tank trucks, have been put under construction respectively, and some 190 million yuan of funds have been put in place. New headway has also been made in popularizing new technologies for producing civilian products. Twenty-five new civilian products, including the 20-foot container self-loading and self-unloading trailer and high-energy igniting coil, passed appraisal last year to gain some 20 million yuan in value. Last year, military industrial enterprises also positively supported the development of tertiary industry and opened their tertiary industrial enterprises to the public. Last year, all military industrial enterprises in the province built 400 new enterprises oriented to developing tertiary industry, and 6,700 workers were hired. Most of the guest rooms, hospitals, special railway lines, and unused warehouses and plant houses of these enterprises have been oriented to the market and been open to the public on a paid basis. There has been a good situation of equally promoting commerce, service, and communications in the military industrial enterprises, and of vigorously developing the tertiary industry.
