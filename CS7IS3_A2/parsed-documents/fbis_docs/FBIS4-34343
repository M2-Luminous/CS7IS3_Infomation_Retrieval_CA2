The investment had been planned barely two years and four months ago. Hundreds of workers, mostly members of the Celso Maraotolara Brigade, as well as engineers, project managers, and technicians from the Ministry of Basic Industry gave additional proof of our people's intelligence and capacity when they got the plant operating without foreign consultation. Also, this is a one-of-a-kind project in the country. The new plant is capable of delivering up to 500 kg of gold per year for seven or eight years; it is considered the most feasible of all the gold-producing plants in Cuba. The sulphur plant was also reopened. This year, it has a pledge to deliver 32,000 tons of sulphuric acid, which is an essential product for the nickel industry.
