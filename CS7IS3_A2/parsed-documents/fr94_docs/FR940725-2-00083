FR940725-2-00083 FR940725-2-00052 [Docket No. 94&hyph;21] Boitshoko P. Marang, M.D.; Revocation of Registration On December 10, 1993, the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause and Immediate Suspension of Registration to Boitshoko P. Marang, M.D. (Respondent). The Order to Show Cause proposed to revoke DEA Certificate of Registration, BM1482506, and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration. The grounds for the issuance of the Order to Show Cause were that the State of Michigan had revoked Respondent's license to practice medicine and that his continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. Additionally, citing his preliminary finding that Respondent's continued registration posed an imminent danger to the public health and safety, the Acting Administrator ordered the immediate suspension of Respondent's registration pending the outcome of these proceedings. 21 U.S.C. 824(d). On December 10, 1993, the Order to Show Cause and Immediate Suspension of Registration was personally served on Respondent at the Wayne County Jail, 570 Clinton Street, Detroit, Michigan. By letter dated January 9, 1994, Respondent requested a hearing on the issues raised in the Order to Show Cause. The matter was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. On February 15, 1994, the Government filed a motion for summary disposition. A copy of the motion was forwarded to Respondent at the address he provided in his request for a hearing, the Wayne County Jail. The envelope which contained the Government's motion for summary disposition was returned to the Government with the notation ``addressee unknown.'' Government counsel verified that the Respondent remained an inmate in the Wayne County Jail and on March 14, 1994, again forwarded a copy of the Government's motion. On February 16, 1994, the administrative law judge attempted to serve Respondent with an order which allowed Respondent 14 days in which to respond to the Government's motion for summary disposition. The envelope was returned, marked, ``addressee unknown.'' On April 7, 1994, the administrative law judge forwarded a second order to Respondent, by certified mail. Respondent failed to file a response to the order. By order dated April 25, 1994, the administrative law judge found that Respondent waived his opportunity for a hearing, and recommended that a final order be entered under 21 CFR 1301.57. Alternatively, the administrative law judge granted the Government's motion for summary disposition. Neither party filed exceptions to the administrative law judge's order and on May 23, 1994, the record was transmitted to the Deputy Administrator. The Deputy Administrator concludes that Respondent has waived his opportunity for a hearing on the issues raised in the Order to Show Cause and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57, enters this final order based upon the record as it now appears. The Deputy Administrator finds that an administrative complaint had been filed with the Michigan Board of Medicine (``the Board'') against the Respondent. After careful consideration of the documents filed in that cause, the Board concluded that the continued licensure of Respondent constitutes a threat to the public health, safety and welfare requiring emergency action. Therefore, on December 1, 1993, the Board summarily suspended Respondent's license to practice medicine. Consequently, Respondent is not currently authorized to handle controlled substances in the State of Michigan. The DEA does not have the Statutory authority under the Controlled Substances Act to issue or maintain a registration if the applicant or registrant is without state authority to handle controlled substances. See 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f) and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld. See Roy E. Hardman, M.D., 57 FR 49195 (1992) (noting that ``Michigan law provides that a suspension of an individual's medical license shall result in the nullification of the individual's authority to handle controlled substances''); see also, Myong S. Yi, M.D., 54 FR 30618 (1989); DePietro's Pharmacy, 54 FR 22499 (1989); Bobby Watts, M.D., 53 FR 11919 (1988); and cases cited therein. Since there is no dispute about Respondent's lack of authority to handle controlled substances in the State of Michigan, the administrative law judge properly granted the Government's motion for summary disposition. When no question of fact is involved, or when the facts are agreed upon, a plenary, adversarial administrative proceeding with the full panoply of due process rights is not obligatory. See Philip E. Kirk, M.D., 48 FR 32887 (1983), aff'd sub nom Kirk v. Mullen, 749 F.2d 297 (6th Cir. 1984); United States v. Consolidated Mines and Smelting Company, Ltd., 455 F.2d 432, 453 (9th Cir. 1971). Having considered the facts and circumstances in this matter, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Dr. Marang's DEA Certificate of Registration should be revoked due to his lack of authorization to handle controlled substances in the State of Michigan. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100) (b) and 0.104 [59 FR 23637], hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, BM1482506, previously issued to Boitshoko P. Marang, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked. The Deputy Administrator further orders that any pending applications for the renewal of such registration, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective July 25, 1994. Dated: July 15, 1994. Stephen H. Green, Deputy Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17948 Filed 7&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] Billing Code 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
