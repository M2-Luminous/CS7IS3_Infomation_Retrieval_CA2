The government will cut back the number of co-productions with foreign firms, ban the creation of joint ventures as well as independent Chinese productions, the official publication of the Ministry of Culture said. The Chinese press on Monday had still failed to report a breakthrough by a Chinese film in the United States -- the winning of a Golden Globe Award in Los Angeles on Saturday by "Farewell My Concubine," by director Chen Kaige. The film, partly financed by Taiwanese capital, received the Golden Palm award at last year's Cannes festival. But, under China's censorship laws, it was only screened rarely in China and often in a truncated version. "Last year, certain Chinese films were produced with (the participation of) Hong Kong and Taiwanese firms which did not respect the rules," China Culture News reported. "These films do not allow the Chinese cinema to occupy the place it deserves on the national market," it said. "This year, we will reduce cooperation abroad and limit the number of co-produced films to 26. And we shall ban the creation of joint ventures for the production and distribution of films." The move comes after two years of relative independence for Chinese studios, whose management has gained some financial autonomy. The liberalisation has fuelled co-productions with foreign companies and also weakened the government's scrutiny over content. These developments have helped young, ambitious directors to bring their works to the screen but have also drawn the wrath of the authorities, who have reacted by censoring the movie or hampering its distribution or filming. The government has set a production quota this year of 150 films for Chinese studios, of which 60 percent must be works of contemporary fiction. "The conditions for lifting the restraints are not yet right," the ministry of film and radio-television, quoted by the China Culture News, said. "The ministry will give production authorisation to 16 state studios, no others," it said.
