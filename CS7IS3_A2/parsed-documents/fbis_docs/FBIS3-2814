Liu said, "for Hubei, the massive Three Gorges project on the Chang Jiang river, the project to divert water from its Danjiang reservoir to north China, and the opening of Wuhan and Huangshi cities, present good opportunities for an economic takeoff." Liu, who is vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, expressed the view at a group discussion by Hubei deputies to the National People's Congress now in session in Beijing. He expressed the belief that Hubei can certainly achieve faster economic growth so long as its 56 million people work hard and properly handle relations between reform, development and stability. According to Hubei Provincial governor Jia Zhijie, Hubei's gross domestic product topped 100 billion yuan last year. New reform measures taken by the central government since the beginning of this year involve the readjustment of interests, and that makes it imperative to properly handle the interest of the whole and those of the part, Liu said.
