At the end of October, a new scientific and technological cooperation agreement was signed by Russia's science minister Boris Saltykov and Carlo Rubbia, the then director-general of the CERN [European Center for Nuclear Research] European particle physics laboratory. The agreement, CERN officials stress, is essentially an umbrella one, with no specific commitment to any particular research effort. It aims rather at providing a "reasonable" (three-year) transition period for developing relations between CERN and the Russian Federation, with the ultimate goal of the latter becoming a full member of CERN. But the place of the signing was significant - the Institute of High Energy Physics at Protvino, near Moscow. Protvino, a typical example of the "big science" beloved by Soviet planners and propagandists, was originally intended to possess a 3000 GeV [giga electron volt] accelerator. But even before the Soviet Union fell apart two years ago, construction work was at a standstill and plans had been scaled down to a 600 GeV device. Now CERN is discussing a possible cooperation programme, working in an energy range now available on accelerators elsewhere. The lower-energy device will provide a useful test-beam for gas targets. Indeed, the Protvino scientists are already planning such a joint project with the United States, but it is a far cry from the grandiose visions of Protvino's original plans. The problem with Russia's "big" physics is not simply one of money. Western rescue funds are available, and a CERN-Protvino project is, as PHYSICS WORLD goes to press, currently awaiting approval from the INTAL foundation where, admittedly, it is competing against over 7000 other applications. There is also an ideological factor. "Science" was for decades hailed by communist theorists as the basis of the Soviet system; there has now been a backlash of public opinion against science and science spending. Privatization, rather than science, is widely seen as the avenue to prosperity, and interest in "pseudo-science" is growing. Even if Russia had unlimited funds, the government might well find it difficult to justify a major commitment to science. For a country near bankruptcy, it is well nigh impossible. Yet scientists at thousands of research institutes have to be paid. And such is the confusion in the entire science sector that even Saltykov is in no position to make an unequivocal decision about the future of so costly an institution as Protvino. Saltykov, however, does not control all Russian science. The Serpukhov nuclear facility, for example, still belongs to the ministry of nuclear energy. There is a long-standing division of competence between the science minister and the Academy of Sciences, and one of the most important research facilities the Dubna Joint Institute of Nuclear Research, is, strictly speaking, an international rather than a Russian facility. Dubna belonged to Comecon (the socialist-bloc equivalent of the EC), which no longer exists. One of its former members, Hungary, quit Dubna when it joined CERN in 1990. The other remain members formally but can contribute little financially. (Paradoxically the late German Democratic Republic still continues to provide finance: the new united Germany, although formally only an "observer", has made a financial commitment.) Under these circumstances, Russia is left to pay - or leave unpaid - the bills. In November, deputy premier Yegor Gaidar instructed finance minister Boris Bedorov to find additional funding for Dubna - although from where was not made clear. International cooperation in science is now seen by the Russians as a vital, and perhaps the only, lifeline. It is not a one-way process. CERN would like to transfer to Protvino a number of experiments which cannot conveniently be continued at its own facilities. And cooperation need not be only bilateral. In spite of Russia's claim to be the legal heir of the Soviet Union, other newly independent states have inherited part of the ex-Soviet scientific workforce -- in many cases, with nowhere for them to work because the laboratories are in Russia. Now the academies of sciences of the successor republics are discussing joint research, and an institutional framework for cooperation is being negotiated. Everything depends on Western funding. But there seems no reason why a Western commitment to bail out the scientific workforce of, say, Belarus or Armenia, should not include supporting scientists from those countries at Protvino or Dubna.
