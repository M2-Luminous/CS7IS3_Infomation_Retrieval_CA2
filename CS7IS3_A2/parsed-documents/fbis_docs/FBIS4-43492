The eighth chamber of the court says in its ruling that there were grave procedural mistakes in the 4 June election by the federal convention. This decision sustained the claim by Munich law professor Bernd Schuenemann, the previous chairman. Under the threat of an administrative fine of up to 500,000 German marks, Bashford and party founder Markus Wegner were forbidden to claim that Schuenemann was voted down by the federal convention. The claim that Bashford is the new federal chairman must not be made or spread either. At the meeting in Hamburg, Bashford had won a majority. The court's ruling states that some of the land organizations had not been invited. Although the Hamburg Land Court had ruled prior to the convention that the North Rhine-Westphalian land organization must be invited, the North Rhine-Westphalian delegates had not had the right to vote, speak, or submit a motion. This is a clear violation of the delegates' rights, the ruling says.
