FR940810-0-00061 FR940810-0-00021 Some Class IV work was covered by the earlier standards, yet the coverage was incomplete. The general industry standard regulated housekeeping activities, and housekeeping activities were also included in the construction standard to be covered if they were part of a construction job. Precautionary maintenance guidelines to avoid disturbing ACM were addressed in Appendix G of the construction standard. OSHA believes that the switch from the regulated ``housekeeping'' activities to the Class IV definition is clearer and reduces loopholes. The custodial activities covered in either event can clearly create asbestos dust and expose custodial employees to that dust. Data in the record show that custodial activities can produce not insignificant asbestos exposure levels. Therefore, the work practices required to reduce that dust are clearly necessary to reduce significant risk to custodial workers. By establishing a Class IV, OSHA is rejecting various recommendations that some activities, potentially involving asbestos disturbance, would result in de minimis risk, and as such should not be regulated (See further discussion concerning Methods of Compliance). The new definition of Class IV work, the removal of the non-mandatory appendix, and coverage of these activities both under general industry standard and the construction standard and shipyard employment standards clarify the standards' application to such work. OSHA requested comments on setting a cut-off for asbestos-containing material with minimal asbestos content. There was overwhelming support for a 1% cutoff for ACM which would be consistent with EPA rules. The Hazard Communication Standard labeling and training provisions require labelling of materials which contain more than 0.1% asbestos. EPA defines asbestos containing material as: ``Any material containing more than one percent asbestos.'' (NESHAP and Green Book p. 30). OSHA has no information to indicate what proportion of building materials fall into the category of containing more than 0.1% and less than 1.0% asbestos. EPA has listed building materials by their asbestos content and among those included on the list, only surfacing ACM ranged down to 1% (and up to 95%) (EPA ``Purple Book,'' Ex. 1&hyph;282). Some participants, including NIOSH have expressed concern that even 1% may be below the accuracy level for optical microscopic methods. (Ex. 7&hyph;145, 162&hyph;39). Among those who dealt with the issue, most supported the 1.0% cutoff, most citing its consistency with EPA (Ex. 7&hyph;5, 7&hyph;6, 7&hyph;21, 7&hyph;43, 7&hyph;51, 7&hyph;74, 7&hyph;76, 7&hyph;99, 7&hyph;106, 7&hyph;111, 7&hyph;120, 7&hyph;137, 151, 162&hyph;59, 162&hyph;29). OSHA agrees that a cutoff of 1.0% asbestos is appropriate for asbestos containing building materials and has included this value in its definitions of ACM. Closely Resemble Included in the construction and shipyard employment standards is a definition for the term ``closely resemble,'' which is the term used in the regulatory text to limit the use of historic exposure data to predict exposures. It is defined as circumstances where ``the major workplace conditions which have contributed to the levels of historic asbestos exposure are no more protective than in the current workplace.'' OSHA's intent is to allow data reflecting past exposures to be used to predict current exposures only when the conditions of the earlier job were not more protective, i.e., employees were not better trained, work practices were not used more consistently, and no more supervision was present. Competent Person OSHA has amended the definition of ``competent person'' in the construction standard and included it in the Shipyard Employment Standard as a ``qualified person.'' The definition is based on the definition of ``competent person'' in the general construction standard, 29 CFR 1926.32(f), i.e. ``one who is capable of identifying existing asbestos hazards in the workplace and who has the authority to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them,'' but adds a specific training qualification. The training provisions require a competent person take a course which meets the requirements of EPA's Model Accreditation Plan (40 CFR 763, Subpart E). OSHA believes that specific training is needed so a ``competent person'' will have adequate knowledge to perform the competent person's responsibilities for Class I and II work. A Class II and Class IV ``competent person'' must undergo ``Operations and Maintenance'' (O&M) training as developed by EPA. Further discussion of these issues is found later in this document. The revised definition deletes from the definition a list of duties to be performed by the competent person. Duties are more appropriately set out in other regulatory paragraphs which are prescriptive, rather than in the ``definition'' section. In response to the court's remand, OSHA has also expanded the scope of the competent persons's duties so that a competent person must supervise all asbestos activities under the construction standard. As noted, these requirements are set forth in other regulatory paragraphs which govern conditions of work in covered activities. The shipyard employment standard does not use the term ``competent person,'' because that term has a unique definition under Part 1915. OSHA has accepted SECSAC's recommendation that the term ``qualified person'' should be used to designate a person with the same duties under the shipyard employment standard. Critical Barriers
