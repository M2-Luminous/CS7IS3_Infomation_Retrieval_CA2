Here is RRI [Radio Republik Indonesia] correspondent Suyono reporting from Medan on the Medan protests: [Begin recording] [Suyono] As of this evening, public security and order in Medan is 90 percent under control following protests by factory workers that are believed to have been masterminded by irresponsible people. Major General A. Pranowo, commander of the Bukit Barisan First Military Region Command, told reporters in Medan that 14 suspects believed to have masterminded the protests are still under investigation. About 14 company-level units mobilized by the Northern Sumatera Regional Agency for Maintenance of Stability remain on alert at sensitive places. [Pranowo] The latest developments show that the protests led to destructive acts. A field observation in Tanjung Merawa showed that workers in the majority of factories there were not involved in protests and had no intention of becoming so, but certain outsiders came and tried to force them to join the protests. Because they refused, destructive acts such as destroying offices took place. It is also apparent that the protests led to destructive acts, intimidation, and terror against workers and factories. We are concerned with this development. As a matter of fact, the security forces have coordinated their response to the situation to prevent it from spreading and to eliminate excesses. Certain groups appear to be exploiting the protests for their own interests. This must be overcome immediately. [Suyono] A joint team organized by the Northern Sumatera Regional Agency for Maintenance of Stability said the protests -- which led to intimidation and terror -- bore a resemblance to communist tactics, as noted yesterday by the chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia. The commander said that field observation showed this was partly true. Accordingly, the joint team is continuing investigations to find out who really masterminded the protests. The commander warned everyone in the region not to be provoked by rumors and anonymous phone calls that are aimed at heightening tension in the region. This will ensure public security and order in North Sumatera. This is correspondent Suyono reporting from Medan. [end recording] Meanwhile, the Central Executive Council of the All Indonesian Trade Union [SPSI] has rejected any protests that harm public order, let alone that lead to destructive acts or ethnic, religious, racial, or communal riots. Imam Sudarwo, general chairman of the SPSI Central Executive Council, said SPSI condemns acts that justify the use of any means to achieve an objective, thus inflicting moral and material losses. In a press release today, Imam Sudarwo supported the government's action against those who violated laws and rules. He urged the SPSI rank and file and all sides to conduct a self-examination in the wake of the Medan protests. In this respect, he urged all sides to handle the manpower issue seriously by strictly adhering to the Pancasila labor relations system, which has become a national consensus. The SPSI Central Executive Council also urged all Indonesian workers to maintain unity and cohesion to enable the Indonesian people to enjoy political and economic stability.
