But they don't seem to be scared by the threat that "Seoul will be turned into a sea of flames if war breaks out," attributed to a North Korean delegate at an inter-Korea meeting last week at the truce village of Panmunjom. They believe that if the North dares a preemptive attack against the South it will suffer quick destruction. "Yes, that's right," said a military source who wanted to remain unnamed. "By the time they drop many bombs on Seoul, Pyongyang will be turned into a desert," he said, citing the very aggressive and retaliatory counterattack plan of South Korean and U.S. forces. He was referring to Operation Plan 5027 of the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command (CFC), or "Oplan 5027." Under the plan, also called "USFK 5027" and "CFC 5027," the combined defending forces of the two countries will occupy Pyongyang and Wonsan on the east coast of North Korea within two weeks of a North Korean invasion, neutralizing the Stalinist regime and thus unifying the Korean Peninsula. "In case of a North Korean preemptive attack," said the source, "the combined defending forces will not give up Seoul or restrict themselves to repelling the enemy forces north of Seoul; they will advance to toppling the North Korean regime and thus regain the northern territory." Such an aggressive counterattack plan had remained classified for years. But Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, in a testimony before the National Assembly, Wednesday confirmed the existence of such plans, saying that Seoul will make use of a North Korean invasion to fight national reunification. "We have a strategic concept that in case North Koreans launch a preemptive attack we will use our retaliatory operations into an opportunity of national reunification," Yi said before the parliamentary Defense Committee. Military experts said the operational concept of the CFC has changed from a defensive one, under which South Korean and U.S. forces were supposed to check the advance of invading forces north of Seoul, or along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Under an even earlier operational plan, the defending forces were to retreat to the south of Seoul, waiting for U.S. reinforcements before launching counterattacks. "But under CFC 5027, a preemptive attack by the North would mean the collapse of the Stalinist regime and national unification," explained a military expert. The CFC 5027 assumes a five-phase war scenario. In the first phase, the CFC, confirming signs of a North Korean attack, requests deployment of the U.S. flexible deterrence option (FDO), or quick deployed reinforcements, to the South. Defcon III is invoked and the defending forces are on standby, awaiting further orders. In the second phase, North Korean forces launch artillery attacks on the South Korean forces deployed along the DMZ, infiltrates special warfare troops into Seoul and other cities to harass the rear. Major roads are filled with South Korean refugees, serving as an obstacle for the CFC operations. North Korean ground troops cross the border, and Scud and Nodong missiles hit Seoul and other major cities and military facilities in the South. CFC forces battle invading forces, hitting and devastating key military areas in the North. U.S. carrier battle groups join the attack against the rear of the North and Patriot missiles guard against Scud and Nodong missiles. The North Koreans are checked north of Seoul. In the third phase the main forces of the North Korean troops are destroyed. The defending forces cross the DMZ and march northward, amid amphibious landing operations conducted on North Korean shores. CFC forces further advance to Chongchon River, north of Pyongyang. CFC has yet to decide whether to march further to the Yalu River that divides North Korea and China. In the fourth phase, Pyongyang is occupied and CFC forces control local residents. In the last phase, the Korean Peninsula is reunified under the leadership of South Korea. In this aggressive operational plan, major damage and casualties on both sides are expected. But Defense Minister Yi's willingness to make use of a North Korean invasion as a chance for national unification is widely accepted as a timely manifestation of Seoul's confidence in its defense preparedness. It's also a strong warning to the North not to run the risk. But nevertheless, a problem lies in the possibility that the North Korean regime may knowingly run the risk, not because it thinks it can communize the South by force, but as a means of solving chronic and explosive internal problems, such as the failing economy.
