At a glance, there is no seemingly understandable relationship between "Seoul City government and North Korea's nuclear development" at all. This notwithstanding, there is an understandable story in this relationship, because there is a delicate functional relation in which the Seoul City government might suffer from not a little monetary loss, depending upon where the direction of North Korea's nuclear issue goes. The Yankee Bonds (bonds issued in U.S. dollars by the U.S. stock market), which the Seoul City government was thinking about issuing this month, are linked to North Korea's nuclear issue. The Seoul City government had planned to issue Yankee Bonds worth $300 million (240 billion won) with a view to investing--the funds raised by these bonds--in the equipment to be used for some sections of the second-phase construction of the Seoul Metropolitan Area subway system. The construction will be completed at the end of this year. Yankee Bonds, with interest rates of as low as 6 to 8 percent, provide better loan terms than any other domestic stocks because they are long-term bonds with a maturity of 10 years. But, a problem has arisen. Tension between North Korea and the United States and between South and North Korea has been mounting to the highest point over the last few days. As a result, voices calling for "warning against the North" and "imposing economic sanctions against the North" have been heard. If such a situation is not removed, the Korean peninsula will be viewed by American investors as an unstable area, and a risk will be added, so that interest rates will drastically increase. In fact, the interest rate, which has been regarded as acceptable only if it increases to 7 to 8 percent, is predicted to increase to over 9 percent--far exceeding the expected rate--as a result of the recent worsening situation surrounding North Korea's nuclear development. This is not the only problem. The fact is that American institutional investors might not buy the bonds issued by the Seoul City government at all. If Seoul City's Yankee Bonds are issued and there are no buyers--which would be a very rare occurrence--it will be a disgrace to our country, let alone the Seoul City government. Under these circumstances, the Ministry of Finance has given a guideline "of stressing the need to reconsider the timing of issuance of Yankee Bonds" to the Seoul City government, saying that "the situation surrounding North Korea's nuclear issue is ominous." Because of this, the Seoul City government has for the moment canceled its plan to issue Yankee Bonds during this month. But, officials concerned at the Seoul City government wear tearful faces, saying: "How can we now raise money for the construction of the subway for the latter half of this year?"
