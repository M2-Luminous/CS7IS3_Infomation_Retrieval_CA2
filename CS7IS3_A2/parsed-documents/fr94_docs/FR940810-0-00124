FR940810-0-00124 FR940810-0-00021 In addition, even an up-front inspection rule must be targeted to be productive. Since not all facilities contain asbestos materials, an attempt should be made to designate those facilities and buildings where it unlikely that ACM will be found, otherwise the information yield from inspections will be unconnected to worker protection. OSHA is using a temporal cut-off of 1980 for its presumption rule. As discussed later, this date was supported by the record, since buildings constructed afterwards are much less likely to contain even stockpiled asbestos containing materials. In 1975, under the authority of the Clean Air Act, EPA banned the use of spray-applied ACM as insulation and the use of asbestos-containing pipe lagging and in 1978 extended the ban to all uses of sprayed-on asbestos. In this regard OSHA notes that the purpose of a cut-off is not to state a date after which it is certain that no asbestos-containing material has been installed in buildings. Rather, it is to designate when it becomes unlikely that asbestos-containing materials have been used in construction. OSHA believes that 1980 is a reasonable date for marking that probability. As noted above, employers and building owners are still required to investigate materials installed after 1980 when they suspect they may be asbestos-containing. As discussed above, OSHA additionally refined its presumption by recognizing two broad categories of building materials as ``high-risk'' and thus that the consequences of a false negative identification supported a such materials be treated as asbestos-containing unless reliable information showed the absence of asbestos. These kinds of materials are TSI and sprayed-on, troweled-on, or otherwise applied surfacing materials. Although as noted the version of an inspection rule urged by most proponents would require inspection for all potential asbestos-containing materials, some participants suggested an inspection requirement which would also concentrate on more potentially hazardous materials first. One suggestion was to, first require inspection of steel structures with sprayed on fireproofing constructed before 1975, next of sprayed-on acoustic ceiling installed before 1980 (e.g., Ex. 162&hyph;27). In the Agency's view, phasing in inspection requirements may provide less certainty and protection than its presumption approach. Requiring a ``presumption'' is an immediate source of protection. Any inspection program takes time and significant resources. Additionally, if inspection of categories of potentially high risk material are delayed under a phased-in-approach, protection is denied pending the start-up date. If judicial challenge is made employers may hold back on any inspections hoping for a court to invalidate the requirement. Even more importantly, evidence in the record also indicates that inspection data sometimes are not reliable. In particular, the Westat Report which evaluated a large sample of school inspections under AHERA, found that although on the whole inspections identified most asbestos-containing materials, ``high-risk'' surfacing material was unidentified as asbestos containing in 36% of the inspections studied (Ex. 1&hyph;326 p. 326). Since surfacing material has been found by OSHA, based on this record to be a high hazard material, OSHA is reluctant to rely on inspections alone to identify it. A presumptive approach requires that material which looks like sprayed on or troweled on surfacing material, be handled with care, without waiting for inspections or relying on the results of inspections which may not correctly identify it. The Agency asked for comment on its intention to designate thermal system insulation and sprayed-on or troweled-on surfacing material as ``high-risk material.'' Several of those responding to the notice felt the list was too limited and should include all suspect materials ( Exs. 162&hyph;11, 162&hyph;16, 162&hyph;18, 162&hyph;24, 162&hyph;28, 162&hyph;33, 162&hyph;36, 162&hyph;39, 162&hyph;42, 162&hyph;44, 162&hyph;45, 162&hyph;46, 162&hyph;57). Some, suggested using the list EPA included in its ``Green Book'' entitled Managing Asbestos in Place (Ex. 162&hyph;35, 162&hyph;42, 162&hyph;44).
