The Catastrophic State of Nuclear Power Engineering in Ukraine"] [Text] Energodar-Zaporozhye -- The Ukrainian Supreme Council has lifted the moratorium which it introduced in August 1990 on the construction of new units at the republic's nuclear stations. The ban is lifted, but the chain reaction provoked by it continues. The Chernobyl disaster hit Ukraine twice. The first time was in April 1986; the second in the summer of 1990. Behind the "concern for the people's welfare" which moved some people's deputies to conduct an unprecedented antinuclear campaign could be seen a desire to reap political capital quickly for themselves. Hotheads, only superficially familiar with the problem, assured the people that Ukraine could get by without nuclear electric power stations [AES], and if they were all closed no one would notice. Things never got as far as closures, but a moratorium, the idea of which was supported by the Ukrainian Communist Party and Communist deputies in parliament, was adopted. ...Ukraine's five AES's have fourteen power units with a total capacity of 12.8 million kw. In 1990 they provided a little less than one-third of all electricity generated in the republic. Today nuclear stations bear 40 percent of the load. But at the same time the symptoms of the current power crisis were already more than obvious. Since 1988 the generation of electricity in the republic has constantly declined. There are two reasons for this: First, half of the equipment at thermal electric power stations [TES] is worn out and needs to be replaced. Second, the extraction of energy sources has declined in both Russia and Ukraine, and their price has risen. But whereas TES's have reduced production, AES's have increased theirs year after year. ...Parliament's former decision halted the construction of three megawatt units in the Zaporozhye, Rovno, and Khmelnitskaya AES's. Economists have estimated that, given international electricity prices of 6-7 cents per kilowatt, a year's moratorium on one unit costs the country $500 million. However, this is not all: In shutting the door to nuclear power engineering, the Supreme Council automatically halted the development of high technologies in Ukraine. The first to disperse were the builders. Then came the turn of personnel operating the AES's themselves. Clever people, the majority of them young, at once understood that the moratorium sounded the death knell to their careers in Ukraine. No new units -- no new positions. And pay? In Russia the controller of a unit [operator upravlenii blokom] earns $300 a month, whereas at the Zaporozhye AES it is 10 times less. Many, just to support their families, are forced to dash off to Moscow after their shift and sell goods... When Russia began to launch its own nuclear power engineering program, recruiters went in droves to Energodar and other Ukrainian AES's. They offer the specialists they need not only a decent wage, but also apartments. Highly skilled workers, whose training takes from three to five years, began to pack their suitcases en masse. This year alone around 400 qualified nuclear engineers left for Russia. If things continue like this, Vladimir Bronnikov, director of the Zaporozhye AES stated, there will be simply no one to operate the sixth unit. The moratorium forced plants producing equipment for AES's to seek orders more crudely. The quality control system became unnecessary and collapsed. As a result, many enterprises can no longer deliver equipment meeting the requirements of nuclear power engineering. The shortage of equipment and its low quality and high cost have slowed the rate of the refitting of operational units. It is clear that their safety has not increased as a result. It is now clear that the aims declared by the moratorium's supporters were not achieved. The ecological situation in Ukraine has not improved; rather the reverse. The generation of electricity has fallen. What should be done next? The moratorium has been lifted, but, alas, this will not affect the power crisis in the republic. The sixth unit at the Energodar AES will come on stream not earlier than next March-April. Zaporozhye AES workers, despite the ban, have nevertheless been able to assemble the equipment and keep it in pre-operational mode. At the Rovno and Khmelnitskaya stations construction of units is not complete, and the equipment is not yet all in place. Now it will have to be collected from all over the CIS or production will have to be set up in Ukraine. Specialists believe that, on condition that it is given strong state support, work could be completed there in 1995-1996. But what question can there be of support, when the Ministry of Power and Electrification owes the Zaporozhye station alone more than 30 billion karbovantsy for energy already produced? Ukraine's debt to its neighbors is great. So that the future of these units is unclear, as is the future of power engineering in the republic as a whole.
