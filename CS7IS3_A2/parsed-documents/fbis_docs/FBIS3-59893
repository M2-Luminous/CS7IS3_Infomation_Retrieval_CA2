After giving an analysis of international reaction to the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet's resolution on START-1 and on the Ukraine's commitments under the Lisbon Protocol, he said that "a consensus against Kiev's denuclearization maneuverings" is forming in the world. In his opinion, "Kiev should take account" of the sharp reaction by European countries to the Ukraine's intention of keeping the nuclear weapons that are on its territory.
