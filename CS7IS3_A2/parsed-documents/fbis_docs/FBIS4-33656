Corruption at home sometimes has implications abroad, the official has said. Will the extradition of those who have committed offenses be discussed? a reporter asked. It is still too early to talk about that, but I congratulate you for your imagination, Escovar replied during the departure of the U.S. retinue of top officials comprising Joan Spero, assistant secretary of state for economic affairs, and Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, and Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow. The interior minister also discussed with them certain topics related to the problem of the governability of Venezuela and Latin America, because in Venezuela, in his words, we have a demonstration of what an ungovernable democracy is. "I told them that we did not have an economic crisis in Venezuela but, rather, the floundering of institutions, the floundering of governability, and that is the challenge this government is facing." Increasing cooperation with the United States is indispensable. We face common challenges, Escovar said, regarding the defense of democracy, in addition to something that is very important: the need for major countries' cooperation in fighting corruption. We need international cooperation, because we want to chase certain crimes of corruption out from Venezuelan borders, hence the support we are requesting from the international community. U.S. official Talbott talked to reporters about the positive results of the meeting with the interior minister. [passage omitted]
