This applied in particular to the financial framework, Biehle said, as he presented his annual report for 1993 to journalists in Bonn today. Politics had left the soldiers uncertain about how much money the Bundeswehr would finally have at its disposal. There was also still no constitutional consensus on foreign missions by the Bundeswehr. With regard to the German UN missions in Somalia and Cambodia, the Christian Social Union politician added that "despite all the problems in the starting up period," an "excellent service" had been provided. Given the ever growing spectrum of tasks and the reductions in money, however, the Bundeswehr was being forced into an "involuntary balancing act." This had had "extremely negative" effects on the morale and the confidence of the soldiers. [passage omitted]
