The Pentagon has announced the identification of remains belonging to a U.S. soldier previously list as missing from the Korean war. "This is the first such identification of remains returned to us by the Korean People's Army since the end of the war," said the Pentagon spokeswoman Kathleen Delaski at a regular news briefing. This soldier's remains were returned with a group of 33 remains that the DPRK handed over to U.S. last November 30. The Pentagon has tentatively identified four other sets of remains, but those associations must be studied and affirmed by an Army review board before they are announced as positive identifications. "The U.S. Government welcomes and appreciates the cooperation of the Korean People's Army that resulted in accounting for this American soldier," Delaski said. "We hope that such cooperation will lead to increased results in the future," the spokeswoman added.
