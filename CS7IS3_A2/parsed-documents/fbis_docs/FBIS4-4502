The agricultural working people of South Hwanghae Province, a bread basket of the west coast, are pulling their full weight on sowing of seed rice on cold-beds and ploughing of paddy and non-paddy fields, true to the highly important teachings given by the great leader President Kim Il-song when he met agricultural officials of the province in March last year. The great leader visited co-op farms in Yonan, Paechon and Chongdan Counties of the province in August that year, went out to fields and indicated ways of more successful farming, acquainting himself with the number of ears per pyong [one pyong is six feet square] and the number of grains per ear. Always concerned for the development of agriculture of the country and the happiness of the people, he has made tireless trips of on-the-spot guidance to rural communities since the liberation of the country. He conversed with farmers and discussed farming with them at the edge of a field in a valley in a chilly breeze of early spring, at a patch of a paddy field under a scorching sun in summer and at a humble farmhouse till late at night in winter. In Korea the chuche method of farming was created, a new agricultural guidance system was established and theses on the socialist rural question was published. The great leader put them forward by consummating the will of the peasants while giving on- the-spot guidance to rural villages. He published theses on the socialist rural question in February 1964 and has made uninterrupted trips of on-the-spot guidance for its realization. Not minding a muddy road of the countryside on a rainy day, a road through the marsh of the tideland and a steep mountain, he called on agricultural working people and converted all the land of the country including the Kindung plain of Hwangju, Singyemiudung and the Paekmu plateau which had been forsaken as a barren land and tideland-turned fields on the west coast into fertile soil. He unfolded a bright prospect of rural construction at a cooperative farm on the west coast, drawing a map of the village. At a workteam of a farm at the foot of Mt. Kuwol he indicated ways for the comprehensive mechanization of agriculture. Last year, he guided the work of the countryside, traveling hundreds of kilometres to northernmost Yonsa County, North Hamgyong Province, and Paekmu plateau in Yanggang Province, tideland-turned fields and Kwail (fruit) County on the west coast and the Yonbaek plain adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line. Indeed, our countryside which was a pronoun of backwardness and poverty in the past has been turned into a modern socialist countryside good to work and live in under the wise guidance of the great leader President Kim Il-song.
