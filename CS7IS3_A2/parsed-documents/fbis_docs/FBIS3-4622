They felt that the current robust economy would enable Malaysia to continue to enjoy growth in investments from other countries. They were also confident that the country's economy would remain strong even if Britain decides that Malaysia no longer qualifies for overseas aid schemes like the Pergau dam project. Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said Britain could do as it pleased, saying that the decision will not affect our economy. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced Friday the cabinet's decision not to award new contracts to British companies following British newspapers' allegation that certain Malaysian leaders were corrupt. Energy, Telecommunications, and Post Minister S. Samy Vellu said the British companies stood to lose projects worth 1.5 billion ringgit (about U.S.$555 million) from his ministry. On Saturday, all the state governments expressed their support for the cabinet decision at a meeting of the national financial council chaired by Anwar. At the meeting, all the state governments agreed to implement the decision. British companies are expected to lose billions of ringgit in projects, including the 9-billion-ringgit (about U.S. $3.33 billion) international airport construction project in Sepang, following the cabinet directive.
