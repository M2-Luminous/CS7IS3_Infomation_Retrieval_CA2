He was prepared to take part in a great debate with business aimed at solving the problem of retroactive entitlements. This is the foundation for the national consensus urged by President-elect Rafael Caldera. In exchange, Rios promises the country an end to labor and social strife. Yesterday morning the executive committee room at CTV headquarters was the scene of an emotional event. Angel Zerpa Mirabal, the confederation's acting president, handed over his post to Antonio Rios, the man who served 14 months in jail on an influence peddling conviction. Upon his arrival, Rio got a warm reception from fellow committee members and others close to the Venezuelan labor movement. The one exception was Carlos Magdaleno, the executive committee's foremost member. Holding a copy of the body's statutes, he insisted that Rios could not assume its presidency. As a sign of protest, Magdaleno walked out of the press conference given by Rios. The labor leader reiterated what he said to his labor colleagues minutes earlier. He repeated his belief that he was the victim of a national and international conspiracy to weaken the CTV. He denied that the attack could have been aimed at him personally because he had committed no offense. "Since the case remains open and my prosecutors, rather than act on good faith, have conducted themselves as accusers, I will continue to demonstrate that I have committed no offense. There are many facts that deserve prompt prosecutorial attention. They include the disclosures of Dr. Esperanza Martino concerning the three financial groups that embezzled over a billion bolivars without a single arrest. "Today," Rios said, "I assume my duties, not with any sense of arrogance, but in the same spirit of service and teamwork that I have always had when seeking to improve the plight of labor. Venezuela is in a period that demands commitment and responsibility from the CTV. It must be ready to talk with the president-elect, his administration, and all other sectors about the accord that will show the way though the serious crisis now afflicting the country. I am convinced of the need for a broad national agreement on how to overcome these difficulties." Rios also emphasized his belief that labor has a pressing need for modernization in order to meet workers' current needs. These needs are different from those of the past, he said, and they require reforms that give labor the power to negotiate new working conditions. "The time has come to warn public employees that they are in danger of falling victim to the sort of crime that I have been accused of. This is why the best that can come of what happened to me is for solidarity to become synonymous with the Venezuelan labor movement. I must tell you of my reflections during my 14 months in prison. I submit that the CTV and all unions must become independent of political parties and their economic resources without delay. This is the way to eliminate once and for all any reliance on partisan politics in the making of decisions that are strictly labor-related." In handing over the CTV presidency, Angel Zerpa Mirabal noted that the International Labor Organization sees the Rios case as a clear human rights violation and will take up the matter at its December meeting. [Regalado] Would you be willing to discuss retroactivity and lower demands for wage hikes as part of a national accord while the country solves its fiscal deficit? [Rios] That is possible and necessary, but it must be done as part of a broad agreement with both wages and prices on the same table. It is not fair to freeze wages and let prices go free. The need is for a broad agreement covering an ample basket of goods and agreed-upon wages. This gives wages room to move if prices rise so long as the country remains in crisis. Willpower on the part of government and business is the key. [Regalado] What do you think of the position MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] has taken on the executive committee against your taking over the CTV presidency? [Rios] I have no knowledge of this. I would ask them to modify their position since everyone knows I am innocent. I would refer them to Eloy Torres, who is sure of my innocence. [Regalado] Would the national accord include elimination of retroactive entitlements? [Rios] I have always said that laws are made to be improved through revision except in the area of social entitlements. Talk of their elimination came up when I was under attack, and I took it as a maneuver against me. But I still regard the entitlement law as no different from others that are susceptible to modification. This is something that can be debated. The fact is that entitlements are all workers have. This is why there is so much resistance to changing them. But I do understand that modifications are necessary because today retroactivity is a drain on public and private resources that could lead to insolvency. Big business has something set aside for such a contingency. This is what makes modification necessary. But it cannot be just a way to meet needs or solve problems for business. It must also improve the lot of workers. I am sure my colleagues on the CTV executive committee would be open to discussion.
