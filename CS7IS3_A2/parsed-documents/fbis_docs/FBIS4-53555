The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) demanded that Masatomo Yamazaki, former attorney to Soka Gakkai, be summoned as an unsworn witness in connection with his alleged attempt to tap a telephone line at the House of Japanese Communist Party Chairman Kenji Miyamoto. Soka Gakkai is the primary support base for Komeito and their ties have often become the focus of disputes over the separation of religion and politics stipulated in the Constitution. The coalition urged the LDP to attend the committee session on Friday to deliberate the 10.89 trillion yen stopgap supplementary budget, which will extend for 40 days an original 50-day provisional budget worth 11.05 trillion yen that expires Friday. The LDP, however, declined because the coalition rejected its demand, parliamentary sources said. The more powerful House of Representatives approved the stopgap supplementary budget on Wednesday. The rare supplement to a provisional budget, the first since fiscal 1990, followed the continued political turmoil involving the resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the selection as premier of Tsutomu Hata. Diet deliberations for the 73.08 trillion yen full budget for the 1994 fiscal year finally started Tuesday.
