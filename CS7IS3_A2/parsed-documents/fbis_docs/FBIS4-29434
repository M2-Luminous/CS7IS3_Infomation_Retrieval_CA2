The limited domestic demand plus the foreign competition in the country now leave Korean manufacturers unable to rely on the domestic market alone. To find a way for survival, they must strengthen exports. Following are views of government, business and association officials on this subject, with a focus on ways and means to increase exports of the indigenously developed digital switching system, TDX. (Editor) --Kim Chong-nam: The nation's market for telecommunication equipment has been largely liberalized by multilateral and bilateral agreements. This is no time for our firms to stick to the domestic market alone; they must be more active to develop markets overseas. What is your views on how to strengthen exports of the indigenously developed digital switching system, TDX, including TDX-10. --Ho Song-pu: Daewoo has so far exported a total of 20,000 circuits to Iran and 50,000 circuits to the Uzbek Republic. This year it will concentrate more on exports, particularly to central Asian countries. We are already pushing exports to a few countries in that region. We took part in the bidding for 3.6 million circuits in Iran, in which three companies are left in the final round of competition now. Of them, Daewoo is a strong candidate. A small-type switching system was developed last year, which we plan to export to China for the first time. In that respect, Daewoo is near an agreement with China on setting up a joint venture; negotiations are in the final phase. Daewoo's total exports so far are 70,000 circuits. --Kim Yong-ki: Samsung is already exporting to China, Russia, and South American and East European countries. Through the end of last year, it exported a total of 520,000 circuits--200,000 to Russia, 120,000 to China, 50,000 to South America, and 150,000 to East Europe. We plan to focus more on countries where we already set up our operations, exporting an additional 1.5 million circuits by the end of this year. Samsung plans to export a small-type set, TDX-1B, to China, and the large 100,000-circuit system to Russia. --Kim Chong-nam: Tell us about difficulties you experienced concerning exports, and how you worked on them. --Kim Yong-ki: First, it was the funding problem. In placing an order for a large project, the ordering country is usually unable to do so with its own fund alone. Potential TDX importers are mostly poor countries. So, to promote exports, we have to give them loans. To support their switching system exports, Japan disbursed more than $51.99 billion and Germany $88.25 billion from their respective foreign economic cooperation funds. Korea's foreign economic cooperation fund is 430.2 billion won [W], of which only W92.6 billion was put out in support of TDX exports. We have difficulties in terms of funding support, too, for in Germany's case, it is an installment payment over 30 years at an interest rate of 0.75% to 2% per annum but, in our case, the rate is much higher. Because of this, Samsung suffered a defeat in Hungary. At the last minute of signing the contract, Hungary turned us down in favor of Germany. They told us then that their was no problem with our offer, the model and everything else, but the terms of funding. It shows what is the biggest difficulty in TDX exports. Also, when making inroads into underdeveloped countries, we need the certification of payment but the Export Insurance Corporation simply refuses to provide it. This is one of the problems that should be corrected promptly. So far, there has been not a single case in which the corporation granted the certification. --Ho Song-pu: Daewoo also finds the funding support the biggest problem. In Iran's case, it demands cooperation in funding as a precondition of bidding. In the latest bidding, Iran demands that our bank file an official document with the Iranian bank promising its funding support. We are worried if the Korean Export-Import Bank will respond favorably. Concerning our plan to export TDX-10 to Iran, we met problems with the Coordinating Committee for Export Control (COCOM). We wonder why we are still subject to COCOM restrictions while U.S. firms already set up joint ventures in Russia. --So Sang-to: What Goldstar can do now is to set up operations in developing countries, for we find it difficult to make inroads into the markets of the advanced nations. But the lack of funds is our problem, too. --Kim Yong-ki: When we export TDX, we must invite technical workers from the importing country for training. In this case, the process of obtaining visas for them takes too long a time. Also, the officially required testing procedures are too complicated for newly developed devices. --Kim Chong-nam: I understand that COCOM restrictions were lifted at the end of March this year, except for exports to Iran, Iraq and North Korea. That was after that that U.S. firms could set up operations in Russia. --Kim No-chol: Companies should make efforts to win the certification of the international quality standard organization, ISO 9000. Korea Telecom will make its efforts to win designation as a certifying agency. Developing countries will sooner or later demand the ISO 9000 certification on our products. We should be prepared for it. --Kim Chong-nam: Let's talk about the question of testing and evaluating on TDX compatibility. --Im Chu-hwan: The Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute is preparing for equipment to be used for the testing and evaluation. We cannot do it right now but will soon be able to provide the service. --Pak Song-tuk: Korea set out to develop the small-type switching system in the early 1970's. It now has its own system. Companies should not entirely depend on the Ministry of Communications [MOC] in developing markets overseas. Even inside the government, some wonder why the MOC should be playing a leading role with exports by businesses. It is a fact, however, that the MOC is giving greater assistance to firms trying to make inroads into foreign markets than before. Most important in promoting switching system exports is to gain the importing nations' trust. In this respect, the MOC backs up businesses by promoting trust-based relationships with importing countries. For instance, we invite students from underdeveloped nations for four to six weeks of training in Korea. These things help gain their confidence. In Romania's case, students who had received such training strongly asked their government to import TDX. This led to TDX exports to Romania. The government's role is to render that type of support. The government has also disbursed a great deal of money from its foreign economic cooperation fund. In the interest rate, too, we are constantly striving to bring it down to the advanced nations' levels. --Kim No-chol: The largest annual order Korea Telecom has ever placed was 2.78 million circuits. It's order for this year, however, is estimated at 1 million circuits. Domestic demand for switching systems is on the decline every year. We will, nevertheless, endeavor for an upturn. --Kim Chong-nam: The switching system is a high-tech complex type of computer, semiconductor and communication device. It has a greater value added than other manufactured goods and is highly effective in inducing exports of related equipment. Therefore, business firms should no longer see it as separate commodities but part of a package. They should establish export strategy based on that concept, including tie-ups between businesses. --Pak Ha-ku: Korea Communications Engineering is in charge of supporting exports. Its duty is to curb excessive competition and promote autonomous adjustments among the four companies in penetrating into foreign markets. Currently, we are conducting such adjustments with 78 importers. In the past, there were cases in which more than one company set up operations in the same importing country, causing the price to fall and creating confusion in that country. We have no such problems now. Korea Communications Engineering is doing designing and counseling services for developing countries. --Pak Song-tuk: Business firms should show greater concern about foreign trainees, because they play a significant role in their governments' choosing our models. --Pak Ha-ku: With the switching system alone, the value added is limited. We should make a comprehensive approach with related products, including lines and networks. Korea recently received Brunei's order for 5 years of maintenance and repair services. This shows that we can sell equipment to guarantee operations, too. --Kim Chong-nam: We should conduct effective promotional activities to convince importers that TDX, our mainstay item, is superior in quality. Dacom Corporation had been using a U.S. model when it recently tried to add a new function. Finding that it has to pay an exorbitant price for new software, Dacom is reportedly considering switching to a domestic model. In short, Dacom's case shows that the domestic model is less expensive and better in quality. We should bring the fact to the attention of all importing countries. --Pak Song-tuk: International trust is important. We could make inroads into Chinese markets because the Chinese trusted us. --Kim Chong-nam: On the private level, a memorandum of understanding was exchanged between the Korea Communications Industries Association and the China Posts and Telecommunications Industries General Corporation. As a result, China will invite a Korean delegation in May, and a bilateral communications cooperation program will be adopted at that time. We will invite a Chinese delegation in the latter half of this year. We will have them inspect our industries during the visit and, if they have any requests then, we will add them to the program. --Pak Song-tuk: The Chinese corporation is sending a 50-member delegation to Korea. The members are very important because they will make the decision on the proposed TDX import. --Kim Chong-nam: The matter of international trust is being taken care of by the government, and I am sure that there will be improvement in the funding issue, too, in the future. Therefore, all there is left for business firms to do, I think, is to effectively use joint export strategy through tie-ups and endeavor to develop markets overseas.
