Whereas Rudolf Scharping, SPD Chairman and chancellor candidate, rejected an increase in the gasoline tax in an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG, Schleswig-Holstein Minister-President Heide Simonis (SPD) told ZDF that, over the long term, one should think about "whether one could use an increase in the gasoline tax to initiate certain developments." Thus, it is important to shift local traffic from private cars to public transportation. Scharping told BILD that he does not want to set a time limit for the 10-percent unification surcharge for high-income earners. The charge will be levied until the "old inherited burdens from the shadow budgets of the current Federal Government are removed." Frau Simonis pleaded in favor of increasing the property and inheritance tax. Those who possess property have been spared so far and made sizable profits. These people "must now also realize slowly" that they must make a contribution to financing the state. According to an Emnid poll among 1,000 citizens, 55 percent support the unification surcharge for high-income earners, suggested by the SPD. A total of 34 percent endorse the general solidarity surcharge of 7.5 percent, planned by the government for 1 January 1995. Klaus Kinkel, chairman of the Free Democratic Party of Germany, described the SPD proposal as a "frontal attack on the top performers in the country." The high-income earners already provide over 90 percent of the overall tax revenue.
