Latest statistics show that the city withdrew 3.35 billion yuan of currency from circulation last year, ranking second after Guangzhou, leaving behind the three centrally controlled municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Tang Shuangning, vice president of the Shenyang branch of the People's Bank China, said that the city's currency withdrawal from circulation has maintained an annual rate of 40 percent since 1990. The net currency withdrawal means that during a given period of time, the amount of money put into circulation is smaller than the amount of money withdrawn. The chief means to withdraw money from circulation include retail sales, bank savings and recovery of agricultural debts, offering of services, property taxation and trading taxation at markets. Under the current economic system, it is regarded as a key indicator of the development of commerce, finance, communications and information. This shows that Shenyang city is well on its way from an industrial city into a city with a developed commerce, finance and services.
