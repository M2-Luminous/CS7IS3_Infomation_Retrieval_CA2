Krisztina Hadas reports: [Hadas] The statement of the Hungarian Way Circles presidium urges unity of national forces. According to movement leader Istvan Csurka, today countless parties characterize themselves as national but this self-declaration is no more than an empty phrase. The Hungarian Way Circles movement interprets such unity as meaning unity with parties of the present government coalition. [Begin Csurka recording] This appeal, in fact, concerns the coalition parties and the smaller and bigger political gatherings and movements which are already members of the Hungarian Way. Now we wish to see more pronounced politics from them. After all, the force in government is the most important, regardless of how much of its popularity has been lost during the time of governing. [end recording] [Hadas] At his news conference Csurka said that the four month activity of the government lead by Peter Boross could be extremely important for the country's future. The leader of the Hungarian Way Circles hopes that the forthcoming national conference of the Hungarian Democratic Forum will bring a favorable political turn for them. He did not speculate but said that, come what may, the Hungarian Way Circles and the Hungarian Justice and Life Party can only influence the government by declarations of principles.
