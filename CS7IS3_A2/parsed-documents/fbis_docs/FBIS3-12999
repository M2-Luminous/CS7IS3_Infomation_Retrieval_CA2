"Following 14 years of desperate efforts to undermine the legitimacy of Iran, the United States is finally heeding international pressure and is trying to come to terms with the political realities of the Islamic Republic," said `TEHRAN TIMES'. It added that Washington's apparent change of heart is due to two major causes -- the limitation of the U.S. influence in the Middle East resulted from the region's cordial relations with Iran and failure of the U.S.-imposed Middle East peace talks which makes Washington to use Tehran's "spiritual influence" in the Islamic world to revive and legitimize the peace accord. "Iran has endeavored to stay faithful to its own Islamic revolution while leaving open the possibility of reconciliation with the U.S. provided that America releases Iran's assets and refrains from covert and overt operations aimed at isolating and destabilizing the Islamic Republic." In the case of re-establishment of ties with Iran, the U.S. would stand to gain a lot more than Iran, therefore, it should be prepared to make greater concessions, said the daily in conclusion noting that Iranian officials are well aware of this fact and would base their demands accordingly.
