SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 17 and 27, 1993, January 3 and 7, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (58 FR 65971, 68398, 59 FR 74 and 1002) of proposed additions to and deletions from the Procurement List. Additions After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the commodities and services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the commodities and services listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities and services to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and services. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and services to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following commodities and services are hereby added to the Procurement List: Commodities Pallet, Wood 3990&hyph;00&hyph;NSH&hyph;0072 (Requirements for Federal Prison Industries, Inc., Washington, DC) Cap Assembly, Plastic Water Can 7240&hyph;00&hyph;089&hyph;7312 Grommet 8140&hyph;01&hyph;063&hyph;7681 Services Grounds Maintenance for the following U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Reservations: Bayou Boeuf Lock, Berwick Lock, East/West Calumet Floodgates, Charenton Floodgate, Morgan City Vicinity, Louisiana Janitorial/Custodial INEL Electronic Technology Center (IETC), 1 Energy Drive, Idaho Falls, Idaho This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised under those contracts.
