Here with the details is Dmitriy Kiselev, our correspondent in Helsinki: Kiselev: The report's authors, Norwegian researchers (?Niels Denner) and (?Thomas Nielsen), claim they have obtained access to classified information, as a result of which they found out that over two-thirds of nuclear submarines are to be dismantled at the Severodvinsk wharfs near Arkhangelsk. Incidentally, only two nuclear submarines with four reactors have been dismantled and cut to pieces so far. The report from the Norwegian ecological organization (?Bellona) contains a detailed analysis of the plans to prepare the Severomorsk wharfs for the work to come. These include building new dry docks and facilities for removal of fuel elements, extending mooring lines for old nuclear submarines and, finally, modernizing the railway connecting Severomorsk and Arkhangelsk with the Mayak enterprise in the Urals, to which the highly radioactive waste is expected to be shipped for reprocessing. However, Norwegian researchers claim that not one plan for the refurbishment of the wharfs for such a large-scale and dangerous task as destroying some 150 nuclear submarines has been approved. And this is in spite of the fact that the works were planned for the period between 1993 and 1998. Moreover, it is still hard to establish who is specifically accountable for complying with international agreements under the START-2 treaty, and also who is ecologically accountable for possible consequences. Meanwhile, at present many old nuclear submarines no longer on combat duty are dispersed throughout the fjords of the Kola peninsula on so-called temporary mooring, the report authors claim. Slackness in project drafting, however, is only half the trouble. It has still not been decided with any degree of certainty what is to happen to the reactors to be removed from the submarines--whether they will be dumped in the Kara Sea--as the USSR used to do until 1991--or stored in a special depository in Arkhangelsk Oblast. There is no money for the depository, the Norwegian researchers conclude, quoting official and unofficial replies from those they had talked to in Arkhangelsk and Severomorsk. This means, the authors of the (?Bellona) report conclude, Russia intends to dump several hundred more nuclear reactors in the Kara Sea. (?Niels Denner) and (?Thomas Nielsen) believe that Moscow's refusal to sign the London convention banning the dumping of radioactive waste in the open sea is further evidence of the existence of these ominous plans. What causes the biggest threat, however, in the view of the Norwegians, is the social unreliability of Russia's nuclear complex. According to their data, the staff of the Murmansk nuclear fleet, the Severodvinsk wharfs, and the Northern Fleet have had their wage payments delayed for several months. It is natural that, under these conditions, the people's attitudes toward their duties may change and the probability of a human error in dealing with radioactive materials increases significantly. So, now you know about the alarming report that was published in Scandinavia. It is hardly appropriate for a new Russia to find out about itself from its scared neighbors.
