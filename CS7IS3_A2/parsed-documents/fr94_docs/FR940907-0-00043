FR940907-0-00043 FR940907-0-00016 40 CFR Part 180 [PP 7F3546/R2074; FRL&hyph;4904&hyph;9] RIN 2070&hyph;AB78 Bifenthrin; Pesticide Tolerances and Extension of Tolerances AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule establishes time-limited tolerances (with an expiration date of November 15, 1997) for residues of the snythetic pyrethroid bifenthrin in or on the raw agricultural commodities (RACs) corn (field, seed, and pop) grain, silage (forage), stover (fodder); milk, milk fat; meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, sheep, and poultry; and eggs. FMC Corp. petitioned EPA to establish maximum permissible levels for residues of the pesticide in or on the commodities. EPA also is establishing time-limited tolerances for residues of bifenthrin in or on cottonseed and dried hops. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation becomes effective September 7, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of June 22, 1994 (59 FR 32167), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that pursuant to pesticide petition 7F3546 and subsequent amendments to it, the FMC Corp., 1735 Market St., Philadelphia, PA 19103, had requested that pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, EPA amend 40 CFR part 180 to establish tolerances for residues of the pesticide bifenthrin, (2-methyl [1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl)methyl-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3,-trifluoro-1-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, and its 4'-hydroxy metabolite in or on the commodities corn (field, seed, and pop) grain at 0.05 part per million (ppm), forage at 2.0 ppm, fodder at 5.0 ppm; milk, fat (reflecting 0.1 ppm in whole milk) at 1.0 ppm; meat of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, poultry, and sheep at 0.05 ppm; meat byproducts (mbyp) of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.10 ppm; poultry mbyp at 0.05 ppm; fat of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 1.0 ppm; poultry fat at 0.05 ppm; cottonseed at 0.5 ppm; hops, dried at 10.0 ppm; and eggs at 0.05 ppm. EPA proposed to establish time-limited tolerances, with an expiration date of November 15, 1997. There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule. The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the time-limited tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the time-limited tolerances are established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
