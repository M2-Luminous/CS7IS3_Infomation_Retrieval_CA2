At a meeting with visiting mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, co-chairmen of the international peace conference on the former Yugoslavia, Kozyrev described the planned air raids as "an extreme step." Although in principle air raid is not excluded within the framework of UN Security Council resolutions, Kozyrev said, Moscow still keeps its initiative in the Security Council to make additional efforts to push for the peace process in the region. Owen and Stoltenberg arrived here earlier today for discussion on measures to prevent violence in the Balkan region from further escalating, keep the Geneva negotiations process going and finally achieve a settlement. The two peace mediators departed for Geneva this afternoon after their brief working visit here.
