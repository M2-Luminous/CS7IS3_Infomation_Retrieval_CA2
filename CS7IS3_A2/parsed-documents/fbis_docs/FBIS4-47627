After the Government established itself in Niyslel Hureen, it convened its sixth meeting on 19 July 1921 during which it organized the Mongolian General Telegraph Committee. The committee was called MONTA, a derivation from the first letters of the Russian phrase Mongolskoye telegrafnoye agenstvo. Until World War II MONTA issued regular reports. During the war period it translated TASS reports and disseminated these over the radio and in newspapers. After the war, the Mongolian Telegraph Agency (Mongolyn Tsahilgaan medeegiy agentlag) was independently organized, subordinated to the Council of Ministers, and renamed MONTSAME. Since then its operation has been expanded to include radio and television, and MONTSAME was designated as a state committee. In 199O it became a "statistically independent organization" subordinated to the Government and called the MONTSAME agency. In accordance with Government Resolution No 40 of 1991, MONTSAME became an official central organization of the Mongolian State and Government.
