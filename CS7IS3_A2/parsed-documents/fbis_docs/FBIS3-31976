Ortega Undergoes Knee Surgery in Mexico PA2801172894 Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish 27 Jan 94 p12 PA2801172894 Managua LA PRENSA Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Report by Roger Suarez] [Text] General Humberto Ortega underwent surgery on both knees at a Mexican clinic, Sergio Ramirez, Sandinist National Liberation Front bloc chief, stated yesterday during a news conference. Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Wheelock confirmed today to LA PRENSA that Gen. Ortega underwent "a minor operation in Mexico on both knees but is in perfect condition and will soon return to the country." Yesterday, Sergio Ramirez called a news conference to defend himself from attacks by his opponents in Sandinist radio stations La Primerisima and Ya. In a commentary, newsman William Grisby said Gen. Ortega had maintained a political alliance with Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo and Ramirez, but these two had betrayed the army chief last September. When Ramirez was asked about the charges that he betrayed Gen. Ortega, he replied: The last time I spoke with Humberto Ortega was Thursday, when he called me from Mexico because of my mother's death. "From his hospital bed and still under the anesthesia, he called me very shaken to give me his condolences.... That is my personal relationship with Humberto Ortega," the former Sandinist vice president stated. It is not known if Ortega will use crutches for some time or will walk with a cane.
