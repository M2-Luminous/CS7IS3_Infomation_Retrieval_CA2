That will enable them to alleviate the effects of the economic crisis. Meanwhile, the effects of a possible embargo on Turkey will be nullified. The National Assembly Committee on Industry and Technology has quickly approved the draft law that will enable the private sector establishments to meet the needs of the military forces. According to the draft law, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and the General Staff will determine the establishments that can manufacture arms with minor changes in their structure. Protocols will be signed with them later, and the government will provide them with financial resources. The draft law has been drawn up by the Ministry of National Defense and approved by the Council of Ministers. Several industrial sectors, including the establishments that manufacture vehicles, household effects, and electronic equipment, will be geared to manufacture every kind of equipment the military forces require when the National Assembly enacts the draft law. Golhan's Statement Minister of National Defense Mehmet Golhan has said: "The country must be in a position to meet all its needs from its national resources in order to render any embargo by foreign countries at critical times ineffective." Meanwhile, Azimet Koyluoglu, chairman of the National Assembly Committee on Industry and Technology, said the following: "The new arrangement was required to support the establishments in the private sector and contribute toward the country's defense. The automobile factories in Bosnia have been converted into arms-producing establishments because of the war in that country. They have shouldered a significant responsibility in the effort the Muslim people are making to defend their homeland. We live in peace. However, we have to plan what we may have to do in case of war." The section, which outlined the reasons for the draft law, said in part the following: "Turkey acquires its arms, military equipment, and spare parts from foreign sources. However, it may not be able to acquire its needs from the same sources in the event of a mobilization or war. Therefore, the possibility of having the arms and equipment Turkey requires manufactured in the country should be studied. Meeting the needs of the military forces from Turkey's industrial establishments will reactivate the national industry sector and create an opportunity for the country to save foreign currency."
