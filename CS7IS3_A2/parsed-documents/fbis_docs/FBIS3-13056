A month after killing four Israeli soldiers and wounding five, Hizballah guerrillas on Monday [7 March] launched a series of bomb attacks on the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA), killing 10 militiamen and wounding 12. A senior intelligence officer was among those killed, but Hizballah reported no casualties on its side. "Monday's operations were specifically aimed at eliminating Israel's main intelligence agents," Shaykh Nabil Qawuq who is among those in charge of Hizballah operations in south Lebanon, told AFP on Tuesday. "They are part of a series of operations to sow chaos among SLA ranks," he said, adding that more than 100 SLA militiamen had deserted over the past year. Military experts and sources close to the Shiite Moslem fundamentalists said Hizballah's operations in recent months were more professional and homed in on specific Israeli or SLA targets to avoid retaliation against civilians. The guerrillas were also using more sophisticated weapons. Their arsenal now includes Russian-made Sagger anti-tank rockets known for their precision, which are increasingly being used against moving targets, a western military source said. Hizballah has had "very good results" with the rockets, said the source, who declined to be named. An SLA official said that Hizballah guerrillas were also using a new type of roadside bomb that "is shaped like rocks and painted in earthy colours." He said the bombs were Iranian-made or upgraded by Iran and that they were capable of jamming Israeli radars. Hizballah also uses Katyusha rockets and mortars. Sources close to the fundamentalists have said the new tactics evolved two months ago with the arrival in Lebanon of a new team of Iranian Revolutionary Guards to oversee and coordinate the anti- Israeli operations. They include a new head for the Revolutionary Guards and an Iranian official known by his first name only, 'Abbas, who is said to be in charge of Hizballah's military operations, the sources said. Around 200 Revolutionary Guards, clerics and social workers are based in Lebanon's eastern al-Biqa' Valley, where they were first deployed following Israel's 1982 invasion. Hizballah has meanwhile transferred its military positions out of the al-Biqa' city of Ba'labakk to areas closer to the border with Syria and switched its activities in the region to social work and construction. Fundamentalist sources said these steps were part of a campaign by Hizballah to improve its domestic image after winning eight parliamentary seats in the 1992 elections. "They are also focusing more and more on helping their supporters to set up private businesses as part of an effort to forge a new image for the movement," a reliable source said. "Hizballah has become more diplomatic since the 1992 elections. They no longer terrorize people," the source added. Hizballah leader Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah said last month his organisation was "not only a military movement. We have popular roots everywhere."
