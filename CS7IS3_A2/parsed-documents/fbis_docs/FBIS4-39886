Over a period of three years, a financial system, aimed primarily at supporting small business, should be developed in Latvia. Therefore, investments in the national economy are necessary, which can be acquired from both the state budget (approximately 3-4 percent of national product) and foreign investments. In addition, in the future it is foreseen to refrain from state-guaranteed foreign credits, so that Latvian banks or businessmen can borrow money directly from abroad. Until now, all foreign credits coming into Latvia were directly or indirectly guaranteed by the government. To create conditions enabling representatives of small businesses in Latvia to obtain credits with fewer formalities, it is necessary, in the first place, to develop and strengthen the Bank of Investments, said Osis. As a next step, the minister mentioned the formation of credit associations and savings banks. In this realm, said Osis, the German Cooperative Bank has pledged its assistance. It is also of greatest importance to establish an association of credits and guarantees, which would be able to provide a guarantee to small enterprises receiving credits. Two Finnish companies are willing to assist in establishing this kind of association in Latvia, Osis reported. According to him, Western experts have advised Latvia to consider the possibility of becoming an "offshore" financial center.
