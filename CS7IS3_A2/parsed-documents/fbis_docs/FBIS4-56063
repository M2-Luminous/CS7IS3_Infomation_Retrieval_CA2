We are broadcasting a special edition of the election series, which presents party opinions. We have invited those heading the lists of the parties that were most successful in the first round of the elections. I greet here in the studio Gyula Horn, heading the list of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], and Gabor Kuncze, who heads the list of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Let us speak about the economy. [passage omitted] You have said that if you come to power, there will be no need for a 100-day grace period. I imagine you were hinting at economic issues. [passage omitted] [Kuncze] I say there is no need for 100 days of grace because in my opinion the next government will have to take action immediately. Of course, this is not separate from the fact that it is necessary to be familiar with the situation that the next government will inherit. We also are of the firm opinion that a very detailed coalition agreement must be concluded because only on this basis will it be possible to coordinate positions in the future, to prepare a legislative program, to organize government work, and to ensure that there is a stable coalition behind the government. [passage omitted] [Horn] Allow me to continue what Gabor Kuncze began. In my view, at the same time coalition talks are held it will be necessary to gain an idea of the country's situation, to gain an idea of what legacy awaits the new government. [passage omitted] Only then -- on the basis of chapters such as the coalition agreement conditions consisting not just of economic matters but constitutional matters and others -- will it be possible to define the most urgent tasks that must be accomplished by the end of 1994. Last, but not least, the next government must differ from the current one in that much should be done to simplify bureaucracy. This would facilitate the greater influx of working capital, which would facilitate ventures, and other. [passage omitted] [Announcer] You emphasize an active economic policy. What measures do you intend to take? [Kuncze] After a possible coalition agreement has been reached, after the conditions have been created for more effective government and parliamentary work, and after the legal amendments have been passed, there could be a need in 1994 for a supplementary budget. It is necessary to set to work immediately on amending the laws that regulate privatization. [passage omitted] The same applies to the legal package that regulates agriculture; it is necessary in this case to create a satisfactory system of market information, a satisfactory credit system, a system of support that can be used more effectively than now. Politics must withdraw from the villages and it must leave those involved in agriculture to work on the basis of their own knowledge and interests. Remaining with the subject of 1994 -- the package of laws on self-government must be amended so that those running in the local elections can do so in accordance with the new conditions. The education laws ought to be reviewed. By way of example, we feel that the system of university tuition fees cannot be introduced beginning in September. Something must be done in connection with the question of the national curriculum. In the second half of 1994 the parliament will have to enact amendments to the legislation on taxation. I am thinking here of tax reductions, tax concessions, and amendments of regulations to encourage investments, which will come into force as of 1 January 1995. The National Assembly this year will have to adopt the budget for 1995. [passage omitted] Our opinion is that the proportions will have to turned around; greater emphasis must be placed on preparation of the laws, and the parliament, by working more effectively, must be able to enact the laws more quickly. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Both of you have mentioned social responsiveness. It has particularly been stressed by Gyula Horn. [passage omitted] It is obvious that the trade unions might have a determining role. What is your opinion about this? Will this trade union interest succeed within the traditional and desirable interest coordination mechanism, or within the parliament, through a certain kind of trade union faction within the MSZP? [Kuncze] The SZDSZ regards interest coordination -- both with employees and employers -- as a very important issue. In this respect, naturally, we accept the trade unions as partners. We also accept this certain social agreement with the interest representation organizations [referring to the MSZP's proposal], not without any reason, because this proposal was also included in the SZDSZ's crisis management program issued in 1991. [passage omitted] However, this cannot happen in any way other than outside parliament, because the essence of this is that these agreements then have to be approved by parliament. Parliament, naturally, has an opportunity to exercise control over these agreements. We are not talking about automatic mechanisms here. Parliament's authority will remain in this respect. However, because the leaders of the largest trade unions will enter parliament on the MSZP's list, there is a danger that these interest coordination mechanisms will take place within the party, or perhaps within the MSZP's parliamentary group of deputies, and not in public. We would not approve of this. We are in favor of openness in this respect. We accept and approve of this coordination outside parliament, with the involvement of the government and the trade unions. This certain economic-social agreement has to be reached with these conditions, and the widest possible range of questions should be included in this debate. [Horn] This is a perpetual debate between us. [passage omitted] Assuming that the SZDSZ also wants a social market economy, it is obvious that the social partnership cannot be established without the trade unions. [passage omitted] Another point is that the MSZP -- within or outside the party -- will not conclude any kind of pact with players in society which is not made public. Therefore, if we have any kind of stance in connection with the trade unions, or in connection with the earlier mentioned economic-social agreement, it will be entirely public. The SZDSZ will be informed about it as well as anyone else and the public. That is entirely true. The third element -- forgive me for saying it -- that six of the 176 individual candidates running in MSZP colors were from the leadership of the National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions, will not determine the Socialist Party's policy. I hope, however, that they will influence it. The party, which has had good relations with the representatives of trade unions for years, has an advantageous position. [passage omitted] The Hungarian trade unions do not come up with impossible demands that cannot be fulfilled. They support all their demands with professional arguments. [passage omitted] [Kuncze] I have to argue with you a certain point. I have to repeat that the interest coordination process has to take place outside parliament; it is a governmental task. I agree with you that the law on legislation has to be amended in this respect; the trade unions' rights have to be included. However, I would not consider it desirable if these coordination talks were also carried out within the parliament. It is the government's responsibility to conclude and observe these agreements. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Forty-five minutes have passed. There remains a very important question -- foreign policy. What role should the ethnic Hungarians living as minorities have in our relations with neighboring countries in drafting the basic treaties? [Horn] In our view a basic treaty proclaims two fundamental points: One is the inviolability of borders, while -- closely connected with this -- the other is the full guarantee of the rights of the national minorities, the Hungarians, living there. That is one thing. The other thing is that we naturally would coordinate the conclusion of such a treaty with the political interest representation organizations of the ethnic Hungarians living in the given country -- whether the country in question is Slovakia or Romania. My conviction is that what the MSZP (?says), that there should be historical reconciliation with neighbors, is unavoidable. The sooner we do this, the sooner we try to realize this in practice, the better. One can proclaim an awareness of our mission, one can say a lot about historical grievances -- this will not lead anywhere. The sooner there is national consensus on the question of the necessity of historical reconciliation and, on the basis of this, on the need for an active relationship-building policy, the sooner we will be able to sort out our relationships and the sooner our country will become more secure. I assert that we will be able to assist more the situation of Hungarians living in the given country. [Announcer] I am also curious about the opinion of the SZDSZ. [Kuncze] I agree that the basic treaties can be concluded only if on the other side, the satisfactory guarantees exist for the assertion of the minority rights of the Hungarians beyond the border. The problem is that because of this, it is very difficult to make progress in the conclusion of basic treaties. For this reason we also place emphasis on the need to take concrete, practical steps in every case when the opportunity arises -- whether it is an economic matter, whether it is the opening of a university or an educational issue, or the issue of bilingualism, or other issues. We emphasize the necessity of maintaining this dialogue. Otherwise these basic treaties are, indeed, important, and they should be concluded on the broadest possible bases. This is our political interest as well, because we can enter an integrated Europe only with settled relations with our neighbors. It is also our economic interest, because we could perhaps have markets there. If the economies of those countries improve, this will give rise to a suitable improvement for Hungarians beyond the border. Until then, the Hungarian Government must handle this area with special importance. From here, we do not have to say how the organizations of the Hungarians beyond the borders should conduct their political activities. It is up to them to shape their politics. The Hungarian Government in power must accept what they have shaped, and it must always ask for the opinion of the organizations of the Hungarians beyond the border concerning the fostering of relations with neighboring countries. Our interest is that they should seek their expectations where they were born, and that is where they should live a satisfactory existence. Allow me to add something: Our integration into Europe is important not just for us, but for neighboring countries as well. This will make those borders one line on the map, and this question will no longer be one that is subject to dispute. [Announcer] A brief question in conclusion: How many seats do you feel you have a realistic chance of getting? Mr Horn? [Horn] It is very difficult to predict, and I do not like to predict. I imagine about 170-180 seats. [Announcer] Mr. Kuncze? [Kuncze] We earlier aimed at repeating, at the minimum, our performance in 1990. That means about 90-100 seats in the next parliament. [Announcer] Thank you for coming to the studio.
