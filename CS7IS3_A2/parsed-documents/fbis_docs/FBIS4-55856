A report by Skender Durmishi: [Durmishi] Commenting on the possible ways for a solution to the Kosova issue, the LDK deputy chairman told the reporters that only a solution on the basis of the recognition of the right to self-determination of the Albanian people of Kosova in a form of political relations and institutional implementation can be considered as acceptable solutions. All other forms of solution, apparently easier, which are sometimes suggested in the framework of Yugoslavia and Serbia, will only create new forms for permanent crises and conflicts. LDK Deputy Chairman Fehmi Agani briefed the reporters on the importance of the meeting of Presidents Berisha and Rugova, which testified to the identity of viewpoints and Albania's full support to the solution of the Kosova issue through dialogue and in the spirit of the fair demands of the people. Both chairmen also encouraged the initiatives and efforts by Albanian political parties in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] to achieve a common way of action. Further on, Dr. Fehmi Agani highly appreciated Denmark's understanding and readiness to assist in resolving the Kosova problem. He greeted the initiative of 11 U.S. congressmen who, in a letter sent to President Clinton, asked that the Kosova issue be treated in the first summit on problems in former Yugoslavia. In the letter, they asked solutions not only through eliminating the discrimination and repression made evident by all international organizations, but on the basis of the right of the Albanian people of Kosova to self-determination. In continuation of his comments on the present Kosovar reality, Dr. Fehmi Agani pointed out that despite the Serbian power attempts to create a false impression for the domestic and international public on the reduction of tension and repression, the Serbian repression and violence has continued in Kosova, even with increased intensity. Providing data and concrete names, Agani informed reporters about numerous cases of raids, mistreatments, pursuits of political prisoners, employees of our self-management institutions, culture workers, etc. Protesting all these cases, Dr. Fehmi Agani found out that through such an increase of repression and despite its verbal readiness to resolve the problem of Kosova through an agreement, which has been confirmed several times, the Serbian power is consciously ruining the preliminary conditions and main premises for an eventual dialogue.
