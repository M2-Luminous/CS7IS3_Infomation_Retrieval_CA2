The solution is then mixed with polytetrafluoroethylene and loaded in an autoclave at 150�C for 24 hours. After the treated solution is cooled to room temperature, white SnO[.sup]2[/] powder is obtained. The powder is washed thoroughly, baked at 150�C for 24 hours, and then pressed into a plate under a pressure of 10[.sup]5[/] kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. The initial particle size of the specimen is 3 nm. After annealing at different temperatures, nanoscale SnO[.sup]2[/] powders of different particle sizes are obtained. The powder crystal structure belongs to the rutile type, and there is less than 1 percent of impurities in the powder. The Raman spectrum is measured with a U.S. SPEX-1403 laser Raman spectrometer. The excitation light is the 514.5-nm line from an argon-ion laser. The backscatter configuration is adopted. All measurements are conducted at room temperature. Figure 1 shows that the peaks in the Raman spectra are of two different groups: the peaks in one group, called mode A, correspond with the peaks in the monocrystalline or polycrystalline SnO[.sup]2[/] spectra. The Raman spectrum peaks with wave numbers of 472, 632, and 773 cm[.sup]-1[/] are designated as A[.sup]1[/], A[.sub]2[/], and A[.sup]3[/], respectively. In the other group, called mode B, the peaks with wave numbers of 358 and 572 cm[.sup]-1[/] are designated as B[.sup]1[/] and B[.sub]2[/], respectively. The mode-B peaks do not exist in the monocrystalline or polycrystalline SnO[.sup]2[/] Raman spectra. This observation indicates that the appearance of B[.sup]1[/] and B[.sup]2[/] peaks is caused by the nanoscale effect. Figure 1. Raman Spectra of Different Nanoscale SnO[.sup]2[/] Solids All the peak intensities in Figure 1 are normalized according to the intensity of peak A[.sup]2[/]. As shown in Figure 1, the intensity ratios of the peaks in mode B to the peaks in mode A increase rapidly with decrease in crystal size. This observation is similar to the phenomenon wherein surface-atom fractions rapidly increase with decrease in crystal size. We assume that the B[.sup]1[/] and B[.sub]2[/] peaks are caused by the surface phonon modes and are closely related to the A[.sup]1[/] and A[.sub]2[/] peaks. This experiment shows that the frequencies of the B[.sup]1[/] and B[.sup]2[/] peaks are lower than those of the A[.sub]1[/] and A[.sup]2[/] peaks. The appearance of the low-frequency surface phonon modes is induced by the relaxation among the surface atoms. This relaxation weakens the interaction among the surface atoms, and consequently reduces the surface force coefficient. Calculations based on the Raman spectra of nanoscale solid materials are expected to generate the specific positions of the nanoscale surface atoms.
