The improved legislation, which gives foreign investors the right to participate in privatization on a par with Russian citizens, should, in the opinion in government experts, stimulate an increased inflow of foreign capital into the Russian economy. The prime minister of the Russian Federation is expected at any time to sign a proposal drafted by the Russian Federation Committee on the Administration of State Property [GKI], which gives foreign investors the right to buy privatization vouchers and exchange them for stock of enterprises without the concurrence of the Russian Federation Ministry of Finance (actually, even before, this requirement had been a mere formality). In the estimation of government experts, foreign investment into the economies of Russia and the former USSR republics, including joint enterprises, by the fall of 1993 amounted to only $7 billion. German companies comprise 60 percent of the foreign investors, and Italian--20 percent; Austria, Netherlands, and Belgium account for 10 percent, United States--5 percent, Great Britain--2 percent, and the countries of the Far East (Japan, Korea, and China) account for the remaining 3 percent. This is due primarily to the fact that the Germans began to penetrate the Russian market and form joint enterprises with Russia much earlier than representatives of other countries. According to GKI data, lately German companies give a priority in capital investment to the chemical industry, as well as machine building and food processing. The Zellstoff und Papier company purchased 30 percent of the stock of Zhukovskiy refrigeration plant. The company plans to invest $2.03 million into the plant's development. The Termozvukoizolyatsinnyye Izdeliya plant (Krasnoyarsk) sold 35 percent of its charter capital. The bid winner--the Knauf Verwaltungsgesellchaft Iphofen--will invest 7.535 million German marks [DM] into the plant. The Ceziwid Elektrowarme GmbH company purchased 30 percent of stock of the Podolsk refractories plant. The investment will amount to $1.2 million. German electrotechnical giant Siemens acquired 10 percent of the charter capital of Kaluzhskiy Turbinnyy Zavod joint-stock company, which produces 50 percent of the turbines on the territory of the former USSR. According to the auction terms, the concern will supply the plant with DM2 million worth of equipment for the reconstruction of two shops. A major German company, Kautschuk Gesellshaft GmbH, purchased for privatization vouchers a block of 19 percent of stock (at the cost of 91.795 million rubles) of one of the oldest enterprises in Tula Oblast--Yefremovskiy Zavod Synteticheskogo Kauchuka. According to the auction terms, the Kautschuk Gesellshaft GmbH company, which has been working with the plant for about five years, is to invest in its development DM1.48 million within four months from the date that the deal is registered. Italian firms prefer to set up joint enterprises with Russia in the area of construction and construction materials production. In the opinion of experts, Italian investors coming into the Russian market are predominantly small and medium-sized firms. The United States began their penetration of the Russian market considerably later than the Germans and Italians--in 1992. They invest money in a variety of national-economic sectors--chemical, tobacco, mining, and electronics. The American tobacco company Philip Morris acquired at an investment auction a block of 20 percent of stock of the Krasnodar tobacco factory. According to the terms of the bid, $60 million will be invested in the plant's development over five years. American company Procter & Gamble--one of the world's leading producers of synthetic detergents--acquired at the investment auction 14 percent of the Novomoskovskbytkhim joint-stock company (Tula Oblast)--the largest in the CIS and Europe producer of household chemicals, which produces 30 percent of the laundry detergent in Russia. The company undertook an obligation to invest up to $50 million in the plant's development over five years. Great Britain has been the latest entrant into the Russian market--since the middle of 1993. British investors working with Russian enterprises prefer to work with tobacco and light industry enterprises. One of the largest textile companies in Europe--the British company Illingworth Morris Ltd.--acquired at the investment auction a block of 49 percent of stock of Moscow factory Bolshevichka. The firm promises to invest $5.5 million into the factory over five years, to purchase new materials for Bolshevichka, to equip the factory with a new clothes-making production line, and to make its network of stores available for selling the goods produced by Bolshevichka.
