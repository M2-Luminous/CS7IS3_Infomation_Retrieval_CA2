In other words, the defense minister believes that the time has come for Portugal to contribute more substantially to the strengthening of the Atlantic alliance's European pillar by systematically committing to the WEU's (still mediocre) military structure the operational product resulting from the process of modernizing its own Armed Forces. This is the purport of a working communication that Fernando Nogueira has conveyed to the Armed Forces chief of staff and the director general of defense policy. In this communication, the defense minister orders the intensification of studies aimed at realizing the above-mentioned intention, but does not forget interests linked to the country's influence in Africa and in the regional geostrategic scenario of which it forms part. The external aspect of the government's philosophy is based on the ideas approved by the last NATO summit, specifically those connected with Partnership for Peace and the Joint Combined Forces, which give the alliance a new image as a security organization; and the internal aspect is based on the new Strategic Concept of National Defense. Portugal's appropriate and balanced presence in the above-mentioned international organizations (NATO and the WEU), as well as support for the initiatives aimed at maintaining global and regional stability carried out by the United Nations and the CSCE, does not impair but rather makes advisable an increased national prominence in bilateral and multilateral relations -- obviously within our real means -- whereby the safeguarding of national interests will be complemented in a sustained and harmonious manner, Minister Fernando Nogueira states in the communication concerned. Observer in Eurocorps The defense minister directs that until a new form of joint military structure is created in the WEU and NATO, the national forces allocated to the Atlantic alliance should be deemed available for the WEU, and that the feasibility of various initiatives should be studied. Three of these are the possible strengthening of the WEU's structures with Portuguese military personnel, the posting of an observer to the Eurocorps command, and the participation of the Separate Airborne Brigade (BAI) in the nonpermanent ground component of the Mediterranean Air and Sea Force. At the same time, forms of participation by Portuguese naval air forces in that Mediterranean joint force will also be studied. Within the strictly European framework, it will also rest with the military to propose the phasing of the Marine Corps' possible forms of participation in the Anglo-Dutch Amphibian Brigade. NATO, United Nations, and Portuguese-Speaking African Countries The development of bilateral cooperation in the sphere of the defense of the Central and Eastern European region -- specifically with Romania and Hungary -- is also advocated by the defense minister, who, in light of the last NATO summit's conclusions, also ponders the ability to respond to Russia. Active participation in the working parties developing in international forums the ideas of Partnership for Peace and Joint Combined Forces will be the background for carrying out that kind of cooperation. The setting up of a group of national forces for possible allocation to the United Nations (on a standby basis) also appears in the defense minister's communication. With respect to the national political and strategic framework, Fernando Nogueira refers to the intensification of bilateral defense relations with the Maghreb countries and technical and military cooperation (including at the trilateral level) with the Portuguese-speaking African countries and other countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
