FR940720-2-00016 FR940720-2-00007 7. Grants From the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno Petitioner alleges that Dalmine has received grants from the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno (``Cazmez'') which are directed to southern Italy. In Certain Steel , we found such grants to be countervailable because they were provided on a regional basis. Petitioner is not aware of any Dalmine plants outside of Bergamo, which is in the North, but points to Dalmine's Annual Reports which show that the company received Cazmez grants in the early and mid-1980s. Based on this finding, petitioner states that Dalmine must have a plant located in the South. Therefore, petitioner requests that the Department, in addition to the Cazmez grants, investigate a large number of other subsidy programs directed to the South, should we find that Dalmine maintains production facilities there. From Dalmine's Annual Reports, we have found that the company formerly had two production facilities in the South, both of which produced welded pipe. Apart from these two plants, which were spun off in 1989, we have not found any other production facilities in the South. Because both the plants in the South produced welded pipe, which is not included in the scope of this investigation, we are not including the Cazmez grants or any other programs directed to the South in our investigation. ITC Notification Pursuant to section 702(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of this initiation. Preliminary Determination by the ITC The ITC will determine by August 8, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is being materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, by reason of imports from Italy of seamless pipe. Any ITC determination which is negative will result in the investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigation will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. This notice is published pursuant to 702(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 355.13(b). Dated: July 13, 1994. Barbara R. Stafford, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations.
