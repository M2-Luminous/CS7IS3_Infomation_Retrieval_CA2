The peacekeepers were freed at 1:35 p.m. (1135 GMT), said Major Eric Chaperon. The troops, 16 Canadian peacekeepers and three military observers of unspecified nationality, were due to return to their post at Cifluk, 19 kilometres (11 miles) northwest of Sarajevo, Chaperon said. They had been deployed there to monitor seven Serb mortar and two anti-aircraft cannons. The batteries had been retained in Cifluk in violation of the February accord under which Bosnian Serbs agreed to withdraw all heavy weapons from a 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital under threat of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air strikes. Bosnian Serb forces still detained or blocked Sunday hundreds of United Nations peacekeepers in several Serb-held sectors of Bosnia.
