FR940127-2-00088 FR940127-2-00064 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;259 and 50&hyph;296] Tennessee Valley Authority; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements of its regulations to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-33 and DPR-68 issued to the Tennessee Valley Authority (the license) for operation of the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN) Units 1 and 3, located in Limestone County, Alabama. Environmental Assessment Identification of Proposed Action The proposed action is in response to the licensee's application dated September 2, 1993, with additional information provided on December 17, 1993, for exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage.'' Under the proposed exemption, the licensee would be relieved of requirements to provide positive containment access control by a guard or watchman during periods of frequent access. BFN Units 1 and 3 have been shut down since March 1985 for modifications required to put the units in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. The proposed exemption would be in effect until immediately before the licensee loads fuel in the reactors when the required modifications are completed. The Need for the Proposed Action Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, paragraph (a), the licensee shall establish and maintain an outside physical protection system and security organization. Containment access controls specified by 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) require that any time frequent access to the containment is required, positive controls are maintained by a guard or watchman to assure only authorized personnel or materials are permitted into the containment. BFN Units 1 and 3 have been defueled since September 1985 and February 1987, respectively. These reactors have been shut down since March 1985 for modifications required to put the units in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. A substantial number of the required modifications require frequent containment access. Therefore, the licensee has maintained a guard at a controlled access location to fulfill the requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8). The licensee believes that the 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) requirements are too restrictive, given the unique status of Browns Ferry Units 1 and 3 and the other controls which are or will be exercised to ensure the reactors are returned to service in a safe manner. Presently, the reactors are defueled, which reduces the radiological hazard potential within the containment such that sabotage could not create a substantial offsite radiation dose. The licensee will perform extensive return-to-service testing on all safety-related systems. This testing ensures that plant components can properly perform their intended design functions. After modifications are completed, the licensee will also perform security inspections to detect sabotage or introduction of foreign material which may have occurred during the recovery effort.
