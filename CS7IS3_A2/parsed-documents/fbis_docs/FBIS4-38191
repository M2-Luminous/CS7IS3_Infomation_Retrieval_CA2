During his reception of Muhammad Gulcegun, deputy chairman of the Turkish Social Democratic Populist Party and member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly [title as received], and his delegation, Ramadan added that the governments implementing the U.S. policy are imposing a blockade on their own peoples and subjecting them to suffering due to the deterioration in their economic situation as a result of the continued blockade on Iraq. The vice president touched on Iraqi-Turkish relations and their development under hard circumstances throughout history. He asserted that promoting the relations between the two countries will contribute to improving the economic situation of both neighboring peoples and consolidate regional stability and security. The Turkish party official pointed to the Turkish people's suffering due to the continued blockade on Iraq, as well as the activities carried out by the Turkish parties and organizations which demand the lifting of the blockade imposed on Iraq. He also lauded the Iraqis' steadfastness and their defiance of the blockade. This proves the Iraqis' strength, adherence to their principles, and struggle for sovereignty and progress, he added.
