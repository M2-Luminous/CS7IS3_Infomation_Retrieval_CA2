Local officials said that the autonomous region is to construct another 200 telecom projects this year to help promote local economic growth. Among the 200 projects are two national projects -- the Inner Mongolian section of the Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin optical fiber line and of the Beijing-Hohhot-Yinchuan-Lanzhou optical fiber line -- and a few long distance telephone lines. According to the development plan, 17,470 long distance automatic terminals, three times that of 1993, and another 2,000 long distance telephone lines will be added to the existing long distance network. That will help all counties and banners of the autonomous region to reach the target of long distance direct dialing. In addition, some 300,000 lines of intra-city telephone exchanges will be installed this year and 80 rural telephone automatic exchange systems will be added. Last year, automatic long distance telephone services were installed in 100 counties and banners on the grasslands.
