The nation's legislators approved the tax reform bill sent by the Executive Branch but with substantial modifications. Here we have a report by Eugenia Salazar: [Begin Salazar recording] Heinz Moeller, leader of the Social Christian parliamentary faction, maintained that the Ecuadoran people succeeded in view of the Executive Branch's attempt to increase IVA [value added tax] by 8 percent under the pretext of a drop in the oil prices at the international market. Moeller said that his party headed the struggle against the taxes and rejected the government intentions to increase them. The public backed this position and this prevented the government from insisting on an IVA increase. The Social Christian deputy praised the Executive Branch's political decision to order its deputies to remain in the sessions to permit the required quorum. This decision permitted the approval of the tax reform bill without the 8-percent increase that was initially proposed by the government. [end recording]
