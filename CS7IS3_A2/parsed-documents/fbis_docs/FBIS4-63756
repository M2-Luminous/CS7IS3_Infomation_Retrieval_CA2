The statement, in particular, notes that Zyanon Paznyak, a presidential candidate put forward by the BNF, collected the largest number of supporting signatures among those candidates who did not utilize the state apparatus in collecting them. In the opinion of BNF leaders, this testifies to the fact that Zyanon Paznyak is the most realistic contender for the presidential post among democratically oriented candidates. The BNF calls for the unification of democratic forces during the election campaign, the organizers of the news conference agreed. However, they expressed an apprehension that a likely dispersion of votes among candidates of democratic orientation can lead to the victory of pro-Communist forces. "Therefore, we appeal to all those candidates who regard themselves as democrats and to their supporting teams to consider a possible withdrawal of their candidacies on behalf of the most realistic contender," the statement notes. According to the BNF leadership, such a step can encourage unity and the future victory of Belarusian democratic forces.
