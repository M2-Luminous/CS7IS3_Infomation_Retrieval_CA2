Amid the wave of spring, the regional agricultural and animal husbandry work conference ceremoniously opened in Hohhot on the morning of 18 February. Attending the conference were heads and secretaries general in charge of agricultural and animal husbandry work of various leagues and cities; responsible persons of pertinent departments; and responsible comrades of various agricultural departments and bureaus as well as pertinent commissions, offices, departments, and bureaus, more than 300 persons in all. Bai Enpei, deputy secretary of the regional party committee, presided over the conference. Zhang Tingwu, vice chairman of the region, made a report entitled "Press Package Reform Forward, Make Breakthroughs in Major Aspects, and Create a New Situation in Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and the Economic Work of Rural and Pastoral Areas." In his report, Zhang Tingwu said: This year, major tasks for economic development of the region's rural and pastoral areas are: to reach 21 billion yuan in total output value of agriculture and animal husbandry; to ensure gross grain output at 10 billion kg, or reach 11.5 billion kg; to ensure total number of animals at 56.5 million head, or reach 57 million head, of which, the number of pigs should reach 10 million head; to ensure afforested land at 5 million mu, or reach 5.5 million mu; to ensure total output value of township and town enterprises at 28 billion yuan, or reach 30 billion yuan; and to make the per capita net income of peasants and herdsmen 100 yuan more than last year's figure of 829 yuan. Zhang Tingwu said: This year, the region's agricultural and animal husbandry fronts should concentrate efforts on winning the following six tough battles: The tough battle of deepening reform: On the basis of stabilizing the household output-related contract responsibility system and perfecting the double-tier management system, this year we should lay emphasis on building the collectivized service system by building, as quickly as possible, a multi-tier, multi-form, multi-composition, and multi-function service network, with the village and gacha cooperative economic organizations as the foundation; with township, town, and sumu service organizations as the link, with leading enterprises (corporations) of banners, counties, townships, towns, and sumus as the core, and with the service organizations run by peasants and herdsmen individually or jointly as the supplement. Construction of markets in rural and pastoral areas should be accelerated. Through the government efforts in cultivating markets, we should make markets guide production, orient production to market demands, promote the development of the socialist market economy, and link the scattered small-scale production with the collectivized large market. The tough battle of capital construction: This year, the region plans to newly add 1.25 million mu of irrigated areas, newly add 6,000 small enclosed pastures around water pools, build 20 million mu of grassland, and build 5 million mu of land whose water is conserved. We should energetically build capital construction of farmland, grassland, and pastoral land, with water conservation facilities as the central link, and further enhance the comprehensive agricultural and animal husbandry production capacity. Basic agricultural and animal husbandry projects should be managed, built, and developed in a comprehensive manner by using as reference the experiences gained from the construction and management of industrial projects. This year is the last year of the second-stage comprehensive agricultural development of the region. We must complete the building of development projects in good quality in order to ensure that the region's comprehensive agricultural development will be carried on stage by stage and to constantly win more projects and more investment from the state. The tough battle of optimizing structure: We should grasp the readjustment of the internal structures of agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry; the readjustment of the internal structure of general agriculture, and the readjustment of the production structure of all rural and pastoral areas. The readjustment should be focused on combining agriculture with animal husbandry, drawing animal husbandry into agriculture, drawing grass-growing into animal husbandry, and effecting a simultaneous development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and grass-growing by using advantages to make up each other's deficiencies. This year, the region should grow 8 million mu of grass, sow 1 million mu of forage grass by plane, grow 3 million mu of forage crops, and produce 2 billion kg of silage. This year, the region should raise a total of 15 million pigs, make each peasant or herdsman share one pig on an average, and make the pigs in stock reach 10 million head. The region should breed 200,000 beef cattle and 4 million mutton sheep, of which, 2 million should be lambs. The success in these aspects will contribute to promoting overall development. The tough battle of township and town enterprises: Efforts should be made to push reform to a new height, expand the scale of operation, improve the grade of products, and enhance the level of management. This year, we should comprehensively popularize the shareholding system and the shareholing cooperative system and vigorously develop the nonpublicly owned economy. We should make great efforts to expand the scale of township and town enterprise groups and to develop the products that are high in starting point, apply high science and technology, have high added value, and earn lots of foreign exchange. By strengthening management, we should effect a marked improvement in all targets of enterprise efficiency. This year, we should launch across the region the emulation drive of vying with one another in becoming "100 million-yuan townships and towns," "10 million-yuan villages," and "5 million-yuan enterprises" and should choose, through appraisal, and commend the banners, counties, townships, towns, and enterprises outstanding in developing township and town enterprises. The tough battle of scientific and technological progress: In agriculture, we should implement across the region the project of organizing 10,000 agriculture-oriented scientific and technological cadres and technicians who are peasants or herdsmen, establish 100 centers experimenting with and demonstrating the high-yielding, high-quality, and high-efficient agriculture, give scientific and technological training to 2 million people, and apply applicable and output-increasing technologies on 20 million mu of fields sown with major crops. In animal husbandry, we should improve the breed of 13 million draft and small animals. In forestry, we should expand the biological economic sphere and the ecological economic sphere and popularize the technology of growing grain and cash crops in forests. In water conservation, we should emphatically apply the water-saving irrigation technology. We should adopt the form of "four fixed targets and three linkings" to mobilize the enthusiasm of scientific and technological personnel. The plan of "green certificates" should be carried out throughout the region. The tough battle of supporting the poor by resolving most difficult problems: As of 1992, 600,000 households and 3 million people in the region were still in a poor state. This year is the first year of the state implementation of the "eighth seven-year" plan for supporting the poor by resolving the most difficult problems. The region as a whole should emphatically support 150,000 poor households, of which, 100,000 households should have enough food and clothes. We should persist in the principle of supporting the poor by developing production and managing the poor in a comprehensive way. We should define the major battlefield of the support of the poor. State support should be extended to counties and the region's support should be extended to sumus. We should be determined to change the outlook of the poor through the methods of designating the areas that receive support, supporting the poor by initiating projects, supporting the poor through scientific and technological means, organizing economic coordination in poor areas, transferring cadres to poor areas, and making rich areas help the poor. Zhang Tingwu stressed: The key to winning the above-mentioned six battles lies in further strengthening leadership, changing the style of work, and grasping implementation. The current conference is precisely a mobilization to grasp and promote implementation. He called on leaders at all levels to consciously put agriculture and animal husbandry in the most important position of economic work, concentrate their major energy on "giving guidance, support, protection, and control," actually carry out the policy of protecting agriculture, and strive to yield results by changing government functions and improving the art of leadership. In conclusion, Zhang Tingwu called on all localities to launch the emulation drive of "vying with one another in pioneering undertakings" and to emulate with each other in doing practical work, scoring achievements, and yielding practical results in order to reap new bumper harvests in agriculture and animal husbandry in 1994 and create a new situation in agriculture, animal husbandry, and the economic work of rural and pastoral areas.
