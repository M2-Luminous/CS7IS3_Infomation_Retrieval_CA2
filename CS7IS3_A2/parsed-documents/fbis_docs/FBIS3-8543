In the view of Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, justice minister and deputy prime minister, sponsorship of the police ought to be decisively broken off. [Unidentified correspondent] In the course of a news conference, Minister Cimoszewicz revealed that there had also been a wish to sponsor the prosecutor's office. Fortunately, this did not come about, he added. [Cimoszewicz] "This was unambiguously cut off after the first case. This was never ever repeated." [Correspondent] In the minister's view, the police ought to behave similarly. In accordance with the law of June 1990, the police are financed from the state budget. Today, there are not sufficient legal grounds for them to be sponsored. The principles for the accepting of gifts by the police are regulated by three documents, of which none is law. There is the minister of internal affairs' decree, an instruction by the director of the finance department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and a letter from the main commandant [of the police]. It is not precluded that the issue of sponsorship will be the main thread in the investigation into corruption in the Poznan police. Minister Cimoszewicz was surprised at the decision of the voivodship prosecutor's office in Warsaw, which shortly wishes to interview Dariusz Rossati, the candidate of the Democratic Left Alliance for [the post of] minister of finance. The interview is in association with Rossati's work on the supervisory board of the Foreign Indebtedness Servicing Fund [FOZZ]. [Cimoszewicz] "What the composition of the supervisory board of this fund was has been known for a long time. Why is it only now necessary to determine the address at which Mr. Rossati lives in Geneva? He has been living there for quite some time." [Correspondent] The minister's doubts are also shared by the head of the prosecutors' department. [Waldemar Smardzewski, director of the prosecutors' department of the Ministry of Justice] "In the near future, I will clarify the reasons it has been acknowledged that it is appropriate now to precisely carry through this procedural event, which could have been carried out a long, long time ago. So, why is this raised only now?" [Correspondent] According to the information in the hands of journalists, the capital prosecutor's office today asked the Ministry of Justice whether it is to question Rossati. Such an obligation has been laid upon it by the appeal court, instructing the questioning of all of the members of the FOZZ Supervisory Board. Smardzewski denied that there had ever been a document with such a question.
