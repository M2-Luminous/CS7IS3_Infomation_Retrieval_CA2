FBIS4-21071 "jptdd015__l94032" JPRS-TDD-94-015-L JPRS Narcotics 5 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA EL SALVADOR Police Will Seek `Highest Possible' Compensation for Police Will Seek `Highest Possible' Compensation for Officers Injured in Explosion PA0504194994 San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 5 Apr 94 PA0504194994 San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU Spanish BFN [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] [Text] Jose Maria Monterrey, director of the National Civilian Police [PNC], reported that the U.S. officer who died after detonating a hand grenade that also wounded two members of the PNC, was under the influence of drugs. Monterrey added that the accident, which occurred at the PNC station in the Zacamil neighborhood, occurred after the officer threatened to try and reclaim the confiscated weapons. [Begin recording] [Monterrey] They say that they arrived at the station after arresting the bodyguards of Colonel Rivera for drunken misconduct. They were firing their weapons, I believe, so they were arrested. They were taken to the police station. They said they were U.S. Embassy personnel, so we called the U.S. Embassy, after which the colonel arrived. We turned over the hand grenade and the weapons that had been confiscated from the two detained bodyguards. He then began to handle the grenade. At first they thought it was an accident. That was later ruled out because of the high amount of drugs involved. [Unidentified reporter] The U.S. Embassy report says he thought it was a toy. [Words indistinct] could it be, given the state he was in because of the drugs, that he might have used the grenade to threaten those present? [Monterrey] Apparently he was a little arrogant when he arrived. There was some of that with our people. You must remember that they always try to look down on our people. However, there is no doubt that this was caused by an excessive amount of drugs. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Monterrey] We are going to try and make this the highest amount they have ever paid in compensation. One of the boys is blind, and the other will lose one eye. [Reporter] Are these the only wounded? [Monterrey] Just these two policemen were wounded. Fortunately all the others fled when they saw him playing with the grenade in his condition. [end recording] The PNC director added that they will ask for the highest possible compensation for the wounded policemen. It was reported that Col. Julio Ramon Rivera, who died in the incident, was a security officer at the U.S. Embassy in our country.
