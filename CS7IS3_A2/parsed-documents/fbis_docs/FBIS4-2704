The persistent emphasis on strictness is determined by the characteristics, important responsibility, important role, and important impact of civil aviation. We must fully affirm the remarkable achievements made by civil aviation in recent years. However, civil aviation also has such problems as a serious safety problem, a declining rate of the normal carrying out of scheduled flights, and a poor quality of service. These problems have caused the extremely great concern of the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the broad masses of the people. It is time that these problem be dealt with. Their main causes are poor management, slack discipline, and a sloppy work style. Poor management is equal to no management. Civil aviation work has a direct bearing on the image of the party and the government, on the people's lives and safety, and on the great undertakings of reform, opening up, and economic construction. For this reason, the civil aviation industry must adhere to high standards, set strict demands for itself, and carry out strict, scientific, and modernized management. To persistently attach importance to strictness, we must emphasize centralization and unity and ensure that government decrees are implemented by all concerned. Civil aviation should deepen reform and change the operational mechanisms of its enterprises. In operation and management, it should streamline procedures, delegate powers to lower levels, and invigorate its business. However, as for safety measures, air traffic control, operational standards, and law and discipline enforcement, it must uphold a high degree of centralization and unity and carry out strict management, and it must not let each of its subordinate units go its own way. The more a trade or enterprise is developed and invigorated, the more it needs to improve its management. The State Council has decided to promote the status of the Civil Aviation Administration of China to a ministerial-level organ. The fundamental purpose of doing so is to improve the management of civil aviation. The civil aviation administration should fully understand the profound meaning and great significance of the decision and take it as an opportunity to improve management and exercise government authority. To persistently attach importance to strictness, the leaders should take the lead in being strict and perform actual deeds. The efforts should start right away with the leaders and the leading organs. To be strict with his subordinates, a superior must first be strict with himself. In light of the problems existing in the leadership of the civil aviation industry, the party committee of the Civil Aviation Administration of China has set three demands for the leading cadres at all levels. One is to attach importance to strictness and to oppose the nice-guy mentality. Next is to work hard, perform actual deeds, and oppose formalism. The third is to consider the interest of the whole and oppose selfish departmentalism. Leading cadres at all levels must seriously fulfill the three demands. In the civil aviation industry, strictness should be an important criterion for personnel employment. Anyone who is weak and poor in management and who has no desire to accomplish much is not qualified to be a leader. Anyone who carries out strict and successful management should continue to do so, and those who practice poor management should improve the situation as soon as possible. To persistently attach importance to strictness, it is necessary to establish a strict responsibility system. The leaders, functional departments, and personnel in charge of various businesses in all civil aviation units and departments should carry out the tasks of safety, normal operation, and service. A clear and definite system of responsibility for safety, normal operation, and good service should be established so that each attends to his duties. To persistently attach importance to strictness, we should give wide publicity to the need for strictness. We should make strictness a general practice so that all civil aviation employees fully understand the purpose, significance, and need for being strict and working strictly according to the rules in all departments, businesses, and jobs. Being strict should become the order of the day and all workers and staff members should conscientiously adhere to it. Anyone who upholds strict standards and makes outstanding achievements should be highly commended. Those who works sloppily should be sternly criticized and educated. Law and discipline violators should be harshly punished. In short, strictness should prevail from top to bottom, with each level strictly supervising the next lower level, and a new image for civil aviation should be established.
