This was their seventh trip to hilly areas this year to study their ways to become affluent. Hills in Beijing, which account for 62 percent of the city's area, have a population of 1.5 million, and the 60 relatively poor townships in these hills have a population of 400,000. The Beijing leaders maintained that hilly areas' prosperity is essential for Beijing to achieve a comparatively comfortable life faster, and Beijing must consider hilly areas' construction as an important goal to achieve. So far this year, Chen Xitong and Li Qiyan have visited the hilly Miyun, Yanqing, Changping, Fangshan, Mentougou, Huairou, and Pinggu Counties in Beijing's suburbs. While there, they talked to villagers to familiarize themselves with these counties' agriculture, forestry, breeding business, water conservancy projects, and processing industries; helped the local people solve problems; and discussed with local cadres and people on how to achieve prosperity. Chen Xitong noted in Liubinbao township in Yanqing County and again in Heishanzai township in Changping County that, to expedite construction, authorities in hilly areas must emancipate their minds, relax policies, and promote market-oriented businesses. To expedite development, hilly areas must proceed from practical needs; count primarily on tapping their rich natural resources; and actively produce marketable agricultural, forestry, livestock, and mineral goods. Chen Xitong repeatedly stressed that all trades and professions in Beijing should come to hilly areas to take a look and actively support hilly areas' construction so that people in hilly areas can also lead a comparatively comfortable life, and so that the idea of "exploiting mountain resources and achieving prosperity through the market" can be realized. He said people in Beijing should consider it an honor to support hilly areas and be able to answer the question what they have done in supporting hilly area development. Chen Xitong and Li Qiyan also stressed in Pinggu County that active support should be given to those cadres who have foresight and the courage to start businesses. They said: We must encourage the peasants to count on science and technology and produce market-oriented goods, and to work hard to expand production so that hilly areas will see the prospects for achieving a comparatively comfortable life.
