In his talks with Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Lojze Peterle here this morning, Qian said that China is ready to promote bilateral cooperation in all spheres. Lojze Peterle arrived here Tuesday [31 May] evening on a six-day official visit to China. There is no obstacle to the development of Sino-Slovenian cooperation, Qian said. During Qian's September visit to Slovenia, the two countries signed a number of cooperation agreements and the first session of a Sino-Slovenian Commission on Economy and Trade was held. Slovenia's prime minister is to visit China within the year, which will coincide with the second session of the commission. These are all signs of the gradual deepening of the all-round ties between China and Slovenia, Qian noted. China adopts a positive attitude towards developing economic and trade links with Slovenia, and there existed a good basis and potential for this cooperation in the past, Qian said. To fully tap this potential, the two governments should encourage their enterprises to contact each other more frequently and adopt more ways of cooperation, he said, adding that the sister-city relationship should also be reinforced. He expressed the hope that the contacts between Slovenian businessmen, who are here with the deputy prime minister, and their Chinese counterparts will bear positive results. Peterle said that he was happy to be here, and that his trip would deepen bilateral ties. He agreed with Qian that the two countries should adopt various forms to propel their cooperation to a new high. The visit to China by Slovenia's prime minister later in the year, and the meeting of the Economic and Trade Commission of the two countries would lay a solid basis for further cooperation between the two countries, Peterle said. After the talks, Qian and Peterle, on behalf of their governments, signed an agreement on the mutual exemption of diplomatic and service passport visas. Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo and Slovenian Ambassador to China Ivan Senicar [name as received] were present at the talks and the signing ceremony.
