Last year, Shenzhen spent 186 million yuan (HK$165.2 million), about five per cent of the SEZ's total expenditure, on public security, the judiciary and procuratorate. This figure, a tiny amount compared with the SEZ's budget for infrastructure which stands at 1.3 billion yuan, is already an 87.87 percent increase on 1992. In his report to Shenzhen's anticorruption meeting last week, Mo Huashu, secretary of Shenzhen's Commission for Discipline Inspection urged party and government officials of all levels to place more emphasis on anti-graft work. "In Shenzhen's anti-corruption drive there are aspects which are still far from satisfactory," he said. And in his report to Shenzhen's People's Congress which opened on Tuesday, Mayor Li Youwei underscored the importance of clean government. He said yesterday that the number of government officials and heads of enterprises who had run off with public money had dropped sharply in the wake of the crackdown. More than 21 had been arrested last year alone and the Public Security Bureau had caught a total of 40 in the past two years, he said. About 80 had fled in that time. "It doesn't matter whether they have been on the run a long time. nor how far they have gone. Even if they have gone to countries with which we have no diplomatic relation, we can get them back," Mr Li said with confidence. Among the 40-odd arrested were a former head of the finance and trade department of Shenzhen's Planning Bureau. The money involved in some cases amounted to millions of yuan. Mr Mo said that in the last four months of last year a total of 2,832 complaints of corruption were made an increase of 102 percent over the same period in 1992. Of the 167 cases that had been closed, 67 percent were classed as serious. Authorities were also investigating 52 cases involving senior officials, about five times more than in the previous year, he said.
