[Soares] Yes. We must work towards the creation of a European constitution and true European citizenship. This will help ensure that the people of Europe become aware that they have the ability to influence their own future as Europeans. [FINANCIAL TIMES] Where should the European Union [EU] place its greatest economic and social priorities during the next three or four years? [Soares] The priorities are to advance to economic and monetary union with an effective European Monetary Institute. We should not forget the European social charter. Progress in the economic and political fields must be matched by advances in social affairs. [FINANCIAL TIMES] Is there a danger of a two-speed Europe? [Soares] This is unacceptable. I see Europe as a broad space for solidarity between people, regions and countries. The existing inequalities, aggravated by an unfavourable economic climate, cannot be used as an pretext for creating a two-speed Europe. [FINANCIAL TIMES] Should the EU give priority to deepening integration among the 12 members or to widening it towards East Europe? [Soares] Both policies are equally necessary. There cannot be true broadening without deepening. The EU should adopt policies aimed at eventually admitting the countries of Central and East Europe as full members. [FINANCIAL TIMES] Are you worried that German unification and a shift in the EU's centre of gravity to the east and north could harm Portugal's interests? [Soares] There is an unquestionable possibility of this happening. The EU should take steps to avoid this development. [FINANCIAL TIMES] Will assistance for poorer EU states inevitably have to be cut after the expiry of the 1993-99 package? [Soares] It is important, necessary, and urgent to supply aid to Central and East Europe. But this should not be done at the price of reducing aid to southern European countries, which are full members of the European Union. Aid should continue for as long as inequalities between countries justify it. [FINANCIAL TIMES] Is European monetary union in 1999 still practicable? [Soares] Europe has lately been gripped by pessimism over the potential of the European project. Some voices describe it as utopian. I do not share this opinion. Only by pressing forward towards full European union, with realism and resolution, will we overcome our difficulties.
