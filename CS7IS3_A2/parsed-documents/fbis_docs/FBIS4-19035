One simply could not afford to permit the Serbs to overrun the Muslim enclave and UN "security zone," which is crammed with refugees. However, the question arises why the Serbs were able to soften up the city for two weeks in full view of the United Nations, without the West awakening from its lethargy. And why certain statements played down the danger for the lives of 64,000 encircled people toward the public, while internal UN papers warned against the dangerousness of Serbian attacks. The assumption is obvious that the West would have actually liked to "sacrifice" Gorazde to the Serbs, since eastern Bosnia was recognized as Serbian long ago. An enclave is a source of continuous controversies and cannot be administered. If it had inconspicuously disappeared, there would be one problem less in the abysses of the Balkans. However, in the age of CNN, such cynical calculations cannot be maintained without harming one's own reputation. However, as a result of NATO's latest signs of life, the initiative continues to be on the side of those who want -- literally -- to pacify Bosnia. The Russians have not succeeded in putting their Serbian brothers in their place. The United States is halfheartedly pursuing its concept for Bosnia -- with the main aggressors being left out. And the United Nations -- as a representative of states with different interests -- cannot venture too far. Typical example: The UN argues that the disciplining of the Serbs served to protect blue helmets. Credulous individuals might have believed that the lives of Bosnians had been at issue.
