Even as others notice that Washington is conspicuously out of step with the Asia Pacific region, the Administration maintains the fiction that everyone else is putting the wrong foot forward. An important test of that perception will come next week when President Clinton decides whether to revoke China's "most favoured nation" [MFN] trading status. US singlemindedness on such issues as human rights (China and Burma), trade barriers (Japan), labour standards (Indonesia and the World Trade Organisation) and even Singapore's corporal punishment regime, could have serious implications beyond the Beltway. There is a strong chance the "tough" US stand on such issues will undermine useful initiatives like the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] forum in which its protagonists are members. Place APEC at risk and you threaten the foundations of the entire foreign-trade policy strategy to which the Keating Government is now so strongly attached. Indeed, unless APEC remains a credible centrepiece of regional relationships in the Asia Pacific, Australia will be left facing a dangerous vacuum. Bilateral relationships can never, for a medium-sized power like Australia, substitute for the clout of an effective region-wide body like APEC when it comes to shaping the environment in which business is conducted. Recent events have already shown it is not possible to quarantine from APEC the impact of an aggressive US stand on issues of regional sensitivity. An informal APEC trade ministers meeting in the margins of the GATT finale in Marrakech, Morocco, last month was pervaded by the antagonism generated by US attempts -- ultimately successful -- to get labour standards onto the agenda of the new World Trade Organisation. The developing world, in particular the ASEAN, remains unconvinced by US claims that its position on labour standards is based on a concern for human rights and adequate working conditions. Instead, they see it as undisguised protectionism aimed at cutting the developing countries' comparative advantage of cheap labour. As Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir put to a receptive Beijing audience two weeks ago: "(The) professed concern about workers' welfare is motivated by selfish interest." At the Marrakech meeting, ASEAN showed its discontent. A US offer to host an upcoming APEC trade ministers meeting was rejected in favour of a rendezvous in Indonesia -- on ASEAN turf. Workers' rights is one of a number of sensitive issues where the US has shown an apparent disregard for the views of Asian nations or given a relatively unsophisticated response to any alternative opinion. Relationships with Burma's military regime is another. Again, there are no shades of grey in Washington's foreign policy filter. The US wants Burma isolated while ASEAN is pursuing constructive "engagement". Sanctions threats are also the preferred device to pressure China on human rights and Japan on trade. The face-saving formula announced yesterday by the US and Japan to revive their trade talks retains retaliation as a US response if Japan fails to open its markets to the extent required by Washington. Meanwhile, US protectionism -- in areas as diverse as agriculture, entertainment, and government procurement -- continues unabated. Senior US officials seem to take an almost perverse pride in maintaining that while many countries support US trade and foreign policy goals, few support its methods. And little effort is made to engender more positive views of the US in Asia. From a country where respect for the law is profound, US President Clinton inexplicably cast doubt over the integrity of the Singaporean justice system by implying the recent vandalism confession of Michael Fay may have been coerced. US Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, compounded the President's indiscretion. He said the US would oppose Singapore's hosting of the first World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting next year -- a move widely regarded as retaliation for the caning of a US citizen. But the bruised backside of a US teenager fades by comparison with the possible impact of a withdrawal of China's most favoured nation status. MFN gives the emerging economic giant of North Asia the same access as others to the US market. Its removal would have a devastating impact on China's economy and cause collateral damage throughout the region. The President, and Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, have been strongly counselled against such a move by many outsiders, including Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gareth Evans. Insiders are now also sounding the alarm. According to a recent Washington Post report of a confidential memo from Winston Lord to his boss Warren Christopher, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs warned: "A series of American measures, threatened or employed, risk corroding our positive image in the region, giving ammunition to those charging we are an international nanny, if not a bully." "Without proper course adjustments, we could subvert our influence and interests," Lord said. The Lord warning -- which cited Evans' criticism -- is being interpreted in some quarters as reflecting a greater awareness and recognition of regional sensitivities. A wider review of US policy might even be under way. Or Washington may simply have recognised it needs China's support, or at least acquiescence, in any attempt to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions. President Clinton's June 3 decision on China's trade status will show whether Washington has started to develop the policy dexterity required for a constructive relationship with the region.
