State Secretary Andras Kelemen said the November 1992 accord could set an example for similar deals with other countries. Kelemen said ethnic Hungarians and Italians in Slovenia can use their native language in education and administration, and take part in law-making by means of positive discrimination. The Slovenian Constitution allows native minorities to use their mother tongue in official contacts at their places of residence. Under today's agreement, national minorities can freely keep in touch with the parent country, study in their native tongue at all levels of education, found learning groups, set up native-language information networks, and make business links abroad. Hungary has more than 5,000 ethnic Slovenian citizens.
