Yun Ki-chong quoted the great leader President Kim Il-song as saying: "Last year, while achieving one victory after another under the party's leadership in the political and military confrontation with the enemy, our people glorified the final year of the Third Seven-Year Plan by displaying great revolutionary enthusiasm and accelerating the construction of the socialist economy." According to the report, the state budget was successfully performed last year with a great upswing in socialist economic construction. The total revenue of the state budget last year was 40,571,200,000 won, or 100.3 percent of the plan and 2.6 percent up on the previous year, and the total expenditure of the state budget was 40,242,970,000 won, or 99.5 percent of the plan and 2.4 percent up on the previous year. As a result, the state budget last year was successfully performed, leaving a financial reserve of 328,230,000 won after fully meeting the increasing financial demands of various sectors of socialist construction. During the Third Seven-Year plan, the state budgetary revenue of the DPRK Government increased at the rate of 5.2 percent on a yearly average, augmenting the total scale of the budgetary revenue 40 percent. Thus, the state budget in Korea has greatly contributed to increasing the potential of the socialist independent economy, developing socialist national culture, promoting the material and cultural welfare of the people and bringing into full play the advantages of Korean-style socialism. This eloquently shows the great advantages and solidity of the state budget of Korea developing in a planned way in reliance on the independent financial basis and the validity of the financial policy of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. Last year, the DPRK Government increased the appropriations for the national economy 2.5 percent as against the previous year and markedly boosted the investments in the preferential sectors of the national economy, the light industry and agriculture. The investments in the coal industry, the mining industry, the power industry and the metal industry rose 3.5 percent compared with the previous year. The coal production capacity has grown remarkably with the construction projects of new coal mines and new pits including the Hwaphong coal mine of the Anju District coal mining complex and the expansion projects of the existing pits promoted and completed last year. The Komdok general mining enterprise and other big promising mines were expanded, with the result that the output of the concentrates of lead and zinc and other valuable ores augmented. The construction of the Kumgangsan and Yongwon power stations and other large-scale hydraulic power stations and thermal power stations was promoted vigorously. The metal plants were consolidated as self-reliant and modern metallurgical bases. Last year the DPRK Government allotted to the light industry vast amount of fund 4 percent greater than the previous year. As a result, great innovations were effected in the production of daily necessities in urgent need for the improvement of the people's living standard. The capacity expansion project of the Kusong textile mill and the construction projects of the March 4 factory, the Nanam garment factory and other modern textile and garment factories, shoe-making factories and food processing factories were completed and the equipment of the light industrial factories was streamlined energetically. The large appropriations for rail transport last year was 3 percent up on the previous year. Heavy rails were introduced and railway lines were modernised at an accelerated pace, and the electrification of various railway sections and the laying of new rails were completed, with the result that the rail transport capacity grew considerably. Last year the DPRK Government increased the investment in agriculture 2.8 percent as against the previous year. President Kim Il-song in his historic letter to the national agricultural conference held on the lapse of 30 years since the publication of "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country" reviewed the great achievements made by our party and people in the efforts to implement the rural theses. He declared that with the realization of irrigation, electrification and mechanization of agriculture, and with an extensive application of chemicals in farming in Korea, the historic task of the rural technical revolution set forth in the socialist rural theses has been carried out in the main. This is an epoch-making change in the countryside of Korea and the most brilliant victory in the efforts to implement the rural theses. The material and technical foundations of agriculture were strengthened and the chuche method of farming strictly applied, with the result that bumper crops were reaped last year in spite of unfavourable weather. Last year, the DPRK Government channelled funds 1.5 percent greater than the previous year into housing construction and the management of towns and land. The state increased the appropriations for scientific and technological development 7 percent and those for education 3.5 percent last year as against the previous year. More than 20 universities and colleges including universities of technology, agriculture and physical education made their appearance last year. The appropriations for various popular measures to further promote the wellbeing of the people was increased in the last year's state budget, granting them great additional benefits at the expense of the state. In our country where the tax system was totally abolished 20 years ago, the factory and office employees are supplied with food almost free of charge at the expense of the state, the universal free education and medical care are in force and factory and office workers and peasants are given dwelling houses free of charge. Billions of won were disbursed for these policies last year, too. During the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan, the WPK and the DPRK Government invariably took various communistic, popular measures for the people, not decreasing the huge financial burden of the state even under the rapidly changing situation. In this period, epochal measures were taken to raise the salaries of the factory and office workers and technicians 43.4 percent on an average, largely increase the pensions of those who benefit by social security and the scholarship of students of schools at all levels and raise the purchase price of some farm products including rice and maize so that the peasants might earn a larger income share. Last year, the DPRK Government directed 11.5 percent of the total expenditure of the state budget to national defence to firmly defend the security of the socialist motherland and the gains of the revolution. Today our military potential has become mighty enough to drive back any provocation and surprise attack of the enemy. Referring to the state budget for 1994, the reporter said: This year's state budget has been made according to the new revolutionary economic strategy shaped by the WPK in such a manner as to concentrate the nation's financial resources on implementing the agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first policies and giving priority to the preferential sectors of the national economy and further increase the might of the country's socialist independent economy. In the state budget the total revenue and the total expenditure are equally set at 41,525,190,000 won, the former 2.4 percent up and the latter 3.2 percent up on last year. This year, the DPRK Government will increase appropriations for the national economy 3.2 percent as against last year, of which a large amount of the state fund will be directed preferentially to developing agriculture, light industry and foreign trade. The state is expected to increase the investment in agriculture 6 percent and that in light industry 5.4 percent above last year. The state investment in the expansion and consolidation of the export goods production bases will go up 4.1 percent above last year. This year's state budget envisages that the investment in coal and power industries and railway transport will be increased 3 percent and that in metal industry 26 percent as compared with last year. The DPRK Government will increase the appropriations for the socialist cultural policies at 2.8 percent, those for scientific development 4 percent and education 2 percent above last year. This year, the government will increase the appropriations for the popular measures so that the people may enjoy greater state benefits in the form of free education and medical care, the upbringing and education of children at the expense of the state, social insurance and social security, etc. This year, too, it will send a large amount of educational aid funds and stipends to Korean children in Japan. It will allocate 11.6 percent of the total expenditure of the state budget to national defence to consolidate the defence capacity of the nation in face of the enemy's war provocation moves. The reporter said this year's state budget submitted for deliberation at the SPA was a chuche-based, defendable budget that definitely guarantees the fulfilment of the vast tasks of the economic construction set by the party with domestic financial resources in reliance on the solid foundations of the socialist independent economy. She also said it was a popular and revolutionary budget that will help improve the material and cultural living standard of the people, increase the might of the country and bring the advantages of Korean-style socialism into full play.
