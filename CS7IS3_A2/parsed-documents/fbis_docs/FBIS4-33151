He was unanimously appointed by the 28 candidates. The party's vice presidential candidate is Rio de Janeiro-born Rear Admiral Roberto Gama e Silva, who was president of the Low Amazonas Studies Group [Grupo de Estudos do Baixo Amazonas -- Gebam] during Joao Figueiredo's administration. The main banner of PRONA's program, which is still being drafted, is a strong government. Carneiro believes that only by intervening in the macroeconomic structure can the government ensure high-quality public schools and health programs. With his rights to 60 seconds of free television propaganda time -- three times longer than what he had in the last elections -- Carneiro plans to attract "two-thirds of the voters who still are undecided." In the 1989 election, PRONA had 360,000 votes. This is equivalent to 0.5 percent of the total number of votes. In this year's elections, the party has its position in the presidential race ensured by the representation of Deputy Regina Gordilho (Rio de Janeiro) in Congress and has gubernatorial candidates in at least 15 states. Carneiro said: "We are not joking. Our party is the only serious thing that exists in the country nowadays."
