The man who woke this sleeping beauty and led it, at a hardly bearable speed, away from its Middle Ages is an internationally renowned cardiologist who was for many years the personal physician to the ill-reputed dictator Enver Hoxha. I found him angry with the latest announcement of the Greek Government, which stated that Albania had not declared the Orthodox Easter a national religious holiday. President Berisha explained that it was with the intention of dispelling any doubts about a religion being discriminated against that he personally attended the central Easter celebrations, along with the patriarch of the autocephalous Albanian Orthodox Church, Anastos Janullatos, who is of Greek nationality. I let him talk about the incomprehensible behavior of the once friendly southern Greek neighbor, about the recent murder of two Albanian border patrolmen, and about hundreds of thousands of Albanian workers being expelled from Greece because of the alleged denial of minority rights to the Greeks in Albania. He gave me only a short smile after I told him that all his country needed after the programmed destruction of public institutions, factories, and schools that was conducted by the old regime just before the first free elections, were neighbors competing at being hostile. President Berisha is impressively modest: He is still living in a two-room apartment with his wife and two children. Chief Support -- the West [Brljevic] You recently received General Robert Oaks, the U.S. Air Force commander. What did you discuss? [Berisha] We discussed the preparations and military cooperation in case the war in the Balkans escalates soon and spreads toward the south. Mr. Oaks said he that agreed the spreading of the conflict to Kosovo was possible and probable. [Brljevic] Albania used to rely on the West. Are you not afraid it will betray you again? [Berisha] We have received firm guarantees that this will not happen. We have had enough time to prepare the defense of the country. It was obvious that if no one was decisive enough to stop Milosevic, who now needs the war in order to survive, then there would be a great war on the entire Balkans. I cannot tell you state secrets, but you can believe that the West will not leave us in the lurch! [Brljevic] Have you not found the fate of the protected areas in Bosnia instructive enough? [Berisha] We should wait. The Serbs have been given ultimatums in both Sarajevo and in Gorazde. It is very important to avoid rash moves that some of the insane bloodthirsty Serb generals are counting on to provoke confrontation of the U.S. and Russian forces and thus definitely make it into the history books. [Brljevic] Was the recent murder of the two Albanian border patrolmen programmed in the same context, to make the tense situation in this part of the world even worse? [Berisha] After the Serbian aggressor, the one who had encouraged it appeared. The whole of Greece is in a nationalist fever. The people of the Balkans have always been easy to get out in the streets, but the price could be very high this time. At a time when it is crucial that passions subside and possible conflicts and escalations be prevented, the Greeks are doing just the opposite. They have expelled hundreds of thousands of our workers. It is true that many of them who are there are not registered, and we are grateful that they are helping us overcome our difficulties that way too, but it is completely unacceptable to use that fact as a factor of political pressure on our country. I want us to improve our relations, to solve the issue of refugees, economic emigrants, and members of the Greek minority in a humane way. I particularly want their human and ethnic rights to be protected, but it is all in vain, because the Greek authorities manipulate their minority and at one moment they will accept our workers, while at the next they expel them in a very uncivilized way. The latest incident has forced us to put the responsibility on the Greek Government because the commandos arrived from their territory and returned there. We have demanded that they be identified. Chauvinists in Athens [Brljevic] How did they reply? [Berisha] That it was a contradiction. Allegedly we, at the same time, accused them of a crime, and asked them to identify terrorists. For heaven's sake, each government is responsible for the crime that the terrorists who arrive from its territory and return to it commit. We did not say they committed it; we are only asking them to identify the perpetrators. Although they have denied it, we cannot rule out the possibility that they organized it. The Greek Government did not condescend to show signs of regret or express condolences even several days after the crime. If it had not been for the international public, they would not have even issued the announcement on the contradiction. We are aware that there are many people in Greece who would like relations to be strained, but we do not wish to contribute to that. [Brljevic] Is that possible? One can see from the example of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] that it will be difficult. [Berisha] Greek politics seems to be one big outrage. The first such outrage was the underhand alliance with Serbia. Moreover, a very hostile policy is being conducted toward the European Union, of which Greece is a member and which it will continue to preside over for a while. Regardless of that, they keep saying that Europe is against Greece, although Greece is the nursery of civilization. At the same time, Greece is probably the only country in the world in which the church has not been separated from the state. [Brljevic] How autocephalous is the Albanian Orthodox church, considering the fact that one fourth of the Albanians are Orthodox? [Berisha] We insist that the Albanian Orthodox be autocephalous. We did not oppose the Patriarchate of Constantinople appointing Janullatos, a Greek, as patriarch, because we do not want to meddle in the affairs of any religion. The Greek authorities have recently demanded that I appoint Greek ministers in the southern Albanian provinces, but I answered that I had no intention of doing so. Namely, the church has a hierarchy that has to be respected. I told them I was very surprised by this demand of a government that is supposed to be a democratic one. [Brljevic] Did you communicate with the Greek authorities directly? [Berisha] During our first meeting, I asked them openly about the so-called chauvinist circles. They said that they could not do anything about it, that each country has its own chauvinist circles. I told them that it was not right that everyone should think the same and that I should see them all in the same chauvinist circle. [Brljevic] Do you think that this nationalism is uncontrolled or that it is a product of a clever manipulation of national feelings, an exponent of foreign, Serb, interests, and, through them, Russian ones? [Berisha] Greece is sailing, and constantly swaying, between the East and the West, between these two tendencies. They are dreaming about a Great Hellas with the Aegean capital at Constantinople. They have got into the same nationalist fever as the Serbs. I thought that both have paid a high enough price for their blind nationalisms once in this century, but I was wrong. Just look at the present-day Greece, talking about itself as the nursery of civilization. It is to a much greater extent Byzantine than it complies with the principles of modern civilization. They, like their Orthodox brothers Serbs, are much better at practicing Byzantine deviousness. The Fear and Lies of the East [Brljevic] The Koran has been printed in Egypt in the Albanian language. The introduction says that after the fall of Communism a new plague, Christianity, hangs over Albania. Do you not have the impression that nobody will leave you alone? [Berisha] I agree with you. We are trying to act in accordance with the principles of tolerance among the members of all the three religions that have always been strong on the Albanian territories. This is the reason this Koran, printed in Egypt, has been the only book to be banned since I became president. Perhaps it would be better to tear out the page, but we decided to ban it by way of warning all those who could attempt to do something similar. At any rate, the above-mentioned sentence printed in the Koran opposes its teaching, which does not allow favoring any religion. [Brljevic] Is the impression that, despite your pro-Western orientation, the Islamic countries have been investing more in Albania, wrong? [Berisha] Only partly. Europe is post-communist. After the Iron Curtain came down, the duality on the continent was revealed. The closeness of the Yugoslav conflict has also been harmful to our economic development. Many Westerners have promised to invest their capital once the war is over, and as long as it seems that a great war is looming over the Balkans, there is no chance of a stronger breakthrough of foreign capital. Although we have opened our foreign policies toward the world completely, they are still reserved about us because we used to be so isolated. The greatest progress we have achieved is with Italy, and we expect significant U.S. aid and the aid of other, not only military, but also economic superpowers. Croatia is surely one of our desired partners. The neighboring Macedonia could also find a solution for the relations with the Albanian ethnic community and become an even more important economic partner for us. [Brljevic] The people in all the post-communist countries trust the United States more than Europe. Since this is also the case with your country, how do you explain it? [Berisha] All the newly-founded countries consider the United States to be the main pillar of Western civilization. The pro-U.S. atmosphere in Albania, including my own disposition, does not in any way collide with the pro-European orientation. In recent history, Europe would get involved in wars as soon as the United States would take a distance, as soon as it would stop functioning as the pillar of Western civilization. The Westerners and Easterners have different fates, different souls. One should always bear in mind that the Easterners lived under dictatorships, which, together, made up an empire founded on fear and lies. The people in this empire aspired toward truth, the only light in their darkness. That is why truth is their weak spot. Europe faced the fall of the Iron Curtain unprepared. The entire West is now faced with the crisis of civilization, the main expression of which is the war in Bosnia. It clearly shows that the entire civilization, the modern world, suffers from collective amnesia. Double standards are used everywhere. We are all responsible for the evil that is happening before our eyes, primarily Europe, in which the public opinion has never been more tolerant of the horrors that are happening in it, as they are now tolerant of the Bosnian horrors. No one can deny us the right to self-defense, as has been done with the Muslims in Bosnia after the entire world had found itself surprised with the Serb aggression. If the democratic world order does not wake up in Bosnia, it could easily be murdered in its selfish sleep. I have said this to every Western politician I have had the chance to talk to. [Brljevic] The West is still trying to make the Serbs come to their senses through negotiations. In your opinion, how long can this "Brusseling" and "Genevesing" last? [Berisha] The international community must eventually take specific measures, as sanctions, threats, and ultimatums are not enough. Serbia, encouraged by the world's reluctance, can now only understand the language of force, the speech of weapons. It is still not too late for a military intervention. The Serbs must pay for what they have done, they must bear the consequences. [Brljevic] Mr. Berisha, does the fact that they have only been rewarded by the international community, which has agreed to all the new conquests, not discourage you? [Berisha] Double standards can be applied to almost everything in this war. Plans, peace negotiations, and Security Council resolutions are hardly more than alibis for passivity. However, it is high time the world realized that any further hesitation will lead to a great war on the Balkans. It is not difficult to foresee what can follow. [Brljevic] The Serbian repression in Kosovo is becoming more intense by the day. Is that not a case of "ethnic cleansing" without war? [Berisha] Ethnic cleansing has been present in Kosovo for a long time. The Serbian president has been trying to provoke a war against the unarmed people in every possible way. Perhaps the Greeks are provoking us with the same motives. Dialogue With Skopje [Brljevic] What will you do if war breaks out in Kosovo? [Berisha] We will not hesitate to help our brothers, you can rely on that. [Brljevic] Will Albania in that case declare war on Serbia alone? [Berisha] If there is a massacre in Kosovo, I am sure that a NATO military intervention will be inevitable. The picture of hundreds of thousands of people of Kosovo, our brothers, fleeing to Macedonia before a massacre, means the explosion of Macedonia. The next picture is giving a hand to the Albanian brothers by Albania and Macedonia -- a new Balkan war. [Brljevic] How have your relations with Macedonian president Gligorov been since the Albanian minority was accused of conspiracy and an attempt at creating Illyria? [Berisha] Our overall relations are good, and we are interested in the stability of Macedonia. There have been some Byzantine tricks; the ones we remember especially well are the ones organized three years ago. [Brljevic] Albania has offered Macedonia access to the sea, is that right? [Berisha] We are glad we can help them. President Gligorov has been trying to solve the difficulties in his country, torn between Serbia and Greece, and sometimes he is suprisingly good at it. Our joint interest is to create the atmosphere of integration in the entire region, which has been falling apart at the seams. The greatest enemy of the Balkans is after all its allegedly greatest stability factor, the so-called Yugoslav National Army. Its monstrous potential must be destroyed. The United States has drawn the red line at Kosovo. President Bush did it first, and President Clinton underlined it. Milosevic's Serbia would be a factor of permanent instability on the Balkans, a fact which has been taken very seriously in the United States. Ten percent of the territory cannot dominate the entire region. [Brljevic] What are the indications of Milosevic's alleged intention to spread the war on Kosovo? [Berisha] Although he is pretending he would like peace, Milosevic needs the war to stay in power. He has been promising the Serbs peace for a long time, but the war is going on, and it has become a way of life, a hypostatized Serb mentality. When the Bosnian Serbs achieve their aims, which is evidently only a question of time, Milosevic will need another conflict. While the United Nations is protecting the occupied parts of Croatia, they are cementing what has been conquered, and the danger of the war spreading to the south after all is therefore much greater. [Brljevic] Meanwhile, Albania and Macedonia are competing to acquire prophylaxis against Serb fascism, buying peace from Serbia with oil? [Berisha] These are only rumors. We are abiding strictly by the embargo, since to support Serbia in its sick intentions in this dirty war would be very stupid, dishonorable, and dangerous. The Recognized Borders [Brljevic] Is the number of Albanian soldiers a secret? What weapons do you have? [Berisha] We have 35,000 soldiers. The outmoded Russian and Chinese weapons have been preserved well; many Western experts were surprised by how well preserved they are. Naturally, we need new military technology, especially modern anti-aircraft defense. We have warships, air forces, and heavy weapons. The air forces are outmoded, but there is quite a lot of equipment. We would like to reach European military standards. We have reduced the term of compulsory military service. In agreement with NATO we have carried out reforms in the army, which their experts say are the most radical of all the reforms in the former Communist countries. We have conducted an integral reconstruction of our command staff in all the army corps. We have democratized all the structures, which has significantly changed the mentality of our officers. We have sent all those above 48 years of age into retirement. However, it is not a secret that in case there is a war we will be counting on NATO and the United States. Albania has already joined the preparations for the event a military intervention takes place earlier. [Brljevic] Could a possible intervention against Serbia solve the problem of Kosovo? [Berisha] No one can deny the Albanians of Kosovo the right to self-determination. Serbia has violated the Yugoslav constitution by denying Kosovo its autonomy, which is where everything started. Up until then Kosovo was a constituent element of the federation, two presidents of which were from Kosovo. A military intervention would not solve the entire problem, but it would certainly start the process of seeking a democratic solution. [Brljevic] Does that imply a Greater Albania? [Berisha] There will be no changing of borders by force! We have recognized the borders of the former Yugoslav republics, and all we are asking is some democratic space for the members of our nation, wherever they may be. We insist on the right of a nation to make its own decisions about its future. In a democratic atmosphere there is no need to "raise" borders.
