"It's absolutely clear that if the government's affairs are not going well, the prime minister himself would resign. A political government coalition is strong only if it finds a new suitable person from among its members for the prime minister's office," Raidal said. The parliament faction of the governing coalition's senior party, Pro Patria, at a meeting today voted in favor of a proposal by Prime Minister Mart Laar to dismiss Defense Minister Indrek Kannik. Laar has said that Kannik's activity fails to fall in line with the government's majority. Kannik at a meeting of the Cabinet later in the day is expected to propose the resignation of Laar's Cabinet as a whole. Kannik received considerable support for his proposal at a meeting of the Pro Patria party council today. Raidal, and independent MP, called the prime minister's move to dismiss Kannik "unethical." He predicted that Laar will have to leave his office as prime minister at least by September. "Even if today brings no solution for the issue, it will happen in the near future," Raidal said.
