Patsatsia was received by Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and Premier Grant Bagratyan behind closed doors. Although the contents of the talks were not made public, they apparently dealt with the problems of transporting Armenia-bound goods via Georgian territory. Patsatia refused to sign an agreement proposed by Yerevan according to which Georgia should bear more responsibility in case natural gas supplies were cut off or limited, the source said. Armenia receives natural gas through a pipeline passing across Georgia which has several times been exploded. Also disturbing for Armenia is that cargo trains with wheat and other goods destined for Armenia come from Georgia with delay or are plundered while passing through its territory.
