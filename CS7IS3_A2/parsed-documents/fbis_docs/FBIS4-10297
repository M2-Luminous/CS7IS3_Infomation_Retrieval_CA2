Defense Minister [Rafael Pardo] sent a letter to the attorney general expressing his disagreement with the decision. Defense Minister Pardo established his ministry's position on the dismissal of Gen. Arias Cabrales. He said he will obey the order but disagrees with it. Why? First, he said that Gen. Arias Cabrales only fulfilled a legal duty and carried out a legitimate order from his superiors. Pardo insists that the top commanders were fully aware of the operation and could have stopped it. Second, says Pardo, Gen. Arias Cabrales' responsibility in the case is not entirely clear because the criminal investigation has not been concluded that an inquiry ordered by the prosecutor appointed by the Attorney General's Office is still pending. The "National Newscast" has learned that the purpose of this inquiry is to find out who gave Gen. Arias Cabrales his orders, who was in the chain of command, and who planned the attack on the bathroom where several hostages died.
