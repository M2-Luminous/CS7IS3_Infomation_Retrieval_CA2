As the ANS-PRESS agency was told by the press service of the foreign policy department of the Republic, in the letter Hasan Hasanov stresses that such an appeal has been necessitated by numerous declarations by the leaders of Armenia to the effect that their republic has nothing to do with the Armenian-Azeri conflict. In conjunction with this, the minister of foreign affairs of Azerbaijan refers to certain facts that testify to the direct participation of official Yerevan in the armed aggression against the Republic of Azerbaijan. In his letter the head of the diplomatic department of the republic gives a chronology of combat actions in the zone of the conflict, the response to them on the part of international organizations, and facts testifying to the direct participation of Armenia in the aggression. "The war is being fought on the territory of Azerbaijan by the armed forces of Armenia with the use of the separatist forces of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian side is using in combat actions heavy materiel covered by the CFE Treaty, under which the materiel should be located on the territory of Armenia," says the letter. According to the assertions of the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan, the facts given indicate that Armenia has acted from the very beginning as the originator, organizer, and key participant in the armed aggression against the sovereign state of Azerbaijan.
