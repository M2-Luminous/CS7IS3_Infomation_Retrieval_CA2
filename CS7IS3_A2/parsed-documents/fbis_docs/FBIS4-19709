Gorazde fell in the worst possible way, with a tragic admission of importance [as published] by the United Nations and the United States, and a victory for the Serbs which is not only strategic but also psychological. The American public saw no roads spattered with blood, did not hear the heart-rending cries of maimed children, and felt no compassion for the civilians prey to despair, as in Sarajevo. The White House was spared the embarrassment of having to respond in some way to yet another wave of denouncements and an angry appeal to "do something." A group of Americans has accused Clinton of having declared "neutrality in the presence of another massacre." For their part, television news programs reported the fall of Gorazde and the conclusions being drawn from the Serbs' display of military and political might -- first and foremost, the fact that the United Nations cannot do anything in Bosnia without the Serbs' cooperation. In the absence of another cry of pain from the vast mass of Americans, the Clinton administration can now devote itself to salvaging what little there is still to salvage in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Indeed, the choice between capitulation and a more intensive bombardment campaign now seems to have disappeared. Beset, as he is, by domestic problems and by the Whitewater affair, the Democratic President cannot take the risk of a strategy of further limited and therefore ineffective interventions, which would open up a new front of broad disagreement within the United States. Indeed, Clinton and his advisers are particularly worried about a strong current of rebellion on the part of those who cannot accept Butrus-Ghali's acting on behalf of the United States. In fact it was the administration itself that gave this impression when it defended the attacks on the Serb positions as a measure designed to protect UN personnel. In fact the objective of the bombardments was to halt the offensive of the Serbs, who are determined to achieve their ends by means of brute force and ethnic cleansing. But Clinton did not have the courage to say so openly. If America's strategy had ever contemplated the possibility of intervention, Washington should have prepared some time ago to send a contingent to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Such a move now would condemn the Clinton administration. For his part, Butrus-Ghali reached the conclusion some time ago that without a leading U.S. role, the UN operations in the former Yugoslavia will be very inconclusive.
