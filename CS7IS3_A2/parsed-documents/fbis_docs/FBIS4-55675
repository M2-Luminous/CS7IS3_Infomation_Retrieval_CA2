[Zubak] I think that the issues that we discussed in Vienna were in fact the most difficult ones, and the most testing ones for the implementation of the Washington Agreement, that is, for the implementation of the Federation Constitution. This is of utmost significance since we have now overcome the most difficult problems. [Hodzic] You were here in Geneva for the meeting of the contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina. How would you comment on their joint statement? [Zubak] That communique issued by the European Union, that is, [words indistinct] and the United States, is completely in line with what we agreed on. However, it is questionable in those parts where it refers to possible territory for the Federation after the demarcation, that is, if the [word indistinct] accept to join it. As far as I personally am concerned, I think that the Federation has to be a geopolitical whole, to be tenable, that is, that it can function as a state community. It has to have communications and road connections, it has to be economically strong enough to provide security for its citizens, and a standard of living that is normal, that is, a standard of living that is equal to the European one. [Hodzic] In your view, what are the next top priority tasks [words indistinct] in order to implement the Federation Constitution and the Vienna Agreement on the ground? [Zubak] You see, I have maintained [pauses] I am one of those who is against deadlines of six months for the implementation of the Constitution since I believe that this is unrealistic. I still believe that [word indistinct] the cease- fire holds, and then we can [words indistinct] for the Federation. Anything hasty or ill-prepared [words indistinct] could possibly cause incidents [words indistinct]. That is why I believe that we should -- as agreed in Vienna -- first adopt [word indistinct] at the Constitutional Assembly, then explain to the people the advantages of the new political and territorial demarcation, and then go into further implementation of the Vienna Agreement. [Hodzic] Do you think there will be problems on the ground in implementing the Vienna Agreement? [Zubak] Well, you see, there is a need to talk to the people, give them information, provide them with explanations [words indistinct] the Constitution, and everything that we have agreed on. Once the people are told, I do not believe that there will be any problems with the implementation, either with the Bosniak people or the Croatian people. [Hodzic] Thank you very much.
