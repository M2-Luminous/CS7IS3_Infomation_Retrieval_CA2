The delegation met with the media on 20 May. Rothschild Francois reports live: [Francois] Good Afternoon! The visit of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights delegation, which came to investigate the human rights situation in Haiti, has concluded. The members of the delegation pointed out that the situation is grave. They said they were able to meet with many people who were victims of human rights violations in Haiti. They also recorded cases of summary executions, abduction, and arbitrary arrests, mostly within the sector of the population favoring the return of President Aristide to Haiti. The OAS delegation stressed that according to the testimonies they collected, the responsibility for those human rights violations falls entirely on the military, armed civilians as well as members of FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti]. The delegation also denounced the many cases of rape reported, especially by women whose husbands or relatives are supporters of President Aristide, especially in the slum areas of Port-au-Prince. For members of this delegation, these violations fall within the scope of crimes against humanity. [passage omitted] It should be noted that during this news conference, members of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights recommended an increase in the number of civilian mission observers in Haiti. The commission believes that the mission is doing a good job so far. It should also be noted that the delegation solicited a meeting with the military heads, including the head of the Army and of the Port-au-Prince police, neither of whom responded, and the delegation is due to leave Port-au-Prince in a few hours. The delegation promises to make a detailed report, within the framework of the situation of human rights in Haiti, to the OAS General Assembly, due to be held in Brazil next month. Further details will be provided in our next broadcast regarding this detailed report by members of the delegation of the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights, which stayed for a week in Port-au-Prince, having come to investigate the situation of human rights in Haiti. According to statements to the press prior to their departure, the delegation considers this situation is worsening each day.
