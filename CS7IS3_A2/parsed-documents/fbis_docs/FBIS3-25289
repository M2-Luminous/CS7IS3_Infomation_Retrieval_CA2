The latest postponement reschedules the election from March 27 to August 28. The vote was initially set to go ahead on December 19 last year. The postponement could feed political tension which exploded last December following the contested election victory of President Omar Bongo. A massive security clampdown, state of emergency and curfew was the government's response to violence which followed Bongo's election victory. Opposition parties, grouped in the Convention of Forces for Change (CFC), claimed their candidate, Father Paul Mba Abessole, won the December 5 vote. Opposition parties immediately said they would boycott the local elections in the aftermath of the presidential vote. Since then the CFC has been silent on its intentions. The post election curfew and state of emergency were lifted Saturday. However, they would be reimposed if "agitators tried to sow trouble," Gabon's Defence Minister Martin-Fidele Magnaga said. Gabon has been trying introduce computerised election rolls to avoid the confusion and claims of election rigging that surrounded the presidential vote.
