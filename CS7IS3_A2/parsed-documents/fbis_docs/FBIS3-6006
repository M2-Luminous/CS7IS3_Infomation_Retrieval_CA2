Today, the Japan Mobile Communications Corporation [known as IDO] and Motorola reached agreement on the matter. Under the agreement, IDO will transfer part of the frequencies assigned to NTT [Nippon Telegraph & Telephone]-type mobile phone service to the Motorola-type mobile phone service, with the two mobile phone services sharing the assigned frequencies half-and-half, and IDO working toward wider use of the Motorola-type mobile phone service by increasing the number of ground radio stations for the Motorola-type mobile phone service to 159 by the end of 1955. In connection with the issue of opening the Japanese mobile phone market, in mid-February the U.S. Government made clear that it would take steps for imposing sanctions on Japan. Next week, Japan and the United States will start governmental negotiations. A Japanese Government official said that with the agreement reached between IDO and Motorola, the possibility has grown that the U.S. Government will not slap sanctions on Japan.
