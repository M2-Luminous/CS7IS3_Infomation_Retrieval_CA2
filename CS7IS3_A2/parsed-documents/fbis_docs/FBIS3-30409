At the airport of the war-ravaged Sarajevo, the two prime ministers were greeted by the commander of the United Nations Protection Forces, Lieutenant General Michael (Rose). PTV correspondent Qamar Muhiuddin reports from Sarajevo that the Bosnian leaders could not reach the airport to receive the two leaders as the area around the airport is under Serbian control. From the airport, the two prime ministers of the Muslim world drove straight to the presidential palace where Ms. Benazir Bhutto and Madam Tansu Ciller were welcomed by the Bosnian prime minister Haris Silajdzic. Later, the two prime ministers called on President Alija Izetbegovic who briefed them on the situation in his country subjected to wanton and dastardly Serbian aggression. The two prime ministers expressed solidarity with President Alija Izetbegovic and the people of the republic who have been victims of genocidal aggression and ethnic cleansing. The Bosnian president expressed gratitude on his behalf and on the people of Bosnia for having demonstrated the unprecedented gesture of solidarity with them in their hour of trial and tribulation. Our correspondent understands that during the talks it was agreed that the world community must take effective measures to stop Serbian aggression and the United Nations resolution on Bosnia must be implemented. The need for immediate lifting of arms embargo was also emphasized. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto also informed the Bosnian president that a contingent of the Pakistan Army is ready to join the United Nations Protection Force in the war-ravaged Bosnia-Herzegovina. During their short stay, the two prime ministers also visited Kosevo Hospital in Sarajevo to sympathize with the victims of Serbian aggression. During their hour-long visit, Ms. Benazir Bhutto and Madam Tansu Ciller went round various wards of the hospital. The two prime ministers were visibly moved to see the innocent people which included old, young and children injured and maimed in the holocaust unleashed by marauding Serbians. Our correspondent says Kosevo Hospital has also been a target of hand grenade attacks 193 times during the last 22 months. As in other hospitals, supplies of medicines in this hospital have become scarce and even water supply remains cut off because of continuing siege of Sarajevo by Serbian forces. Pakistan and Turkey have called upon the United Nations Security Council to ensure implementation of all its resolutions and lift the unjust embargo against Bosnia with a view to ensuring a halt to the destruction of the republic. The call was made in a joint declaration issued at the conclusion of the most courageous and historic visit to Sarajevo by the prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller of Turkey. The two leaders said in the joint declaration that Bosnia must not be forced to negotiate at gun point. We will resist any imposed settlement which rewards the aggressor and legitimizes the fruits of aggression. Ethnic cleansing cannot and should not be the basis of statehood. The joint declaration said it is shocking that this apalling human tragedy is being enacted in the heart of a continent which prides itself on its commitment to human rights and respect for human dignity. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Madam Tansu Ciller said it is unacceptable that in this era in which the principles of the United Nations Charter are recognized as having universal validity, a sovereign independent state is being violently dismembered along racial lines and genocide perpetrated against the peaceful and enlightened people. They saluted the heroism of the people of Bosnia and supported their just struggle for their national survival and said we fully endorse their resolve to preserve the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of their motherland. About the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the two leaders said rarely in the annals of human history have a nation been subjected to such merciless savagery in the full view of the world. They called for an immediate and strict implementation of a total cease-fire and cessation of hostility so that negotiations can be resumed and huge relief operation ensured. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Tansu Ciller said the situation on Bosnia-Herzegovina is a universal tragedy. The degradation of the human person as practiced in Bosnia is of concern to the entire human race. We leave this beleaguered but great city deeply outraged at the injustices being done to its citizens, but in fullest admiration and solidarity for the resolve to reject an unjust dispensation. Earlier, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto arrived in Croatian capital Zagreb today. She was received by Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, the deputy prime minister and the foreign minister and the UN special representative. The prime minister was accompanied by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, Interior Minister Major, retired, Nasiruddin Khan Babar and the foreign secretary. Later, Ms. Benazir Bhutto had a meeting with the prime minister of Turkey, Madam Tansu Ciller, who also arrived in Zagreb to accompany her to Sarajevo. The Pakistani and the Turkish prime ministers later renewed call to stop the destruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Begin recording] [Bhutto] the prime minister of Turkey and I are both going to Sarajevo, less as prime ministers and more as mothers, to focus the attention of the world on the plight of the people of Bosnia and to give a renewed call for the end of fighting. It is tragic to see that in the heart of Europe so many of the principles upon which peace and stability in the world are based are being violated. The UN Charter enshrines the territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations. But here the territorial integrity is being violated. It is very important that the Croatians and the Bosnians also coordinate closely together to permit redrawing of borders. [Ciller] We should try to make sure that the approach of Europe and the definition of Europe is defended, that the values of Europe should be defended, and we should do that together and there is no discrimination as to who does this. The value is that we should be defending the multinational, the multiculture, multireligion entity of living together. This is what Europe has been all about. [end recording]
