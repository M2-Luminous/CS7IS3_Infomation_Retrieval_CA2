In 1993 China issued stock with a value of $1.2 billion, a quarter of the value of all stocks issued in Asia. Last year the value of stocks issued in Asia increased by 250 percent, from $1.8 billion in 1992 to $4.5 billion. At the same time, in consortium loans China is the largest loan country in Asia, and the value of its total loans has increased from $2.7 billion in 1992 to $3.6 billion. China has almost a quarter of the value of all bank loans in Asia. In 1993 its bank loans in Asia grew 30 percent, to $15.4 billion. China is also one of the main players in the bond market; in 1993 it raised $3 billion by issuing bonds. This made the funds raised by China in the abovementioned three ways to toal $7.8 billion. The OECD also said that in 1993 the amount of loans on the world market grew by a third, to a record $811 billion. The demand for bond issues in Asia and Latin America caused the amount of capital raised on the markets of developing countries to reach an unprecedented $84 billion. The OECD added that the market activity could still be dynamic in the future. The part of the OECD report on trends in financial markets said that the cause of this amazing growth was that the amount of loans of OECD countries grew $150 billion, as well as the active seeking of loans on the capital market by the dynamic Asian countries and the Latin American countries headed by Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. The capital raised by OECD countries rose from $536 billion in 1992 to $691 billion, accounting for 85 percent of world loans, the lowest figure since 1985. Among the main debtor countries in the OECD, America and Japan are still in first place. A survey showed that the capital raised by America and Japan increased respectively from $95 billion and $76 billion in 1992 to $125 billion and $85 billion. The capital raised by Germany almost doubled -- from $28 billion in 1992 to $65 billion. Next were France, which raised $58 billion; Britain, which raised $51 billion; and Canada, which raised $39 billion. The capital raised by the developing countries has almost doubled -- from $47.3 billion in 1992 to $84.5 billion. Their share of the market has increased from 7.8 percent two years ago to 10.4 percent.
