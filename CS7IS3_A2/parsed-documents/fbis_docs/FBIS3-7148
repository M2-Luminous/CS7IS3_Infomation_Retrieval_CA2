The article says: NAM is entering into a new phase and independence against imperialism remains its idea. The imperialists and the reactionary forces averse to NAM's independent advancement against imperialism are trying by hook or by crook to keep off the influence of the movement and enervate it. The imperialists and some old forces, advertising international detente, contend that NAM has lost the effectiveness of its existence, and are setting afloat the claim that the basic idea must be revised and the orientation of its action be switched over to economic matters from political matters. They are bringing all manner of political and economic pressure to bear upon the non-aligned countries adhering to the independent stand against imperialism, seeking to impede the cause of the independence of the people, and working to split nam by causing friction and estrangement among those countries. Such being the situation, the non-aligned countries can not realize their desire to enjoy an independent life free from domination and subjugation, unless they enhance the function and role of NAM and strengthen the revolutionary struggle against imperialism. Stressing the need for the non-aligned countries to actively strive to intensify this movement with firm conviction of the justice of it and its idea, the article continues: What is of importance in intensifying NAM is to invariably maintain its basic idea and principle. NAM is, in essence, a movement for making the whole world democratic and independent and its basic principle is to maintain independence, not joining any bloc. The idea and principle of NAM are its life and soul and an indispensable requisite that must be maintained in the whole course of its activities. The non-aligned countries must not waver in any complicated situation, but remain faithful to the idea and principle of NAM and reject all attempts to detach it from its qnherdct idea and principle. Of importance in intensifying NAM at present is to achieve its unity and cohesion. The non-aligned countries must closely unite on the principle of mutual respect and non-interference in other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and check and foil the imperialists' moves of division and estrangement with a strategy of unity. The non-aligned countries will accelerate the building of an independent new world and realize at any cost the noble idea of independence against imperialism by intensifying and developing NAM, firmly united under the banner of independence against imperialism.
