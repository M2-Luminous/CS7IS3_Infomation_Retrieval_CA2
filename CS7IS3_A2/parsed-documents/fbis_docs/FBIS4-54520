A patrol came under fire Friday [29 April] at 1:30 p.m. (1130 GMT) in the east of the zone from Serb forces which were themselves within the three-kilometre (two-mile) limit imposed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation on April 22, UNPROFOR spokesman Eric Chaperon said. The British forces had taken no casualties. They had riposted, and the Serbs were believed to have taken three casualties in what Chaperon described as a violation of the NATO ultimatum in the eastern town of some 65,000 residents. Under the NATO deadline, all Serb heavy weaponry was to be withdrawn from a 20 kilometre (12 mile) radius around Gorazde, and troops pulled out from the inner exclusion zone, by 0001 GMT Wednesday. No further details were immediately available on Friday's incident.
