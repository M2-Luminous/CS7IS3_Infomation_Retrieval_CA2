Twenty percent of the order has already been paid for. Another 60 percent of the payment is due to arrive in the next few days. If it does, Jaderne Strojirenstvi will supply the corresponding part of the ordered equipment by the end of June. According to Vaclav Lobovsky, director of Skoda Jaderne Strojirenstvi, this contract should, first and foremost, explore the ability of Ukrainian nuclear power stations to pay. Jaderne Strojirenstvi had signed a letter of intent with Derzhkomatom [State Committee for Nuclear Energy], their umbrella organization. Skoda hopes to obtain $150 million (4.5 billion korunas) worth of orders on the basis of this contract, to be realized gradually until the end of the year 2000. This is the sum at which the letter of intent estimates the needs of the four Ukrainian nuclear power stations equipped with VVER [water-moderated water-cooled] reactors--Rivne, South Ukrainian, Zaporizhzhya, and Khmelnytskyy. According to Karel Wagner from Skoda Jaderne Strojirenstvi, who participated in a seminar on Czech regulatory drives in the South Ukrainian nuclear power station, Skoda's program has been received well. By its design, the equipment offered by Skoda also enhances the nuclear power stations' safety. In addition to reactor grids and drives for regulatory systems, Skoda Jaderne Strojirenstvi wants to assert itself on the Ukrainian market with hermetic cable bushings [kabelove hermeticke pruchodky], spare parts, and operational inspections of the pressure vessels.
