Tsai] [Text] Taipei, Jan. 18 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan Tuesday [18 January] said ties between Taiwan and Thailand have been cordial and will continue to develop. In 1993, he noted, Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$1 billion with Thailand, whose economy has grown substantially in the past decade. If the growth continues, Thailand will soon join the ranks of newly industrialized countries, he added. Currently, he pointed out, both countries are working on an investment guarantee agreement, whose draft proposal was exchanged last February. In addition, the two sides are expected to sign a pact to avoid double taxation later this month. The premier made the remarks while meeting with Marut Bunnak, speaker of the Thai House of Representatives and president of the Thai National Assembly. Marut, leading a 14-member parliamentary delegation, arrived in Taipei Monday for a six-day visit. Lien told the Thai speaker that about 50,000 Thai workers are working in Taiwan, making up the largest group of foreign laborers. Thai laborers have made contributions to Taiwan's economic development, Lien said. Moreover, he noted, Taiwan investors channeled US$4.4 billion into Thailand as of August 1993 and Taiwan residents made about 500,000 visits to Thailand each year. This is solid evidence of the close relationship between the two countries, he said. The Thai senator [title as received] was accompanied during the visit by Director P.Y. Teng of the Foreign Ministry's East Asian and Pacific Affairs Department as well as Edmund Y. Liu, representative of the Taipei Economic and Trade Office in Thailand.
