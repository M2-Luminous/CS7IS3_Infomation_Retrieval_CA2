The product is a technology driver chip which incorporates new element technology in order to achieve a high speed architecture. NEC's developed architecture divides a pipeline. Each pipeline executes multiple commands simultaneously, and pipelines are further divided as processing time increases which accomplishes high speed processing. As for the element technology, from circuit and layout design, a high speed processor, high speed cache memory, high speed clock signal circuit, high speed clock signal distribution circuit, and a low noise and high speed interface circuit were developed. Low noise and high density standard cell layout were also developed. Thus a CMOS with 500 MHz, 0.4 �m, and triple layer Al circuitry was developed. The developed 32-bit RISC model MPU operates at 500 MHz. The developed MPU is a CMOS with 0.4 �m triple layer Al circuitry. It is a technology driver chip which incorporates new element technology in order to come up with a high speed architecture. The product is named ``GALLOP (GHz-clock Applicable Logic and Layout Octpipeline Processor.'' The high speed architecture which operates at 500 MHz divides the pipelines. Each pipeline executes multiple commands simultaneously, depending on the calculation time. The 32-bit data path is organized with eight pipeline levels. New Technology Is Incorporated In Architecture, Circuit, And Layout In order to realize the CMOS process with triple layer Al circuitry operable at 500 MHz, new element technology was incorporated in the circuit and layout designs. The new element technology includes: (1) high speed processor; (2) high speed cache; (3) high speed clock signal generator; (4) high speed clock signal distributor; (5) low noise high speed interface; (6) low noise high density standard cell layout. The developed chip has about 200 thousand transistors in a chip area of 7.9x8.84mm[.sup]2[/]. It uses 3.3 volts, the power consumption is 6 watts and it can operate at 500 MHz (see table 1). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

The ``SSSP (Super High-Speed Signal Processor)'' is the high speed signal processor that was developed in 1989. It placed a 16-bit arithmetic processor operating at 200 MHz on board. After that, ``VSP3 (Video Signal Parallel Pipelined Processor)'' was developed and operated at 300 MHz. Those devices were made using bi-CMOS technology. Figure 1. RISC Model MPU High Frequency Trend For example, Alpha by DEC uses 0.75 �m CMOS. Additionally, with 1 �m multi-crystal Si emitter ECL bi-polar process, a 32-bit MPU can be operated with 115 W and 300 MHz. MPU high speed is realized by using a RISC architecture. To achieve this high performance, a technology to produce a high speed clock is most important. <annot> Key: 1. Operational Frequency (MHz); 2. The developed product introduced this time; 3. Year of Introduction.</graphic> However, it is essential from now on to establish high speed CMOS technology in order to make a low voltage and low cost devices. For this reason, a RISC chip operable at 500 MHz was developed for the purpose of determining the speed limit of CMOS technology and establishing element technology which is indispensable for future high speed MPUs. The developed high speed architecture incorporates the basic features of RISC that can process multiple commands simultaneously, and additionally pipelines are divided when the time to calculate is too long. At a concrete level, computing element that takes a longer time, instruction cache, and data cache are organized in two levels of pipeline. The register file that takes a short computing time is in the first level pipeline. As a result, data path is organized with 8 levels of pipeline (see figure 2). Figure 2. Developed RISC Architecture Also Employs High Frequency Speed Internally As an architecture consideration, the external interface executes at a lower frequency than the internal frequency. Although the internal clock is 500 MHz, external clock can be lowered to 62.5 - 250 MHz. Since the chip packaging and printed circuit board have longer wiring and have large load and inductance, the solution to transmit a high frequency signal was studied. The 62.5 - 250 MHz external signal was twice, four times, and eight times propagated in PLL (Phase Locked Loop) circuit. Adjusting to the internal high speed, the instruction cache and data cache have 1 K byte capacity. Discussion of the circuit technology developed in element and layout technology follows next. The topics include: computing element; cache memory; clock signal generator; clock signal distributor circuit; interface circuit; and standard cell layout. Computing Element: Two Levels Of Pipeline Organization Since the computation occur at 500 MHz, a pipeline that runs at 2 ns is organized with two levels. The reason why the pipeline stage is divided into two levels is because of difficulty of processing addition calculations with one clock cycle of 2 ns in one level. In a 32-bit processor, adder, barrel shifter, and logic processor are placed on board as an element technology. As an adder, BLC (Binary Look ahead Carry) that has a good reputation for video processing, and as a barrel shifter, a transfer gate model selector are employed. Cache: Two Levels Same As Computing Element Since cache memory operates at 500 MHz, the same as the computing element, a 2 ns pipeline stage is organized with two levels. At one level, address decode is performed, and at the second level, signal is read and amplified, and a 22 bit tag memory is compared with the address. In order to realize 2 ns high speed, as for the element technology in cache memory, the address decoder, pipeline register, and comparater are generated by dynamic circuit design. As a result, the register part is made small to 100 ps, which is 1/4th smaller than the traditional register. And comparater speed is enhanced by 30%. Cache memory uses 4 words as one block, date write is done by the write-back method, and the rewriting algorithm employs a direct mapping method. Rewriting is processed by a bus circuit control with one block unit. Clock Generator Circuit: Low Jitter PLL Developed In order to maintain stable operation at 500 MHz, a low jitter PLL circuit was developed. The PLL circuit consists of a Phase Detector which detects the phase shift, Loop Filter which converts the result of the phase shift to voltage, Voltage Controlled Oscillator which controls oscillation frequency by the loop filter output voltage, and a Counter which divides the output oscillation signal. In order for the loop filter to run stably at 500 MHz, a differential amplifier was employed. By this, PLL circuit frequency stability was improved greatly. Traditionally a loop filter used the invertor which is placed on the video processor board. Because of this, with relation to the threshold value of MOS transistor, a deadband existed, and the frequency was shifted greatly. This time because a differential amplifier was employed which eliminated deadband, high stability was realized. From circuit simulations, it was verified that jitter was controlled to 15%. Offset problems caused by the differential amplifier were solved by feedback. Also for a counter, a dynamic circuit was employed and 1 GHz operation was realized. Clock Distribution Circuit: Skew Was Reduced By Shortening The Layer In order for the clock signal distribution circuit to run at 500 MHz, for the clock signal phase difference, the short circuit method by which each layer level was shortened to reduce clock skew was employed. The driver was distributed like a tree, and then the driver output of each layer level was short circuited, and skew correction was added (see figure 3). If the distance between the clock driver is 4mm and input skew is 0.2 ns, then output skew can be reduced by half, 0.1 ns, by the short circuit of each driver distance. Figure 3. Developed Clock Tree Layer Short Circuit On the other hand, for a part of memory and random logic, the driver can not be laid out like a tree. In that case, the clock signal was supplied by using a large driver. At some point in the output buffer to supply the clock, capacity to adjust skew was installed, and by laser trimming, delay time was sensitively adjusted. Interface Circuit: Low Noise With 1V Oscillation Width In the interface circuit, a maximum 250 MHz external clock signal can be transmitted. Moreover, the circuit that eliminates nose generated by the interface circuit by itself was developed. That consists of an input buffer circuit and an output buffer circuit (see figure 4). Figure 4. Input and Output Buffer Circuit Developed forFigure 4. Input and Output Buffer Circuit Developed for The input circuit buffer is configured with the combination of a variable invertor circuit. Noise was controlled by terminal resistors placed at the input terminals and connector terminals. Terminal resistors are organized with 4 nMOSUs which have different channel widths and are connected with parallel. An externally supplied 4 bit signal turns these four nMOSUs on and off. When the input buffer circuit characteristics are changed, noise can be controlled by adjusting resistor values at the terminal resistors. Reflection caused by improper adjustment of impedance at bonding wires and packaging will also be eliminated by the terminal resistors. However, if the terminal resistor is built-in, chip power consumption becomes larger. To solve this problem, signal oscillation width in the input and output buffer circuit is controlled to a low, 0 - 1V. At 0V, power is not consumed. However if the reference terminal is lowered to 0.5V, then it will cause a problem by being influenced from the ground potential difference. For this problem, power source wiring was strengthened at the layout design, and the fluctuation of electrical potential was controlled. Output signal level at output buffer circuit is determined by ratio between pMOS on-resistor and terminal resistor. On the other hand, in the output buffer circuit, a momentarily large current will flow when multiple circuits are operated simultaneously. To solve this problem, the circuit is divided in two groups, and the current peak was distributed over two levels. For layers having different clock trees, the time difference was maintained, so that the clock signal is given to the register. The peak time difference is about 0.4 ns, and it is not a problem practically. Delay time of both input buffer circuit and output buffer circuit are quite small, 0.3 ns. The interface circuit has a function to adjust phase shift with an external system. That is a synchronous interface circuit. By including a circuit to control interface delay time, system skew is reduced. Layout: About 50% High Density Achieved In layout design, transistor density was increased by 50%, and new standard cell layout which intensely controls noise in the power source was developed (see figure 5). Figure 5. Developed High Density, Low Noise Layout A simple method to achieve a high speed CMOS circuit is to use a short channel length transistor. In addition, if the wiring is minute, then capacity will be larger. Thus improvement of transistor drive capacity is needed. For this reason, if transistor width is increased, then transistor density is lowered at the time of layout, wiring length is increased and wiring capacity gets larger. To solve this dilemma, a high density layout was developed this time. High density was achieved by using the first level Al pole, and wiring between cells was connected by a second and third level Al. In the traditional layout, a region to connect at the outside of a cell is necessary, but this time the layout does not require that region. Second level Al is passed through at the top of the cell, and 17 lines at the second level Al are passed through at the cell 48 �m in height. This time using a standard cell, a 32-bit adder was laid out, and 10,210 transistors per mm[.sup]2[/] were integrated, which is 50% more than the traditional model. Layout: Low Noise With Stack Model Wiring Low noise was achieved by the development of a stack model power source wiring layout. First, in order to supply a stable power source, impedance was controlled, and the principle, Rnoise must be shut off at the closest point to where the noise is generatedS was followed. Impedance was controlled at the merging layer of the first level Al and the second level Al. That is because the area and resistance of power source wiring and connecting wiring can be made small. The reduction of noise was achieved by the stack model power source wiring, in which large area of nMOS is established under the power source wiring. The nMOS formed by using a polyside layer becomes a bypass condenser, about 0.027 �F, which functionally controls noise. The peripheral area of PLL circuit is covered by stack model power source wiring, and shielded from the digital circuit that would be a source of other noise. In addition, to avoid the influence of noise, the power source for the digital circuit and the power source for the PLL circuit are separated. PLL Circuit Establishes Independent Power Source Pad In the developed overall chip layout, the database is placed on the right side, and the data cache and instruction cache are placed on the left side. The register file is placed on the data path. Two cache memories are divided into blocks of cache body and a tag part in order to make the layout area small. The control circuit and PLL circuit placed on the right side of the data path are surrounded by 200-240 �m width power source wiring and connecting wiring. The PLL circuit that uses an analog signal is surrounded by stack model power source wiring and also an independent power source pad is placed there. The pad around the chip is spaced 140 �m horizontally, and 150 �m vertically, and 180 pieces are laid out.
