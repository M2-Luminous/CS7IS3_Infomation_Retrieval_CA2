[Rabin] I would have been happy had the policemen who served within the framework of the Israel Police right up to the intifadah returned to their posts. I regretted their resignations at the time and I would be happy if they returned, but under the clear understanding that overall responsibility for security in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip -- as long as we have not reached and implemented the Gaza-Jericho agreement -- lies with the State of Israel via the military government and the Civil Administration. We wanted the policemen to remain, but they decided otherwise. I would be happy if they returned to their posts, but we must realize that they will be subservient to Israel's authority. [Golan] Mr. Prime Minister, do President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher believe that your proposal to recruit the Palestinian police in Hebron, as you have suggested, will suffice to return the PLO to the negotiating table? [Rabin] I did not suggest anything, I told them that was the situation, just as I have been telling you. The resignation of the policemen was not what we wanted. In places where policemen showed a readiness to remain, we were pleased, and we welcome it now too. [Golan] Following your Washington talks, how do you estimate the chances of renewing the talks in the near future, first with the PLO and then with the Arab states? [Rabin] I very much hope and believe that the Palestinians must also have an interest in advancing the negotiations because without a joint interest we will not reach an agreement. Peace is not imposed. We do not impose anything on them and they cannot impose anything on us. The peace negotiations must be in the interest of all the involved sides. No side can dictate terms contrary to what has already been agreed because of some incident, no matter how tragic, such as the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. We did not demand any changes in the agreement we reached with the Palestinians in the wake of terrorist activity by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] or its likes against Israelis. [Golan] How do you feel when demonstrators carry placards showing you wearing a kaffiyeh? [Rabin] I am so used to it that it does not have any effect on me. [Earlier in the newsreel, Golan quotes Rabin as calling the PLO demands to evacuate Hebron settlers and deploying an independent Palestinian police force or international force in the town "a nonstarter," which he rejected outright. Golan says Rabin told Israeli correspondents in Washington, that "it is unfeasible to have an armed police force in Hebron which is not subordinate to Israel." Rabin said Israel is considering various proposals to alleviate the situation for the Palestinians without harming security. "Referring to the Syrian track, the prime minister said that in his talks with President Clinton, they discussed the components of peace -- the scope of the withdrawal on the Golan Heights, security arrangements, the stages for implementing the agreement, and the substance of the peace -- but there was no detailed discussion on the depth of the withdrawal." Rabin also raised with the President, the growing Russian involvement in the Middle East and "called for better coordination between the cosponsors of the peace process." [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 17 March quotes Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu as rejecting the idea of deploying Palestinian policemen in Hebron.]
