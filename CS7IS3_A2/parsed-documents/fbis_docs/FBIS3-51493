At approximately 1230, Camacho Solis disclosed three points to reaching an agreement for normalcy, peace, calm, and tranquillity in this area. He said the first step had been taken by the chief of the executive branch. This step consists of suspending any confrontation between the Army and the rebels. The second step, Camacho explained, is for all parties to join in a civic movement to lay the groundwork for negotiations. We then would go on to the third step, which will be the dialogue. According to Camacho Solis, a great politician who favors dialogue, what is needed is a dialogue with the Chiapas guerrillas to discuss their viewpoints and demands and then set a deadline. With regard to a deadline, he noted that a deadline for the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] cannot be established yet because they are in no condition for that. He said all he wants is for the situation to move toward one of peace, tranquillity, and calm in Chiapas State. Camacho Solis said: We are certain that we are doing fine; we are on the correct path to reconciliation. Camacho Solis is about to start a motorcade for peace. It will depart from San Cristobal de las Casas and go to Ocosingo, where heavy fighting with the EZLN took place. During the news conference, Camacho Solis was accompanied by Bishop Samuel Ruiz and Armed Forces Commander Oton Calderon.
