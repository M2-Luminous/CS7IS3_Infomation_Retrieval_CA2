Gligorov stresses that this could result in a dramatic economic destabilization of Macedonia, and consequently of the overall situation in the region. The Macedonian president goes on to say that the EU must find a solution to this problem, and notes the EU's slowness, lack of determination and unequal treatment of the two sides. At the end of his letter to Jacques Delors, Gligorov stresses that if the problem with Athens is not solved, Macedonia will have to initiate a discussion of the Greek embargo in the Security Council.
