The Account was established by Providentmutual as a separate investment account under Delaware law on June 30, 1994, as a funding vehicle for variable life insurance contracts. The Account will be registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. The Account will be divided into subaccounts, each of which will invest exclusively in the shares of a designated investment portfolio of a specified open-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act. 6. Under Delaware law, amounts allocated to the Account are owned by Providentmutual. To the extent provided under the Contract, however, that portion of the assets of the Account equal to the reserves and other Contract liabilities pertaining to the Account shall not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business Providentmutual may conduct. The income, gains and losses, realized and unrealized, from the assets allocated to the Account are credited to or charged against the Account without regard to other income, gains or losses of Providentmutual. The Account is, and any future account will be, a ``separate account,'' as defined by Rule 0&hyph;1(e) under the 1940 Act. 7. PML is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company of Philadelphia. PML acts as principal underwriter, as defined in the 1940 Act, of the variable life insurance contracts supported by the Account. PML is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Applications for the Contracts and future contracts will be solicited by registered representatives of PML, or other broker-dealers having selling agreements will PML, who are licensed by applicable state insurance authorities to sell flexible premium variable life insurance contracts. 8. In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Congress amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ``Code'') by, among other things, enacting Section 848 thereof. Section 848 changed the federal income taxation of life insurance companies by requiring them to capitalize and amortize over a period of ten years part of their general expenses for the current year. Under prior law, these expenses were deductible in full from the current year's gross income. 9. The amount of expenses that must be capitalized and amortized under Section 848 is generally determined with reference to premiums for certain categories of life insurance and other contracts (``specified contracts''). Thus, for each specified contract, an amount of expenses must be capitalized and amortized equal to a percentage of the current year's net premiums (i.e., gross premiums minus return premiums and reinsurance premiums) for that contract. The percentage varies, depending on the type of specified contract in question, according to a schedule set forth in Section 848(c)(1). 10. Although framed in terms of requiring a portion of a life insurance company's general expenses to be capitalized and amortized, Section 848 in effect accelerates the realization of income from specified contracts for federal income tax purposes and, therefore, the payment of taxes on the income generated by those contracts. When the time value of money is taken into account, this has the economic consequence of increasing the tax burden borne by the insurance company that is attributable to such contracts. Because the amount of general deductions that must be capitalized and amortized is measured by premiums paid for specified contracts, an increased tax burden results from the receipt of those premiums. In this respect, the impact of Section 848 can be compared with that of a state premium tax. 11. The Contract and any future contracts to which the ``tax burden charge'' will be applied are among the specified contracts. They fall into the category of life insurance contracts for which the percentage of net premiums that determines the amount of otherwise currently deductible general expenses to be capitalized and amortized with respect to such contracts is 7.7 percent. 12. The increased tax burden resulting from the applicability of Section 848 to every $10,000 of net premiums received may be quantified as follows. In the year when the premiums are received, Providentmutual's general deductions are reduced by $731.50_i.e., an amount equal to (a) 7.7 percent of $10,000, or $770, minus (b) one-half year's portion of the ten-year amortization, or $38.50. Using a 35 percent corporate tax rate, this works out to an increase in tax for the current year of $256.03. This reduction will be partially offset by increased deductions that will be allowed during the next ten years as a result of amortizing the remainder of the $770_$77 in each of the following nine years, and $38.50 in the tenth year. 13. To the extent and capital must be used by Providentmutual to satisfy its increased federal tax burden under Section 848 resulting from the receipt of premiums, such profits are not available to Providentmutual for investment. Accordingly Providentmutual submits that its targeted rate of return is appropriate for use in this present value calculation. Because it seeks an after tax rate of return of 9.3 percent on its invested capital 1 Providentmutual submits that a discount rate of at least 9.3 percent is appropriate for use in calculating the present value of its future tax deductions resulting from the amortization described above. 1 In determining its cost of capital, Providentmutual considered a number of factors. Providentmutual first projected its future growth rate based on sales projects, current interest rates, the inflation rate, and the amount of capital that it can provide to support such growth. Providentmutual then used the anticipated growth rate and other factors (such as market interest rates, Providentmutual's anticipated long-term growth rate, the risk level for this type of business that is acceptable to Providentmutual, inflation and available information about the rates of return obtained by other insurance companies) to set a rate of return on capital that equals or exceeds this rate of growth. (Of these other factors, market interest rates, the acceptable risk level and the inflation rate receive significantly more weight than information about the rates of return obtained by other insurance companies.) Providentmutual represents that these are appropriate factors for Providentmutual to consider in determining its cost of capital. Providentmutual also took into account the ratio of surplus to assets that it seeks to maintain. Providentmutual represents that maintaining the ratio of surplus to assets is critical to maintaining a competitive rating from various rating agencies and to offering competitively priced products (i.e., sufficient dividends on outstanding contracts and competitive pricing on newly offered contracts). Consequently, Providentmutual asserts that its surplus must grow at least at the same rate as its assets. 14. Using a corporate tax rate of 35 percent, and assuming a discount rate of 9.3 percent, the present value of the tax effect of the increased deductions allowable in the following ten years comes to $165.16. Because this amount partially offsets the increased tax burden, applying Section 848 to the specified contracts imposes an increased tax burden on Providentmutual equal to a present value of $90.87 (i.e., $256.03 minus $165.16) for each $10,000 of net premiums.
