This is entirely wrong for the security council, said a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement published on June 1. If things were to take a correct track, the security council should have called in question not the DPRK, but some quarters of the agency secretariat, the spokesman said, and went on: Before starting refueling, we had requested the agency several times to take necessary measures such as its presence and the removal of the seals. But it failed to send a group of inspectors till refueling began, thus openly neglecting its duty as an international organisation. This was what some quarters of the secretariat did. The UN Security Council, instead of finding fault with the DPRK, should have taken issue with some officials of the IAEA Secretariat who laid huddles in the way of the DPRK's peaceful nuclear activities, framed a sinister political intrigue to shift the blame on to the DPRK and transferred the problem to the United Nations. If the IAEA Secretariat and the UN Security Council, bereft of impartiality, insist on pressure with an unreasonable attitude, we will no longer feel any need to be restricted by such pressure. It is more than intolerable that we have suffered from big obstacles in our peaceful nuclear activities, restricted by the unilateral demand of the IAEA. In case pressure is put on us again, we will no longer fall a victim to the unreasonable demand but will have to go our own way, unhindered by anything. This is the unshakable will of the Korean people, who regard independence as their life and blood. If some officials of the IAEA Secretariat declare that the technical possibilities of the future measurement of fuel rods were gone or the UN Security Council put pressure on the DPRK, threatening "sanctions" under that pretext, we cannot but take decisive countermeasures, rather freeing ourselves from such unreasonable restrictions than suffering from them, and we will be left with no other choice but to go over to the continuous process of the peaceful nuclear activities. We will respond any time with utmost sincerity to the intention to deal with the issue in a fair way and resolve it in a peaceful way through dialogue. But we will counter without slightest compromise any intention to unjustifiably put pressure on us, ignoring our sovereignty, if but a little.
