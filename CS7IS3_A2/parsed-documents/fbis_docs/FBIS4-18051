Russian Missilemen Use Ukraine Equipment But Moscow Controls Nuclear Weapons in Any Event"] [Text] Ukraine honors its obligations and is evacuating nuclear warheads to Russian in accordance with an earlier coordinated schedule, Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander in chief of the Strategic Missile Forces, told foreign military attaches in Moscow yesterday. By this time 180 Ukrainian warheads have arrived in Russia to Nuclear Industry Ministry installations for subsequent dismantling. In response the Russian nuclear department is shipping to Ukraine deliveries of fuel elements for Ukraine's nuclear power plants. The planned withdrawal of missile regiments from Belorussia [Belarus] continues. On 28 March during a summit in Moscow Presidents Yeltsin and Nazarbayev signed an agreement on military cooperation and the status of strategic nuclear forces whereby missile divisions in Kazakhstan were moved under Russian Federation jurisdiction, and also coordinated a schedule for the evacuation to Russia of all nuclear warheads within 14 months. After that, within three years, all launchers and strategic missiles in Kazakhstan are to be abolished. The procedure for the abolition, however, has not so far been finalized (the details of the Russian-Kazakhstan nuclear agreement did not become known until recently). The process of "nuclear divorce" of Russia with Ukraine, Belorussia, and Kazakhstan is proceeding amazingly smoothly. Yet problems remain: On 25 April General Staff Academy official Nikolay Kostin publicly expressed doubts about "the circle of people today possessing information about strategic arms command and control systems." In response to SEGODNYA's correspondent, Gen. Sergeyev stated that in his troops "everything is under control." Should any attempt be made to reveal nuclear codes, emergency warning panels will flash in all related headquarters, including the General Staff. Maybe Kostin meant the warheads of the air-based strategic cruise missiles of the 45th Army stationed in Ukraine? The equipment used to command and control strategic nuclear missiles was indeed manufactured in Kharkov. Russian specialists are apparently concerned over the possibility of leaks of strategic information from there (inducing to other foreign countries). Yet Gen. Sergeyev is calm because the control system's software is of Russian origin. "Without the software, the hardware is of little value," Mr. Sergeyev stressed. Under the START I Treaty, 403 strategic missiles (including Ukrainian) and 302 launchers have been destroyed. Even so there are approximately 67 percent of domestic strategic carriers in the Strategic Missiles Forces (1,150 units, of which 350 are in neighboring states) and more than 75 percent of the Russian Federation's aggregate megaton charge.
