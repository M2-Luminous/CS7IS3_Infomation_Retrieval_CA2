The Farmers' Federation Council, which includes the Farmers' Union, said it would continue talks with the government to tackle the problems of farmers and ensure policy favorable for the development of agriculture. On the other hand, the federation plans to propose a popular no confidence vote to the government and the parliament if they fail to settle privatization of food processors, to protect food market, to finance and credit farmers and to introduce favorable taxation before the Aug. 1 deadline. In addition, the federation demands a leadership shake-up in the Economics Ministry because Minister Ojars Kehris is said to be responsible for the unfavorable economic situation. The Latvian Farmers' Union faction will not propose Kehris' resigning in the Saeima (parliament) but will discuss it in coalition sittings, said faction head Andris Rozentals. Latvia has 180,000 individual farms at the moment, said Farmers' Federation deputy chairman, Andris Auzins. From those, only 1,000 are well-off, 7,000 to 8,000 "make the ends meet," while the rest live on family allowances and retirement pensions, he said. The agriculture suffers most from the chaotic situation on the domestic market and the uncontrolled import of food stuffs, Auzins said. Agriculture Minister Janis Kinna argued that the Latvian food market was the best protected in the Baltics in view of the introduced import tariffs on farm produce. The Latvian Farmers' Union ran for the incumbent Saeima together with the Farmers' Federation, the Unlawfully Repressed Persons Association and the Daugavas Vanagi organization. In the Saeima, it joined Latvia's Way to form the ruling coalition, which now unites 47 deputies. From those, three have been suspended on KGB collaboration charges.
