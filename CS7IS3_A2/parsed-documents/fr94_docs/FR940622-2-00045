FR940622-2-00045 FR940622-2-00034 [OPP&hyph;180944; FRL 4872&hyph;9] Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption To Use Pirate Insecticide; Solicitation of Public Comment AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Georgia Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the ``Applicant'') for use of the pesticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1 H -pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, to control beet armyworms (BAW) on up to 25,000 acres of cotton in Georgia. In accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption. DATES: Comments must be received on or before July 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Three copies of written comments, bearing the identification notation ``OPP&hyph;180944,'' should be submitted by mail to: Public Response and Human Resource Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. In person, bring comments to: Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA. Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information.'' Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain Confidential Business Information must be provided by the submitter for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments filed pursuant to this notice will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Susan Stanton, Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. Office location and telephone number: 6th Floor, Crystal Station I, 2800 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 308&hyph;8327. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for use of the insecticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, available as Pirate 3SC from American Cyanamid Company, to control beet armyworms (BAW) on up to 25,000 acres of cotton in Georgia. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. According to the Applicant, BAW has historically been a late-season pest of cotton, particularly in drought years. However, the use of organophosphate insecticides in the Boll Weevil Eradication Program has disrupted the natural biological control of BAW, causing it to become a serious, season-long problem in certain years. According to the Applicant, the registered pesticides provide only partial control of BAW. If Pirate Insecticide is not available for use and a severe outbreak occurs, the Applicant claims that yield losses of up to 100 percent are possible in some fields. Under the proposed exemption, a maximum of two ground applications of Pirate 3SC would be made at 8.53 fluid ounces of product (0.2 pounds active ingredient) per acre. No applications would be made within 21 days of harvest. A maximum of 10,000 pounds of active ingredient would be needed to treat up to 25,000 acres of cotton. This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18 require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the Federal Register and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a new chemical (i.e., an active ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide) [40 CFR 166.24 (a)(1)]. 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1 H -pyrrole-3-carbonitrile is a new chemical. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
