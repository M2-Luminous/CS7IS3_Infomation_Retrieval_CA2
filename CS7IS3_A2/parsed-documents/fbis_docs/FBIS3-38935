A NATO source said "a majority, not everybody" in the 16-member alliance was in favour of putting the Serbs on notice following the mortar attack last weekend that killed 68 people in Sarajevo's central market. But NATO requires unanimity to take a decision and Greece has come out strongly against the airstrikes. Canada has also expressed strong reservations for fear of reprisals against its troops serving in Bosnia. In Washington a U.S. official said the United States would ask its NATO allies to authorize bombing raids against the Bosnian Serbs unless they pulled their heavy weapons back from the hills around Sarajevo. The NATO source said two proposals were on the table at a meeting of NATO ambassadors here, one by the United States and France and the other by Britain. Both contained the notion of a warning but avoided the word ultimatum. The aim would be to give the Serbs seven to 10 days to withdraw their heavy weapons at least 20 kilometers (13 miles) from the predominantly Moslem Bosnian capital. The Bosnian army's artillery would be put under international control. The source expressed optimism for reaching a consensus. "Last night we were closing together," he said. The alliance was to consider a request by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to authorise the use of its warplanes for a punitive action to deter future attacks such as Saturday's slaughter in Sarejevo's market. But NATO, stung to action by the worst incident in the 22-month-old conflict, appeared to have a broader purpose in mind: lifting the siege of Sarajevo immediately as urged Monday by the European Community. In Washington Secretary of State Warren Christopher emphasised that the military threat was paired with a vow to step up pressure on Bosnia's three warring factions to reach a political settlement. Christopher said the military and diplomatic initiatives were "very closely interrelated. They are interlocked. One does not take the place of the other. They go together." Clinton approved the twin-pronged response to the grizzling [as received] shelling of Sarajevo's market on Tuesday. During the day he talked by telephone to French President Francois Mitterrand, French sources said, but declined to give details. Clinton also telephoned Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, and tried but failed to contact British Prime Minister John Major, said a senior administration official who asked not to be identified. Canada and Britain, the largest contributors to the UN Protection Force in Bosnia after France -- which has deployed 6,000 blue helmets, are reluctant to back Paris' call for an air strike, fearing it might expose their own troops to Serbian retaliation. Washington hopes to find "an agreeable position" with Paris on a minor sticking point relating to the distance to which the Serbian artillery should pull back from Sarajevo, the senior administration official said. But as far as an agreement within NATO in the Brussels meeting, "I don't know if this will happen tomorrow," he added. The U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, John Shalikashvili, warned a Senate committee on Tuesday that air power was limited. "Air power alone can not bump someone into a peace treaty," he said. He said NATO's North Atlantic Council would discuss "whether you can use limited air power not to stop, but to reduce, the chance of a tragedy that occurred in Sarajevo the other day."
