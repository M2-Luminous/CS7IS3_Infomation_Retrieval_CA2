FBIS4-6607 "dreas078_a_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Coalition Representatives Decide To Endorse Hata Coalition Representatives Decide To Endorse Hata OW2104234794 Tokyo KYODO in English 2325 GMT 21 Apr 94 OW2104234794 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Heads of the ruling coalition will endorse Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on Friday [22 April] afternoon as a candidate for prime minister as coalition representatives struck a deal on a draft policy platform for a new cabinet early Friday. The prime ministerial election in both houses of the Diet is expected to be held Monday. Hata, concurrently deputy prime minister, is certain to be elected prime minister because the coalition has a majority in the 511-seat House of Representatives. Secretaries general-level representatives of the ruling parties reconciled their positions early Friday on two key policies -- Japan's response to North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program and tax system reform. The coalition executives also decided to ask all coalition chiefs to convene a meeting around 2 PM [0500 GMT] Friday to endorse the draft policy platform and name a candidate to succeed departing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who suddenly announced April 8 his intention to resign over financial improprieties. Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest force in the seven-party coalition, told a news conference early Friday that Hata, who leads Shinseito, is the best candidate from a common sense viewpoint. He also denied speculation that he will become deputy prime minister. Murayama currently does not hold a cabinet post. Talks among the coalition partners had remained at an impasse over how to find common ground to document policies in two key areas -- tax reform and the North Korean nuclear issue. Earlier Thursday, all the coalition parties other than the SDP spurned its demands to play down the wording on tax reform and the North Korean nuclear issue in a policy document for a new cabinet, officials said. The SDP earlier threatened to leave the alliance because of differences on the key issues but decided to remain in the coalition by seeking a compromise. The representatives agreed on a phrase requiring the government to seek "cooperation with Asian nations concerned" in addition to the United States and South Korea in the event of an emergency over North Korea's alleged nuclear program. The agreement was made after the SDP conceded its demand on the inclusion in the coalition's policy paper of a phrase obligating the government to consult with China, as well as the U.S. and South Korea, if the United Nations decides to slap economic sanctions on North Korea. The SDP has friendly ties with Pyongyang. On tax system reform, the coalition parties agreed on a plan to revamp the current tax system with a phrase seeking reform based on "public understanding" through possible revision or elimination of the existing consumption tax but focusing attention on raising indirect taxes. The SDP demanded that the term "national consensus" be inserted into the policy document as a prerequisite for a hike in indirect taxes, while other parties call for inserting an indication of their readiness to hike the consumption tax from the current 3 percent. The SDP had demanded the abolition of the 1989 consumption tax, a value-added tax, in exchange for a compromise that calls for creation of a new indirect levy with public consensus. The SDP scored a victory in the 1989 House of Councillors elections campaigning against the consumption tax. In February, Hosokawa was forced to scrap a plan to introduce a 7 percent "national welfare tax" to offset a 6 trillion yen tax cut in place of the consumption tax in the face of strong opposition from the SDP.
