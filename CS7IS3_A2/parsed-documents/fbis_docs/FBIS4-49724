The number of foreign-funded enterprises has surpassed 170,000 in China and is still expanding. "They have brought us advanced technology, equipment and funds we need badly, and are playing an increasing role in China's national economic development," an official of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce said. "However," he pointed out, "some localities have paid attention only to the number and not to the quality of foreign-funded enterprises, some have violated the state law and regulations to offer extra preferential policies to go along with the other side, and some even have under evaluated the property of our state enterprises in order to set up joint ventures with foreign business people or sell the property to them." He disclosed that a small number of foreign business people have not yet registered their capital according to contract since having their names registered. To guide foreign-funded enterprises toward healthy development, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce will adopt the following key measures: -- Reinforce and improve the examination of investment registration; -- Approve the report of evaluation of the property submitted by a Chinese state enterprise which plans to cooperate with foreign businessmen in setting up a joint venture; -- Require foreign business people scheduled to set up joint ventures or cooperate with Chinese to list the actual values of their equipment and other materials in kind in the contract, with figures subject to approval by intermediary and notary organizations; -- Require central state enterprises that plan to sell stocks or use state property to set up joint ventures or cooperate with foreign firms to submit a report for state approval prior to putting plans into action; -- Require Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative enterprises to share weal and woe despite the proportion of investments; -- Strengthen the supervision and examination of investments made by foreign-funded enterprises. An enterprise with registered capital of less than two million U.S. dollars must deliver the funds within six months from the day on which it gets a business license, and the time limit for a business with registered capital of less than five million U.S. dollars will be one year, and two years for those with registered funds of less than 10 million U.S. dollars. The period will be extended for larger projects. -- Upon discovery, revoke the license of and punish any Sino-foreign joint venture enterprise whose Chinese partner has replaced the foreign side in handling registered capital, according to the law and regulations.
