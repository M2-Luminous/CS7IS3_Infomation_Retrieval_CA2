Mr. Abdirahman said that the SNM delegation, led by himself, and the Somali National Alliance [SNA] delegation, led by Chairman Mohamed Farah Aidid, met in Addis Ababa between 25-29 April this year, and discussed various issues -- including current efforts to reconcile the Somalis, the settlement of any unresolved problems, and the search for a solution that is satisfactory to all parties, which will bring the crisis to an end and prevent the further destruction of the Somali people. In conclusion, the SNM chairman and his delegation thanked the chairman and the SNA delegation for their tireless efforts, the value that Mr. Aidid places on the role of the SNM, and his constant invitations to talks concerning the reconciliation of Somali people. The SNM has issued the following clarifications in connection with the present situation in Somalia. 1. The experience gained during the last three years clearly shows that the path followed by the Somali people, whether in the north or south of the country, toward settling the differences which emerged from the struggle against the dictatorial regime of Siad Barre, have so far not achieved the goal of stability or created a government that is better than the former one for Somali people. 2. In looking at these issues, we should have realized that the Somali people cannot continue along a path that leads to national suicide or to a failure to create a reliable government or mini- states. 3. The international community has tried to help the Somali people in every way and assist them toward finding a way out of the current intolerable situation, but so far nothing has succeeded, and the international community has acknowledged that it should leave the Somali people to choose either a resolution of their differences or a reversion back to a primitive era, where they are unable to maintain sovereignty or government. 4. It is therefore indispensible that Somali organizations meet soon and realisticaly work together toward finding a middle ground for compromise, so as to save the Somali nation and people from ruin. 5. In considering the Somaliland situation in the north, Mr. Abdirahman said the time had come when people should realize that the international community does not accept the path so far pursued by Somaliland toward recognition. The international community has clarified that it is up to Somalis to decide whether they will remain as one country or disintegrate into smaller different countries. Mr. Abdirahman Ahmed Ali said that Somali people living in the north and south of the country should sit down together and settle (?differences) through the wishes and rights of the people of the north and decide whether they will secede or will strengthen the unity and brotherhood of Somali people. 6. At the time the Siad Barre regime was toppled in 1991, the SNM had succeeded in creating peace and reconciliation among those communities belonging to the SNM as well as with others in the north. During the last several months the SNM has established contact and understanding between the SNM and other political organizations in the north. He said the SNM is now ready to make official contacts. 7. It is important that these issues be dealt with directly and that further talks take place among the various Somali groups, so as to arrive at a tangible solution to the differences and misunderstandings that have so far deprived the Somali people of a stable, tangible government. He said that the SNM will participate in all future Somali reconciliation conferences, as it has done before. 8. The SNM will adopt a position of neutrality concerning differences among the various groups, and will strive to narrow these differences in the best way, while eliminating mistrust. 9. After the SNM carries out its internal consultations and after it consults with communities outside the SNM and other political organizations, it will present a proposal based on a Federal Government, with every state having regional autonomy.
