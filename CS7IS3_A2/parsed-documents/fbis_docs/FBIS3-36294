As a member of the parliamentary commission on legislature and law Sergey Sobolev told the news agency Interfax-Ukraine, "the president becomes the head of state and represents Ukraine in international affairs, signs international treaties, and is entitled to cancel decisions of the Cabinet and implement a number of other duties." The supreme body of the executive power in the republic is the Cabinet, which is confirmed by the parliament. As a result, Sobolev said, "Ukraine actually becomes a parliamentary republic." The draft law on power also envisages that all authorities in regions are transferred to chairmen of local executive bodies, which should be elected popularly. The institution of presidential representatives in this case is eliminated. Speaking at a session of the Supreme Soviet the day before, its Chairman, Ivan Plyushch, spoke against holding a referendum on basic constitutional provisions about power in Ukraine on March 27. Earlier, this proposal was made by President Leonid Kravchuk. Plyushch believes that amendments to the organization of state power in Ukraine "should be made not through a referendum, but through the adoption of a constitutional law."
