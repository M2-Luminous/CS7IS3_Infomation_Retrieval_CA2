ANYONE WHO STILL HAS FAITH IN TOMORROW... As the saying goes, there are as many opinions as there are people. We were told in Zugdidi that Rayon Head Edisher Chargazia is a tough man. Some went so far as to say he's unfriendly or even crude. As it happens, we didn't get a chance to talk to Batoni Edisher. We did meet him, but our brief meeting, distinguished by impeccable courtesy, was not enough to say much even approximate, let alone specific, about the man, or rather his character. The most astute observation, in our opinion, came from a cheerful native of the village of Tkaia: "You won't get anywhere being nicey-nice; it takes sternness and toughness to tidy up this messy rayon of ours, and just because he doesn't pat everybody on the head, they think he's a heavy character." Indeed, the rayon head did not waste time being nice but swiftly kicked out the ideologues and financiers of the "resistance." He got rid of the managers of educational, cultural, and administrative bodies, retail and trade organizations, banks and many enterprises and establishments, and almost all village heads and assembly leaders who, through action or inaction, fostered regional destabilization and funneled large amounts of state and civic bodies' funds to followers of the ex-President. He installed new people in their place. In Chargazia's words, "We're not fighting those who 'think differently,' we're fighting those who would 'differently' destroy the country." We have already reported some of Zugdidi's destruction and ruination, which have impacted not only agriculture but also industry. Still, stabilization--despite difficulties (the shortage of electricity and petroleum products, the lack of raw materials, transportation problems, financial straits, and so on--has enabled Zugdidi's enterprises to resume operations. Programs have been worked out, local resources are being mobilized, old contacts are being restored, and the groundwork is being laid to resume full-capacity operation soon (this may sound a lot like officialese, but in this case we prefer it: officialese may be dry and bland, but it is incomparable in terms of conciseness). In short, the people of Zugdidi (like all of Georgia's people) are eager somehow to get the wheel-rusted, stripped and looted train of industry moving again after its tracks have been torn up fore and aft and the rails are scattered far and wide.... Zugdidi Chinaware Factory is one of the few enterprises which escaped looting and wrecking. Attempts were made on it, but not a single motor or machine was lost, even though the enterprise stood idle almost eight months. The reason is that Director Givi Soselia and his shop chiefs guarded it day and night with weapons in their hands. There was a time when the shops of this only-begotten child of the Georgian chinaware industry employed 800 workers; now, only 350 are left. But in this case, that "only" actually represents a victory: most of the republic's industrial enterprises are idle, while the Zugdidi Chinaware Factory is working, even if only at half capacity. "We resumed production in January," Batoni Givi told us. "People realized that this endless 'oppositionizing' and 'national disobedience' was going to destroy the country. The old way of life is gone. Furthermore, the working man craves to work and has eventually come back. The rayon's new leadership is helping us in every way. No 'witch hunt' is going on, nobody is going to persecute you for your belief if you are not guilty of a crime. People have realized that the reconciliation process is real and deep-seated, not just empty words...." Givi Soselia is a well known executive not only in the rayon but all over Georgia; he has almost three decades of experience as a manager and has been in charge of this factory for seven years now. He shrewdly foresaw the processes to be expected following the breakup of the USSR and the possibility that ties would be broken, and he took advance measures to stock up on raw materials, which are now so expensive and hard to import (96 percent of the raw materials the Zugdidi Chinaware Factory needs comes in from outside; it was planned that way from the start, and continues to this day!); now these supplies are enough for the factory to operate at full capacity for two years! But what then? What will it take to prevent the country from being exploited over imported raw materials? Then there are the endless crises, the destruction, hyperinflation and chaos. Soselia and his collective have to think about tomorrow. They are working with the Caucasian Mineralogical Institute and the Technical University's Chemistry and Geology departments to find ways to convert to Georgian raw materials. There are already some encouraging findings: in Bolnisskiy Rayon's Begtakari village they found a deposit of excellent kaolin, enough to last 200 to 300 years! Hence, soon Georgian chinaware will really be Georgian. It is also possible that 60 to 70 percent of the factory's output will meet European standards. The Zugdidi factory also has close ties with Germany's famous Dorset Firm, which is the leading supplier of chinaware and ceramics production lines to the world. The Dorset Firm has worked out a blueprint to rebuild the Zugdidi factory to accommodate the production of new items such as facing tiles and plumbing fixtures. German specialists will visit Georgia soon, and the question of further cooperation will be decided on the governmental level. Except for plates, the Zugdidi Chinaware Factory manufactures all kinds of dishware (because of erratic electricity and the high price of fuel oil, it can't manufacture plates--there are only two big kilns operating). We saw something that is unusual and rare in Georgia at the present time: construction going on. They are building a new, temporary cafeteria on the first floor (the factory's excellent permanent cafeteria was blown up in 1992--by the "resistance movement"). Every month the factory spends 50 million coupons so workers can buy meals at a discount. It may be a drop in the bucket, but it's real, it's progress. It shows the working man that the factory does care a little and is ready to help.... Scant months have passed since the terrifying, chaotic events of September-October, when many no longer believed that this impossibly disordered country could get back on its feet, when the administration and no more than a handful of Zugdidian policemen doggedly, tirelessly stood watch over the beleaguered factory, so that later, after the sun broke through again, the state wouldn't give it up for lost. So now it is working, turning out goods; Georgia's firstborn of chinaware is operating. Thanks are due to Batoni Givi Soselia and his comrades-in-arms. P.S. The factory people asked us to convey their thanks to the Zestafoni officers of the Internal Affairs Ministry's Property Protection Administration who patriotically came to their aid in November-December, and in addition to serving as alert sentinels, they shared their own food with the people who had taken refuge in the factory. A number of formerly idle enterprises have resumed operations in Zugdidi. All the tea industry facilities are operating, work is underway on restoration of the machine building plant, and two of the Inguri Pulp and Paper Combines' shops are operating. We personally tasted samples of Tarkhuna, a soft drink made by the Beer and Nonalcoholic Beverages Bottling Plant. It was pretty good, not bad at all! This plant is worth some discussion. The Enguri Firm (whose chairman of the board is Zurab Gogokhia), to which his plant belongs, happened to be founded in the time of troubles, and, as the saying goes, it bore the brunt of them. This relatively stable factory always did a fair job of meeting the region's needs, producing 25 to 30 tonnes of beer and 25,000 to 30,000 bottles of soft drinks a day. But for eight months now they haven't been brewing any beer, and in the past two months they have only supplied 40,000 bottles of soft drinks to consumers. This does not mean, however, that the enterprise is neglected and hopelessly dead. Not at all! We talked to deputy board chairmen Gigla Alshibaia and Tamaz Antia and engineer-technologist Tornike Gelendava. They are optimistic about the future. The enterprise came out of the civil war's destructive blows unhurt. The collective fought tooth and nail to save the factory. Gigla Alshibaia had this to say: "Every night, seven of us took turns guarding the place against looting. And we saved the plant's facilities. On the other hand, we failed to save the new enterprise we are building not far away. Two of the new facility's three stories were already completed, but somebody dismantled it and took the blocks away. It's a good thing that the production lines that had been bought for it were here and were saved. We can actually start making beer today, we have the necessary materials in stock, and all we need is a steady supply of electricity. As you know, the brewing of beer is a lengthy and complex process; if the electricity goes off it can do a lot of damage, the cycle is interrupted and beer that is almost ready has to be dumped." "But hey, you are making soft drinks. Do you have enough sugar?" "Instead of sugar we use syrup which we manage to find. As they say, 'Where there's a will there's a way.' In order to get uninterrupted power directly from the substation (they promise us this will soon happen), we spent our own money to switch the district's population over to a separate power line. Give us peace and quiet, and we'll run this like clockwork. We have many plans, and converting to leasing has made everything easier." We have cited the Chinaware Factory and the Enguri Firm to show that love of one's job, patriotism, and faithfulness to one's enterprise can do a lot. At a time when brother was fighting brother, and looting and robbing ruled, when it was every man for himself, and when destructiveness was no disgrace, these enterprises preserved people's hope for the future and did what was needed to make that hope a reality. The Odishi Tea Combine saved itself the same way (Demur Todua, director). We learned one remarkable fact--considering today's conditions, anyway: after making their inspection, the Finance Ministry's auditors awarded a prize to Rezo Kantaria, the head accountant of the Zugdidi Experimental Tea Combine (Nugzar Gulua, director) because of the excellence of his work. Zugdidi is licking its wounds, working hard and striving for normalcy, with great effort and toil, sometimes confidently and sometimes hesitantly. The process will probably go more quickly when the army of refugees goes back home. Today (according to the February count) 65,800 refugees have taken shelter there (26,000 in the city). There is hardly a family that hasn't taken someone in. Koki Sherozia's three-member family in Tkaia at one time, almost a whole month, had 37 relatives as guests. Today there are 12. There are many such families. The refugees are having a hard time of it. Sad to say, not all of them have a host. Dormitories, children's homes, administration buildings--and even cattle sheds--are packed. This huge mass of people are painfully concerned about every nuance of the negotiations about returning to Abkhazia. Anyone who has looked into the matter can detect processes which indicate that among them there are active political opponents working to foster destabilization. There are indications that agents of the enemy are working among them. One indicator of that, perhaps, was a provocative challenge which we ourselves witnessed: "Let us enter Abkhazia carrying white flags and, if there is no other way, register ourselves as Abkhazians." Along with this, a thousand rumors are being circulated, and some people, in despair, are seizing upon them eagerly. For example: "They say that the Abkhazians in the village of Chuburkhindzhi, Galskiy Rayon, have hung a big banner which reads, in Mingrelian, 'We must create an Abkhazian-Mingrelian Republic. Do not hinder us'"; or, "They say Ardzinba has said he won't bother the Mingrelians, he will repatriate them all, if they will change their passports and register as Mingrelians." A laughing matter? Not at all! Foreign and domestic enemies are cleverly exploiting the plight of the refugees, trying to fragment and corrupt people and pit them against one another, to launch a new wave of destabilization, to place the settlement of the Abkhazian question in jeopardy. Maybe someone will swallow the hook?! The main thing, however, is faith in the future. God forbid we should lose it.
