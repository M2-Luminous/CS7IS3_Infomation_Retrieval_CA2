He noted that Lebanon's sovereignty must be respected and any violation thereof is unacceptable. In remarks he made this evening, Musa added that the raid could negatively affect the peace process, noting that such acts are not acceptable for dealing with the existing problems. The foreign minister emphasized that Egypt clearly stands for the protection of Lebanon's sovereignty and called on Israel to stop such actions. Asked about Egypt's position regarding Lebanon's request to convene an urgent session of the Security Council to discuss the raid, Musa said that Lebanon naturally and undoubtedly has a right to make such request. Asked about Israel's claim that the objectives of its raid are purely military and not political, Musa said: We are now talking about peace, not military objectives. He added: If we want to give impetus to the peace process and create an atmosphere of peace, such measures are uncalled for. Asked if the nonaligned foreign ministers had discussed the raid, Musa said they had not, but it is possible that this issue may be raised at tomorrow's meetings.
