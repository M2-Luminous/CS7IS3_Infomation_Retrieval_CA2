It has been decided to modernize 65 F-104S's and to lease 24 Tornado-ADV's (Air Defense Variant) from the British government for 10 years. This gives Alenia (Finmeccanica group) a deep breath of oxygen from the industrial point of view, and also under a social profile, as the modernization program for the F-104's will mean that no additional personnel will be laid off from the Turin factories. Let us look at the two operations in detail. The contract was given to Alenia yesterday morning, and it is worth about 400 billion lire. It will ensure that the air force will have an interceptor fighter that, although it has an average life of 15 years, could acceptably carry out the role of short range interceptor fighter for another 10 years. The first renovated Starfighters, that will carry the initials ASAM (Updated Modified Avionics System) will be available for the four designated air bases at Cameri, Grossetto, Istrana, and Cervia, 18 months after the placing of the contract. The interventions of Alenia, and the other national subcontracting companies, mainly regard rewiring and the substitution of other systems, as well as the installation of a new and more potent inertia platform to assure more precise navigation. The aircraft will be armed with two Aim-9L Sidewinder missiles with infrared guidance systems, and a couple of Aspide missiles with radar guidance systems, built by Alenia. The 65 F-104's that are to be modernized will be chosen by the air force from the 120 airplanes of this type in their possession, giving priority to the airframes that have suffered less structural fatigue, and the last one will be delivered three years after the start of the program. Substantially it is an operation that tends to increase the overall reliability of the aircraft, without noticeably increasing its operational capacity, that remains the same as that of a jet that is over 20 years old. The other operation provides for the leasing of 24 Tornado-ADV's, that the RAF [Royal Air Force] has grounded since the end of East-West tensions. It is an aircraft that has 70 percent in common with the attack version of the Tornado, that was used by Italy during the Gulf War. The most notable differences are found in the electronics system, which has been optimized for long range interception, and amongst other things the ADV has a potent Fox Hunter firing radar produced by GEC. In fact 173 aircraft of this type were built. It was developed by British Aerospace to meet the threat of the Soviet Backfire some distance away from Britain. The contract is worth 700 billion lire spread out over 10 years, 270 billion lire will cover the leasing, and 430 billion lire will pay for spares, assistance, maintenance, manuals, and training for the pilots, and intercept officers, that are the mission commanders. The 24 Tornados will be assigned to the bases at Gioia del Colle and Trapani, covering a gap in our air defense in the Mediterranean area. Without doubt this operation will have a decisive influence on the British-Italian policy agreements for the Eurofighter-2000 program, as well as guaranteeing sufficient work for the technicians of Alenia, avoiding the possible dismembering of the company's work force, to cover the three years that still remain before the European program starts at an industrial level.
