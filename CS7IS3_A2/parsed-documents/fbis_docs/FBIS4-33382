In addition, two or three other persons entered the residence today, diplomatic sources told EFE. One of the Belgian officials told foreign journalists that he could "neither confirm nor deny" the report on the persons' entry. Several witnesses, however, said the people slipped into the building from neighboring houses' yards despite the presence of dozens of Cuban plainclothes and uniformed police. Three people left the house on Thursday. According to a report that the other would-be refugees filtered to the press, these people could be state security agents. Serafin Rodriguez, director of the Cuban Foreign Ministry's Europe Department, told EFE that the local authorities still do not have a list of the refugees, "which could be useful for many things, even to alert the ambassador, if necessary, about some of the people inside the building." Rodriguez said that a few days ago, the Belgian Government mentioned to the Cuban Government the possibility of sending in reinforcements to its four-person delegation in Havana. These reinforcements would include diplomats and technicians. "We accepted," Rodriguez said. On Thursday in Brussels, a spokesman reported that the authorities consider sending a small contingent of police -- not more than five -- to keep order in the interior of the ambassador's residence. Rodriguez said Cuban Foreign Ministry officials, Belgian Ambassador Paul Vermeirsch, and special envoy Willy Verriest have continued to talk and that the two sides agree that the occupants must leave. "The problem lies in getting them out," he said. Rodriguez said Cuba has "guaranteed in writing" that these people will not be tried for the occupation of the embassy building and that the offense "will not constitute aggravating circumstances in eventual trials." The fact that they created, inside the occupied residence, an organization, the Union of Cubans for Freedom, does not help, Rodriguez said, but he added that this is something that requires further study. Diplomatic sources commented that the Belgians perhaps should "apply some more heat and pressure" on the refugees to persuade them to leave the embassy.
