This looked as though the Russian Foreign Ministry and its head Andrey Kozyrev pursued a pro-Western line. This was, however, a policy of establishing partnership relations with the West in the context of a new balance of forces in the world," Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Kolokolov told INTERFAX. He said that "only through direct contacts with our Western partners could we prove that Russia was a great power. We had to establish partnership relations with those who could pose a danger to us." Kolokolov, just back from a European tour, said that he had consulted with heads of foreign mnistries in Austria, Slovakia, Germany and Switzerland on the Balkan, African and Middle East situations. He had also discussed these issues with heads of numerous UN agencies in Geneva. Kolokolov said that whoever he had conferred with had welcomed the increased Russian activity in the Balkans and the Middle East. "This is understandable because in the Yugoslavian crisis we are in equally good relations with all the warring parties, the Serbs, Croatians and Moslems," Kolokolov said.
