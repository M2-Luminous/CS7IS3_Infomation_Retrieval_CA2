He said a decision would be made shortly on when to resume the UNHCR land convoys crossing Serb territory to different points in Bosnia, which were also suspended Monday. "We are receiving the security assessments from UNPROFOR and UN observers in Bosnia. The trucks are loaded and ready to go. There is a good chance that the convoys will also be going," he said. More than 20 airlifts to bring supplies into Sarajevo were planned for Tuesday, he said. Though the airlifts and land convoys through Serb territory were halted, a dozen other land convoys went ahead as scheduled from Metzkovic for different towns in central Bosnia. Of the convoy blocked in Hadzici, Redmond confirmed it had been stopped in "Serb-controlled territory by about 100 women who were demanding the release of their husbands apparently detained by the government forces." "We will try again today to reason with them and get things going. If we do, it will be the first time in many months that we will be able to use that road," he said. In other developments, a prisoner exchange was made Tuesday between 128 Moslems who had been held by Bosnian Croats at Rodoc and 61 Croat prisonners detained in Jablanica, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Geneva said. The ICRC, which was supervising the exchange, said it had also started repatriating 200 displaced Croats, mostly women and children, who had been living in difficult circumstances in Jablanica. Most had asked to rejoin their families in Mostar, in southern Bosnia.
