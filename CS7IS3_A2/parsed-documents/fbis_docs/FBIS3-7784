Vujicic: "God -- The Only Controller"] [Text] One of the dailies published the news that "a close encounter between General Ratko Mladic, commander of the Srpska republic army, who was flying in his helicopter and two U.S. F-16 fighters has recently taken place in the skies above the former Bosnia-Herzegovina." According to this story, the U.S. fighters descended to the height at which general's helicopter was flying, waved to him with their wings and flew their own way. The air force of the Srpska republic army is not familiar with this event, however, in Bosnia -- a land of miracles, anything is possible. They say that on a clear night one can count more aircraft and helicopters in the sky above the former Bosnia-Herzegovina than there are stars. There is noone who has not been flying -- the command of Srpska republic army air force says -- especially since "the no-fly" directive. Since NATO aircraft began patrolling over this republic, the North Atlantic air force has carried out more than 12,000 flights above Bosnia, of which more than 7,000 were combat flights. As our source explains, NATO classifies as noncombat flights those that carry humanitarian aid and transport organization officials. The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], too, have carried out thousands of flights by airplanes and helicopters, and the air force of the Republic of Croatia does not pay much attention to the no-fly directive either. The Croats have actually never stopped flying over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in the latest Croatian Army and Croatian Defense Council operations in central Bosnia they have been using helicopters daily. According to foreign sources, the Muslim army has 14 Hind helicopters and four ultralight airplanes, which are also carrying our combat flights. Since they have been on this mission, NATO aircraft have not downed a single aircraft of either side. Our sources claim that the opportunity to do this presents itself some 10 to 20 occasions daily, which is how many Muslim and Croatian flights Serbian radars register over Bosnia on average. To illustrate this information, our source says that, for example, Serbian radars the day before yesterday registered 117 flights over this republic, 10 of which were carried out by the Croats and Muslims. God alone controls and coordinates these flights above Bosnia. NATO plans its routes and controls them from Vicenza [Italy] by means of AWACS aircraft in the Adriatic Sea. The Croats do this via Zagreb, and the Muslims most probably from Zenica, even though they surrendered control of the skies to the Croats in May 1992. UNPROFOR, although it cooperates with NATO, also uses its own systems for navigation of aircraft, most probably from Sarajevo. Must one should point out that there is no coordination between them. Finally, our source, who is otherwise a senior military expert in the Serbian Republic Army, says that it is a real miracle that there have been no crashes and major tragedies above Bosnia so far. He warns that anything is possible in the skies over Bosnia-Herzegovina, bearing in mind the absence of flight controllers. Such aa situation could be used against the Serbian side, which really flies only when it has to, that is, when wounded need to be transported to hospitals. [Box p 5] Blind Flights What distinguishes the flights of the Croats, the Muslims, and the Serbs over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina from NATO and UNPROFOR flights is that "home boys" try to avoid using radio during the flight in order to remain unnoticed. They are, therefore, flying blind as the local pilots know the terrain like their backyard. According to military circles, NATO fighters have more or less given up chasing these aircraft as pilots manage to mislead them and land on time. On the other hand, there have been cases of "remote control aircraft" being sent over mountain peaks to taunt U.S. radars and aircraft.
