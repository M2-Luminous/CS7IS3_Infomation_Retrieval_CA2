Before departing from Tokyo's Haneda Airport, Nazarbayev told reporters that the central Asian country will proceed with ongoing economic reform although he acknowledged it is impossible to achieve the reform without "pain." He also said that raising productivity through joint ventures with advanced countries, such as Japan, that have high technologies would contribute to preventing falling living standards of the people in the former Soviet republic. In a joint statement signed by Nazarbayev and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa Friday, Japan pledged to allocate 1,170 million yen to Kazakhstan to help dismantle its nuclear arsenal inherited from the former Soviet Union. Tokyo will also provide a loan totaling 12,982 million yen for improving railway infrastructure and tackling air pollution from thermal power stations. The Export-Import Bank of Japan will extend an untied loan valued at 220 million dollars to support its transition to a market economy.
