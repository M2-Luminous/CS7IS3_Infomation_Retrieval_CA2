Before leaving Cyprus this morning, Mr. Clark told CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] that in the end all the Cypriot people will pay the price for the failure of the talks. He noted that Rauf Denktas was very hasty in stating that the process had collapsed, and added that Denktas has ulterior motives for what he does and says. Mr. Clark added: I cannot say anything else except that Denktas intentionally and hastily said our efforts had collapsed. Mr. Clark said the United Nations must decide to continue its mission and to study seriously the suggestions he will submit later. Mr. Clark also noted that there has not been enough good faith or political will to solve the problems. When asked what should be done to create such a will, he said that in addition to the two leaders in Cyprus there are other voices which should probably be encouraged to take a bigger part in the consultations.
