As they settled down to bilateral talks, Gen. Abacha remarked that economic development and security in the West African subregion and Africa in general are best guaranteed by the cooperation of the African countries, but in the framework of groupings like the ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] and the OAU. State House correspondent Chris Ngu reports: [Begin recording] [Ngu] Gen. Abacha's opening speech at the bilateral talks was dominated by two themes: peace and economic development in the West African subregion. He told the Togolese delegation led by President Gnassingbe Eyadema that the pursuit of happiness for the people of both countries should be the cornerstone of leadership responsibility. He said that in the face of current economic and security problems in West Africa and developments in the world, subregional and regional cooperation of African countries becomes imperative. Gen. Abacha, however, noted that peace and economic development cannot be achieved in an atmosphere of strife and discord. He commended President Eyadema for what he referred to as the president's peace effort in Liberia, adding that peace efforts in Liberia should not be given up. [Abacha] I believe our resolve under ECOWAS which formed the basis of establishing ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] -- as a vehicle for establishing peace and security of the Liberian people, as a vehicle to which democratic forces will emerge in that country -- has to be pursued to its logical conclusion. The conflict in Liberia should not be allowed to continue forever. [Ngu] On relations between the two countries, he hoped that President Eyadema's visit will strengthen relations between Togo and Nigeria. President Eyadema, on his part, agreed with Gen. Abacha on the need for the warring factions in the Liberian crisis to work for peace. He said that no businessman, local or international, will like to invest in a country where peace and security cannot be guaranteed. President Eyadema said Nigeria's ECOMOG initiative is a fine example of a country that believes in peace and security of the subregion. Turning to the West African economy, he called for an emergency meeting to discuss global issues facing the subregion. A situation in which raw materials and export commodities from the West African countries continue to attract low prices and marked by depreciating national currencies should not be allowed continue. Delegations of the two countries went into a closed-door session. President Eyadema and his team, who flew in today, have left the country. [end recording]
