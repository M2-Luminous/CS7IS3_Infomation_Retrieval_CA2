He expressed his view to journalists, according to a REUTER report, after a meeting in Moscow with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who has arrived in the Russian capital to receive a literary prize. As is known, the other day the U.S. Congress decided on a unilateral dropping of the embargo on arms supplies to the Muslim side in the Bosnian conflict. The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that Russia, for its part, will not be taking similar steps vis-a-vis the Bosnian Serbs unless they are connected with a peaceful settlement of the crisis.
