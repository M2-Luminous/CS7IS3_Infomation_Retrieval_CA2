To the correspondent's remark that the formula is "take it or leave it" and that the lifting of the arms embargo and a continued implementation of the sanctions are proposed if the Serbian side does not accept the formula, Buha said that the international community has been warned hundreds of times that the conflict could then assume unforseeable proportions, as Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has warned. "I do not believe that the international community will allow things to get out of hand and take that course if the plan is not accepted. It is more likely that pressure will be put on all sides to reach a compromise, and perhaps a solution will be found within the new proposal, but with certain corrections. I believe the whole matter is in U.S. hands," Buha said. He said everything will become clearer in the next fortnight, after a series of talks. "The solution lies in the recognition of the three peoples' right to self-determination, that is, to having their states and territorial borders, and after that all sovereign nations would establish the sort of relations that suit them," Buha said.
