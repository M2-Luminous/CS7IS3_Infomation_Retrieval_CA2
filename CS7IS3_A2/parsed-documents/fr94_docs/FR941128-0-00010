FR941128-0-00010 FR941128-0-00004 Section 19(b)(11)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461 (b)(11)(B)) provides that $2 million of reservable liabilities 1 of each depository institution shall be subject to a zero percent reserve requirement. Section 19(b)(11)(A) permits each depository institution, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Board, to designate the reservable liabilities to which this reserve requirement exemption is to apply. However, if net transaction accounts are designated, only those that would otherwise be subject to a three percent reserve requirement (i.e., net transaction accounts within the low reserve requirement tranche) may be so designated. 1 Reservable liabilities include transaction accounts, nonpersonal time deposits, and Eurocurrency liabilities as defined in section 19(b)(5) of the Federal Reserve Act. The reserve ratio on nonpersonal time deposits and Eurocurrency liabilities is zero percent. Section 19(b)(11)(B) of the Federal Reserve Act provides that, before December 31 of each year, the Board shall issue a regulation adjusting for the next calendar year the dollar amount of reservable liabilities exempt from reserve requirements. Unlike the adjustment for the low reserve tranche on net transaction accounts, which adjustment can result in a decrease as well as an increase, the change in the exemption amount is to be made only if the total reservable liabilities held at all depository institutions increases from one year to the next. The percentage increase in the exemption is to be 80 percent of the increase in total reservable liabilities of all depository institutions as of the year ending June 30. Total reservable liabilities of all depository institutions from June 30, 1993, to June 30, 1994, increased by 5.0 percent (from $1,496.9 billion to $1,571.5 billion). Consequently, the reservable liabilities exemption amount for 1995 under section 19(b)(11)(B) will be increased by $0.2 million to $4.2 million. 2 2 Consistent with Board practice, the tranche and exemption amounts have been rounded to the nearest $0.1 million. The effect of the application of section 19(b) of the Federal Reserve Act to the change in the total net transaction accounts and the change in the total reservable liabilities from June 30, 1993, to June 30, 1994, is to increase the low reserve tranche to $54.0 million, to apply a zero percent reserve requirement on the first $4.2 million of transaction accounts, and to apply a three percent reserve requirement on the remainder of the low reserve tranche. The tranche adjustment and the reservable liabilities exemption adjustment for weekly reporting institutions will be effective on the reserve computation period beginning Tuesday, December 20, 1994, and on the corresponding reserve maintenance period beginning Thursday, December 22, 1994. For institutions that report quarterly, the tranche adjustment and the reservable liabilities exemption adjustment will be effective on the computation period beginning Tuesday, December 20, 1994, and on the reserve maintenance period beginning Thursday, January 19, 1995. In addition, all institutions currently submitting Form FR 2900 must continue to submit reports to the Federal Reserve under current reporting procedures. In order to reduce the reporting burden for small institutions, the Board has established a deposit reporting cutoff level to determine deposit reporting frequency. Institutions are screened during the second quarter of each year to determine reporting frequency beginning the following September. In July of 1988 the Board set the cutoff level at $40 million plus an amount equal to 80 percent of the annual rate of increase of total deposits. 3 In August of 1994, the Board replaced the single deposit cutoff level that had applied to both nonexempt and exempt institutions with separate cutoff levels. The cutoff level for nonexempt institutions, which determines whether they report (on FR 2900) quarterly or weekly, was raised from the indexed level of $44.8 million to $55.0 million. The deposit cutoff level for exempt institutions, which determines whether they report annually (on FR 2910a) or quarterly (on FR 2910q), remained at the indexed level of $44.8 million. 3 ``Total deposits'' as used in determining the cutoff level includes not only gross transaction deposits, savings accounts, and time deposits, but also reservable obligations of affiliates, ineligible acceptance liabilities, and net Eurocurrency liabilities. From June 30, 1993, to June 30, 1994, total deposits increased 0.9 percent, from $3,793.3 billion to $3,828.9 billion. Accordingly, the nonexempt deposit cutoff level will increase by $0.4 million to $55.4 million and the exempt deposit cutoff level will increase by $0.3 million to $45.1 million. Based on the indexation of the reservable liabilities exemption, the cutoff level for total deposits above which reports of deposits must be filed will rise from $4.0 million to $4.2 million. Institutions with total deposits below $4.2 million are excused from reporting if their deposits can be estimated from other data sources. The $55.4 million cutoff level for weekly versus quarterly FR 2900 reporting for nonexempt institutions, the $45.1 million cutoff level for quarterly FR 2910q versus annual FR 2910a reporting for exempt institutions, and the $4.2 million level threshold for reporting will be used in the second quarter 1995 deposits report screening process, and the adjustments will be made when the new deposit reporting panels are implemented in September 1995. All U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks and all Edge and agreement corporations, regardless of size, are required to file weekly the Report of Transaction Accounts, Other Deposits and Vault Cash (FR 2900). All other institutions that have reservable liabilities in excess of the exemption level of $4.2 million prescribed by section 19(b)(11) of the Federal Reserve Act (known as ``nonexempt institutions'') and total deposits at least equal to the nonexempt deposit cutoff level ($55.4 million) are also required to file weekly the Report of Transaction Accounts, Other Deposits and Vault Cash (FR 2900). However, nonexempt institutions with total deposits less than the nonexempt deposit cutoff level ($55.4 million), may file the FR 2900 quarterly for the twelve-month period starting September 1995. Institutions that obtain funds from non-U.S. sources or that have foreign branches or international banking facilities are required to file the Report of Certain Eurocurrency Transactions (FR 2950/2951) at the same frequency as they file the FR 2900. Institutions with reservable liabilities at or below the exemption level ($4.2 million) (known as exempt institutions) must file the Quarterly Report of Selected Deposits, Vault Cash, and Reservable Liabilities (FR 2910q) if their total deposits equal or exceed the exempt deposit cutoff level ($45.1 million). Exempt institutions with total deposits less than the exempt deposit cutoff level ($45.1 million) but at least equal to the exemption amount ($4.2 million) must file the Annual Report of Total Deposits and Reservable Liabilities (FR 2910a). Institutions that have total deposits less than the exemption amount ($4.2 million) are not required to file deposit reports if their deposits can be estimated from other data sources. Finally, the Board may require a depository institution to report on a weekly basis, regardless of the cutoff level, if the institution manipulates its total deposits and other reservable liabilities in order to qualify for quarterly reporting. Similarly, any depository institution that reports quarterly may be required to report weekly and to maintain appropriate reserve balances with its Reserve Bank if, during its computation period, it understates its usual reservable liabilities or it overstates the deductions allowed in computing required reserve balances.
