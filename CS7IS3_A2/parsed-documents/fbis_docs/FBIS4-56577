Frantz Robert Monde wrote to the U.S. President and the UN secretary general asking them to try to convince President Aristide to nominate a new prime minister in Haiti. It is the latest attempt at mediation from the president of the Lower Chamber, who indicates in his letter that any failure of this initiative would lead the parliament to fill the state vacuum. Here is a summary of the letters of President Monde to U.S. President Bill Clinton and to the UN secretary general, with Clarence Renois: [Begin Renois recording] It is a new approach by the president of the Chamber of Deputies. Frantz Robert Monde specifically addressed the president of the United States. He began by criticizing the attitude of the Democratic congressmen of the Black Caucus who, according to him, desire a solution to the Haitian crisis, even if it involves weapons and genocide. The president of the Chamber of Deputies also deplored to the U.S. president the behavior of President Aristide who, according to him, is trying to provoke an upheaval among the officers of the Haitian Armed Forces, and who stubbornly refuses to nominate a new prime minister because it would favor the application of the legislators' plan. Frantz Robert Monde, in writing, called on President Clinton's wisdom and clear-mindedness avoid the influence of the Black Caucus Democrats who, he says, are exploiting Haiti's crisis to pursue and defend their own interests. Frantz Robert Monde also pleaded with the president of the United States in favor of a national solution to the Haitian crisis. Only negotiations among Haitians, and the unemotional support of the international community can save what can still be saved in Haiti. The president of the Chamber also addressed the UN secretary general, soliciting his support in prompting Jean-Bertrand Aristide to nominate a prime minister. I call on your humanism and your high sense of morality, writes Frantz Robert Monde, who foresees, and I quote: If the United States does not succeed in convincing the president-in-exile to fill the political vacuum, the parliament will be left with a last resort, recognizing the persistent refusal of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to obey the Constitution's provisions. Following the consultations in Port-au-Prince, here is now the president of the Chamber of Deputies involving himself in a new approach, this time with the international community, specifically the world's highest authorities in order to find a solution to the crisis. It is only after consultations with U.S. President Bill Clinton and UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali that Frantz Robert Monde will consider applying the articles of the Constitution to emerge from the political deadlock.
