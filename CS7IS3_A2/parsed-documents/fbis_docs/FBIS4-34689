FBIS4-34689 "drlat121_m_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-121 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 Brazil Explosion at Army Headquarters Investigated Explosion at Army Headquarters Investigated PY2206125694 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2308 GMT 21 Jun 94 PY2206125694 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO Portuguese BFN [Text] Brasilia, 21 Jun (AE) -- The Army Ministry has ordered an investigation to find out who is responsible for the detonation of a home-made bomb last week in the Army headquarters in Brasilia. The bomb did not cause any damage but it made a lot of noise. A message found at the site of the explosion states: "War is not necessary, eating is," paraphrasing Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa. The message is interpreted as a warning over low military salaries. Army spokesman General Gilberto Serra denied the existence of the message and minimized the effects of the explosion at the Army headquarters, which is known in Brasilia as "Fort Apache." He said the initial investigations show it will be difficult to discover who is responsible for the explosion, which took place on the third floor of the Training and Research Department (DEP). The official report states that the explosion was caused more by a firecracker than a real bomb. The main report was drafted by a DEP colonel. The explosion was an "isolated incident that has nothing to do with salary demands." He said military personnel know of their chiefs' efforts to achieve a salary increase and know President Itamar has promised to improve their situation. "We must wait a little because everything depends on arrangements in the economic field," he said. Federal Administration Secretary Romildo Canhim today confirmed that a salary increase for civilian and military employees will be discussed and defined after the implementation of the new currency, the real. "It has already been decided, and a salary increase will not be discussed now," he said. Once the real is in circulation in July the government will resume discussions to implement the Equal Salary Law which foresees a 28 percent real increase for public servants, the minister said. The increase will come in August.
