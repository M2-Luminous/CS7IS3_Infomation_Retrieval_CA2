The move may provoke leaders in Beijing as the Chinese Government has instructed that the new property gains tax of between 30 percent to 60 percent had to come into effect across the country on January 1. "At present, the central government has no controls on local authorities regarding the implementation of the new tax regime," said Thomas Chan, reader in the department of business studies, Hong Kong Polytechnic. "But it is just a transitionary stage. The government will pressure all local officials to enforce the new system, probably after Chinese New Year," he added. Zeng Haorong, mayor of Haikou, the provincial capital, said yesterday in Hong Kong: "The province is studying the implementation of the new property gains tax. But, before the details are finalised, we will continue to impose the old property tax even for projects concluded after January 1." He gave no information about the timetable of the review, but added: "We have to be extremely careful about the introduction of the new property gains tax and ensure that foreign investors' confidence will not be hit." Property development is one of the largest industries on Hainan island, one of China's five special economic zones. Hainan has set up more than 140 development zones throughout the province. The island was also targeted under last July's campaign to clamp down on property speculation in China. The property industry was hit hard during the second half of last year. Mr Zeng, along with the director of Hainan's Economic Co- operation Department, Xiao Ceneng, and the mayor of Sanya, Wang Yongchun, attended the inauguration ceremony of the Hainan Institute at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).
