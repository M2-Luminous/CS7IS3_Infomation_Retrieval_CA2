Japanese and European Commission trade officials set the level of Japanese auto exports to the trading bloc in 1994 at 984,000 vehicles, up slightly from 980,000 for 1993, the officials said. The negotiations were based on a 1991 accord between the two sides to monitor Japanese car exports to the EU until the end of 1999, after which all EU restrictions on car imports will be lifted. In the talks in late February, the European Commission forecast no growth in European demand for cars this year, while Japan is looking for a slight increase. The levels set for 1993 had to be renegotiated in September after demand in the EU markets sank more than expected. The 1993 target represents a drop of 18.5 0.000000rom the previous year.
