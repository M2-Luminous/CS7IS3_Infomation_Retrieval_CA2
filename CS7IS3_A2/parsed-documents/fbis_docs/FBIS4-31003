FBIS4-31003 "dreeu106__a94015" FBIS-EEU-94-106-A Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Poll: 45 Percent See Senate as Unnecessary Poll: 45 Percent See Senate as Unnecessary AU0106123094 Prague CTK in English 1031 GMT 1 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0106123094 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, June 1 (CTK) -- Forty-five percent of Czechs believe that parliament should consist of the Chamber of Deputies alone, according to a survey of 946 people carried out by the Institute for Public Opinion Research (IVVM) at the end of April and the beginning of May. In November 1993 this figure was 42 percent, and this February it was 43 percent. Meanwhile, support for a two-chamber parliament to include a senate is down to 18 percent, having stood at 23 percent in November and 24 percent in February. Those who did not know formed 37 percent (earlier 35 and 33 percent). People who did not want a Senate were more likely to be Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) supporters, although they included also many Civic Democratic Party (ODS) supporters. The IVVM also asked respondents if they would take part in elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Senate and local authorities if such elections were to be held now. 71 percent said they would definitely or probably take part in Chamber of Deputies elections and 76 percent in local elections, but only 45 percent would take part in elections to the Senate. Willingness to participate in all three types of elections grew with the level of education reached.
