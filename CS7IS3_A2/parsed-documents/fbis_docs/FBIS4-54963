[Brazauskas] More steps will follow shortly. Order must be finally instated at the border between our two countries -- we are striving not only at reviving contacts among people, but also at facilitating the flow of merchandise. This has an enormous significance for bilateral trade and transit from the Scandinavian countries, Russia, and the Far East, to Poland and to the West. This could become a major source of revenue for both our countries. I also appreciate the significance of cultural ties and of ordinary human interactions, I mean in particular Poles living in Lithuania and Lithuanians living in Poland. So far, there has been a great deal of talk about this but right now -- after the signing of the treaty -- various organizations and associations will have the opportunity to spread their wings. They will be able to solve problems concerning national minorities that have not been settled yet or to which we have not paid enough attention. The treaty creates many opportunities, and it is up to us whether we will avail ourselves of these opportunities and to what extent we will improve our mutual relations which are burdened with historical legacies. Let us not forget that we are neighbors. That creates a commitment. [Graczyk] But both sides continue to be very distrustful of each other and old prejudices often emerge in various discussions. [Brazauskas] We have been meeting various Lithuanian citizens so I can say we do not value enough those contacts that are already in place. While talking to Poles living in Lithuania, I have never noticed that they have any political problems. Sure, they have economic problems, like all of us. Contrary to popular views, Poles and Lithuanians live alongside each other in peace in this country and there is no hostility between them. [Graczyk] But your optimism is not shared by many politicians on both sides of the border. [Brazauskas] Well, unfortunately some of those politicians incite and demonize problems which would not require this much attention under normal conditions. But I have faith that President Lech Walesa's historical visit to Lithuania will establish a long-awaited foundation for calming down moods and leaving complaints behind, both in Lithuania and in Poland. For some time to come, we have to take into account the noisy presence of "great patriots" who demand the impossible. [Graczyk] Against this backdrop, do you not fear problems with ratifying the treaty in the Lithuanian parliament? [Brazauskas] The most difficult stage is already behind us. There should be no problem with pushing the treaty through the Seimas [parliament], especially given that two-fifths of the votes will suffice for that purpose. I am sure we will manage to gain this many votes. Demonstrations and protests cannot change anything in that regard. After all, this is also about our security. [Graczyk] The "Partnership for Peace" proposal has recently brought back the idea of a so-called Baltic Sea-Black Sea community. [Brazauskas] It is just one of many ideas, nothing else. I am not an enthusiast of such alliances, especially military ones. My view is that we should have a uniform system of security for our countries. But economic alliances are a different story -- Baltic states already cooperate with one another very closely in many areas. So I think President Walesa will like the idea of developing cooperation between our three countries and the Visegrad group. I do not hide that we would be very interested in this kind of direction of development of our cooperation. After all, ever since we regained independence, we have been clearly saying: Destination -- West. [Graczyk] During a recent meeting of the three Baltic states' presidents in Palanga, it was said, among others, that the Polish-Lithuanian treaty should become the first step on this road. [Brazauskas] We agreed at the meeting that we will strive at making contacts with the Visegrad Group closer. It is an area of cooperation which suits us very much. I submitted exactly this proposal to President Walesa and I think that we will debate it further in Poland shortly.
