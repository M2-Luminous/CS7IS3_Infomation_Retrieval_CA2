At a rally addressed by the king near Newcastle today, a spokesman for the group said they would be at the disposal of the king. The king again told his followers that suppression would follow if they voted on April the 27th and 28th. Gary Alfonso reports: [Begin recording] [Alfonso] It was a day of contrasts which became a day of unity. Zulu impis [warriors] armed with spears and knobkieries danced passed the group of stone faced right-wing commando members. They have, however, one thing in common. They refused to acknowledge the state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal. The Zulus are defying the restrictions by carrying illegal traditional weapons. The right wingers have occupied a site in the center of Newcastle. Despite emergency regulations, they refused to budge. At Dick's Halt outside the town, King Goodwill Zwelithini told his followers their vote on election day would empower a central government that did not understand their needs. [Zwelithini] As long as central government continues to exist and the voice of the people is silent, the bigger our problems in the region will become. [Alfonso] A while later, a spokesman for the Boer Commando told the crowd what they apparently wanted to hear. [Boer Commando's Delarey Schoeman] We are here to tell the king of the Zulu people that our strength is his strength. Our power is his power. [loud applause] [Alfonso] The unit was cheered as they marched from the gathering site, and the king later officially opened a life-giving water supply scheme to the small Zulu community. An ANC rally in the same area was postponed to tomorrow. Most party supporters opted to go to Ladysmith to catch a glimpse of their leader. Newcastle is well known for its political divisions. Local ANC, IFP, and now right-wing officials say the area belongs to them. That claim will not be tested because thousands of people have been told not to go to the polls in less than two weeks' time. [end recording]
