He said that Crimea would welcome relations with Kiev similar to relations between Russia and Tatarstan. Meanwhile, Kiev has stated on many occasions that unlike Russia, Kiev was a unitary state and that the conclusion of such an agreement would go against the Ukrainian laws. Commenting on some of the Ukrainian politicians' plans to introduce direct presidential rule in Crimea, Karpov said that the implementation of such a plan would be unfair. He admitted, however, that the Crimean parliament's decision to restore the 1992 Constitution had been taken in haste. He noted that on the eve of the decision-making, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov had urged the deputies to put the decision off at least until autumn. Crimea's restored constitution provides for treaty-based relations with Ukraine and for the Crimean citizens' right to dual citizenship. Karpov believes that a commission of Crimean deputies and their Ukrainian colleagues could settle all the disputable issues. He also expressed the hope that a Ukrainian parliamentary delegation's forthcoming visit to Crimea would help ease tensions. "Crimea is always ready for compromise. The Crimean deputies have a good command of the language of compromise and diplomacy," said Karpov.
