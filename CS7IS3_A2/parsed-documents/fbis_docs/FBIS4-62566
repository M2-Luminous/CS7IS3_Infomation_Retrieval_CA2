On Monday talks were held between Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh with Russia's mediation. Marina Chernukha reports: [Chernukha] Open talks were held at the Russian Defense Ministry. Pavel Grachev insisted on it, in order that, as he put it, journalists could decide for themselves who is interested in settling the conflict and who is not. Probably, this had an affect as the sides agreed on a cease-fire already from the night of 16-17 May. An interstate group of experts will be working in Moscow throughout this night so that on Tuesday the leaders of the delegations could sign a protocol on a cease-fire and on settling the conflict. After this, as Grachev reported, on 19 May the protocol will be handed over to the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan for coordination and to the Russian president for his approval. Taking into account that this is the third attempt to settle the conflict with Russia's mediation, many people expressed doubts regarding its success. What is needed for it? After the talks we posed this question to Pavel Grachev: [Begin Grachev recording] Desire has to come from both sides, not from the people, but from the leaders of both sides. I hope there will be peace. Evidently it is the people who will not allow fighting. Enough is enough. At this time, in such a part of the world...you understand that when something is not working out and after a truce fighting flares up afresh, then somebody has a wish for and profits from this fighting. But remember that those who issue commands regarding military actions, they never take part in a war, they won't even go to the frontline. They always issue commands from the rear. [end recording] [Chernukha] Well, probably this time the politicians will act more carefully.
