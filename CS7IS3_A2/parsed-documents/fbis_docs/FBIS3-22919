Karadzic told reporters: "If we are in full control of the situation we can fully guarantee the safety of aid workers in (the self-proclaimed) republic of Serbska." He added: "But if there are going to be air strikes we may lose some control." "We would never give such an order to harm foreigners in our country. But if they strike us then that's going to be chaos and this chaos may command many things we would never command," Karadzic said. The foreign UN aid workers who were having trouble leaving Bosnia have reached Zagreb, a UN official said Saturday. UN foreign workers in Banja Luka in northern Bosnia were denied permission to leave for Zagreb on Wednesday because they lacked a 48-hour pass required by authorities. The workers reached Zagreb Saturday, UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokeswoman, Sylvana Foa, said in Geneva. She described comments made by Bosnian Serb deputy military commander Milan Gvero on Wednesday to TANJUG news agency about stopping UN aid workers from leaving the country as a "rather frustrated" reaction to NATO threats of air strikes.
