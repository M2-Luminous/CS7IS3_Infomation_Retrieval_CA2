According to her, the Serbs should condition the opening of Tuzla airport for humanitarian needs on the closure of land corridors bound for that town, which are now functioning perfectly well. She added that the Serbs have aready paid a high price for conceding Sarajevo airport to the United Nations; this particularly refers to the transport of wounded Serbs, who now need three and a half hours to reach hospital instead of 30 minutes as was the case before.
