FR941004-1-00098 FR941004-1-00018 Section 1357.20␣Child Abuse and Neglect Programs This section is revised to update and correct the citations to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act and to include the subject of those citations for clarity. Section 1357.30␣State Fiscal Requirements (Title IV&hyph;B, Subpart 1, Child Welfare Services) In this section, we are proposing a number of editorial and technical changes and one major policy change regarding time limits on expenditures for subpart 1 funds. The editorial and technical changes are: revising the section title to indicate that these fiscal provisions apply only to States receiving funds under title IV&hyph;B, subpart 1; adding titles as needed to all paragraphs in this section; redesignating paragraphs as needed for clarity; and adding a reference to title IV&hyph;B, subpart 1, in paragraphs (a), (d), (e)(3), and the introductory language to paragraphs (e) and (e)(2) for specificity and clarity. The major policy change regarding time limits on expenditures is found in new paragraph (i). Current rules in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section require an obligation period (within the year the Federal funds were awarded) and a liquidation period either ``within two years or the period within which claims must be filed under title IV&hyph;B, whichever is earlier.'' These requirements have proven to be unnecessarily confusing to and burdensome on States. Therefore, we propose to delete the requirement for an obligation period and propose that subpart 1 funds must be expended (liquidated) by September 30 of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the funds were awarded. This will mean an identical expenditure period for funds under title IV&hyph;B, subparts 1 and 2, and the independent living program. We believe this simplification and congruence of rules will be welcomed by States administering these programs. A conforming amendment has been made in 45 CFR 1355.30 to clarify that 45 CFR part 95, subpart A, is not applicable to title IV&hyph;B programs. Section 1357.32␣State Fiscal Requirements (Title IV&hyph;B, Subpart 2, Family Preservation and Family Support Services) We propose to add a new §1357.32 to specify the fiscal requirements for the State administration of title IV&hyph;B, subpart 2. We considered putting the fiscal requirements for both subpart 1 and subpart 2 of title IV&hyph;B in one section, but because of the considerable differences in statutory requirements, this did not appear to be a useful approach. The proposed regulation reflects statutory requirements in sections 432, 433, and 434 of the Act. In paragraph (d), the requirement for 75 percent Federal reimbursement of allowable expenditures and the matching rate also is taken from the Act (it is the same reimbursement rate for both subparts 1 and 2). The State's match may be computed either as 25 percent of total funds or 33 percent of the Federal share. Paragraph (e) contains the statutory requirement against supplantation, i.e., using subpart 2 funds to take the place of funds currently being spent for family support or family preservation services, thus reducing the level of services being provided. Section 432(a)(7) of the Act requires that funds under subpart 2 must not be used to supplant ``Federal or non-Federal funds'' for these services. We propose to define ``non-Federal'' to mean State and local public funds. Nongovernmental funds would not be included. We believe States should be held accountable for a maintenance of effort, and ACF will be collecting information annually on State level spending to monitor this provision. Local public entities will provide assurances on maintenance of effort to the State and maintain sufficient information to document this maintenance of effort upon request.
