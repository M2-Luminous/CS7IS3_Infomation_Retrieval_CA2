The previous record was 248.39 billion yen in 1980, the officials at the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said. Under the mutual aid system, farmers pay premiums to a governmental agricultural insurance body and in case of disaster receive insurance money depending on the extent of the damage suffered. In 1993, Japan's rice crops were the poorest in the postwar period, with the rice crop index remaining at 74, meaning extremely poor. The unseasonably cool, wet summer damaged the growth of rice plants across the nation. The officials said the ministry has so far paid the money to 1,366,000 farmers, about half the contracted farmers. Per capita payments averaged 321,600 yen, they said. Damage was most severe in Hokkaido, Miyagi and Aomori Prefectures, they added. For the payments, the ministry used part of revenue it gained from sales of imported rice, the officials said. The government made a profit by selling imported rice, which is far cheaper than the sum the government pays domestic producers, at the government sale price for domestic rice to protect Japanese farmers.
