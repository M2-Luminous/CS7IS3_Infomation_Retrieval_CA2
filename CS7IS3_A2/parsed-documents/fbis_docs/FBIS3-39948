For the first time, [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi has abandoned his crusading tone and opened up to Fini's right wing. He did it at the same time the leader of the AN was shaking the hand held out to him by [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi. "The right is ready to govern," Fini replied to the call put out by Berlusconi, who wants to transform the electoral agreement between Forza Italia, the Alliance, the League, and the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] into the political alignment destined to govern the country after 27 March. In the space of a single day, the moderate alignment took more than one step forward. Interviewed on Rete 4 [Fininvest TV station], it was Bossi who broke the ice. To speak of Fini's movement he took the long way around. He reiterated that the Fascist Party had become the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and that the MSI "then became something else again," implicitly admitting that a change was underway. "In parliament, Fini's group will be statist, whereas now it is antistatist," he noted with irony. Thus, it is possible to move from opposition to cooperation. That does not, however, include cooperation in the executive, the League secretary warned, "since they have to clean up their act." Bossi predicted support "from the outside," to cite him verbatim. In short, they are no longer "fascists" but "snails": even Bossi's words appear at least kindly this time. Is this just a momentary conversion? According to Roberto Maroni, the League's parliamentary floor leader, the AN will not form part of the government. The League and Forza Italia "have the consensus they need" and will form a minority executive to which "anyone can give their external support." Thus, Fini's deputies would not be unwelcome. A dialogue is underway -- albeit at a distance, and with all the necessary provisos (no to government posts, but yes to forming part of the majority) -- between the League and the AN. Moreover, an agreement has been concluded between Fini and Berlusconi. Opening the electoral campaign in the capital, the MSI secretary also dropped the "anti-everything" tone he used to adopt back in [former President] Cossiga's days, in the same way as the Forza Italia leader has toned down his anticommunist stance of recent days. The explanation is clear: Fini and Berlusconi are today opting for proposal rather than protest, since the polls show them on the up -- i.e., no longer in howling opposition, but in the lineup being put forward for the government. Fini stressed: "Moving from the first to the second republic must include overcoming the divisions of the past and bring about the union of Italians who are trying to roll up their sleeves and get down to work." Fini asked his followers to refuse the "left's policy of casting its opponents in the role of the Devil." He asked the moderates to "oppose the statism which links [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] Achille Occhetto, [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti, and [Italian Republican Party Chairman] Visentini today, and which will try to embrace [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli and [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni tomorrow." Bossi said of Segni: "I will let him come forward for a while and then I will strike him and beat him back, because I know that the DC [Christian Democratic Party] plus Segni will disappear from Italian politics in the new electoral system. Then it will be we and the former DC centrists, whom we are holding onto so they do not have to fall back into the oblivion left by the disappearance of their former party."
