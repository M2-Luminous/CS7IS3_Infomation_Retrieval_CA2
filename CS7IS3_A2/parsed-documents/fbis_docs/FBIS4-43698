PDS officials responsible for political coordination are to call a meeting of the National Council -- the miniparliament entrusted with the task of electing the secretary -- on 28 and 29 June. It will not be easy for D'Alema to take over the party's leadership, however. In order to do so, he will need to obtain a majority plus one in the National Council, comprising approximately 500 members -- but Occhetto intends to stand in the way. [Venice Mayor] Cacciari has invited the PDS to postpone the election until November and constitute an interim "directory" which will guide the transition process and enable the party to work out its position in relation to the progressive coalition as a whole. However, D'Alema cannot afford to wait: [L'UNITA editor] Veltroni might become a dangerous opponent.
