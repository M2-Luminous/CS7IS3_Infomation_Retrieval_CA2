FR940622-1-00069 FR940622-1-00029 Section 674.18␣Use of Funds The Amendments provide for an institution to transfer up to 25 percent of its Federal Capital Contribution allotment for an award year to either or both the FSEOG and FWS programs effective for the award years beginning on or after July 1, 1993. The Secretary proposes to amend this section to incorporate this new authority. Section 674.31␣Promissory Note The Secretary proposes to require an institution to use the promissory note that the Secretary has developed and approved and to prohibit the institution from changing any provisions of that note, as is the case with the promissory notes in the FFEL program and the Federal Direct Student Loan program. The notes approved by the Secretary will no longer appear as appendices in the regulations but will be provided in a ``Dear Colleague Letter.'' In accordance with provisions in the Amendments, the Secretary is also proposing to delete the defense of infancy provision in §674.31(a)(6). Section 674.33␣Repayment The Secretary is proposing, in accordance with amended section 464(c) of the HEA, to allow an institution to increase to $40 the minimum monthly repayment amount provided for in the loan agreement. This provision applies to loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after October 1, 1992, to a borrower who on the date the loan is made owes no balance on any Federal Perkins Loan or National Direct Student Loan. The Amendments also established forbearance of principal and interest, or principal only, as requested in writing by the borrower, if the borrower's monthly title IV, HEA loan repayment obligation equals or exceeds 20 percent of the borrower's monthly disposable income. The institution may also grant forbearance to a borrower if it identifies other reasons that warrant it. The Secretary proposes to add this provision to this section. To encourage repayment of defaulted loans, the Amendments provide that the Secretary may authorize an institution to compromise on the repayment of a loan if the borrower pays: (1) At least 90 percent of the loan; (2) all interest due; and (3) any collection fees due. The Secretary is proposing to include this authority in this section. Section 674.34␣Deferment of Repayment_Federal Perkins Loans and Direct Loans Made On or After July 1, 1993 Effective for loans made on or after July 1, 1993, the deferment provisions under the Federal Perkins Loan Program will change in accordance with amended section 464(c)(2)(A) of the HEA. The Secretary is proposing to revise the regulations to reflect this change. Loan repayment for these loans may be deferred for periods during which a borrower: (1) Is at least a half-time student; (2) is pursuing a course of study in a graduate fellowship program approved by the Secretary or in a rehabilitation training program for disabled individuals approved by the Secretary, excluding a medical internship or residency program; (3) is, for a period not to exceed three years, unable to find full-time employment; (4) is, for a period not to exceed three years, suffering an economic hardship; or (5) is engaged in service described under the cancellation provisions. The definition of economic hardship proposed in these regulations is the same as the definition of economic hardship as was proposed in the FFEL program notice of proposed rulemaking, published on March 24, 1994. The Secretary will incorporate the same definition of economic hardship into the Federal Perkins Loan, the FFEL, and the Federal Direct Student Loan program regulations based on public comments received on this notice, the FFEL program notice, the discussions of the negotiators during the Federal Direct Student Loan program negotiated rulemaking sessions, and the public comments received on proposed regulations in the Federal Direct Student Loan program. Section 674.35␣Deferment of Repayment_Federal Perkins Loans Made Before July 1, 1993 The Secretary is proposing to amend §674.35 in accordance with the National and Community Service Act of 1990, which provides that a borrower who is performing volunteer service that is comparable to service in the Peace Corps may be compensated at a rate not to exceed the Federal minimum wage and still qualify for a deferment.
