The request was made in connection with the fact that the Russian prosecutor's general office believes that Zhirinovskiy's book entitled "The Last Breakthrough to the South" gives grounds for instituting criminal proceedings against Zhirinovskiy. This was announced by the chairman of the State Duma, Ivan Rybkin, at its session today. The Duma Council is expected to look into the appeal on Thursday.
