Provide the Cellular Infrastructure Equipment Customer with such technical assistance and cooperation as may be reasonably necessary in order for the Customer both to accomplish such replacement or redeployment and to have the new manufacturer's equipment interoperate with AT&T products in that area or in an adjacent area, with AT&T providing this assistance in accord with reasonable pricing and business practices, including AT&T's right to receive reasonable compensation for such services and its right not to be required for these purposes to provide competing equipment suppliers with proprietary information that is not necessary to allow the interoperation of AT&T and non-AT&T equipment; and 2. Waive any contractual requirements that it receive prior notice of, or must consent to, redeployment by any customer of AT&T Cellular Infrastructure Equipment to a new location. In the event of deployment or sale, the Cellular Infrastructure Equipment Customer or new purchaser will succeed to the original purchaser's warranty, license, and other contractual rights, and AT&T's obligations under Sections V.A, V.B, V.C, and V.D of this Final Judgment shall apply to any new purchaser as if it had been the original purchaser. E. In the event that the United States, in its sole and unreviewable discretion, determines that AT&T has violated any of its duties under Sections V.A through V.D of this Final Judgment to an Unaffiliated Cellular Carrier in any area where that Unaffiliated Cellular Carrier competes with McCaw or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System, and where the Unaffiliated Cellular Carrier has deployed or contracted to deploy an AT&T Equipped Cellular System prior to the date of entry of this Final Judgment, AT&T shall be required to offer to buy back the AT&T Cellular Infrastructure Equipment hardware purchased or contracted for by that Unaffiliated Cellular Carrier for use in that Cellular System prior to the date of the entry of this Final Judgment, at their original purchase prices, less depreciation as calculated on a straight line basis over a period of ten years for switches and eight years for all other hardware, to offer to refund the proportionate share of all monies paid for unused portions of any licenses for software to be used with such hardware, and to offer to release the Unaffiliated Cellular Equipment Customer from future obligations relating to Cellular Infrastructure Equipment deployed in such Cellular System. The United States may, in its sole discretion, appoint an independent fact-finder to conduct the investigation or factual determination of any issue raised in connection with any alleged violation, reserving to the United States the right to make a final determination. In the event of any such appointment, the losing party ( i.e., the customer or AT&T) shall pay all costs and fees of the fact-finder. In stipulating to the entry of this Final Judgment, AT&T has irrevocably waived any right it may have to appeal, contest or otherwise challenge any adverse determination of the United States pursuant to this Section V.E. VI Applicability and Effect The provisions of this Final Judgment, applicable to each defendant, shall be binding upon said defendants, their successors and assigns, officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with each defendant who receive actual motive of this Final Judgment by personal service or otherwise. Each defendant and each person bound by the prior sentence shall cooperate in ensuring that the provisions of this Final Judgment are carried out. Neither this Final Judgment nor any of its terms or provisions shall constitute any evidence against, an admission by, or an estoppel against any party. The effective date of this Final Judgment shall be the date upon which it is entered. VII Compliance A. 1. AT&T will file plans for the implementation of the provisions of this Final Judgment with the United States Department of Justice not later than 90 days after the Final Judgment's entry. AT&T shall file a Structural Separation implementation plan describing its implementation of the provisions of Sections III and V.A.4; an Equal Access implementation plan for each McCaw Cellular System, describing its implementation of Section IV; and a Nonpublic Information implementation plan, describing its implementation of Section V.A. 2. AT&T shall supplement the plans required by Section VII.A.1 as necessary to describe the implementation of Equal Access in subsequently acquired Cellular Systems, and to describe significant changes in the matters reflected in the plans. 3. The plans shall be effective 90 days after filing with the Department, unless disapproved by the Department by written notice to AT&T, identifying the manner in which the plan is insufficient. The Department may in its discretion approve a plan in fewer than 90 days. In the absence of an effective plan, AT&T shall be enjoined as follows: a. In the absence of an effective Separation plan, AT&T shall comply with Section III of this Final Judgment without modification, and shall not perform Proprietary Development for McCaw. b. In the absence of an effective Equal Access plan, AT&T may not provide Interexchange Services to customers of McCaw Cellular Systems, except under arrangements that prevailed prior to the merger. c. In the absence of an effective Nonpublic Information plan, AT&T shall not sell Cellular Infrastructure Equipment to McCaw or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems, except that AT&T may sell Cellular Infrastructure Equipment to such Cellular Systems if they were AT&T Equipped Cellular Systems prior to the commencement of this action.
