FR940325-0-00034 FR940325-0-00009 E. Other Comments Related to Credit Accounting Change DDC and EMA requested that EPA expedite this rulemaking to allow the use of FIFO for the final report due in 1993 on the 1992 model year, because engine manufacturers claim that they had planned their production based on the assumption that the system in effect was essentially FIFO-based. On the other hand, NRDC commented that changing the credit accounting system ``midstream'' for the 1992 model year, when some of the 1994 model year engines are already being produced, is not acceptable because of the impact on air quality. EPA does not want to penalize those manufacturers who pulled ahead technology for the purposes of generating credits for the 1994&hyph;1996 model years and has decided to apply this change of credit accounting at the earliest possible time. In addition, these credits represent emission reductions that have already occurred and are subject to the environmental safeguards of discounting and limited credit life. Several comments by NRDC and MECA relate to the ABT program in general rather than to the specifics of this rulemaking. For example, the concern was raised that credits do not necessarily represent real emission reductions, but may reflect the shaving of safety margins. Responses to such comments are in the preamble to the final rule for ABT (55 FR 30584, 7/26/90). MECA also commented on the effects of this credit accounting change on the emission control manufacturers, specifically manufacturers of oxidation catalysts. MECA summarized the environmental benefits of using this particular emission control device and pointed out that lost revenues from decreased sales will negatively impact the amount of research and development that can be performed by these manufacturers. Manufacturers assert that switching to FIFO removes the disincentive to pull ahead new technology. Pull ahead provides opportunities to gain experience with new technology before having to use the technology more widely. F. Extension for Corrections to End-of-Year Reports Although other commenters did not indicate any concerns with the reporting period extension for corrections to end-of-year reports, NRDC commented that this extension may cause complications when rectifying compliance problems, because any problems presumably would not be detected until nine months after the end of the model year. However, engine manufacturers still must submit their initial end-of-year reports within 90 days after the end of the model year, and the possibilities of any compliance problems would be most evident in this particular report. These compliance problems may be mitigated later when all the credit-generating engines have been tracked to points of first retail sale by the submittal of this report. EPA will have the opportunity to initiate investigations if problems appear in end-of-year reports. The change here affects only the secondary reports, which are due after manufacturers have had more time to track engines to the point of first retail sale. Finally, because of the uncertainty for the manufacturers of the content and timing of this final rule, EPA will permit manufacturers to submit their revisions to the 1992 model year end-of-year reports within 15 days after the effective date of this rule. IV. Final Rule Requirements As a result of today's action, manufacturers of heavy-duty engines participating in the ABT program will be required to use credits scheduled to expire in the earliest model year before using credits that would expire in later model years, beginning with reports due in 1993 for the 1992 model year. Furthermore, manufacturers will have an additional 90 days beyond the original deadline for submitting corrections to their end-of-year reports, totalling to 270 days after the end of the year to submit the final reports. Display of OMB Control Numbers EPA is also amending the table of currently approved information collection request (ICR) control numbers issued by OMB for various regulations. This amendment updates the table to accurately display those information requirements contained in this final rule. This display of the OMB control number and its subsequent codification in the Code of Federal Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR 1320. The ICR was previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there is ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this table without prior notice and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would be unnecessary. For the same reasons, EPA also finds that there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). V.
