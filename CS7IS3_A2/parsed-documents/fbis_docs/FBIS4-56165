The Czech Government is prepared to enter negotiations on the creation of a free trade zone either between the Czech Republic and Brazil or between the countries of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) on the one hand and the Mercosur Association (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay) on the other, Klaus said at a press conference after his meetings with Amorim, Brazilian President Itamar Franco and other leading figures. Klaus spoke in favour of creating bilateral free trade zones when in Argentina and Chile on an earlier stage of his ten-day tour of South American countries. Amorim told CTK on Monday [25 April] a free trade zone should not be limited to the two states but rather include all Mercosur and CEFTA countries. He said he felt prospects for greater mutual trade were very good because the economies of Brazil and the Czech Republic had undergone great changes, privatisation and intensive liberalisation. Amorim hailed the agreement on economic cooperation and the mutual granting of most-favoured nation status which he signed with Klaus on Monday as the first step towards closer trading relations. But he also urged the two sides set up a joint commission, on the basis of an inter-governmental agreement, to ensure the political framework for bilateral business. Klaus said the drop in trade with Brazil over the last three years was only a temporary phenomenon and refused to draw any conclusions from it. He said the market was opening up and the volume of trade could be expected to increase. In foreign affairs Klaus said the two countries had many views in common, which allowed them to work together within the framework of the United Nations and elsewhere. Amorim said the UN Security Council should be enlarged if it were to remain legitimate in the new world. Developing countries should also be represented on it, he said. On Monday evening Klaus left for Sao Paulo where he is to meet the Sao Paulo state governor and meet university students before returning to Prague.
