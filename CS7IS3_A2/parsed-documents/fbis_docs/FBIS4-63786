According to V. Gulizadeh, this information has been confirmed by a deserter from the Armenian Army. The deserter said that the Armenians committed those actions since they knew that they would soon leave the occupied Azeri territory. V. Gilizadeh has also said that the Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev appealed to the Chairman of the CSCE's Minsk Group J. Eliasson and regular member states of the CSCE with a request to bring pressure to bear upon Armenia to stop committing barbarian actions on the Azeri territory. The President Aliyev has also appealed to the UN Secretary General Mr. Butrus-Ghali and asked him to inform the members of the UN Security Council about these crimes committed by Armenians. The state adviser thinks that the world community must pay attention to the felonies committed by the Armenian armed forces and take measures in order to stop barbarian actions.
