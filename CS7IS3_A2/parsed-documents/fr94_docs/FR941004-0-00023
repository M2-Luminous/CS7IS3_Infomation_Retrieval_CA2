FR941004-0-00023 FR941004-0-00009 40 CFR Part 52 [MA&hyph;24&hyph;1&hyph;6557; A&hyph;1&hyph;FRL&hyph;5074&hyph;8] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Massachusetts_Amendment to Massachusetts' SIP (for Ozone and for Carbon Monoxide) for Transit Systems Improvements and High Occupancy Vehicle Facilities in the Metropolitan Boston Air Pollution Control District) AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This revision establishes and requires the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Executive Office of Transportation and Construction to construct and operate specified transit facilities and high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes established therein. Implementation of the defined transportation projects will help reduce the use of automobiles, provide for additional transit facilities in the Metropolitan Boston Region, and improve traffic operations on the region's roadways, resulting in improved air quality. This action should have a beneficial effect on air quality because it is intended to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the Boston Metropolitan Area. The emissions to be reduced include hydrocarbons (ground-level ozone precursors) and carbon monoxide (CO). This action is being taken under sections 110 (a) and (l) of the Clean Air Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule will become effective on November 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours, by appointment at the Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, One Congress Street, 10th floor, Boston, MA; Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., (LE&hyph;131), Washington, DC 20460; and Division of Air Quality Control, Department of Environmental Protection, One Winter Street, 7th Floor, Boston, MA 02108. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Donald O. Cooke, (617) 565&hyph;3227. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2795), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The NPR proposed approval of a revision to Massachusetts' SIP for Transit Systems Improvements and HOV Facilities in the Metropolitan Boston Air Pollution Control District. The formal SIP revision was submitted by Massachusetts on December 9, 1991. This new regulation commits the Massachusetts Executive Office of Transportation and Construction (MA EOTC) to pursue implementation, monitoring, and enforcement of transit system improvements and HOV facilities listed in Table 1, that were identified as transportation and air quality mitigation measures in a 1990 Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the CA/THT project. EPA determined five of the proposed transportation control measures (TCMs) were necessary to help achieve an air quality benefit from the CA/THT. The Massachusetts regulation amends 310 CMR 7.00 by adding two new sections; 310 CMR 7.36_``Transit System Improvements,'' and 310 CMR 7.37_``High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes.''
