He said that 30 years have passed since the United States took a step for a total trade embargo against Cuba, but it has still failed to overthrow Cuba. North Korea has undergone more strict trade embargo sanctions by the United States for nearly 50 years than Cuba, he said, adding: In fact, North Korea is a communist state subjected to pressure and sanctions of the U.S. and the West for the longest period. Therefore, North Koreans will never be frightened by any "sanctions".
