He has long been the supreme commander-in-chief, Shevardnadze's aide Teimuraz Stepanov, who is currently in Moscow, told ITAR-TASS on Monday. Stepanov believes that Shevardnadze has made this decision in order not to create new tension in society. Perhaps in conditions of instability this is the only correct decision, the aide added.
