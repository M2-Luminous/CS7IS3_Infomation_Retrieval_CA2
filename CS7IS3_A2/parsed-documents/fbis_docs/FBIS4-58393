This has prompted British official circles to intervene to prevent its showing, under the pretext that it would influence the course of the investigation into the affair. Although the Great Jamahiriyah has nothing to do with this film, the British media are endeavoring to conceal facts from the British people and they pick out what serves Britain's colonial purposes without respecting the truth and without showing any desire to let the British masses know all the facts. This is the method used by the western states to black out the facts of this affair.
