"We can deliver our own position on the matter and seek Washington's support from the perspective of cooperation on criminal matters," Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said Saturday, suggesting that Seoul may oppose issuance of a residency permit. The embassy in Washington has been instructed to formally confirm reports that Kim has asked for a residency permit, commonly called a "green card." Kim, chief aide for diplomacy and national security under President No Tae-u, went to the United States in April last year as a guest researcher at the heritage foundation. Just few months after departure, an investigation implicated him in the taking of massive bribes in connection with the "Yulgok (military modernization)" project. Hong said the government learned about a week ago of Kim's application for a green card. "We will consult with the Justice Ministry in deciding what to do, if we need to ask for U.S. cooperation," he said. "But canceling Kim's passport is not an option under consideration."
