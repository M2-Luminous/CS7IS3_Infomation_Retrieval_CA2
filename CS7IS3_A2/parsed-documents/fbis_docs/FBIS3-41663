Michael Graetzel of the Physical Chemistry Institute of the Federal Technical College in Lausanne has succeeded in developing dye-coated titanium dioxide elements which are far simpler to make than conventional silicon solar cells. Graetzel told an international convention on solar and hydrogen technology in Freising a few weeks ago that the new solar cells are already being used in electronic bathroom scales. They are also used in solar-powered wrist watches, the material replacing the watch-glass. Although the output is only a few microwatts, it is quite sufficient for the watch mechanism. The starting point for Graetzel's idea was photosynthesis, the photochemical principle used by plants to obtain energy from sunlight. Graetzel's ``photoelectrochemical'' cell uses a dye to capture light quanta like chlorophyll does in plants. Graetzel found titanium dioxide to be a semiconductor material which transmits the photon charge as electricity in the form of electrons; tests have shown it to be extremely stable. The essential trick is to roughen the titanium dioxide coating to increase its surface area and thus the number of photons captured. In direct light the new solar cell currently achieves a 10 percent voltage efficiency. Graetzel believes the efficiency can be doubled in the next few years. By comparison, cells made from amorphous silicon, currently the cheapest material, reach an energy efficiency of only around 5 percent. In diffuse light, where silicon cells provide hardly any power worth mentioning, the efficiency of the titanium dioxide element is now already around 18 percent. This is chiefly because the titanium dioxide's rough nanocrystalline surface is suited to the spectrum of diffuse (longer wavelength) light. This makes the new technology of interest for applications in our latitudes since the solar cell can provide electricity even with a cloudy sky. Graetzel describes manufacture as relatively simple, requiring neither high temperatures, vacuum, nor nitrogen pressure chambers. Titanium dioxide can be applied to glass by screen printing. Titanium is also a common natural element, and titanium dioxide is nontoxic, unlike the semiconductors cadmium tellurite and copper indium diselenite, which are also used for solar cells. Graetzel said that a Gelsenkirchen plate glass firm intends to make 100 watt solar modules. A pilot plant for mass production will be ready there in three years' time. The material is expected to cut the current high costs for solar modules to one tenth.
