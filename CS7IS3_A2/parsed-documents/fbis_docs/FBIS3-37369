"The government is patently weak: It gives promises by the hour but does not realize that one can only give promises when each promise is realistically substantiated. The cabinet was reorganizing itself for a month, while ever fresh corrections of the budget were taking place," Mr. Fedorov stated. He also noted that while the Finance Ministry assessed real budget revenue at 80 to 90 trillion rubles a month ago, today it assesses it at 130 trillion although no new receipts have been registered. According to Mr. Fedorov, this is yet another attempt at window dressing. Correcting budget figures in this manner cannot result in stabilizing finances and, in Mr. Fedorov's view, is only applicable "in a bid to receive the next $1.5 billion from the IMF and to prove that reforms in Russia are continuing." The budget deficit, he declared, would amount under the present draft budget to 100 trillion rather than 40-50 trillion as was projected earlier, which would result in a collapse of the financial system and an explosion of hyperinflation three or so months after. As a result of "the government's flailing around," Mr. Fedorov believes, "the Pandora box has been opened: Production workers are threatening strikes, and numerous lobbyists are demanding money." However, he said, now many members of the current cabinet (including both Mr. Soskovets and Mr. Grachev) "are now ready to agree with me. Zaveryukha's greedy appetites are too immense." Boris Fedorov said that very soon the committee on budget, taxes, and prices is going to organize Duma hearings on the government's monetary policy, and he would like to hope that "these hearings will be different than the hearings on economic policy." Boris Fedorov, who last week was elected chairman of the Duma subcommittee on control over the Central Bank's activities, is obviously expecting Viktor Gerashchenko's report with interest. "I am prepared to embrace Mr. Gerashchenko," he declared, "I only still would like the Central Bank chairman to submit for Duma consideration not simply a one-page report as was the case in 1992, but to include in it a balance sheet of the bank's financial activities."
