Talking about family planning for the floating population, Peng Peiyun said: Guangdong Province, which is experiencing rapid economic development, tops the country in terms of the size of its floating population. It is very difficult to carry out family planning among this section of the population. In this regard Guangdong Province has provided a great deal of good experience. Peng Peiyun stressed that family planning is a long-term task. To do a good job in this respect we must rely on the party committee and the government and we, on our part, must exercise leadership well. In raising the question of exploring the potential of the leading stratum, we mean to encourage leading people to seek knowledge about the population theory so that they will have a better understanding of family planning work. So long as our leading people are enhancing their understanding, they will show greater initiative in family planning.
