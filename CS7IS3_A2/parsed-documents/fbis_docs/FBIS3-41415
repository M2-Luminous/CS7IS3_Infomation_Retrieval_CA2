The coordinating committee will meet regularly to develop a national strategy to maintain biodiversity domestically and overseas. It will also discuss proposals to take to the first conference of countries which are parties to the treaty scheduled for November. That conference will consider ways to fund developing countries' efforts to maintain biodiversity as well as consider policy on the transfer of biotechnology. The treaty, which came into effect last year, was drawn up at the United Nations-sponsored earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in June, 1992. Forty-nine countries have signed the treaty. Policy measures developed by the committee will be combined with measures adopted at the November conference for incorporation in an overall national strategy by the end of the year. The treaty covers the protection of endangered species, access to biological resources for commercial use, and the maintenance of the world's species' genetic pool.
