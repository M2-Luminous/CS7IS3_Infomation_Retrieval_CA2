[Kono] They are even worse than I expected. In particular, they have absolutely no capability of handling economic policies for redressing the recession. The government's pump-priming package came out too late, and it will cost a lot to make up the loss caused by the policy failure. As for its diplomatic policies, the coalition destroyed the favorable Japan-U.S. relations that had been built up by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. The LDP cannot support such an administration. We shall confront them. [Ogino] The LDP is taking a strong stand on the 100 million yen in loans to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa from the Sagawa Kyubin Co. Do you intend to defeat his government over this issue? [Kono] Right now, Mr. Hosokawa's involvement in the scandal is the primary reason for the public's distrust of politics. The public will never become confident in politicians unless he fully explains his own position. Depending on Mr. Hosokawa's attitude, our party may promote campaigns to defeat the cabinet. We will determine our course of action depending on Mr. Hosokawa's attitude. [Ogino] Several LDP leaders noted that the next general election may take place even before implementation of the new electoral system. What is your comment on the remarks by LDP members? [Kono] I do not really know whether those people meant that the election is technically possible or whether they actually want to hold the election right now. But, in my opinion, there are still certain possibilities of such an event. [Ogino] What do you say about the coalition parties' moves toward a realignment of political parties? [Kono] A certain circle in the coalition is discussing interparty tie-ups without consideration for a conformity of policies. I wonder whether it is worth calling such moves a political realignment. [Ogino] But even the LDP may be involved in the moves. Don't you think so? [Kono] The coalition is just seeking its own survival without dealing with pressing political issues. The LDP has a policy to cope with such an irresponsible administration. We have no intention of listening to proposals from them. [Ogino] Some of coalition parties are seeking the so-called great coalition with the LDP. [Kono] It may be possible for us to cooperate with the coalition in such fields as public welfare or national security, but this does not mean that we can support the coalition government. Any temptation (from coalition parties) will never damage the unity of the LDP. [Ogino] It appears that former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe is showing a positive stand toward a tie-up with the coalition.... [Kono] The LDP is various individuals, and members may hold various personal opinions. But I believe that their actual behavior as LDP members is another story. [Ogino] Do you think it is possible that a major breakup will occur in the LDP and that some members will join some groups in the coalition? [Kono] I think that is unlikely. The LDP is a party of various people who gathered under the great framework of liberalism, democracy, and the market economy. The LDP is functioning as a stabilizer of the Japanese political scene because it consists of wide-ranging political opinions. If the LDP were a more ideological and exclusionary party, the political scene would have been extremely unstable. [Ogino] What is your plan for adjusting the LDP's lower house members to the new single-seat constituency system? [Kono] The party's Internal Reform Headquarters is expected to formulate guidelines for the nomination of candidates in mid-April, and the Election Committee will prepare for election campaigns in line with the guidelines. I would like to prepare a well-planned system so that all our candidates can win. [Ogino] What is your strategy for winning back power? [Kono] It is very difficult to win back power when the Hosokawa administration maintains a high level of public support. However, the administration is rapidly losing its popularity because the public is becoming aware of its real nature. In particular, I am talking about the increase in its negative ratings. We will try our best to increase support for the LDP, and we must urge the Hosokawa administration to step down from power when it lose the support of the public. At the interpellation in the beginning of the present Diet session, Mr. Kono clearly said that "the Hosokawa administration is ready to be overthrown." However, it appeared that he still has no strong determination to seek the dissolution of the administration, or the lower house at any rate. While he said that the breakup of the LDP would "never" occur, the party is likely to face rough going hereafter over party tickets for the next general election.
