He can make it through the rain" -- this figurative description coming from a journalist gives you an extremely accurate idea of the U.S. ambassador in Moscow: 62-year old Thomas Pickering is a top-flight professional. His involvement in Bill Clinton's talks with Boris Yeltsin is not only a case of paying tribute to the norms of protocol. Pickering's prestige among the U.S. political elite is exceptionally high. Despite having spent just over six months in the Russian capital, the ambassador's view of what is happening in our country carries weight in the White House and is given consideration by Clinton. The unanimity of views is impressive. Americans, Russians, Israelis, and Arabs point to his brilliant analytical mind, good memory, rapid responses, and ability to conduct a conversation. "Pickering is a textbook diplomat," a U.S. correspondent in Moscow believes. His post in Russia is the seventh ambassadorial posting for a lawyer and historian with two university degrees. He first heard himself addressed as "Mr. Ambassador" in 1974, when he was appointed head of the U.S. mission in Jordan. Since then he has been to Nigeria, El Salvador, and Israel, led the U.S. mission to the United Nations, spent time in India, and lastly Moscow. "Late in the evening of 1 August 1990 I was attending a farewell dinner at the home of Britain's permanent UN representative," Pickering said. "The report of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait found me there. The Security Council worked the whole night through and at 0600 hours adopted the first resolution condemning Saddam Husayn." From that day on the diplomat became a television star. Journalists literally did not leave his side. The general opinion is that Pickering's openness played a cruel trick on him -- Secretary of State James Baker ultimately decided that his subordinate's popularity was greater than his own. With the result that in 1992 Pickering was dispatched to protect U.S. interests in Delhi. His appointment to Moscow heralded a kind of triumphal comeback for him. Fears whether Pickering, who had not previously tackled Russia, would be able to rapidly bring himself up to speed were dispelled. Smolensk Square does not conceal its respect for the ambassador. "He is very active and in just a few months has been able to set up such broad contacts at the highest level that some people who have spent two or three years in Moscow might envy him," an informed Russian diplomat said during a private conversation. The Foreign Ministry believes that, in tandem with Richard Miles, the new minister-counselor (the number two man at the embassy) and an expert on Russia, Pickering is capable of doing a great deal to develop bilateral relations. Of course, impeccable professionals do make blunders. It is rumored that, in the morning of 13 December, total confusion reigned at the traditional meeting of leading embassy staffers. No one was prepared for the dramatic Russian election result. It is a desire to avoid these kinds of surprises in the future, rather than hypothetical disappointment with Yeltsin and Gaydar, that accounts for the Americans' desire to expand contacts with various political forces. Pickering carefully avoids answering questions like "Will you invite Zhirinovskiy for cocktails?", although he does not conceal the fact that his subordinates have had contacts with "liberal-democrat" representatives. [Communist Party of the Russian Federation leader] Gennadiy Zyuganov was one of the guests at a reception in Vice President Gore's honor. "Less shock, more therapy" -- since the 12 December elections this phrase, highlighting Washington's renewed approach to offering Russia financial and technical aid, has become a stock phrase. Pickering confirms that the money granted to our country will be used to create social support and professional retraining centers designed to ease the impact of future unemployment. Conversion, the reconfiguration of enterprises, and the creation of new jobs all figure in the programs funded by the West and the United States directly. "The attention given to the social aspect of reforms does not mean that we can forget to combat inflation," the ambassador remarked. "It is necessary to rid ourselves of this evil for other than economic reasons. Historical experience reminds us that the development of hyperinflation jeopardizes the existence of democracy." Pickering is actively learning Russian (his sixth foreign language after French, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, and Swahili) and traveling a great deal -- in just over seven months he has managed to visit St. Petersburg, Tula, Nizhniy Novgorod, Ulan-Ude, Irkutsk, and the Far East. On weekends the ambassador and his wife go out of town -- they are very interested in Russian estate and church architecture. The ambassador loves Baroque music (particularly Bach), collects books on military history and biographies of famous people, and loves reading thrillers, particularly spy novels. "Some day Thomas Pickering will undoubtedly be deputy secretary of state," a U.S. journalist friend said when he learned that Clinton had appointed his personal friend and Russian specialist Strobe Talbott to this post at a reception in the vice president's honor. "Admittedly, he will most likely never get the post of head of the Department of State -- that is generally given to political appointees."
