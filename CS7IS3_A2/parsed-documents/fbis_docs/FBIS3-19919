However, according to a decision made by the government at its informal evening meeting a little while ago, there will be a passage of at least six nautical miles between the territorial waters of Finland and Estonia in the Gulf of Finland. Markku Lehto reports: [Lehto] Behind the government's decision in principle to extend Finland's territorial waters to 12 nautical miles lies, first of all, the need to monitor traffic off the Finnish coast more closely than before. Here is what Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto says: [Begin Haavisto recording] Well, I believe that now our Frontier Guards establishment, operating under the Interior Ministry, will have new kinds of possibilities, because now the distance within which we can take measures will increase considerably, that is, this will considerably improve Finland's security. [end recording] [Lehto] Another reason has been international pressure; our neighbors implemented the extension of their territorial waters earlier: Estonia extended its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles a year ago, and earlier both Russia and Sweden made a similar decision. The planned new nautical border for Finland differs from the main principle of 12 nautical miles in the Gulf of Finland and in (Bogskaer) of the Aaland Islands. A passage of three nautical miles of open sea will be reserved from the center toward the coast in the Gulf of Finland to meet the needs of shipping mainly near St. Petersburg at the end of the Gulf of Finland. The Estonians have also left a similar passage for Russian shipping, so that traffic to and from St. Petersburg can in future use a passage of six nautical miles.
