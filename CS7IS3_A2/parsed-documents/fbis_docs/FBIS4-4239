It has a planned annual production capacity of 600,000 tons of soda ash. The plant, a key construction project of China's Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-1990), involved an investment of 710 million yuan and is scheduled to produce 400,000 tons of light soda ash and 200,000 tons of heavy soda ash annually. Its main equipment has been imported from Germany, Japan and the United States. The project, which was started in April 1986 and completed in June 1989, was built on the largest salt production base in China -- Yangkou Salt Farm of Shandong along the Bohai Sea. Since it was put into production on a trial basis, it has produced more than 2.4 million tons of 100 percent pure soda ash, which has been sold in more than 20 provinces and regions in China and exported to 11 countries and regions. In 1993, it produced 640,000 tons of soda ash, 80,000 tons of which were sold abroad, accounting for one-eighth of the nation's total production and more than one-fifth of the country's soda ash exports. It has ranked among China's 500 largest industrial enterprises for three consecutive years.
