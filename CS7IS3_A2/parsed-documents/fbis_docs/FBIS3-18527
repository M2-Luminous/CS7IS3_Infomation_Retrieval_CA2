However, he has never before touched his ally's most sensitive nerve -- namely, his broadcasting empire -- so closely and, moreover, riding one of Forza Italia's own white horses. In fact, speaking in the town of Varese, the League leader said: "I will be very interested to see how the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] -- who speaks so much of liberalism -- reacts to what we will be saying about antitrust measures, when the League addresses the problem of competition. Liberalism," Bossi went on to explain, "cannot entail dominant economic positions, and therefore I will be interested to hear what Berlusconi has to say when we call his TV networks into question." In his Varese speech, however, Bossi did not limit himself to attacking Berlusconi's "treasures." He also accused Forza Italia, once again, of being an instrument created by the establishment to try to weaken the League. Despite this, Bossi did not seem to be afraid of contradicting himself by asserting that "if Forza Italia does not betray us in any way, we will make room for freedom even in a Catholic-communist country such as Italy, where liberalism has never before taken root." In any case, the Senator [Bossi nickname] is convinced that the League will be successful within the liberal-democratic coalition. Therefore "Forza Italia," he said, "which was launched by the DC [Former Christian Democratic Party] to destroy the League, is being used by us to destroy what is left of the old Catholic party." "This is why we entered into an agreement, but this agreement is only an electoral one." In order to permit his supporters to swallow the pill of being asked to vote indiscriminately for all the "liberty" lists, including Forza Italia, Bossi explained that, in single-member constituencies, where the choice is "unfortunately" compulsory, 70 percent of the candidates will, in any case, belong to the Bandwagon [League nickname], and only 30 percent will be Berlusconi's associates. "However, in the proportional vote," the Lombard leader emphasized, "you will be able to choose your political force, namely the League, and will not be forced to vote for Forza Italia, which was set up to rescue the establishment."
