In addition to the routine investigation that we conducted immediately after learning what happened at the produce market in Sarajevo, we also carried out an additional investigation, and we can say with certainty that the Serbs did not do this and that the Serbian side did not gain any political advantage. It is impossible to grasp that the Muslims would do something like this, and usually when we know that it was not us we are inclined to blame the other side. We have reached certain conclusions that a third side exists that is very interested in massacres such as this one happening, as certain political aims of foreign factors in former Bosnia-Herzegovina are thereby achieved. This said, we cannot today identify this side. There are many parties interested in preventing closer relations between the Serbs and the Muslims. They wanted to undermine these talks precisely at the moment when we were making positive progress on establishing trust between Serbs and Muslims, and when we were close to an agreement similar to the one signed with the Croats. We cannot now say that we cannot exclude the possibility of this being the Muslim side, but one thing is certain, and that is that the Serbs did not do this [sentence as heard].
