This was reported early yesterday evening by PT President Rui Falcao (state deputy for SP) [Sao Paulo]. A day earlier, PT presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said that he would accept Sarney's support. Lula said that the PT could not refuse to talk with the former president and that he will resume the north-south railway construction begun by Sarney. "There will be no agreement with Senator Sarney. The PT has not and will not seek him. We cannot forbid, however, anyone from demonstrating admiration for our candidate," Falcao said after the weekly meeting of the PT national executive board. Falcao, one of the leaders of the most radical PT wing, said the party cannot make an agreement with Sarney because his government was marked by recession and by the liberal distribution of radio and television stations [in exchange for political support]. Falcao believes that a political alliance between Lula and Sarney is "unthinkable." "The PT demonstrated what it thinks of Sarney when it struggled with all its might to prevent him from remaining in power for five years. No PT deputy voted for the extension of his term in office," the PT president said. The party is not disdaining Lula's idea of wanting Sarney's support, Falcao said, adding that Lula and the PT agree on one point: The objective is to win the votes of Sarney's followers. Despite the meeting held on 8 June between Deputies Aloizio Mercadante (PT-SP) and Jose Sarney Filho (PFL-MA) [Liberal Front Party - Maranhao] to discuss an alliance between Lula and Sarney, Falcao said there has never been an understanding on the subject. He said the "informal talks" between Aloizio and Sarney Filho were misinterpreted. According to Falcao, the PT's strategy will be to maintain direct contacts with Sarney's followers and convince them that Lula's government platform is the best to get the country through the crisis.
