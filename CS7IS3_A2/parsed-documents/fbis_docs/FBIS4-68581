But the State Committee on Antimonopoly Policy (GKAP) was not seriously counting on convincing all opponents right away--its aim was simply to acquaint First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets with an alternative point of view on this problem. [Begin box] Over the period 1992-1993, more than 225,000 certificates were issued for Russian production output, including about 180,000 for foodstuffs. In addition, about 108,000 certificates were issued for import production, of which about 100,000 were for foodstuffs. More than 2,600 product items failed to obtain a certificate due to lack of conformance with safety requirements, including 2,000 food product items. [End box] Sergey Bezverkhiy, chairman of the Committee on Standardization, Metrology, and Certification, presented his view of the problems of the department under today's conditions. In his words, Russia has presently subscribed to three international certification systems and talks are already nearing conclusion on the adoption of several others (certification of metals, composites, and railroad transportation). A number of unresolved problems exists in the domestic system, however. These problems deal primarily with the poor legislative base--Russia has only six legislative acts "covering" this sphere, while Japan has 33, the United States--160, and the European Community--over 300. In addition, transition from the Soviet certification system to a purely Russian one--GOST R [State Standards--Russia]--must be accompanied by a simultaneous reworking of the "Soviet" standards. However, the committee's capabilities do not permit rapid improvement and perfection of 26,000 old state standards. Oleg Soskovets concisely expressed his opinion of the report: "loud but incoherent." The first deputy prime minister devoted far greater attention to the report of the Antimonopoly Committee's expert who cast doubt overall upon the advisability of maintaining the Russian system of certification in its present form. In the opinion of GKAP, this system has at least two flaws. The first--mandatory receipt of a certificate of conformance with national state standards (which, incidentally, is a purely Russian invention)--provides no advantage to the Russian exporter from the practical point of view. In the West, the quality of Russian (Soviet) standards themselves still remains to be proved. Even on the domestic market, incidentally, the system of total certification has failed to improve the quality of goods. The second flaw lies in the fact that the Certification Committee combines commercial and control functions--the right to issue certificates of conformance is delegated only to testing centers and laboratories under the committee's jurisdiction. GKAP specialists presently have information on "deals" (between the certification company Rostest-Moscow and the Moscow Customs Office, for example), leading to the formation of a monopoly for this variety of service. [Begin box] Russia Subscribes to the Following International Certification Systems: --system of certification of means of road transportation (Geneva Convention of the European Economic Commission of the United Nations); --system of the International Electrical Engineering Commission for testing electrical equipment with respect to conformance with safety standards (accreditation of Russian laboratories within this framework is scheduled for May 1994); --the Brussels Convention on Reciprocal Recognition of Control Markings for Firearms and Ammunition (accreditation of Russian laboratories is scheduled for June 1994).
