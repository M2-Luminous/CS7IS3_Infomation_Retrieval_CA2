FR940214-2-00028 FR940214-2-00014 SoCalGas says that it will notify the Commission of the particular site of the border crossing no later than May 1, 1994. The export facilities will have a capacity of 40,000 Mcf per day. SoCalGas estimates the cost of the Bowker Road Alternative to be about §350,000 and the cost of the Calzada Justo Sierra Alternative to be about §590,000. SoCalGas says that the export facilities will be used to provide natural gas transportation service from receipt points on the SoCalGas systems to the United States_Mexico border. The rates for this service will be rates on file with, and approved by, the California Public Utilities Commission. Any third-party shippers or exporters will be required to obtain the proper export authorization from the United States Department of Energy, Office of Fossil Energy. A connecting pipeline to receive the exported natural gas will be built on the Mexican side of the border and operated by Petroleos Mexicanos. SoCalGas also describes certain other related facilities which are scheduled to be built by it in Imperial County. SoCalGas says that these facilities, (about 31 miles of pipeline, with appurtenances), are under the jurisdiction of the California Public Utilities Commission. SoCalGas says that they will be used to serve native California natural gas load, in conjunction with the export transportation service. SoCalGas says that this overall project will permit the export of natural gas to the City of Mexicali, Mexico, to serve both the existing local distribution system in Mexicali and industrial end-users in the Mexicali area. SoCalGas says that these customers presently use propane-air, liquefied petroleum gas, diesel fuel, high sulfur fuel oil and other petroleum products. SoCalGas says that the replacement of these products by natural gas will result in a reduction in air pollution in the U.S.-Mexico border area. SoCalGas requests that approval of this application be granted no later than June 1, 1994. Comment date: February 25, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 6.

Northern proposes to install a small volume measuring station and appurtenant facilities as a new delivery point to accommodate a new service by Peoples to Dodge City Cooperative Exchange, a commercial end-user. Northern indicates that the delivery point would be located at an existing farm tap in Section 34, T27S, R25W, Ford County, Kansas, and states that the gas would be provided to Peoples under Northern's currently effective transportation service agreement and rate schedules. Northern advises that the peak day and annual volumes are expected to be 24 Mcf per day and 5,000 Mcf, respectively. Northern estimates that the facilities would cost $1,890 which would be paid by Peoples as a contribution in aid of construction.
