The mediators have not yet found the magic word that will clear the reasoning of the Black Cockerel negotiators. It was necessary for UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye to resort to his rudest vocabulary to get the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] to behave in a manner more compatible with the spirit and letter of the aims of peace--particularly because there is also an urgent need for this great undertaking to succeed. The UN special representative managed to get UNITA to reduce its demands for participation in the future national police from 45 to 25 percent. He also managed to get UNITA to lower its demands for participation in the Riot Police from 50 to 30 percent. Nonetheless, those figures are still much higher than the 5 to 10 percent proposals put forth by the mediator and the government. It is for this reason that, over the last three days, the pressing [preceding word in English] has been applied and will continue to be applied unilaterally on the UNITA side.
