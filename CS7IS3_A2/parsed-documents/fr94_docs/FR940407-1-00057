FR940407-1-00057 FR940407-1-00012 Commenters in Docket No. 91&hyph;51 suggested several alternative allocation methods, including a method based on cargo carried on the outbound portion of the voyage or based on revenue generated by Commission and non-Commission regulated cargo. These proposals stemmed from the bifurcation of regulatory authority in the domestic offshore trades between the Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission. However, that split in jurisdiction has no direct connection with the costs a carrier incurs in providing service. The Commission shall not attempt to contrive an allocation methodology as a solution to an issue that can best be remedied by legislative action. The Federal Maritime Commission certifies pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(n), that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, including small businesses, small organizational units and small government jurisdictions. The Commission grants a waiver of the detailed reporting requirements to carriers which earn gross revenues of $25 million or less in a particular trade in accordance with 46 CFR 552.2(e). The collection of information requirements contained in this proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511), as amended. The incremental public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to range from an average of 41 hours to 65 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Sandra L. Kusumoto, Director, Bureau of Administration, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573 and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.
