In an interview with AL-AHRAM today, the minister said Jordan is eager to support the Arab League and realize the idea of comprehensive pan-Arab security to allow an Arab reconciliation and solidarity able to overcome the differences. He added that Jordan is also eager to forsake the past to enable the Arab nation to face up to its challenges and dangers. He said his country will not abandon the principles of the peace process in which it believes, primarily Security Council resolutions, the principle of land for peace, Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, primarily Jerusalem, and securing the Palestinians' legitimate rights, on top of which is their right to self-determination. On the blockade of the port of al-'Aqabah, which Jordan tried to link with the resumption of negotiations, he said the blockade causes huge losses to the Jordanian economy, adding that it was enforced as a result of the Gulf war to which Jordan was not a party and for the results of which it was not responsible. He added that Jordan presented legal documents to the United Nations and every country concerned and explained the need for and importance of lifting this blockade as a security measure to guarantee the region's stability and advance the peace process. Commenting on recent terrorist incidents in Jordan, Talal al- Hasan said they were isolated. They are being investigated and the law will take its course. He noted that Jordan has always enjoyed stability and security.
