He announced that before noon he had been visited by Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic, who had shown him a draft resolution by Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] deputies to be adopted by the National Council should the prime minister not agree to hold early elections in October this year. The resolution proposes to cancel some previous Cabinet decisions in the sphere of privatization of enterprises and to have the course of action taken by the prime minister and Julius Toth, the deputy prime minister and finance minister, investigated by the General Prosecutor's Office. The resolution calls on the two Cabinet officials to resign. In this context, Vladimir Meciar said that he is asking the General Prosecutor's Office to investigate the possibility of this being attempted political blackmail. He added that this illustrates the deep moral crisis of the politics of the SDL and others who participated in this action. Meciar went on to confirm that the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia held talks yesterday evening about a broad coalition with the representatives of the Slovak National Party, the SDL, and the Christian Democratic Movement. However, he rejected speculation that he had offered specific ministerial posts to SDL Deputy Chairman Peter Kanis.
