Brigade soldiers, together with the inhabitants of 'Imran, taught the adventurist gang a serious lesson. They proved that the people's resolve was invincible, and that the person who plays with fire will be the first one burned. This gang, which brags of imaginary victories achieved through its hired mercenaries, is ashamed to tell the truth, which is known by the sons of valiant 'Imran, who saw how the 3d Armored Brigade confronted the forces of defeatism and made them taste their evil in broad daylight. While we are saddened and regret the human and material losses suffered by the two sides, at the same time we hold those hired commanders of the ruling gang in Sanaa responsible, before our people and their armed forces, and before local, Arab and world public opinion, for the crimes they have perpetrated, as well as for any conflagration -- in which the greatest losers will be the Yemeni people, who have been patient for a long time. However, there are limits to patience. The Defense Ministry, which strove and is striving to prevent the situation from exploding, renews its appeal for an end to all criminal acts of combat against the units of the 3d Armored Brigade and innocent citizens, and for an end to the siege against these units as well, which would guarantee an evacuation of the wounded and the delivery of supplies. In this context, we call on international bodies and organizations, particularly those concerned with defending human rights, including the Yemeni Red Crescent, the Arab Red Crescent organizations and the International Red Cross, to carry out their humanitarian duties towards our brothers and sons in the 3d Armored Brigade, who are in danger of being annihilated by the ruling gang and its myrmidons. The Defense Ministry again warns against the consequences of continuing to play with fire and fanning the flames of a crushing civil war throughout the homeland. We are confident that our people and their Armed Forces, and all the honorable nationalist forces for whom the homeland and its sons are dear, will not stand aside as onlookers in the face of the danger that threatens the homeland and its unity.
