Tomanek on a news conference held by members of the Meciar-led "shadow cabinet" on board the Druzhba on 5 April on the occasion of the first anniversary of the daily REPUBLIKA: "Provisional Cabinet Is Afraid of Control"] [Excerpt] Gabcikovo--[Passage omitted] According to members of the shadow cabinet, the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] as the strongest coalition party has an interesting position. Even though the government includes 11 former members of the Communist Party, the wires are actually being pulled by the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH], through the important posts of state secretaries. [SDL Chairman] Peter Weiss has gotten rid of four SDL representatives who were ready, in the interest of stabilizing the Slovak Republic, to negotiate with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] by appointing them to posts. Pavol Kanis, Pavol Koncos, and Juraj Hrasko are ministers, and Lubomir Fogas is in the European Parliament. The SDL, which proclaims its social orientation, has given up these government departments and clearly goes after property through privatization. They Are Trading in Deputies According to members of the shadow cabinet, the provisional government will try, out of fear of the election outcome, to change the electoral law. By asserting a lowering of the 5-percent threshold [for winning seats in parliament], a greater number of parties would get into parliament, and the result would be a lasting destabilization of the political scene. The attempts by the coalition to gain 90 votes before the elections will probably continue. The elections would be in acute danger in that case. The government coalition keeps addressing eight to nine HZDS deputies, with seven-digit sums flying through the air. In spite of everything, Vladimir Meciar is confident of the HZDS's victory in the early democratic elections. [passage omitted]
