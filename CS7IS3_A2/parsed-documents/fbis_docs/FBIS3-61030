Russia Needs a Program To Develop Military Air Transport"] [Text] It was the third day of flying. The An-124 Ruslan airship, which took off from Melbourne, Australia, crossed over the South Pole, refueled in Brazil and Morocco; then crossed the North Pole, refueled once again at one of Russia's Far Eastern military airfields; and by the end of the third day closed the ring around the globe. I was lucky to participate in this flight. Piloted by two crews headed by test pilots Lieutenant General of Aviation L. Kozlov and Colonel Yu. Resnitskiy, in 3 days of flying the Ruslan set seven world and 10 all-Russian records. Three years have passed since then, but no one has yet been able to either surpass or repeat these accomplishments by Russian pilots. The fact that in three days of truly nonstop flight the airship never underwent technical maintenance (brief landings were made only for refueling) also says something about the high operating reliability of the Ruslan. This is the sort of aviation equipment Russian military air transport possesses. Military air transport. VTA [military air transport] is presently equipped with medium An-12 and Il-76 airplanes and heavy An-22 Antey and An-124 Ruslan airplanes. All of them are outfitted with reliable sighting and navigation systems and inter-aircraft navigation systems. This makes it possible to airlift troops and equipment, and land airborne forces day and night in adverse weather and navigating conditions, and in the presence of air defense countermeasures. The An-12 was the first specialized military transport airplane built in the Soviet Union. It is capable of parachute landing on two platforms weighing a total of 16 tonnes or 90 paratroopers, and of taking off from ill-prepared landing strips, including dirt strips of limited dimensions. It has shown itself to be simple to operate, and to be highly reliable in the most diverse geographic and climatic conditions. The An-22 Antey was the world's first heavy military air transport airplane. It was introduced two years before the similar American C-5 (1969). The dimensions of its cargo cabin (length without ramp 26.4 m, width and height 4.4 m each) permitted airlifting of almost all combat equipment of the ground forces and the equipment of other armed services, which practically solved the problem of airlift capability of combat equipment in those days. The demand for airplanes capable of carrying oversized cargo remains very high even today. The Il-76 (Il-76M, Il-76MD) has been the main airplane in VTA since 1974. Its different modifications have a maximum lifting capacity of from 28 to 43 tons. Airliner turbojet engines allow a cruising speed that is 1.5 times greater than that of the An-12. The dimensions of the cargo cabin (length 20.0 m, width 3.45 m, height 3.4 m) permit parachute landing of three or four platforms with a total weight of 42 tons, and make up to 75 percent of the combat equipment of the different armed services airliftable. The Ruslan An-124 is the world's largest military transport airplane. Its maximum operating take-off weight is 392 tonnes. The unique dimensions of the cargo cabin (36.5 x 6.4 x 4.4 m) permit transport of practically all combat equipment of the armed services. Possessing a lifting capacity and range that are two to three times greater than those of the An-22 and Il-76, it consumes 1.5-2 times less fuel per ton of airlifted cargo. I have managed to fly aboard all types of VTA airplanes in the line of duty. I know first-hand about the missions and problems of these air garrisons. There is good reason why aviators in miliary air transport are referred to as "laborers of the sky." Practically all crews in military air transport have experienced runs lasting many days to the most remote corners of the country, and to neighboring and distant countries. This, when due to the absence of travel money they had to eat and sleep aboard the airplane, when a fuel truck or an airfield engine starting unit had to be begged or "commandeered" from "alien" airports, and other such "life's tribulations." And despite the fact that these toilers get little in return for their nomadic way of life, they conscientiously fulfill their duty, sometimes at the limit of human endurance. Together with paratroopers, VTA crews were the first to arrive in Afghanistan and the last to leave. They were also the first to reach Armenia after the earthquake. In 20 days of December 1988 360 VTA airplanes flew over 1,200 sorties. They carried 380 truck-mounted cranes, 180 tractors, bulldozers and excavators, more than 10,000 tents and yurts, and over 37,000 tons of other equipment and cargo needed in the rescue efforts. I have been to the air force TsKP (central command post). Who in the air force flies on days off and even on holidays? Only VTA crews. They fly from 50 to 100 sorties daily. Despite the shortage of aviation fuel, spare parts and other expendables (this topic needs special discussion), the intensity of flying in VTA is high. I selected 1 December of this year at random, and asked: What routes were the crews flying that day? On this day VTA carried out 49 special assignments. (On other days this figure can double.) The planned assignments included: a) in the Transcaucasus--10 An-22 and Il-76 airplanes. Delivery of food, and transport of military dependents and refugees on the return leg; b) in the Western Group of Forces (Germany)--9 An-22 and Il-76 airplanes. Planned troop withdrawal; c) in Dushanbe--2 Il-76 airplanes. Delivery of food and medicine, and transport of military dependents and soldiers discharged into the reserves on the return leg. Five runs to Tiksy, Anadyr, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy and Vladivostok to carry food and goods to garrisons in the Far North and Far East were planned in the interests of the Central Trade Administration. In addition, five VTA regiments flew planned training flights on this day. In short, reports tossed out by some mass media suggesting that air force airplanes are laid up, that VTA just about disintegrated after the USSR collapsed, do not correspond to reality, to put it mildly.

Over 200 VTA airplanes remained beyond Russia's borders. Moreover, most of them were the latest modifications of the Il-76MD, and their flying time was still low. However, Russian VTA has basically been reorganized by now. Relocated air units are adapting themselves to their new places with difficulty, with considerable problems. And of course, VTA never stopped combat training for a single day. The Russian president, who recently visited Tula and saw the aviators at work, had high praise for the skill of air force personnel in general and VTA personnel in particular. Of course, as is true with the entire Army, maintenance of VTA is an expensive proposition for the state. Each airplane costs billions of rubles (for example a new Il-76 costs R6 billion), and each tonne of aviation fuel costs around R170,000. Given the present political and economic turmoil in the country, it is difficult, and almost impossible, to preserve and multiply the combat potential of VTA. But this is something that has to be done. No matter what competent specialists I spoke with, they were all unanimous in their opinion: In view of its economic and geographic position and political importance in the world arena, Russia needs military air transport like it needs air. Our country is one of the few states in the world in which there are large cities and there are places where entire peoples live and which can be reached, as that song goes, only by airplane. Their life support requires a huge air and ground transportation fleet. Furthermore, Russian territory is significantly greater in area for example than the United States. Given the reductions in the Army, we can no longer maintain identically strong groupings of ground and other forces in different regions. Consequently, their mobility is now acquiring very great significance. And only military air transport is able to support this mobility, to transfer forces quickly as reinforcements into a particular region. For example, the USA is also reducing its Army. But it is not reducing its military air transport--on the contrary it is increasing it. The forces and resources of military air transport and refueling aviation in the United States are under the Military Airlift Command--MAC. (Our refueling airplanes belong to strategic aviation.) The United States has one refueling air army and two military airlift armies under MAC. Each army consists of three strategic airlift wings (C-141 Starlifter, C-5A and C-5B Galaxy airplanes) and two tactical airlift wings (C-130 Hercules airplanes). According to data available to me there are 390 strategic and 640 tactical military transport airplanes in MAC today. In a time of full mobilization, the United States can bring in over 700 airplanes for strategic forces and cargo (this is not counting tactical military air transport). This is achieved by using reserves and dual-purpose civilian airliners. We, however, cannot use civilian airplanes when the need arises. The following examples say something about the high mobility of American forces. During the operations of United Nations multinational forces in Somalia (Operation Restore Hope), transport airplanes of the U.S. Air Force and civilian airplanes recruited for these purposes flew over 700 trips and transferred over 27,000 personnel and over 15,000 tonnes of cargo. During Operation Desert Storm 10,000 sorties were flown, and around 3,000 persons and over 270,000 tonnes of cargo were carried into the Persian Gulf zone from August 1990 to March 1991. In short, mobility of any forces would be unimaginable without military air transport. And the Americans, who know how to make every dollar count, invest sizable resources into it. For example, the forces will soon be receiving the new C-17 military transporter. Its experimental models have already been flying since 1987. Possessing economical engines and equipped with an air-to-air refueling system (by the way, all strategic military transporters of the USA have such a system), the C-17 can transport and land all types of organic weapons, forces and combat equipment. It is capable of operating from poorly prepared and dirt airfields with a short landing strip. So what about us? I am far from the notion that today's Russia should compete with the Americans in development of military air transport. It would be sufficient to say that the fleet of these aircraft is significantly smaller in our country than in the USA. Moreover, the missions of Russian VTA differ in many ways from the American organization. But as long as we have sufficiently powerful air transport (which is also useful to the national economy), and if we are thinking about not only preserving but also reinforcing VTA for the sake of the entire Army's mobility, then we need to consider the future. In my opinion, the future of VTA is uncertain today. All of the problems stem from insufficient financing. Had the Soviet Union not collapsed, and had the Russian treasury not been depleted, VTA would have begun receiving a new military transport airplane produced by S. Ilyushin's firm, which is not inferior to the American C-17, by as early as the current decade. But because of the absence of money, work on this aircraft is barely alive, and none of the plans for its commissioning are being met. The huge output capacities of aviation plants producing the Il-76MD and the An-124 Ruslan are currently standing idle, while the air force is unable to place orders for them because it has nothing with which to pay for them. It would be sufficient to say that in the last 3 years not a single airliner has been added to VTA. And in the meantime the existing fleet of airplanes is aging, their life is being used up. Two Antey aircraft have already served their full useful life, and have been written off and dismantled for spare parts. Airplanes are standing idle because of a shortage of storage batteries and tires (wheels), and because the engines have served their useful life. The engines are being repaired at plants, but there's no money with which to get them out of hock. If money isn't found by 1 January 1994, a third of the Ruslans and 12 percent of the Il-76 fleet will have to be laid up. But the airplanes aren't the worst of the problem. People have nowhere to live! As of today 5,240 families of servicemen just in VTA do not have living quarters. This includes around 2,000 pilots. This year 564 families received apartments. But this is just a drop in the bucket. At this rate, the earliest many of the people on today's waiting lists will acquire their own roof over their heads will be 9 years from now. The VTA commander is keeping a constant finger on the apartment problem. He has toured all of "his" garrisons with this problem in mind. For example, he reached an agreement with the local administration in Taganrog to immediately allocate 20 apartments ready for occupancy. A contract was drawn up, but there is money to pay for it. The amount--R470 million. Where is this money to be had? And in Orenburg, for example, he was able to reach agreement with the administration, and people (officers and their families) began moving in without making the prepayments. But such obliging people are rare today. As a rule they are operating according to the principle of the heroes Ilf and Petrov: Money in the morning, chairs in the evening. You can't sign for anything--such are market relations. Many new VTA garrisons do not even offer conditions for normal operation of airplanes. Assume for example that a regiment has been relocated to an airfield used previously by fighters, which are significantly smaller in size than VTA airplanes. The appropriate parking pads are needed, but there aren't any. Significantly larger containers for fuel, space for technical maintenance units and many, many other things are needed. But in the meantime maintenance must be carried on in bitter cold, at an airfield exposed to all four winds. People sometimes work in inhuman conditions, while receiving their pay 2-3 months late. Some are unable to endure, the fill out discharge applications, and sometimes you can't blame them. But the bulk, the core of the military collectives are staying together, and continuing to toil. Moreover they are working conscientiously. What is keeping them going? It's no longer fashionable today to speak in flowery phrases, but I can't find any epithets for these people other than "duty," "honor" and "conscience." In short, VTA lived in the past, is living now, and I think it will go on living in the future. Were the country's leadership to find the resources to support it, people capable of improving and strengthening military air transport are already in place.
