Two main issues were brought up: tactics related to prompting early elections and the centers of power within the SDS. Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the SDS National Coordinating Council, said elections are the only prudent alternative for Bulgaria's fate. However, he himself sees no real evidence that elections could take place by the end of the year. He appealed for unity within the SDS. Stefan Savov, chairman of the SDS parliamentary faction, said that the parliament is the heart of democracy. According to him, the blue [SDS] deputies blocked many recommunization bills, and they should continue to do so. According to Radical Democratic Party Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, the SDS faces both elections and a choice: whether to proceed toward a split or to head along the road of unity. Yordanov said that the presidency was seen for a long time as the basic enemy of the SDS, but this position has changed. The Radical Democrats, the Nikola Petkov Bulgarian Agrarian National Union [BZNS], the Democratic Party, and the Christian Democratic Center Union expressed the joint stance that the parliamentary boycott is a means and not an end in itself, and that it should be effected at an appropriate moment along with extraparliamentary pressure. The opposition of Ecoglasnost, the Conservative-Ecological Party, and certain local structures of the SDS did not surprise anyone. They demanded an immediate walkout from the parliament. Edvin Sugarev insisted that the conference should impose a decision on the parliamentary faction to boycott the parliament if the cabinet is successfully reshuffled. In this context, the old problem of the SDS coalition related to the centers of power emerged again. The Social Democrats of Ivan Kurtev proposed a single center of power -- the coalition's political organ and the national conference. They should be the only organs entitled to adopt political decisions. All those proposals will be incorporated in the program document, which the conference will adopt tomorrow. However, there are clear indications that the boycott of the parliament will be postponed, while the centralization of power within the coalition will be carried out. The BZNS of Anastasiya Mozer, the Monarchists, and the Christian Democratic Party were mentioned favorably as possible partners in a future coalition.
