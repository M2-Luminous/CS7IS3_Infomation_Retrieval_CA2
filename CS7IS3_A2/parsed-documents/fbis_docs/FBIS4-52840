Most of those at the meeting favored his reappointment although some opposed it. Thus, the leadership now plans to request Hosokawa to stay as party leader, and then make an official decision at a national meeting of party representatives in early June. There still remain differences of view on the issue within the party, however. While there is a group saying, "We will act with Mr. Hosokawa to the end," there is also a group that is critical of Hosokawa for his role in forming the floor group "Kaishin." Thus, it is possible that the question of Hosokawa needing to quit may come up again in the future. The meeting on the morning of 11 May of the 23-member standing committee was called to discuss the issue of who should be named to head the party. Most of the committee members shared the opinion: "If he resigns, the JNP will not be able to go on its own." However, when another meeting was held with all party Diet members attending later in the afternoon, voices of strong discontent erupted with some members saying: "Our mission is to achieve political reform, and Mr. Hosokawa betrayed it."
