Opening the debate on the restructuring of the Research Councils in the House of Commons, Mr Waldegrave announced that 15.4 million pounds, derived from additional funds and reallocated resources, will be made available to "demonstrate our commitment to the new partnership between the Research Councils and industry." The 15.4 million pounds will be used for a number of initiatives including: -- a new competitive scheme to encourage researchers to collaborate with industry. The grants will be complementary to the funding provided by industry for strategic research. A small pilot scheme will be run with funding of 3.5 million pounds in 1994-95. The awards will be named ROPAs after the White Paper, "Realising our Potential". The pilot will be coordinated and run by three Research Councils - the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) -- an additional 0.6 million pounds to the CASE Awards available to firms which have demonstrated their ability to provide the right environment for postgraduate training in the past -- priority in the distribution of research funds to areas identified by industry as being of strategic importance. For example 2 million pounds to the innovative manufacturing programme, 3.4 million pounds to the human and animal genome and immunology programmes and 4.5 million pounds to chemistry. Commenting on the new ROPA scheme Mr Waldegrave said: "The unique feature of this scheme is that the conventional peer review system will not be used but industry's recognition of the researchers will be taken as an indicator of quality and relevance. It gives industry a major role in identifying the researchers, who will be eligible to apply for support for strategic research." Mr Waldegrave concluded by emphasising the importance partnership will play in taking forward the policies of the science White Paper: "Government took a strategic look at what scientific research and postgraduate training it should fund. And Government has resolved to build on existing strengths to create a closer and more systematic relationship with the science and engineering base, industry and commerce. "The new initiatives I have announced today will go a long way to furthering those objectives. I congratulate Sir John Cadogan, the new Director General of Research Councils on the imaginative programme he has designed." Detailed allocations to the Research Councils were announced today by Mr Waldegrave in reply to a parliamentary question from Cheryl Gillan MP, (Chesham and Amersham). Mr Waldegrave also placed in the Library of the House a paper setting out in more detail the allocation of the 15.4 million pounds to new programmes.
