Francesco Speroni, minister for institutional reform, is off, and he has no intention of stopping. The start was a very fast one, with the majority expressing immediate agreement on his bill. [Caviglia] It must have been hard to persuade your government allies. [Speroni] Not at all. As far as federalism is concerned, the National Alliance is still putting up a fight, but I see no insuperable difficulties. All that was needed the other day was an hour's discussion, more by way of clarification than anything else. The only annoying thing was that I had to get up at six in the morning to get to the meeting. [Caviglia] Can the double ticket of federalism and presidentialism bring everyone into agreement? [Speroni] It would be fine with me; I have always been a presidentialist. But let us get something straight: The direct election of the presidents of the regions does not mean presidentialism. It is the same system used to elect mayors. [Caviglia] Now that you have taken the first step, will you tell us which ones you intend to take next? [Speroni] The next step is definitely the appointment of the panel of experts whose job it will be to revise the Constitution. What we have just agreed on is nothing more than a partial bill on the regions, a portion of the constitutional reform that is being brought forward so that the 1995 elections can be held under the new system. The rest will come with the reform of the Constitution along federal lines. [Caviglia] Who will be the members of this panel? In recent weeks there has been talk of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] constitutionalist Augusto Barbera, as a gesture of goodwill toward the opposition parties. [Speroni] Unfortunately, Barbera cannot be on it because he is tied up all summer with a lecture tour in England, but he is willing to help. I still want to widen the debate to include the opposition parties. Federalism is a heritage shared by all who believe in it, not a matter of majority and opposition. [Caviglia] And what about Miglio [of the Northern League]? [Speroni] Miglio will not be involved, but only because he has declined the offer, twice since the government was formed. I can hardly go down on my knees and beg him. [Caviglia] How long do you think it will take to complete the federal reform? [Speroni] Well, it is definitely not a matter that can be settled in three months. The only one who managed that was de Gaulle, but he did it by going over parliament's head, and I have no intention at all of doing that. The new Constitution must not be the constitution according to Speroni or Berlusconi; it must be what all the Italians want.
