On Friday afternoon, various social organizations held a demonstration in downtown Mexico City. Approximately 5,000 persons were there to commemorate the 23d anniversary of the 10 June 1971 disturbances. People of all ages took to the streets in the old section of Santo Tomas; they walked along Puente de Alvarado Avenue. When they reached the corner with Zaragoza Street in the Guerrero neighborhood, a bus driver, who did not stop for the marchers, ran over two persons. Israel Lopez, age 25, who was driving the bus with Mexico State license plate No. 96JWV of Route 65, ran over Angel Sotero, age 48, and Victor Padilla Flores. Both were taken to the Ruben Lenero Hospital with fractures and internal injuries. A group of demonstrators wanted to lynch the bus driver and tried to turn the bus over. Judicial police took him away and protected him and later took him to the patrol station, which the demonstrators covered with spray paint. Israel Lopez was turned over to the Investigation Department No. 7 of the Federal District. Among the demonstrators were people from the Francisco Villa Front, who two weeks ago, blocked the Ignacio Zaragoza Avenue. A female photographer, who was covering the demonstration, had to defend herself against two female marchers who started beating her up. Acts of aggression and attacks against reporters, cameramen, and photographers followed. The demonstration continued down Hidalgo Avenue, Eje Central, and Madero Street until the marchers reached El Zocalo. The main gates and the front entrance of the National Palace were spray painted, and the demonstrators shouted insults against the government.
