He condemned the silence and time-wasting of the Security Council in response to the Serbs' aggression and said: Of all the resolutions passed by this council, only the resolution imposing an arms embargo on the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina is being implemented. This in itself encourages the Serbs to further carry on with their aggression and blood shedding. On the downing of two U.S. helicopters by the fighters of the same country in northern Iraq, he said that this would lead to instability and insecurity for all the countries of the region and added that the downing was a result of America's domineering policies.
