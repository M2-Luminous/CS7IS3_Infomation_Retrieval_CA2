FR941006-0-00017 FR941006-0-00004 Stability Allocation Recognizing that State agencies may already have participants on the program supported with the grant funds each State agency received in the prior year, the formula strives to protect this service depending on total funds available. A stability allocation is provided to protect prior year grant levels contingent on availability of funds. If funds are not adequate to fully fund prior year grants, all State agencies will receive a prorata reduction from their prior year grant level commensurate with the shortfall of available funds. If funds are available, each State agency would receive a stability allocation equal to its final authorized grant level as of September 30 of the prior fiscal year. If funds are still available, all State agencies will receive an inflation adjustment. This inflation adjustment will reflect the anticipated rate of food cost increases as determined by the Department. Should funds be inadequate to fully meet this adjustment, each State agency will receive an equal percent inflation increase as permitted by the amount of funds available. Growth Allocation If funds remain after the stability allocation, then these funds are provided for a `` growth allocation ''. The growth allocation gives additional funds to each State agency which has an inflation-adjusted stability allocation which is less than its fair share allocation. The formula subtracts each State agency's current year stability allocation from its fair share allocation to determine the dollar shortfall. Each State agency's shortfall, as a percent of all State agency's shortfalls, yields its percent share of the funds available for the growth allocation. Example of Formula Allocation Process The example below describes allocation steps for stability and growth. First, all State agencies have received at least their prior year final grant, which totaled $4,500. As $5,000 is available to allocate in this case, funds are sufficient to do both stability and growth allocations. 1. Stability Allocation. All State agencies receive an inflationary increase, based on full inflation, to the extent permitted by available funding. In this example, available funding permits the entire inflationary increase: ␣ 1State agency 1Fair share 1Prior year final grant 1Inflation 3% 1Stability grant A $1,000 $1,100 33 $1,133 B 2,500 2,000 60 2,060 C 1,500 1,400 42 1,442 n,s Total 5,000 4,500 135 4,635 Funds remaining=$365 2. Growth Allocation. Under fair share State agencies get a proportion of remaining funds based on the shortfall between their fair share allocation and stability grant. In the example below, the $365 available for growth funding is shared by States B and C according to their respective shortfalls from their fair share allocations. ␣ 1State agency 1Fair share 1Stability grant 1Shortfall 1$$ 2Pct. 1Funds rec'd 1Final grant A $1,000 $1,133 NA NA NA $1,133 B 2,500 2,060 $440 88 $322 2,382 C 1,500 1,442 58 12 43 1,485 n,s Total 5,000 4,635 498 100 365 5,000 Funds remaining=$0 If any funds allocated in the two steps above cannot be used and are declined by one or more State agencies, then these funds are allocated, using the method in Step 2, to the under fair share State agencies which have the ability to use more funds. If all funds are still not distributed, then these remaining funds would be allocated to State agencies which have a stability allocation which is at or greater than its fair share allocation. Each of these State agencies which can document the need for additional funds will be eligible to receive additional funds based on the difference between its stability allocation level and fair share allocation. State agencies closest to their fair share allocation shall receive first consideration. The Department recognizes that being at or over fair share is a statistical definition that may or may not accurately indicate the actual need for funding to serve all eligibles within that State. Therefore, over fair share States must have the opportunity to receive additional funds, should the funding be available. For instance, in the example above, State A would be able to receive funds declined by State B or C. In this way, the precedence for funding will be to increase funding to under fair share State agencies to the extent possible, while still allowing State agencies that are over their fair share level to receive additional funds when a documented need for additional funds exists. Additionally, over fair share States must demonstrate effective efforts to control food package costs. All grants awarded through this process would become the basis of the following year's stability allocation.
