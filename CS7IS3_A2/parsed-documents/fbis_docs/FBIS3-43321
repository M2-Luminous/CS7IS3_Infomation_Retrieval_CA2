The Spanish envoy, who was called for consultations by his government, left for Spain on 12 December following the expulsion of the Spanish consul in Bata. The consul was declared persona non grata after holding an eight-hour meeting on 10 December with the political parties that did not take part in the 21 November legislative elections. At the meeting, the Spanish consul supported [words indistinct] of violence likely to jeopardize the order, peace, and tranquility prevailing in the country. Despite this act, considered as interference and a provocation, the Equatorial Guinean Government has continued to maintain good relations with Spain since that country decided unilaterally to (?reduce) its cooperation with Equatorial Guinea. This decision was followed by the departure of a large number of Spanish technical staff from our country. The Equatorial Guinean people, who are aware of the importance of the ties between them and Spain, hope that the contents of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's message are positive and promising. In fact, that is the wish of all the sons of this country.
