FBIS4-28275 "dreas111_d_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-111 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 South Korea PRC `Virtually Refused' Request on Sanctions PRC `Virtually Refused' Request on Sanctions SK0906063294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0625 GMT 9 Jun 94 SK0906063294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Beijing, June 9 (YONHAP) -- China virtually refused Seoul's request Thursday to participate in UN sanctions against North Korea, but agreed on the gravity of the nuclear situation and promised diplomatic efforts to find a solution. South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu met with his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen for nearly two hours in the morning, but they failed to narrow their differences on Beijing's crucial participation in the sanctions, officials at the South Korean embassy said after the meeting. Han tried to explain why the UN Security Council was compelled to seek sanctions against North Korea and asked for China's active involvement, officials said. But Qian withheld comment on such explanations and instead urged all directly involved parties -- South and North Korea, the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- to leave the door open for dialogue, said Kim Ha-chung, minister at the South Korean Embassy. Nevertheless, the Chinese foreign minister agreed with Han on the seriousness of the current situation and promised his country's best efforts in full consideration of the matter's gravity, he said. The officials said they took this remark as a sign of China's willingness to persuade North Korea and mediate between the North and the United States to resolve the nuclear row. China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council with veto power, does not favor punitive steps against North Korea and thus poses a major obstacle to a council resolution, expected next week, spelling out sanction measures. The participation of China, a major supplier of crude oil to North Korea which shares a common border with the reclusive state, is considered critical to effective sanctions. Han flew into Beijing late Wednesday after holding strategic talks with council members earlier this week. The two foreign ministers agreed to cooperate closely at both the Security Council and bilaterally in seeking a resolution, according to Kim. Han briefed Qian on the IAEA's report to the Security Council last week and South Korea's ensuing consultations with the permanent members of the council. He stressed that China's role is more important than ever as sanctions are being discussed, the officials said.
