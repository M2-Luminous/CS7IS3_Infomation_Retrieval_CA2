Background and Main Methods of Implementing Grain Reform Hunan and Hubei, major Chinese grain producing provinces, have for a long time suffered the constraints of the former grain purchasing and selling system, causing the unreasonable situation of grain production and business shouldering heavier and heavier burdens. Governments at every level shouldering heavy financial subsidies burdens in being responsible for grain are responsible for shouldering grain burdens. Grain enterprises bearing the burden of debts in dealing in grains have even more grain burdens. Farmers bearing the burden of low efficiency also bear a burden from planting grain. If this vicious circle continues, the burdens will become heavier and heavier. Grain reform is imperative and it is precisely the opportune time. First because the stable social, political, and economic situation throughout the nation provides a good general environment for grain reform. Second, because grain resources are ample. Both provinces' grain reserves are 10 billion jin or more. Third, because market prices for grain are steadily declining, essentially approaching the posted price, and the market price is even lower than the posted price. Fourth, because in recent years with economic development, the standard of living of urban residents has greatly improved and their tolerance has increased. According to a survey of the two provinces, in the last two years , expenses for grain consumption only make up about 5 percent of consumer cost of living expenses for urban residents. People from all quarters agree that now is an opportune time to conduct grain reform and the pace of grain reform should be increased. In the grain reform plan implemented throughout Hunan Province and in some counties (cities) of Hubei Province, reform consists of the following main aspects: A. Grain purchases and sales and prices are opened up in all directions and under state macroeconomic control they mainly rely on the market adjustment of grain supply and demand. Since 1 January 1993, fixed grain purchases have been abolished in Hunan Province and the price is determined by the market. Most of the counties (cities) in Hubei Province that have opened up grain also have abolished fixed purchases and because the grain department enters into intended fixed amount but no fixed price agricultural commercial contracts with agricultural households, the price is determined by the market. Agricultural taxes still are levied in kind by grain departments. In grain sales, they have abolished the fixed quantity parity price supply system and have implemented a new method of supply guaranteed in accordance with market prices. At the same time, it has been ordered that various types of grain coupon, grain certificate, and residential grain inventory permit grain quotas no longer be circulated. B. Abolishing parity price grain allocation. Hunan Province has come out with a regulation that after grain purchases and sales and prices are freed up, they will abolish the former provincial parity price system plan for allocating rice. The special state grain reserves, the State Council market adjusted grain, and the present state turnover grain and provincial reserve grain allocation plans will still be administered in accordance with state regulations. Counties (cities) in Hubei Province that have freed up grain also will abolish parity price grain submission tasking. C. Abolishing the "three linkages" preferential policy. Hunan Province has stipulated the abolishment of the "three linkages" parity price materials supply for farmers and will allow the price to be determined by the market. Hanchuan County in Hubei Province has changed its "three linkages" parity price grain material supply to comprehensive price supply with the price determined by the county government. Grain advance purchase earnest money has been changed to production loans extended by county agricultural banks and credit associations. Shishou city has stipulated that they will abolish the "three linkages," but give preferential supply of fertilizer and diesel below the market price and above the parity price and low-interest loans to agricultural households that have signed agricultural-commercial grain purchasing contracts. D. Implementing grain price subsidies for urban residents. After all localities have grain reform, they will implement grain price subsidies based on the principle of common assumption by the state, enterprises, and individuals. Generally, it will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance to allocate subsidies to the staff of administrative institutions and it will be the responsibility of enterprises themselves to resolve grain price subsidies for enterprise staffs, and subsidies will be allowed to be figured in their costs. E. Freeing up operations and enlivening circulation. In every locality's grain reform plan it is explicitly proposed that they should conduct multi-channel operations and enliven circulation. Grain departments should convert operating mechanisms as quickly as possible and actively participate in market competition, establishing and performing the main channel functions in competition. Other state-run, collective, and individually-run enterprises, as well as individual farmers also can operate retail and wholesale grain businesses. F. Establishing a grain risk adjustment fund system. Grain is a special commodity directly related to the national economy and the people's livelihood and the state should enhance macroeconomic controls. So, all localities have made the establishment of a grain risk adjustment fund an important component and measure of grain reform. Generally they have stipulated that on top of the Ministry of Finance grain subsidies, "three linkages" material parity-negotiated price differential funds, and advance purchase earnest money discounts allocated according to policy, in cities and counties, for such things as negotiated price operation tax reductions and exemptions and payment of service and administrative fees for "converting people from agriculture to non-agriculture," municipal and county grain bureaus will establish special administration and government controls for special use in curbing grain market prices in special years and supporting such things as structural adjustments in agriculture, resolving grain price subsidies for financial subsidy personnel, and dealing with the debt burden of grain departments. G. Implementing a special preferential policy to support the conversion of grain enterprises. Hunan Province has clearly announced that after grain reform, grain enterprises will be responsible for their own profits and losses, but the wages of grain enterprise staffs will be totally guaranteed by the provincial finance department for three years and fees and interest on central special grain reserves, current state circulating grain, and provincial grain reserves also will be borne by the provincial finance department. At the same time, they have stipulated that grain enterprises and enterprises newly developed after conversion will be exempt from taxes for three years, except for taxes on monetary awards, and grain enterprise bank loans will continue the originally designated preferential interest rates. II. Reflections Following the Grain Reform and Its Affect on the Economic Life of Society A. Reflections Following Grain Reform 1. Urban residents' spirits are steady. In the last few years with economic development, the income of urban workers has clearly increased and residents' economic tolerance has constantly increased. Several residents reflect that grain is now plentiful, the market is flourishing, and grain prices are steadily declining. Rather good quality grain can be bought anywhere and any place for a suitable price, much better than in the past. But there also are quite a few of the tiny minority of workers seeking support who reflect that following grain reform, increased grain consumption cost output has lowered their standard of living. 2. Rural cadres and masses have mixed feelings. They believe that only since grain reform have farmers truly had autonomy in production and operations to plant whatever brings in money. But at the same time, they also feel that in the past when grain was tight the government stimulated sales. Now when grain sales are bad, they have abolished the fixed quota purchases. In this topsy turvy situation, in the end it is the farmers who suffer the losses and are hurt. Rural cadres generally reflect that since grains were opened up, planting, reaping, and sales are no longer urged, but collecting collective submissions of retentions and redeeming loans are rather difficult. In the past cadres pursued the masses for grain. Now they pursue the masses for money. And a new change has taken place in the relationship between rural cadres and masses. II. The Affect of Grain Reform on the Economy and the Life of Society A. It encourages changes in the way that government departments take responsibility for grains. They have gradually changed from mainly relying on planning and administrative methods in the past to mainly relying on market methods. In the past government departments took responsibility for grains. Everything from planting, purchasing, processing, storage, and sales was conducted according to the mandatory plan. Grain reform can encourage government departments to respect and apply economic laws and use market mechanisms to do a good job of managing production, purchases, and sales. Relevant departments also have paid attention to market surveys and research and gradually learned how to set up production and organize purchases and sales in accordance with market demands. B. It encourages farmers to adjust the structure of the industry. They have gradually changed from being mainly oriented to the demands of the plan in the past to being mainly oriented to market demands. The first thing is that following grain reform market mechanisms have begun to perform a function. Farmers one after the other are readjusting the mix of their crops based on changes in the market and are diversifying and are vigorously developing the production of high grade agricultural products. After Chenzhou city freed up grain prices, farmers conscientiously adjusted the make up of their planting, reducing the area planted in grain and expanding the area planted in cash crops; and reducing the area planted in early rice which is lacking in quality and expanding the area planted in middle and late rice and high grade rice. For the year, early rice was reduced by 100,000 mu and high grade rice was increased by 400,000 mu and cured tobacco was increased by 120,000 mu. Secondly, the internal structure of agriculture has been adjusted. As reflected in Hanchuan County, since the beginning of autumn, the county has stressed three major adjustments: adjusting the 25,000 mu of low lake fields to develop the aquatic products industry; adjusting the 6,000 mu of hilly country to develop tea, fruit, and wood; and setting aside 70,000 mu for grain, cotton, and pod vegetables. As income increased, it also caused the internal structure of agriculture to become ever more rational. The third thing is adjustment of rural industrial structure. According to a Hanchuan County survey of 80 rural households, before the price of grain was freed up, 202 people, 94.8 percent, engaged in agricultural labor and 11 people, 5.2 percent, engaged in secondary and tertiary industry. After grain prices were freed up, agricultural workers decreased to 169 people, 79.3 percent, and those engaged in other industries increased to 44 people, 20.7 percent. C. It encourages grain enterprises to convert their operating mechanisms. From simply grinding rice flour in the past, they have gradually converted to diversified operations adapted to the market. After grain prices and operations were freed up, grain departments and enterprises very quickly shifted toward the market and accelerated the transformation of operating mechanisms and changes in operating methods. Presently, grain departments and enterprises at every level are paying close attention to changing course and changing their form. The first is streamlining the structure; the second is starting diversified operations and opening new methods of production; the third is doing a good job of serial development of grain products; and the fourth is increasing business network points and increasing market competitiveness. According to the reflections of the Shishou city grain bureau, since grain reform, the entire bureau has engaged in risk mortgaged contracts for the whole staff to guarantee returns. Of the bureau's thirty enterprises, in 1991 nine enterprises lost 7.03 million yuan. In 1992, after the grain reform, they made a profit of 1.095 million yuan and seven enterprises greatly reduced their losses. State-run grain enterprises have acquired new life and vitality and maintain a leading position in grain purchasing and sales. D. Since grain has been freed up, processing industries with grain as raw material have expanded their markets even more. It can be seen from the cities and counties that have freed up operations that freeing up grain prices and operations not only has not produced a major impact and a chain reaction on the market, but the operations of grain processing enterprises are even more flexible. Presently, grain processing enterprises are converting from large batch operations to small batch, from simple purchases and sales to integrated purchases, sales, and processing, and from mainly having commercial grain enterprises receive raw materials to mainly having the market receive raw materials. These small scale and highly flexible enterprises that can process and can diversify operations should indicate that freeing up grain prices has injected new vitality into these enterprises. III. Major Problems Facing Grain Reform and Suggestions Grain reform is a major reform that is strongly policy oriented and has broad involvement. In making the transition from the old to the new system there will necessarily be a series of understanding, system, and operational problems. Judging from the situation in Hunan and Hubei provinces, we believe that currently the most pronounced problems are mainly exhibited in the following respects: The first is that since grain reform, quota purchases and the "three linkages" preferential policy have been abolished and this grain reform is being conducted in a grain buyers' market, grain prices are low, purchasing funds are short, grain sale difficulties are exacerbated, and farmers' income is reduced. Hanchuan County in Hubei Province reflects that in July of this year, after grain prices were freed up, the price for 50 kilograms of early rice dropped to 18-19 yuan and that for middle rice fluctuated between 20 and 21 yuan, averaging below the state fixed price. Although the market price of wheat was higher than the fixed purchasing price and farmers throughout the county could earn more than 780,000 yuan, income from early and middle rice was down by 6.18 million yuan. So, grain farmers' income was down 5.4 million yuan, a per capita reduction of 7-8 yuan, because grain prices were freed up. According to this calculation, in predominantly grain producing regions, farmers' per capita income was reduced between 20 and 22 yuan because grain prices were freed up. The 1992 farmers' net per capita income throughout the province was preliminarily estimated at 663 yuan, a 6 percent increase over 1991, essentially restoring 1990 levels. But the cash income from grain sales was down by 13.3 yuan and grain planting experienced an extreme drop. It is reported that Hunan and Hubei provinces are prepared to reduce the area planted in grain by 5 million mu and 3 million mu, respectively. This will have a definite affect on future grain production. The second thing is that grain departments have numerous financial debts, a great deal of old grain, and heavy burdens and enterprises have a number of difficulties converting. Several localities reflect that when grain enterprises currently bearing the "three major burdens" of numerous debts, a great deal of old grain, and a number of retiring people, go to the market, they lack competitiveness. In the past "the emperor's daughter did not worry about marriage." Not only were there few network points, but several grain stores, stations, and points were established in rather out of the way places and the infrastructure was backward. Grain departments in every locality are striving to come to grips with developing diversified operations as an important measure for converting enterprise operating mechanisms, but it is generally felt that they lack experience, lack skill, lack qualified people, and lack funds, and have numerous difficulties. The third thing is that in such respects as ideological concepts, business awareness, and understanding of science and technology, we still are far from meeting the requirements for developing a post-grain reform market economy. Several farmers reflect that "in the last few years, when we had no choice we planted grain, but when we planted grain, we also had no way, we could not sell it off. After grain reform, production was even more difficult. They told us that we were allowed to seek our own markets and no longer to seek the mayor. But where do we farmers go to find a market?" The fourth thing is that the grain market system is not fully developed and circulation channels are not open. The development of such aspects of the infrastructure as both regional and national wholesale grain markets, adjustment methods, and land and water transportation are very unsuited to what is required to reform the grain circulation system. These issues must elicit a great deal of attention and we must adopt feasible and effective measures and solutions, because how these issues are resolved not only is directly related to whether grain reform can be smoothly conducted in the two provinces, but also will have a major affect on the national grain situation. So, we propose the following suggestions: A. Direct farmers, based on the fundamental stability of overall grain production, to make appropriate adjustments in the product mix and the make up of cultivation. From the overall perspective of China's current grain situation, overall supply and overall demand are essentially balanced with a slight surplus. But there is a problem with the product mix. There is mainly excessive paddy and insufficient high grade rice. But we also must notice that the level of China's current grain production still is controlled by nature. Overall grain supply capabilities still are not strong and per capita levels are not high. Strictly speaking, China's grain problem still has not been solved. After increases in consumption levels, especially rural consumption levels, and gradual adjustments in grain varieties and production structure, the overall balance is gradually becoming tight. So, after grain reform, we must adopt measures to ensure the basic stability of grain production and guard against major slippage. We now must adopt a policy of "developing production, adjusting structure, guiding consumption, and opening markets," and actively organize and direct the broad masses of farmers to arrange production based on changing market demands and ensuring grain stability and strive to develop high-production, high-quality, high-return grain varieties suitable to increasing beans, small mixed grains, and other famous high-quality varieties with a foreign demand, appropriately adjusting the make up of cultivation and improving economy returns. B. Pay close attention to solving the financial debt problem. We should thoroughly and completely clear up current debts and distinguish the funds owed, and then handle them differently. Those owed funds that are policy, the Ministry of Finance should help to resolve. If they cannot be resolved for a while, we should stop the interest, make them interest-free debts and not take additional interest or penalty interest. For the portion that should have been subsidized by the locality and was not subsidized, the local treasury is responsible for allocating adequate subsidy. Debts that are enterprise business losses should be absorbed by the enterprises themselves. At the same time, a financial listing should be made of historical policy debts and newly added debts and they should have special administration, distinguished from regular enterprise business. C. Appropriately resolve the issue of old grain. A significant portion of grain currently stored by several localities is old grain and it urgently needs to be properly handled. As reflected by Hubei Province, about 4 billion kilograms, approximately half, of the grain currently stored is very hard to sell early long-grained, nonglutinous rice. Of that, a considerable portion has been there for three years or more, some even more than five years, and is inedible. So, we propose permitting early long-grained, nonglutinous rice that has been in place more than three years to be used to process feed or be sold on the market at the price that it can currently be sold. The differential between the cost of this grain and the actual selling price would be shared by the central government, local government, and enterprises. D. Enhance development of the market system and open circulation channels. 1. We should adopt measures helpful to accelerating the development of rudimentary grain markets in grain producing areas, while selectively doing a good job of establishing regional wholesale grain markets in regions that mainly produce grain or have rather good conditions. 2. Guide the farmers to enter the circulation sphere. We should actively organize farmers, rural cooperative economic organizations, special transportation and sales collectives, and individuals to enter the market and directly engage in grain trading. To reduce the current unchecked and arbitrary farmer production and business activity, we should actively develop combined serial production, supply and sales grain production and business voluntarily participated in by the farmers. 3. We should improve methods of grain allocation and transfer and do a good job of coordinating relations between producing areas and sales areas. For the grain required by sales areas, we can adopt such methods as contract purchases and sales and purchasing and marketing agents, or have production organized and arranged by producing regions based on the varieties and volume required by sales regions, using sales to determine production and using economic forms to determine cooperative relations between producing regions and sales regions. 4. Enhance grain infrastructure and improve such basic conditions as storage and transportation. E. Improve social services and direct and assist farmers in adapting to the requirements of market economy development as quickly as possible. Reform of grain purchases, sales, and prices is being conducted in the current situation where it is difficult to sell grain and it also is difficult to sell cotton, oil, and sugar. So, a great many farmers feel at their wits ends. Some feel that they cannot look to the market and some feel that they cannot look accurately on the market. Some look to the market and lack skill. Some, although they have found markets and have a certain amount of skill, lack funds. All of these need to be further resolved by enhanced rural social services. In brief, since the freeing up of grains, we must not simply orient farmers to the market, but it is important to actively direct and assist them to take new steps to adapt to the development of the market economy as quickly as possible.
