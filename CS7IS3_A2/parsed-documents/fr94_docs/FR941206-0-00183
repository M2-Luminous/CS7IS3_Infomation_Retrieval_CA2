FR941206-0-00183 FR941206-0-00019 (h) One or more safety devices that vent directly to the atmosphere may be installed on the cover, closed-vent system, or control device provided each device meets all of the following conditions: (1) The safety device is not used for planned or routine venting of organic vapors from the surface impoundment or the closed-vent system connected to a control device; and (2) The safety device remains in a closed, sealed position at all times except when an unplanned event requires that the device open for the purpose of preventing physical damage or permanent deformation of the cover, closed-vent system, or control device in accordance with good engineering and safety practices for handling flammable, combustible, explosive, or other hazardous materials. An example of an unplanned event is a sudden power outage. ยง264.1086 Standards: Containers. (a) This section applies to the owners and operators of containers having design capacities greater than 0.1 m 3 subject to this subpart into which any hazardous waste is placed except for a container in which all hazardous waste entering the container meets the conditions specified in ยง264.1082(c) of this subpart. (b) An owner or operator shall manage hazardous waste in containers using the following procedures: (1) The owner or operator shall place the hazardous waste into one of the following containers except when a container is used for hazardous waste treatment as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section: (i) A container that is equipped with a cover which operates with no detectable organic emissions when all container openings (e.g., lids, bungs, hatches, and sampling ports) are secured in a closed, sealed position. The owner or operator shall determine that a container operates with no detectable emissions by testing each opening on the container for leaks in accordance with Method 21 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A the first time any portion of the hazardous waste is placed into the container. If a leak is detected and cannot be repaired immediately, the hazardous waste shall be removed from the container and the container not used to meet the requirements of this paragraph until the leak is repaired and the container is retested. (ii) A container having a design capacity less than or equal to 0.46 m 3 that is equipped with a cover and complies with all applicable Department of Transportation regulations on packaging hazardous waste for transport under 49 CFR part 178. (A) A container that is managed in accordance with the requirements of 49 CFR part 178 for the purpose of complying with this subpart is not subject to any exceptions to the 49 CFR part 178 regulations, except as noted in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. (B) A lab pack that is managed in accordance with the requirements of 49 CFR part 178 for the purpose of complying with this subpart may comply with the exceptions for combination packagings specified in 49 CFR 173.12(b). (iii) A container that is attached to or forms a part of any truck, trailer, or railcar; and that has been demonstrated within the preceding 12 months to be organic vapor tight when all container openings are in a closed, sealed position (e.g., the container hatches or lids are gasketed and latched). For the purpose of meeting the requirements of this paragraph, a container is organic vapor tight if the container sustains a pressure change of not more than 750 pascals within 5 minutes after it is pressurized to a minimum of 4,500 pascals. This condition is to be demonstrated using the pressure test specified in Method 27 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, and a pressure measurement device which has a precision of # 2.5 mm water and which is capable of measuring above the pressure at which the container is to be tested for vapor tightness. (2) An owner or operator treating hazardous waste in a container by either a waste stabilization process, any process that requires the addition of heat to the waste, or any process that produces an exothermic reaction shall meet the following requirements: (i) Whenever it is necessary for the container to be open during the treatment process, the container shall be located inside an enclosure that is vented through a closed-vent system to a control device. (ii) The enclosure shall be a structure that is designed and operated in accordance with the following requirements: (A) The enclosure shall be a structure that is designed and operated with sufficient airflow into the structure to capture the organic vapors emitted from the hazardous waste in the container and vent the vapors through the closed-vent system to the control device. (B) The enclosure may have permanent or temporary openings to allow worker access; passage of containers through the enclosure by conveyor or other mechanical means; entry of permanent mechanical or electrical equipment; or to direct airflow into the enclosure. The pressure drop across each opening in the enclosure shall be maintained at a pressure below atmospheric pressure such that whenever an open container is placed inside the enclosure no organic vapors released from the container exit the enclosure through the opening. The owner or operator shall determine that an enclosure achieves this condition by measuring the pressure drop across each opening in the enclosure. If the pressure within the enclosure is equal to or greater than atmospheric pressure then the enclosure does not meet the requirements of this section. (iii) The closed-vent system and control device shall be designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of ยง264.1087 of this subpart.
