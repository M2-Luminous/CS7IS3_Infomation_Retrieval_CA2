Apart from getting close to the people and improving relations between the party and the masses, one of the purposes of making the trips before and after Lunar New Year's Day is to study and handle the new contradictions and problems arising from reform. According to informed sources, Li Ruihuan, Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, arrived in Guangdong's Zhuhai yesterday and will spend the new year in Guangdong. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, another Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau, is currently inspecting Sichuan. Vice President Rong Yiren and Tian Jiyun, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, yesterday attended the spring festival party for the people and servicemen in the Guangzhou areas. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin, who is also state president, and Premier Li Peng will stay in Beijing to "spend the new year." Jiang and Li will attend a large-scale spring festival get-together party organized by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, on 10 February (Lunar New Year Day) in the Great Hall of the People. Although rumors have recently circulated that CPC elder Deng Xiaoping will come to Guangdong, an informed source said that this year Deng Xiaoping will still follow his old habit and spend the new year in Shanghai. Informed sources pointed out that visits by senior CPC leaders before and during the spring festival (Jiang Zemin went to Shanxi, Li Peng went to Guangdong, Zhu Rongji went to Fujian and Sichuan, and Li Ruihuan went to the Zhuhai and Shenzhen Special Economic Zones) are related to the important reform measures to be announced this year. The several reforms to be launched will involve bold measures which will be announced within a short period of time, and will touch on very complicated relations; therefore, the senior level in Beijing must study and grasp the new contradictions and problems which are arising in large numbers from the process of reform, and it also has to coordinate relations between the central and local authorities after the implementation of the revenue-sharing system. In particular, it has to soothe the local leaders a bit and address the grievances among some "local lords." The official XINHUA NEWS AGENCY yesterday verified an exclusive report by this newspaper the previous day that Premier Li Peng left Shenzhen for Huizhou for inspection. XINHUA said that after cutting a ribbon to open the commercial operation of No. 1 generator in Guangdong's Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, Li Peng arrived in Huizhou for inspection, sending new year's greetings to the masses. XINHUA also quoted Li Peng's remarks that Guangdong is at the front of reform and opening up, and its various undertakings have been developing rapidly since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, and he hopes Guangdong people, encouraged by the spirit of the 14th party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, score new and bigger results in the new year. Li Peng, accompanied by Ding Guangen, Fei Xie, and Zhu Senlin, toured Huizhou City Industrial Products Exhibition, and visited the teachers and students at Huizhou City No. 8 Middle School. According to another piece of information, on the afternoon of 6 February in Chongqing, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is currently on an inspection trip to Sichuan, convened a forum which was attended by the factory heads and managers of nine state-run enterprises which are plagued by difficulties. Zhu Rongji pointed out that to build a modern system of enterprises, the first thing to do is to separate the government from enterprises, the government must not be allowed to dictate to the enterprises at will, and enterprises must be allowed to make their own decisions concerning operation and management, whereas when a decision is proved erroneous, the factory manager must be held responsible, and such a system must be formed so that staff and workers can exercise supervision. The enterprises which have debts larger than capital and which are unable to reverse the process of making losses should go bankrupt on a trial basis; then, reorganization of enterprises will be carried out to give them a new life. He also pointed out that to smoothly change mechanisms and to be able to maintain social stability, it is necessary to carry out reform of the social insurance system. Zhu Rongji also said that the difficulties facing state-run enterprises are temporary, state-run enterprises have a bright future, and the temporary difficulties will surely be solved step by step. The method to solve the difficulties rests on the state's policy, but mainly rests on enterprises' self-reliance and hard work. Enterprises must carry out market research, develop new products, strengthen management and operation, change operational mechanisms, look at themselves, and demand more from themselves. At present, special attention must be paid to the life of staff and workers, and efforts must be made to protect their basic livelihood and social stability.
