FBIS4-41532 "drsov123_b_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-123 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 RUSSIAN NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political Issues Explains Proposal To Extend Term Explains Proposal To Extend Term LD2606194194 LD2606194194 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow NTV in Russian at 1700 GMT on 26 June broadcasts the weekly "Itogi" program, which features a four-minute interview with Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian Federation Council, in which he explains his recent proposals on prolonging the mandates of Federal Assembly deputies for two years. First, Shumeyko states the main points of his proposal, stressing that President Yeltsin had nothing to do with that initiative: "Changing the existing laws and the corresponding articles of the Constitution immediately and turning the Federation Council into a more efficient body will enable us, the current deputies, to deal with various issues on a deeper level. I will not conceal from you that it is necessary to introduce amendments into the Constitution, prolonging the mandates both for the State Duma and the Federation Council for at least two years. It has only just become possible for deputies to pass laws and tackle legislative issues, but instead they are being confronted with a completely different problem--a new election. In my opinion, a fresh election will upset Russia's balance to the utmost degree. I have not said a single word about the president in this connection." Shumeyko then comments on the public reaction to this proposal: "I read the newspapers yesterday--the reaction is quite normal. Who then distorted my meaning most and who has been criticizing and accusing me of immorality? SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, PRAVDA, Baburin, and Gorbachev--there is life in the old dog yet! This means that I was right. These people do not want political accord, they do not want stable work to begin in Russia--that is all." Shumeyko then explains the reasons behind his initiative: "At this stage, I can see no point in a change of power because Russia will never come back to the state it was in when it was part of the Soviet Union. This is impossible. Since we have achieved political accord, the entire society now has to think about the quickest way for our state to overcome this poverty and crisis." He says that social problems mattered more to the Russians at this stage: "The politicians ought to feel that people are tired of these endless elections. They need anything but elections. They need a job, a salary, a normal life, and a developing state structure. They want the achievements of this state that have been recorded in its Constitution to exist in real terms. They want to be rid of crime and want courts to work normally, and many other things, but not elections."
