This was the consensus arrived at during the two-day international conference of environment ministers. At a joint press conference in Agra, they advocated expanding trade in such a way that it would reduce poverty in areas where it exists and at the same time address environmental concerns. They said the implementation of the forest principles adopted at Rio should be given special attention. The ministers recommended that a special task force be set up in all countries for the sustainable development of forests. The ministers also expressed the hope that the differences of opinion on restructuring and replenishment of the global environment facility should be quickly resolved. Environment ministers from 10 countries including Brazil, China, Malaysia, Germany, and Britain attended the conference along with representatives of leading environmental agencies.
