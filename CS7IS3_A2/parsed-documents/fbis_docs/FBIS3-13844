Unless the world senses that Egypt is prepared to assume a key role in the region no one will assist us. The result would be negative both in terms of the Egyptian domestic scene and the life of ordinary Egyptians. Many nations have fallen behind, retreating into backwardness and poverty that Egypt is not eager to join, he stated. Speaking to chief editors of Egyptian newspapers during the plane trip from Harare to Cairo, Mubarak said that the daunting efforts in which he is engaged, his exchanges with various world leaders, and his bid to achieve stability in the region have demonstrated to the entire world, particularly the big powers, the vitality of Egypt's role in this part of the world. Egypt's policy during the Gulf war proved to the whole world that Egypt is a reliable force, he said. President Mubarak said that the consultations he held with leaders of major countries and his friendship with them led these countries to adopt policies that helped Egypt in its talks with the IMF. The world does not appreciate reclusive nations and that major powers only support those countries that have stature and influence and get involved in world events, Mubarak pointed out. President Mubarak said that he is in constant touch with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, and Jordan's King Husayn in an effort to stimulate the peace process and resume the Arab-Israeli talks in Washington. He pointed out that even during his stay in Harare he talked on the telephone with King Husayn. President Mubarak added that the contacts he had with President Clinton and all the other parties produced results, particularly following the UN Security Council resolution concerning the massacre in al-Ibrahimi Mosque. An Israeli delegation will meet in Tunisia with Palestinian officials to review current proposals and prepare for high-level Palestinian-Israeli talks, he remarked. 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are likely to meet in Cairo to sign an agreement detailing the practical measures for the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, Mubarak said. The agreement will set a timetable for the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the return of 'Arafat to Palestinian land. The president pointed out that an Israeli- Palestinian agreement was already reached before the Hebron massacre occurred. Jerusalem's status will be determined through negotiations, Mubarak said. A statement in which U.S. President Clinton declared otherwise [a'lana ghayr dhalik] has been cited by a U.S. television network, but this statement was denied by an adviser at the U.S. Department of State who was speaking to journalists in Cairo last Thursday, Mubarak remarked. President Mubarak reemphasized the position of the U.S. Administration vis-a-vis Jerusalem, whose status will be determined through negotiations [al-quds allati sayatahaddadu mawqifaha min khilal al-mufawadat]. Concerning the possibility that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher might visit the region in the near future, President Mubarak said: Such a visit is likely. To a question about the attitude of some Arab rulers toward Egypt, President Mubarak said: I don't care about persons, but I do care about the Arab nations. My principal concern is the interest of these nations. We are against the partitioning of Iraq and Sudan. To another question about the recent visit to Cairo by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and the possibilities of arranging a meeting between them in Cairo soon to achieve national reconciliation, President Mubarak said that Egypt is making the necessary contacts in this regard to achieve progress. However, the arrangements for such a meeting in Cairo must be preceded by an agreement between the two sides, President Mubarak added. Alluding to the issue of national dialogue in Egypt, President Mubarak said that he will call for the start of this dialogue next April and that he will deliver a speech when the dialogue starts. He pointed out that working groups and a committee representing all concerned groups will be formed. He affirmed that the government is currently carrying out tangible and concrete efforts, adding that Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's tours of various governorates have helped to solve many problems. President Mubarak said that some 200 projects were recently set up in Suhaj Governorate, noting that this will help solve the problem of unemployment. Continuing, President Mubarak said that the government will make strenuous efforts in the various fields by the end of this year and the beginning of next year. Commenting on current intensive activity by the political parties to prepare for next year's People's Assembly and Consultative Council elections, President Mubarak said that everybody is encouraged to join such activity and he is sure that the makeup of future parliaments will reflect this popular participation. He asserted that the government is doing its best to solve all problems, particularly important ones like unemployment. He urged further efforts to solve this problem gradually. President Mubarak said that in the past Egypt had no currency reserves in the banks and that current reserves must not be squandered but kept for appropriate uses, noting that the money belongs both to the public and the banks. Discussing the reduced revenue from tourism and the demands made by some people working in the tourist business, he said that the government has exempted owners of tourist businesses in Aswan from taxes for 10 years. He noted, however, that some unreasonable requests are being made. He said many citizens have suffered as a result of lower tourism profits. Mubarak said although some people are disturbed by the evident wealth of some Egyptians, one must remember that wealthy people who invest their money in projects or spend it at hotels and other places are actually helping to create jobs for others. He explained that this issue must be viewed from a practical angle, taking into account the benefit to society and Egyptian families. On the South African Committee meeting that President Mubarak chaired in Harare yesterday, the president said that the committee had met to discuss measures by which the OAU could contribute to backing the democratic process in South Africa. President Mubarak noted that the KwaZulu announced their independence yesterday and that they want to set up a state independent of South Africa, but the South African Committee in its meeting yesterday rejected the question of KwaZulu's independence. He noted that the final statement issued by the committee had reaffirmed the territorial integrity of South Africa. President Mubarak added: We will hold urgent and extensive talks with all parties, the major states, and the United States to assist the democratic process in South Africa and facilitate the elections that will be held on 27 April. President Mubarak noted that the white right-wing party [al-hizb al-abyad al-yamini] in South Africa is pressing the KwaZulu to create these problems, adding that urgent messages will be sent in the next two days to resolve these problems. President Mubarak described the results of the South African Committee meetings as good. He noted that there was a proposal to hold an international conference on the elections in South Africa, but the proposal was not accepted. Besides, he added, the people of South Africa must approve of such a conference first. He pointed out that the elections will be held on 27 April and the South Africans do not want to postpone them, because such a postponement would be a disaster for them and would lead to serious consequences. Asked if he would go to South Africa on 10 May following the elections in his capacity as OAU chairman, the president said that nothing has been decided yet, adding that this could be determined after the elections. The president expressed concern over the current events in South Africa, where some people are sneaking their money out of the country. He noted that this will have a very negative effect on development in South Africa after the elections. He hoped that there would be stability in South Africa in the coming stage and that the national forces would avoid potential conflicts. On the status of the KwaZulu in South Africa, President Mubarak said that the KwaZulu have no resources, oil, or minerals, but they are closely linked to the apartheid regime.
