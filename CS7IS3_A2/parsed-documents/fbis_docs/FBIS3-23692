P. Senkevich, doctor of technical sciences, vice-president of the K. E. Tsiolkovskiy Academy of Cosmonautics and the Russian Federation of Cosmonautics, and chief of the head department of the Central Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building of the Russian Space Agency, under the rubric "Differing Opinions": "Where Should the Spacecraft Be Sent?"; first two paragraphs are source introduction] [Text] These days, even the most deep-seated of principles are being reexamined in every area of life. And that goes for the space program, too -- a sector that has always been the most important component of the domestic military-industrial complex. Have the huge sums of money spent for the development and launch of space gear been warranted? Do we need that gear now? In what direction should the space sector in Russia be developed, and should it be developed at all? The articles printed here reflect two substantially different points of view with regard to certain of those problems. And one must believe that there are yet other points of view... `The Aim -- To Keep the Russian Space Program Intact' Answering the questions of KHIMIYA I ZHIZN is the vice-president of the K. E. Tsiolkovskiy Academy of Cosmonautics and the Russian Federation of Cosmonautics and chief of the head department of the Central Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building of the Russian Space Agency, Professor V. P. Senkevich, a doctor of technical sciences. Khimiya i Zhizn: The space program is one of the most expensive areas of human activity. The country has spent vast sums of money on "space" over a period of decades. How efficient and justified can one regard that spending? Senkevich: First of all, I'd like to say that those sums haven't been as great as one would think. In recent years, the former Union spent about 1 percent of the gross national product on the space program. When you consider that the workers in the sector, along with their families, also make up 1 percent of the country's population, then it turns out that the same amount of money has been spent here, "per capita," as in the country as a whole. Here are the figures for 1989, a year that can be considered representative because there was none of the current inflation back then: 6.9 billion rubles [R] were spent on the space program; of that, 1.7 billion went for space hardware for the national economy and science, 1.3 billion went for reusable systems, and 3.9 billion went for space-based military information systems. That is much less than the unthinkable losses recorded in many other sectors of our economy. Annual grain losses, for example, were R20 billion that year; meat losses, 6 billion; and above-norm remainders of material values, 247 billion. In that same year, by the way, the United States spent $29.6 billion on space, $22.8 billion of which went for "military" space. As for efficiency, that's certainly not always measured in rubles. It all depends on what kinds of goals are set for the space program, and those goals have changed more than once over the period of the space program's existence. During the cold war, for example, space-related advances were regarded primarily as the realm of the technical and military-political competition of two systems. That situation existed until the early '70s, when preeminence and prestige both for us and for the United States began, by and large, to retreat into the background. Now the principal criterion is, To what extent does this or that advance satisfy the customer: defense, science, etc. The space race has moved into the realm of technology. By the way, our space hardware was built with a strictly domestic component and instrument base: the Western countries placed severe restrictions on the transfer to us of any advances that could be used in space or other programs. Nevertheless, our designers have almost always been able to satisfy the requirements of the customers. Be that as it may, we now have a strong inventory of aerospace hardware. We have broad inventory of launch vehicles capable of lifting 0.5-100 tons; we have built spacecraft for various uses, and orbital stations; and there are in space 160-180 of our spacecraft, linked in some 30 systems. Their operation is supported by a strong ground-based infrastructure -- launch facilities, flight control centers, regional centers, and receiving stations for space-derived information. Unfortunately, the economic difficulties of recent years have also affected the space program. Operational scales in many of its areas have been cut back appreciably. A system of production cooperation decades in the making has been disrupted -- a system in which more than a thousand enterprises were directly involved in space activity and more than 2,000 enterprises and organizations throughout the entire former Union were indirectly involved. Spending for the space program in 1991 was cut back by 35%; in early 1992, before the state order was approved, the entire sector was actually frozen, and to pay wages (the average current wage, by the way, is about 1.5-fold lower than the average for all of Russia), almost all the enterprises had to take out loans from commercial banks at enormously high interest rates. Just a little more of this, and Russian will no longer be among the greatest of space powers. That's why recently we've been thinking seriously about cost recovery of advances and about the possibilities of getting a commercial return for the use of space hardware. Khimiya i Zhizn: Does that mean that the space program is also entering the age of market relations -- with denationalization of property, privatization, and other facets of market economics? Senkevich: Phrasing the question that way would probably be wrong as it relates to the space program. It would be better to speak of commercialization, that is, about attracting private capital, with state control, to economic activity. That's what has long been done in the leading Western countries -- there they strive to comprehensively expand the market for the sales of aerospace industry products and for services based on space systems. But even with that, it's the opinion of foreign experts that a necessary condition for the survival and growth of a space program remains the financial support of its government. We also see the future of our space program in the joint activity of the state and private capital. True, we still have many unresolved problems here -- specifically, there is virtually nothing of the legal basis that is needed. Nevertheless, we can at this point name the principal directions being taken in the commercialization of our space program. They involves things like, for example, the proffering of communications services, the study of natural resources, the monitoring of the environment and weather, the lofting of various kinds of satellites into orbit, and the leasing of space hardware. Of course, it's still too early to be talking about billions in profits from the space program -- right now we have to be talking about, primarily, the cost recovery of individual types of operations and about their commercial prospects. And those prospects will depend on how vigorously and successfully Russia enters the world space market. Right now, more than 130 states are either directly or indirectly participating in it, and that is the criterion by which the overall scientific-technical potential of a country is assessed, and it would be worse for us to fall behind here. Khimiya i Zhizn: But do we have anything to enter the market with? Senkevich: According to American experts (and we're generally in agreement with them), Russia has the lead right now in roughly half of the areas involving space hardware. We have today the most powerful rocket with a rather advanced first stage -- the Energiya; we have what is for the time being the only orbital station in the world, a unique compact nuclear reactor for use in space, and extremely precise engines for changing the orbit of a space vehicle. The U.S. Department of Defense is very interested in many of our advances, and they feel that the use of those advances would make it possible to accelerate the implementation of the American SDI program by about five years and save almost $2 billion. In other words, that is the actual value of just those of our advances. Thus, even the most developed countries are interested in collaboration with Russia in the field of space technologies. But on the other hand, they are, of course, guided primarily by their own interests -- political and commercial. The United States, for example, will obviously try to use the situation to purchase more cheaply everything of value that Russia has, in the process getting as far ahead as possible of Japan, Europe, India, and China, but at the same time not allowing the appearance of a serious competitor on the world space market in the person of Russia. Khimiya i Zhizn: But how about our internal market -- will space products or space services appear on it in the foreseeable future? Senkevich: The space program is itself, above all, a part of the internal market, and it is a big customer for many other sectors. Building space vehicles requires metals, plastics, ceramics, optics, communication systems, power supplies, life-support systems, various kinds of gear, onboard and ground-based computers, and many other things. Of course, part of the budget appropriations earmarked for space goes to pay for all that. In that context, it's very important that the space program, more so than any other sphere of activity (save for the nuclear sector), use the latest scientific and technological advances and thereby serve as a powerful catalyst for progress. At the same time, the space program this very moment is filling orders from the economy. That involves, primarily, things that have already become customary -- space-based communications, television broadcasting, navigation, and monitoring of the Earth's surface for various consumers. In space, we're already producing, on a semiindustrial scale, single crystals, superconducting materials, and ultrapure biomedical preparations. For example, single-crystal cadmium telluride can be used for making x-ray sensors in medical tomographs. As many as a thousand sensors can be made from one crystal 20-25 mm in diameter. On the ground, it is extremely difficult to produce high-quality single crystals; but several kilograms of those kinds of materials have already been brought back to the ground from orbit. By the way, a gram of single-crystal cadmium telluride is worth nearly $1,800 on the world market. Finally, a third area in which we're active on the internal market, one that is extremely important for the survival of the Russian space program and for the entire economy as well, is the transfer of space technologies to other sectors. For example, the development of the reusable Buran spacecraft and the Energiya launch vehicle involved the development of nearly 500 new designs and more than 100 new materials. Only 20 percent of those advances have a narrow, specialized application; many of the other advances are already being used in the nuclear, aviation, and electronics industries, in the light and chemical industries, in medicine, and so forth. Khimiya i Zhizn: The representatives of your sector have made those kinds of pronouncements more than once. But I don't recall anything like ever being able to buy anything made with space technology in a hardware store. Senkevich: Suit yourself, there are plenty of instances like that. Our enterprises and our technologies are used to make refrigerators and cutters, televisions and samovars, juice makers and electric shavers. Our sector is offering the housing construction industry structural and insulation materials, sealants, and so forth. We're offering the power-engineering industry catalysts for removing the flue gases at heat and electric-power plants. We're offering metallurgy various kinds of refractories, and the auto industry, engine valve seats made of aerospace materials (this technology was used to make rocket nozzles). Permanent magnets with high-level magnetic features are making it possible to greatly reduce the sizes of various electric motors, electromechanical converters, and so forth. Articles made of the carbon-carbon composite material argolon are much stronger than the usual graphite materials, and in an aggressive medium they withstand temperatures of up to 500�C and can be used in metallurgy, chemistry, and petrochemistry. The antifriction, self-lubricating material phenan, which is based on porous bronze with special pore-filling polymer additives, remains efficient in aggressive media of up to 600�C and can be successfully used in transportation, in farm machinery, and so forth. And I could go on: I could talk for a very long time on the possibilities for the use of space materials and technologies in the economy. By the way, a special system is being created in our sector now to facilitate that kind of technology transfer. Khimiya i Zhizn: From the very outset, the space program in our country was under the strict control of party-and-governmental organs in the context of a command-administrative system. What does the structure of the sector and the control of the space program's growth look like these days? Senkevich: Our space program, in fact, has always featured a high degree of state centralization in its management. But that's typical of the leading Western countries, too. It is only because of the immense concentration of efforts and resources that we have been able to achieve such tremendous advances in going after our main goals. And those advances would have been even greater if, in approving principal directions to be taken and long-term space programs and plans, the officials at the top had taken full measure of the recommendations of the head institutes and independent experts. What also hindered things considerably were the excessive secretiveness, the lack of departmental coordination among the consumers and the developers, and the extraordinary monopoly that existed. Nevertheless, the positive aspects of such an organization of operations managed to predominate. Virtually all the large space projects (with the exception of the mission to the Moon) were completed, although in the process deadlines were not always met and budgets not always adhered to, and the specifications of some items sometimes turned out to be below what was called for. But one mustn't forget that the deadlines were often unnecessarily strict, and the requirements, exaggerated: aerospace systems, especially in the early days, were built at the leading edge of what was technically possible, and no command-administrative measures could have produced better results back then. As for today, the government of Russia recently made some important decisions aimed at preserving and developing the Russian space program as a sector important to the state. In 1992, the Russian Space Agency was formed, to develop and carry out state policy in the exploration of space and to serve in the role of general buyer of national-economy- and science-related space systems and, with the Ministry of Defense, buyer of dual-purpose systems. The agency has already prepared a draft of the State Space Program for Russia for the Period Leading Up to the Year 2000, the execution of which will preserve Russia's position as a leading space power. The program has gone through interdepartmental appraisal and is being examined in the state commissions and in the government. Khimiya i Zhizn: What areas in the Russian space program today have been pronounced the most necessary? Senkevich: The program is based on the need to preserve and develop virtually all the main areas in today's space sector. In the field of national-economy-related space hardware, that pertains to the setting up of information-dissemination systems (communications and radio and television broadcasting), navigation, environmental monitoring, weather prediction, warning of possible natural disasters, the study of the Earth's natural resources, and, finally, the continuation of work to perfect new space technologies and produce valuable materials in orbit. Science-related space hardware will be used to conduct further systematic basic research in astrophysics, planetology, geophysics, and other fields of science. Our plans to study Mars and the asteroids are evoking a great deal of interest in the world science community. Most of our science projects will be performed in the context of programs of international cooperation, including commercially based programs. Space systems will also be used for purposes of defense. The main job here, in accordance with the new defense doctrine of Russia, consists maintaining the strategic stability that exists. In that context, it is important to know that many military space systems, complexes, and means are expected to be used simultaneously for the national economy. The program-specified operations for insertion systems and reusable systems will be aimed at the technical retooling in that area, one task of which is to preclude the use of toxic fuel components and to give back to the national economy some of the land that was taken out of production before to serve as a drop zone for spent components. The Proton and Soyuz rockets will be updated, and new rockets will be created. Considerable attention will be devoted to choosing efficient configurations of reusable systems and to the completion of the flight tests of the Energiya-Buran system. Russia is performing joint work in the space program with 18 countries. Some of the services involving international programs will be proffered on a commercial basis. We hope that in the course of this program, our space program will soon assume again a place befitting it and will further benefit hundreds of millions of people.
