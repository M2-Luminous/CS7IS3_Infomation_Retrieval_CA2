Our correspondent reports on the latest developments there: Sources from the two warring sides present contradictory reports about the outcome of battles during the last two days. Both sides, however, confirm that battles in Kabul during the last 48 hours have left hundreds of people dead or injured. An official of the Ministry of Intelligence and Culture [as heard], who is close to the Afghan president, said today: Forces opposing the government have been forced to retreat from the positions they occupied on the first day of the battles. Furthermore, he said, 200 fighters of the [Afghanistan Islamic Revolution] Coordination Council have been killed. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] said that in the battles during the last two days a number of areas, such as the Microryan residential estate, the senior officers' training complex, Hidgah mosque and parts of the Hudkheyl area have been captured by the forces of the Coordination Council. He added: A large number of forces loyal to the government have been killed or wounded in the process, and tens of corpses still litter the battle grounds. The spokesman also announced: A Scud surface-to-surface missile was fired from Mazar Sharif toward positions held by Sayyaf's Hezb-e Ettehad-e Eslami [Islamic Union] forces in the Karizmir area, near Paghman. He added: Paghman, situated west of Kabul, has also been bombarded by General Dostam's aircraft. Meanwhile, reports indicate that during yesterday and today a Coordination Council delegation to Islamabad met and conferred with the ambassadors of France, America, Russia, and England, the UN envoy in charge of Afghan affairs, and an Islamic Conference Organization delegation. It was announced that these meetings with foregin ambassadors and envoys are taking place in order to enable the Council to explain its stances, while at the same time it is hoped that ways of establishing a cease-fire in Kabul will be achieved through these meetings.
