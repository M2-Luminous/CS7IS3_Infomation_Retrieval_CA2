The fratricidal war continues to ruin and bleed our nation white, destroying our Kampuchean motherland. If this disastrous situation continues, our motherland and race will certainly perish. Faced with such a tragic situation, it is my duty to invite Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the Cambodian People's Party and of the National Assembly of Cambodia; Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, chairman of the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party and first prime minister of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC]; Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister of the RGC; and His Excellency Khieu Samphan, head of the party of Democratic Kampuchea to a Round Table of Peace and National Reconciliation to be held under my chairmanship at the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh capital from 2 to 7 May 1994. [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk [Dated] Phnom Penh, 22 April 1994
