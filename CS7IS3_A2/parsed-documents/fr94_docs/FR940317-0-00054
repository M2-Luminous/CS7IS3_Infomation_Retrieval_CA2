FR940317-0-00054 FR940317-0-00022 Secondary market disclosure practices present greater concerns. Recent highly publicized defaults 19 and refundings, 20 as well as the tremendous level of issuances during the past two years, have heightened interest in municipal secondary market disclosure. 21 The PSA has testified that today ``secondary market information is difficult to come by even for professional municipal credit analysts, to say nothing of retail investors.'' 22 Substantial issuer information, in the form of official statements, state-required reports, and other public documents, is available from the approximately 20% of municipal issuers that come to market frequently, accounting for 80% of the dollar volume of municipal securities issued. 23 However, the remaining issuers, representing 20% in dollar volume but 80% in number, which come to the market much less frequently, provide substantially less continuing information. Many of these issues are health care issues, housing issues, industrial development bonds, and other conduit financings, 24 financing sectors which have had the greatest incidence of defaults, both monetary and technical. 25 In addition, information often is unavailable for smaller issues of securities of general purpose units of government and the securities of special purpose districts and authorities. 26 19 Examples include the defaults engendered by the failures of Mutual Benefit Life, Executive Life and Tucson Electric Power, and the bankruptcies arising out of the Colorado Special Districts.
