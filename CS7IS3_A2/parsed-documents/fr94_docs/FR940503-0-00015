FR940503-0-00015 FR940503-0-00003 To address these concerns, Form AC has been revised to now require that each converting association provide, as part of the business plan submitted with the application for conversion, a detailed discussion of how the capital acquired in the conversion will be utilized, including, among other things, any proposed stock repurchases. Also, the OTS is revising ยง563b.3(g)(3) to prohibit stock repurchases for one year following conversion. After one year, a recently converted association may file with the appropriate Regional Director an open-market repurchase program in which it can request stock repurchases of no more than 5% of the outstanding capital stock during any twelve month period within the following two years. In addition to the current standards governing permissible repurchases, the Regional Director can now disapprove repurchases if the association does not demonstrate a valid business purpose for the stock repurchase. The regulation, however, will permit the Regional Director to approve amounts greater than 5% in the second and third years if there are circumstances that would justify such repurchases. Section 563b.3(g)(1)(iii) has been deleted to conform with this revision. The OTS also is soliciting comments as to whether the current requirements of the capital distributions regulations governing the ``upstreaming'' of conversion proceeds to holding companies formed by converting institutions should be revised to further restrict the upstreaming of substantial amounts of the conversion proceeds soon after the conversion. K. Other Issues 1. Subscription Rights The conversion regulations require that prior to the completion of a conversion, no person may transfer, or enter into any agreement or understanding to transfer, the legal or beneficial ownership of conversion subscription rights, or the underlying securities to the account of another. 23 23 12 CFR 563b.3(i)(1). The OTS notes that the FDIC and others have recently suggested that it may be appropriate for depositors to be able to transfer and sell their subscription rights so that any ``windfall'' value can be distributed directly to the depositors. In this regard, the OTS believes that this type of change to the current conversion regulations would raise a number of novel and complex legal and policy issues, many of which were taken into account previously by the FHLBB in determining to prohibit transferability. These issues include the possibility of adverse federal tax consequences to depositors receiving such rights, undue pressure on mutual associations to convert that may evolve from significant shifts of savings funds by depositors into such associations, difficulties in equitably allocating such subscription rights among depositors, potential manipulation of the process by sophisticated third parties to the detriment of the depositors, incentives for manipulation by insiders, the continued need for establishment and maintenance of a liquidation account, 24 and significantly increased conversion costs due to compliance with securities laws requirements for registering subscription rights for public distribution. 24 The regulations require that a converting association establish and maintain a liquidation account for the benefit of eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account holders in an amount equal to the association's net worth at the date of conversion. Each eligible account holder is deemed to have a pro rata inchoate interest in the liquidation account. In the event of a complete liquidation of the association, an account holder's interest may not be increased after conversion, but may be reduced by any subsequent decrease in the account holder's savings account balance. See 12 CFR 563b.3(c)(13). The OTS believes these issues must be carefully analyzed before considering regulatory changes in this area. Therefore, the OTS is not proposing any change at this time that would allow for the transfer or sale of subscription rights, but is requesting comment on whether subscription rights should continue to be nontransferable, or if transferability is recommended, the reasons for, and the manner in which to allow for, such transfer. 2. Availability of Conversion Documents The conversion regulations, since adoption in 1974, have prohibited the placing of copies of preliminary conversion stock offering and proxy soliciting materials in the OTS public files. The OTS has noted, over the past few years, an increasing interest shown by account holders, the public and the media in the information contained in those portions of an application for conversion. The OTS believes that even though this information is preliminary in nature, it may be useful for account holders and the public to access it earlier in the conversion process. The OTS, therefore, is revising ยง563b.4(c) to eliminate the automatic confidential treatment that has been afforded this information in the past. The revision will permit the public to have ready access to all relevant materials regarding proposed conversion transactions. 25 Applicants will have the ability to request confidential treatment of any portion of these materials by following the confidential treatment procedures contained in section 563b.4(c). 25 This revision augments the amount of information regarding conversions currently required to be made public by converting associations. Section 563b.4(a)(3)(i) requires that, promptly after adoption of a plan of conversion by its board of directors, a converting association must notify its members, and make copies of the adopted plan of conversion available for inspection by its members at each office of the savings association. Section 563b.4(a)(3)(ii) also allows a converting association to issue a press release announcing the conversion.
