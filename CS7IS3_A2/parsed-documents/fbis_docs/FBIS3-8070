The commander of the Serb forces in the territories east of Tuzla, Colonel Momir Zec, has said that the Serb forces, regardless of the agreement which allows humanitarian flights to Tuzla, are keeping a close watch on the airport. Col. Zec Told Belgrade daily POLITIKA that the top Serb military officials were not surprized by the decision to re-open the Tuzla airport. "This is a political move which removes the NATO threats and, within such a compromise, it suits us better to have Russian troops supervize the airport," Col. Zec explained. The whole issue of the Tuzla airport has been discussed by the media for the past seven months, the Colonel recalls. It is an artificial, extremely politicized construction, allegedly aimed at facilitating the supply of relief aid. it is obvious that some Western countries want to neutralize the arms embargo resolution on Bosnia and use the airport to supply the Bosnian Moslems with arms. The Tuzla airport is 5-6 km away from Serb front lines, Col. Zec said. it is in poor condition. The runway, which was damaged, is being repaired, but not the airport buildings. Colonel Zec also denied some agency allegations that the Bosnian Serbs bombarded Tuzla 3 days ago, immediately after the downing of the four aircraft near Banjaluka. "We do not bombard Tuzla. We only respond to Moslem provocations, but our actions are aimed strictly at military targets," Colonel Zec said. Since the beginning of the war, two years ago, there have never been large-scale battles between the Serbs and Moslems in and around Tuzla. 14,000 Serbs still remain in the town, but the Moslem authorities refuse to allow them to leave.
