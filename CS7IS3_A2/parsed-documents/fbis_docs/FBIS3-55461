Armenian Defense Ministry press service reported that there was intense enemy howitzer fire at the defensive positions around Vahan in Krasnoselskiy Rayon at about 1000. The Armenian side did not retaliate. There were no casualties on our side. No other incidents have taken place along the rest of the border since last night. Fierce battles are continuing along almost the entire Karabakh confrontation line. Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army press service reported that though the Azerbaijanis have made certain insignificant advances, the Karabakh troops are managing to halt enemy attacks in some sectors of the front. The enemy is trying at all costs to break through the Armenian defensive lines at some point, and is therefore launching attacks and sustaining heavy losses. Nearly 3,000 Azerbaijani troops and officers have been killed during the incessant battles since 18 December. More than 70 fighters were killed on the Karabakh side during that same period. The Azerbaijanis launched attacks in the eastern and southern sectors of the front this morning, but Armenian forces are repulsing them.
