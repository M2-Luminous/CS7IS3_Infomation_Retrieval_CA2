In yesterday's press conference at the Shangri-la Edsa Plaza Hotel, he discussed his recommendation to consider a "`negotiating package' to overcome the current nuclear stalemate and regain momentum for a gradual and controlled three-stage process for Korean unification." He said the North Korean nuclear program threatens security and peace in the region, and suggested a base on which peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula can take place. His "negotiating package" calls for the United States' recognition of North Korea "as a legitimate member of the world community" and for the establishment of diplomatic and economic relations between the two countries. He also reiterated that the "Team Spirit" military exercise in South Korea needs to be suspended or better yet abolished. On the other hand, North Korea should accept International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections, abandon its nuclear ambition, and stop any hostile policy against Seoul. He also presented his proposed model of gradual reunification which needs to be achieved through three peaceful principles of coexistence. Stage one is the "confederation of two independent governments, where each maintains authority in foreign affairs, national defense, and internal administration." Among its features is the equal number of representatives from each government to the Korean Republics and the consensus needed before any measure is passed. The confederation would aim to achieve the principles of peaceful coexistence, peaceful exchange, and peaceful reunification. The second stage is the Korean federal system which is composed of two local governments given autonomy on internal matters but where foreign affairs and national defense are the responsibility of a federal government. Stage three will be complete reunification which he believes may be more than a decade away.
