Igor Sergeyev says Moscow is no longer in control of the safety of nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine. In an interview with Interfax on Tuesday, he said that the missile troops deployed in Ukraine were no longer under Moscow's control after the commanders of the 43rd and 46th missile divisions took an oath of allegiance to Kiev. Sergeyev spoke of being unable to control troops "whose officers expressed loyalty to another state." He said he outlined the emerging situation in letters to Ukrainian and Russian Defence Ministers Vitaliy Radetskyy and Pavel Grachev. At the same time, the Russian official pointed to progress in the negotiations on the pullout of nuclear weapons from Ukraine. He said the first batch of nuclear weapons was to be transferred to Russia on March 28. Sergeyev said that tension was also running high over the nuclear weapons deployed in Kazakhstan whose leadership prevented the transfer of weapons to Russia and opposed the plan for taking obsolete missiles off combat duty. Sergeyev says the dismantling of those missiles should have been started in 1993 but nothing has so far happened. In his words, Moscow has no problems with the servicing or withdrawal of nuclear weapons deployed in Belarus. "These have remained under our jurisdiction," said the general. He also said that one of the three missile divisions deployed in Belarus had been pulled out and disbanded as scheduled. The two remaining divisions are to be withdrawn and demobilized in the first half of 1996. Sergeyev says the withdrawal process will taken in stages: four regiments will be withdrawn in 1994 and the other four a year later. This will bring an end to the pullout of nuclear weapons from Belarus. The two divisions are to be disbanded in the first half of 1996. Sergeyev says that his troops' combat readiness is just as high as in the period of stagnation in the former Soviet Union when military supplies were good. In his words, the withdrawal of obsolete missiles were being carried out as scheduled.
