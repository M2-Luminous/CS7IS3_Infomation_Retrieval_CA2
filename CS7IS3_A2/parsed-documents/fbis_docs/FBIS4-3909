These advances have come in the fields of surveying resources and monitoring the environment and natural disasters by using high- and remote-sensing technologies, including satellite sensing. Official sources have said that China has established a dozen large-scale geographical information systems, including a national territory survey, flood forecast on the lower reaches of the Yellow River and anti-disaster measures. Others include a monitoring information system for the "three norths" (north, northeast and northwest China) forest belts and environmental development, one for Shanghai's urban construction, one for the underground pipe network in urban Beijing and one for the basic land conditions in northeast China's Liaoning Province. Speaking at today's inaugural meeting of the China Geographical Information Association, director of the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping Jin Xiangwen said that China's construction of a geographical data bank has gone into high gear. He said that a data bank on the primary geographical conditions of the national territory has been built up at the scale of one to one million, adding that a new one at one to 250,000 is in the pipeline. Meanwhile, he said, China has started building a high-precision data bank of the earth compiled from satellite information. A digital survey and mapping system is being constructed to gradually integrate aerial and remote-sensing surveys and the information system for the national territory integrated into a whole, according to the official. Jin said that his bureau has set up digital production bases in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Xian, Chengdu and Harbin. Meanwhile, China has set up a key national lab for resources and environment information, a key national lab for surveys and mapping using remote-sensing data and a research institute for mapping and geographical information systems.
