The club recognizes the need for treating toxic waste but says that the Premex Antstalt's project contradicts the Latvian law on dangerous waste and a respective Basel convention. The project provides to build a plant for burning highly toxic chemical waste in the vicinity of the Riga port. The firm plans to process not only Latvia's own waste but to bring it in from Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the CIS and the United States. The first stage of the project envisions to build one processor able to burn down 50 percent of the totally planned volume of noxious substances. Later, two more processors would be built. From their total burning capacity of 300 tons per year, 20 percent would be Latvia's own and 80 percent -- imported waste. The project requires a $450 million investment and 10 million U.S. dollars in yearly operational costs.
