He warned the Estonian side: [Grachev] If this situation changes, then it will not take long to reinforce this group in order to guard and defend Russian military sites securely. [Ivlev] The Estonian authorities' policies toward the Russian-speaking population was called apartheid by Pavel Grachev. [Grachev] They are dividing them into black and white, brown and red, green and blue. What is this? So what if by nationality he is Russian? He was born and grew up there, or he has lived there for 30 or 40 years. That is his land as well when it comes down to it. It is not permissible for anyone to throw him out his own country. [Ivlev] Pavel Grachev also touched on the issue of Russia's attitude to the Partnership for Peace program that, in his opinion, is not entirely suitable for our country. [Grachev] You know, we came to the conclusion why should we not, Russia, put forward our own partnership concept. What, are we worse than the others when it comes down to it? [Ivlev] A group of Russian scholars are to prepare proposals on this by 15 May that will then be examined by a Russian Security Council session. If they are approved then they will be announced by Pavel Grachev on 24 May at NATO's headquarters in Brussels. Aleksey Ivlev, Vladimir Abdeyev, NTV, from the Russian Defense Ministry.
