What hampered the Republic of Latvia's Supreme Council and what hampers the Saeima in finally bringing to legislation? Do we really have a deceiving Republic of Latvia and a deceiving Saeima, as a few loud and angry people now conclude? Perhaps Latvia really should be transformed from a parliamentary republic to a presidential republic, as a larger, but more moderate group of people think. Is a single and guaranteed correct answer to such questions even possible? Leaving the answers to them to each reader, RIGAS BALSS inquired of the Saeima chairman, Anatolijs GORBUNOVS, about the process, procedures and backstage events in the formation of laws. [Bekeris] So, could a critical period arise that the Saeima becomes unnecessary and "undefendable" from the inhabitants of Latvia and even in the view of its own citizen's interests? [Gorbunovs] I think that in the near future that will not happen. Yes, ignoring the critical attitude toward the parliament or toward the way in which the parliament operates, or toward individual deputies or factions, I think that the public does understand that the parliament is a mechanism for realizing and regulating public interests with the help of laws, so that conflicts can be resolved and compromises can be found. If the parliament is regularly democratically renewed then it will more or less reflect society itself. It is a mechanism in which citizens can realize their goals or also select representatives who express their interests and there must, of course, be such a place where the interests of citizens can be harmonized. International experience has not discovered anything better than a parliament. Of course with different emphases, different functions, but the basic idea is the same. In the developed world this thought and form appeared around the year 1600, that is, in the 17th century. [Bekeris] Do you directly, as the Saeima chairman, have the right to initiate legislation? Does it seem to you that the Saeima responds with sufficient sensitivity to all of our conflicting life courses? [Gorbunovs] I have the same right to initiate legislation as any other deputy, but to do so four more deputies are needed, for the constitution stipulates that a legislative initiative must have five deputies. If five deputies submit a proposed law, then the Saeima reviews it. But regarding the response and recall of conflicting and actual life processes, that is a very complicated question. Legislators are criticized because we do not have laws appropriate to one or another of life's fields and regarding various economic or social processes, which would advance reforms. And this criticism has some basis. Occasionally it does indeed sound very simplistic, as if by adopting a few laws or amendments all problems could be resolved. In fact things in essence are that now all areas of life, all economic and social processes must be reformed and that must all be reflected in laws. And here we must have whole legislative blocs. Of course, to work out laws conceptually and then to polish them juridically requires a large and vast job. We are, unfortunately, missing a professional apparatus of clerks as foreign parliaments have, who have worked for many years and have an accepted procedure for their competitive placement. In addition, the situation in Latvia is too complicated to permit simply adopting all of Europe's best legislation. We, first of all, must take into account everything that has gone on until now, Latvia's legislation in the 1920's and 1930's, for that was the basis for the development of the Latvian state. Then nationalization. Also the system created in the Soviet period: Soviet judicial and socialist economic relations. The results of colonization and occupation. And the current task is to renew everything at the same time and also to transform based on the principle of a law-based and democratic state. In addition there is the property question, relations between former owners and the current users of property, taking into account the mass deportations and emigration of the 1940's, mainly among Latvians, largely reducing it to a national question. I sometimes think that if we, with our current legislative experience only now began to take on reform then indeed.... On the other hand, how would we have gotten this experience otherwise? [Bekeris] Do the mass media--the press, TV, radio--influence the legislative process? Is such influence even desireable and, if you acknowledge it, then how does it manifest itself? [Gorbunovs] Of course the mass media have quite broad opportunities to influence deputies and that must be done. Often such influence is indirect, for radio and television do not literally discuss various amendments or changes in editing laws. Of course the press, TV and radio influence legislation conceptually, for every law or amendment to a law is a political fact, it is an instrument to realize a concrete policy. And in analyzing specific policies or Saeima faction doctrines, expressing the arguments "for" or "against," along with that the press, TV and radio bring pressure on political parties, on factions, and that is either support or a position of opposition and, if this position truly is argued, analyzed, then it definitely influences the legislative process positively. [Bekeris] How does the "Saeima Mail" function, which receives complaints and suggestions from inhabitants? Do the appropriate [Saeima] commissions have a mutual contact with these correspondences? [Gorbunovs] There is a suggestions bureau, a suggestions commission. These suggestions are analyzed and categorized, and, of course, the commissions also strive to answer concrete letters. Suggestions of a general nature are copied and distributed to all factions. But in our election system and deputies' responsibilities, the link with voters also has its problems, for voters vote for parties and it is clear that in a proportional representation system, from which district each deputy is elected, but this clarity does not reach beyond Kurzeme, Vidzeme, Latgale and Zemgale. Deputies in other, foreign parliaments have already told us that this proportional system cannot long survive, that it is a transitional period system and until now it still exists in Italy, but it is now being fixed there too, for the ideal is that each deputy has an electoral district. In return for a mixed system, both majoritarian and proportional, where a deputy is responsible to his party, he has also an electoral district, in which there is a direct bond with the voters and responsibility to the voters. That, of course, is more effective. About letters. If a letter is written to me personally, then I also strive to respond to all of those who have written me. But sometimes these letters are addressed to the Saeima, including only my surname or post--Saeima Chairman--then I address them to all factions. Some letters, which are particularly urgent, we copy and distribute to all deputies, although they are not addressed to them. In their speeches deputies often cite voter letters. [Bekeris] Did the activity of the earlier Supreme Council disturb the influence of the so-called lobbyists and is something similar sensed right now? [Gorbunovs] Lobbyists personally do not come to me, but that does not mean that deputies do not sense lobbyists. Here we should analyze what this lobbying is, for I conceive of lobbying as political pressure, which is brought by one or another social group in defending its interests, and that is completely acceptable; without normal lobbying the parliament cannot even function. But it is very important that deputies see beyond these interests to the context of the interests of the whole society, or else he, too, turns into a narrow lobbyist. Since we have been working for only less than a year, it seems to me that deputies have not yet become connected to narrow lobbying. It does show up occasionally, but it has not been so awful. When the Supreme Council completed its work this lobbying was more pronounced. [Bekeris] How does the work of the Supreme Council chairman differ from your current work as Saeima chairman? [Gorbunovs] My situation has changed significantly. Working as the Supreme Council chairman I "smoothed out" many things during sessions, right in the meeting hall. Now my task is not to smooth out conflict, but rather to give deputies equal opportunities so that they can always depend on the fact that their wishes will be correctly and consistently observed. If some deputy today is refused on some procedural question, then he knows that his political oppenent will be just as correctly refused next time, and that is one of the chief fundamental rules for the normal functioning of the parliament. As soon as deputies feel injustice, unfruitful discussions of procedure begin. In terms of procedural issues the Saeima chairman adopts very few rules by himself. In return his rights as a deputy do not become limited. He may participate in debates, vote, work as a member of a Saeima commission, and also he may stand in for the President in the absence of the President. As a member of the team, feeling complete responsibility for the work of "Latvia's Way," [LW] I actively work in the "LW" faction and coalition, and also on the Economic Commission. Leading plenary sessions requires me to be objective and tolerant toward all viewpoints, but after surviving a few faction and commission sessions I yielded to subjective emotions. [Bekeris] Do you see a possibility that the governing coalition will be able to draw in other Saeima factions and deputies? [Gorbunovs] First, people will want to evaluate the results of what we are doing and how we are doing it in a longer time frame. Another thing, that there must be a mutual connection between the voters and responsibility. That must happen through party members, but I think in any event that forced party development in the near term will not happen, not within "Latvia's Way," nor anywhere else. Are we thinking about expanding the political union? It is doubtful that that would happen in the near term. "Latvia's Way" is open to political dialogue on this question. But two conditions must be taken into account here. First, that other parties would gladly find themselves in opposition for a while and not connect themselves with the governing coalition, for that would also mean accepting responsibility for mistakes and for the fact that much has not yet been achieved. Second, the minority government formed by "Latvia's Way" and the Agrarian Union, not having achieved a majority in the parliament, causes it to work very carefully and to keep together, accepting full responsibility, and that, perhaps, is also a basis for a certain stability. Whereas establishing a new union, expanding the existing one, or establishing a new coalition on a platform in which only individual program points are mutual, that would an unstable thing and that should not be done. Whether that is normal or a coincidence, "Latvia's Way" and the Agrarian Union is developing a coalition whose place is in the center and to the right of center. The opposition is found on both the right and left wings. That is why it is practically not possible to develop a coalition government. That is not something for which blame should be assigned or which is to be wondered about. That would more readily look like irresponsibility or adventurism. That, it seems to me, opposition factions also understand, and--my conclusion may be in conflict with other conclusions expressed--that causes opposition factions also to be constructive, both in introducing legislation and various amendments and changes to laws, and in actively participating in discussions of proposed laws submitted by the government. That, in turn, sometimes causes indignation within the governing coalition, as they try simultaneously to maintain the capacity to do battle. If there is no internal division within the faction, then, it seems to me, two scenarios are possible: Either "Latvia's Way" and the Agrarian Union of Latvia will honestly work to the end, together drinking the bitter herb, or there will be an early election for the Saeima.
