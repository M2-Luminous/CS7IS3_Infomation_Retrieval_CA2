The French energy corporation Elf Aquitaine and the Trust Agency agreed on a compromise on Friday [25 March]. Buna GmbH, which is owned by the Trust Agency, is to take over the shares held by Thyssen Tradition Union in 1997 and, in return, will receive up to 33 percent of the Minol shares from Elf. Elf Aquitaine has achieved its goal: The current majority shareholder in the 4-billion-mark [DM] project in Leuna has been able to reduce its shares from 67 to 43 percent. The Russian company Rosneft will take over the relevant 24 percent in the planned construction of a large refinery in Leuna. Minol Shares Thrown In If Thyssen Trading Union -- which holds 33.3 percent in the consortium -- leaves the project after the completion of the refinery, Buna GmbH will take over its shares. In return, Buna is to "get up to 33 percent of the Minol gasoline station network from Elf," Trust Agency Wolf Schoede announced on Friday. Prospects for Buna Thus, the path has been paved for the construction of the large refinery. However, according to Schoede, the board of governors of Elf Aquitaine still has to take a vote on the result in Paris on Monday [28 March]. If the body were to oppose the compromise, against all expectations, the Trust Agency will demand -- as has been agreed by contract -- the return of the Minol gasoline station network and, at the same time, call for a contractual penalty of DM1.5 billion. The new refinery, with an annual capacity of about 8 million tonnes, is a decisive pillar for the preservation of large chemical industries in the central German triangle. Above all, for Buna GmbH "the privatization prospects have improved further, since Buna will get an attractive share in Minol," as Schoede said. In addition, Buna, which is the largest buyer of refinery products in the region, can build raw material deliveries on a secure basis. On Wednesday [23 March] Trust Agency President Birgit Breuel signed a declaration of intent with representatives of Thyssen and the Russian Gazprom AG, according to which the two take over the management of the polyolefine chemical industry in Buna and Boehlen for five to seven years. According to the Trust Agency concept, in the future Buna is to be supplied directly with natural gas from the Siberian field of Yamal. The natural gas is to be transported with tanker ships from Arkhangelsk to Rostock and then be provided to Buna through a pipeline from the Baltic Sea coast, which is still to be built. Land Provides Financial Aid The Thyssen Tradition Union welcomes the compromise. A Thyssen spokesman said that if construction begins after Easter, the refinery will be completed on time at the end of 1996 or the beginning of 1997. FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said that Elf Aquitaine is "now all the more obligated to act." Saxony-Anhalt Economics Minister Rainer Lukowitz announced that the project will be supported with approximately DM1 billion from the land and the Federal Government.
