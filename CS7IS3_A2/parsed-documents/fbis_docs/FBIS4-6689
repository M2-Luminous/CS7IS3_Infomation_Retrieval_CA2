Aichi told U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, however, that the action will be within the framework of the pacifist Constitution which bars the country from resorting to the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. The defense ministers of Japan and the United States agreed that the U.N. Security Council will respond if diplomatic efforts fail to settle the North Korean nuclear issue. Perry arrived in Tokyo earlier in the day from Seoul for a two-day visit to Japan. He will meet Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on Friday.
