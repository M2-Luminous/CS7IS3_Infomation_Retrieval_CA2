"If we launch economic transformations such that the population cannot hold out to the end, this social unacceptability will put the brakes on economic reform once again," he said. About Slovakia's high (14.8 percent) unemployment, Kovac said that "especially disquieting is the large share of long-term unemployment, which is threatening to become unemployability. More than a third of the people without work are below the age of 25. This is a very bad start to life." He described the onset of a decline in unemployment in districts where economic change is apparently happening faster and strengthening the private sector as a springboard. The new government's recipe for reducing unemployment comes from understanding that the solution lies not with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, but with the economics ministries. "The fastest method of eliminating unemployment lies in developing small and medium businesses and the neglected area of tourism, although this could suck up the work force like a sponge," he said. "If we are able to start a system of supporting small and medium businesses, we will hold unemployment below the desired ceiling of 17 percent." The system is to consist of simplified legal regulations, clear rules for rapid privatization, easier availability of credit, and tax breaks for businesses. This system should also restore the confidence of foreign investors, whose interest in Slovakia weakened last year, Kovac said. The solution also lies in better preparation for the restructuring of the economy so that companies can alter their production plans rapidly, and in the launching of large construction projects such as highways, the reconstruction of the railways, the completion of the Mochovce nuclear power plant, or a dam in Zilina, West Slovakia. In the meantime, the government must keep alive the educational and health care systems, which have reached a critical condition because of "ill considered restrictions without (properly) prepared systemic measures." The health care system, threatened by debts of 50 billion Slovak crowns ($1.5 billion) from uncompleted construction projects and obsolete equipment and 1.8 billion crowns ($54 million) for unpaid-for medications and other materials, should be protected through emergency financing at the beginning, but changes must be adopted quickly, Kovac said. "It is necessary to complete the privatization of pharmacies and to set in motion the privatization of spas and the activities of the health profession. This is possible only under a relatively stable system of incentives.... I believe it will be possible to introduce the new system as early as June or July." A compromise under preparation with the labor unions on changes in the Tripartite (government, labor, employers) General Agreement should also help preserve social peace, Kovac said. But concluding talks with the unions depends on the views of the International Monetary Fund concerning the new government's economic program.
