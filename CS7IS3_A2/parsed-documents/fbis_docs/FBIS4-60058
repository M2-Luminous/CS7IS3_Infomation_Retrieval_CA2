It must remain a symbol of democracy and accord in Kurdistan. The two years since the election of this parliament have been rife with a series of malicious plots and intrigues concocted by the enemies of our Kurdish people. It succeeded in confronting all these problems through sincere and arduous efforts and appropriate decisions. The current stage puts historic responsibilities on Parliament, responsibilities that require it to play an effective role in unifying the views of the two main parties in Kurdistan: The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] and the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] and to do all it can to normalize the situation. Our final word is that the masses of Kurdistan elected the Parliament and trust in it. Anyone who believes in the masses and respects their aspirations will believe in the Parliament, respect its sanctity, have recourse to it, and consider working through it to be a civilized way of overcoming problems and warding off dangers.
