When asked to comment on the plan by Li Teng-hui of Taiwan to "spend his holiday" in some Southeast Asian countries in February, he said "we are very concerned about it." Recently, the spokesman noted, the Taiwan authorities have been trying to develop `substantive relations' with some countries by spending holiday and paying private visits there, which is what they call `holiday-making diplomacy'." [no beginning quotation mark as received] By so doing, he said, they attempt to squeeze into some international and regional organizations and seek the status of a "political entity". Therefore, under whatever names and in whatever forms, Li Teng-hui's visits to those countries cannot cover up his political intention and the official nature of such visits, he added. He stated that the Chinese Government stands firmly opposed to the official contact between Taiwan and countries having diplomatic relations with China. We hope the countries concerned would cherish the fruits of the all-round development of their relations with China and be alert to the political intention of the Taiwan authorities so as to protect the friendly relations and cooperation between China and those countries from being disrupted and jeopardized," the spokesman said.
