Israel will respond to this U.S. request, which was recently received here, by the end of the month. The Defense and Foreign Ministries are preparing to hold consultations on the reply. On 22 May, a discussion on the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC] was held at Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' office. Israel signed the convention in January 1993. In its reply to the United States, it will presumably announce that since the ratification date is not until next year, Israel will not address the issue at the present time. To prevent the CWC from harming its security and to ensure a Middle East free of chemical weapons, however, Israel will demand that Arab countries also sign the convention. [passage omitted]
