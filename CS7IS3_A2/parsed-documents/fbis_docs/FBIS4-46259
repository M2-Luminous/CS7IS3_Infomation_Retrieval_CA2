The Movement has to choose between confrontation, understanding, or a truce. What option have the Movement's bodies adopted? Ghawshah: This issue is complex and wide-ranging. I will try to discuss the basic topics dealing with it. First, let us say that the stage of theorization about what stand Hamas will adopt if the Palestinian authority is imposed and the Palestinian police enters the self-rule areas is over. All the Palestinian forces, those who supported or opposed the peace process which started in Madrid and ended with the Cairo agreement are now treading on a minefield. They all should think before taking any step to avoid an explosion that would destroy everything. Hamas has taken measures to counter this stage. The Hamas Movement has resorted to all that is in its power to confront the march of capitulation which began in Madrid, and succeeded in obstructing and delaying this march. There is a mighty force behind this process, represented by the United States, the Zionist forces, and the regimes loyal to them, and these forces succeded in imposing the Cairo and Oslo agreement on the Palestinian people. The hands of the clock cannot be set back, but we can make proposals that would prevent the explosion and at least limit the losses. We in the Hamas Movement approach the Palestinian authority and the police force with caution. We will judge them on the basis of their deeds and not their words, especially sweet talk which is rife at the present time. We believe that avoiding confrontation is a national and religious duty by which all should abide. The Hamas Movement has translated this into a political stand and decision not to confront the Palestinian authority and police force. We will deal with them in a civilized and peaceful manner by highlighting the mistakes, secrets, and loopholes in the Cairo and Oslo agreements and mobilizing the masses and forces in and outside the territories to reject this agreement and foil it with civilized methods. This is the stand of the Palestinian opposition, represented in the Alliance of Palestinian Forces. The Palestinian police force is part of the Palestinian people. Most of its members are from the Palestine Liberation Army [PLA] and had fought the Zionists in many places, particularly in Lebanon during the Zionist invasion of that country. We are fully convinced and we know that this police force has decided not to confront the Palestinian people with bullets. But the overwhelming circumstances to which I referred at the beginning of the interview have forced the PLA to become a police force that carries out joint patrols with the Jews, and whose members eat with the Jews and live with them and normalize their relations with them. We are fully convinced that the members of this police force will not open fire on the children of the stones or the strugglers whose role has been instrumental in achieving the partial withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and whose role will also be instrumental in achieving any future withdrawal from the West Bank. This has taken place thanks to the blood they had shed and their sacrifices and not as a result of the intelligence and ability of the negotiators. [passage omitted] Al-Ma'ayitah: Major General Nasr Yusuf has made a statement on the issue of arms collection. As for yourself, you have said that this issue is taboo and a red line. Do you believe that Maj. Gen. Yusuf's statement was meant to be implemented? Or do you think it was made merely for media purposes? Ghawshah: [passage omitted on Yusuf's background] The arms issue is indeed sensitive and important. It constitutes a red line. There are various weapons at stake. The most important of these are the weapons used by the mujahidin affiliated with the al-Qassam Battalions and other Palestinian forces. These weapons were only used in resistance to occupation troops and settlers. Everybody is well aware that weapons are dear to the mujahidin. The mujahidin's weapons are sacred. They should remain in the hands of the mujahidin. The mujahidin's right to bear arms is enshrined in all temporal charters and heavenly faiths. Additionally, the collection of arms from the Palestinian people is unacceptable. [passage omitted] Al-Ma'ayitah: What about the Hamas Movement's military activities since the start of efforts to implement the autonomy agreement? Ghawshah: The Hamas Movement has explained that it will uphold its principled Islamic jihad stand. Our jihad will continue as long as the occupation of our territories is maintained. [passage omitted] The selection of Zionist targets for attacks is made at the operations room of the al-Qassam Battalions in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian territories occupied in 1948. Al-Ma'ayitah: Has Hamas thought of launching an opposition political party? Has it considered the idea of cooperating with some forces and figures to launch such a party so that it may deal politically with the self-rule authority? Ghawshah: [passage omitted] As regards the Hamas Movement, this issue is under consideration, particularly since it was dictated by the developments of the current phase. However, the launching of parties has its pros and cons; and the cons might outweigh the pros. The launching of parties that implicitly approve the Palestinian-Israeli agreement might be facilitated. [passage omitted on Palestinian politics] Al-Ma'ayitah: It is now three years since the opposition was launched under the name of the 10 factions, and, more recently, the Alliance of Palestinian Factions [APF] was formed. Don't you think that this is as far as these factions will go -- a ceiling that is not measuring up to the challenges? Ghawshah: You may recall that in late 1993, following the signing of the Oslo accord, Hamas pressed for a provisional Palestinian leadership to take over. Regrettably, however, a number of the Palestinian factions had their sights set too low. We were so anxious for the 10 factions' formula to get off the ground that we went along with a formula based on political tasks rather than a political agenda, governed by a majority consensus rather than unanimity. We knew that this was not exactly the right formula, and hoped that it will be developed. Hamas, however, found itself a loner in the field, particularly regarding the intifadah and militarily. When they demanded that a combined nationalist-Islamic command be instituted inside the homeland, we demanded confidence- building initiatives on their part. For example, having refused to consider an alliance with Islamic forces in the elections for the Dentists Association in Gaza so that we may beat the capitulationist candidates, the democratic forces should not go on to call for a unified command. How can can there be a unified command if these other factions are not active in terms of jihad and the intifadah. This and other obstacles have stood in the way of refining the APF's formula. [passage omitted] The APF formula needs reformulation in light of new factors. It may be better to establish a wide opposition front during the next stage--a front which has a definite concept and in which every one in the occupied territories takes part with all his might--and to activate the Palestinian diaspora. The Palestinian people in the diaspora, however, are the big losers. Al-Ma'ayitah: Is Hamas' decision to continue the intifadah still valid or is it under study and reconsideration? Ghawshah: There is no doubt that the new era, as well as epitomizing the self-rule on the ground, will affect the intifadah, which is aimed at ending the occupation. As a result, the intifadah activity will drop in areas from which the Zionist forces withdraw. However, the intifadah's activities are numerous. Some activities are expected to reduce in the self-rule area after the end of the occupation, and some other activities will lead to friction with the self-rule authority and its supporters. The Hamas Movement will study and assess these matters, as well as intifadah activities, to secure the desired results and eliminate negative factors. Hamas may call for the reduction of some intifadah activities that have no impact on the overall conflict with the Zionists, especially within the self-rule area. But jihad and resistance will continue against the occupation everywhere. Al-Ma'ayitah: Is Hamas satisfied by the interaction of Islamic peoples and movements with the intifadah and Hamas' role? Ghawshah: [passage omitted] The Islamic movements in the cordon states have a basic role to play in supporting jihad activity undertaken by Hamas inside Palestine. These movements's political, popular, and militant performance has not reached the level required in the Islamic and political arenas.
