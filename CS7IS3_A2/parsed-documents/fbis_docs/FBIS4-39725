The Riigikogu speaker acknowledged that the present crisis within the Fatherland party has transported itself to the Cabinet, and that there is a serious danger that this may turn into a constitutional crisis. Now some of his fellow thinkers in the republican group within the Fatherland Party have recommended that he should stand for the Fatherland's chairman and take it upon himself to form a new government, as a candidate for premier. According to Nugis, he sees this as a task from his fellow thinkers. Shirking one's responsibility can only be seen as a betrayal of one's ideals, said Nugis. According to him, the Riigikogu has now formed the opinion that the Government led by Mart Laar cannot stay. In the opinion of the Riigikogu speaker, parliament is ready for a vote of no confidence in the present government, regardless of the outcome of the elections at the Fatherland meeting. According to Nugis, the government coalition is also of the same opinion.
