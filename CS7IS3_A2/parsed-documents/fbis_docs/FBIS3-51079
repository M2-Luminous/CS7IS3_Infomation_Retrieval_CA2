The meeting, summoned by President Carlos Menem, was attended by Defense Minister Oscar Camilion, Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf, the chiefs of staff of the three branches of the Armed Forces, and Division General Mario Diaz, the chief of the Joint Staff. The meeting was also attended by Presidency Secretary General Eduardo Bauza, SIDE [Secretariat for State Intelligence] chief Hugo Anzorreguy, Deputy Miguel Angel Toma, and Senator Eduardo Menem. The meeting analyzed the situation in Santiago del Estero and La Rioja, and studied a report submitted by Jorge Busti, minister of government in the cabinet under the Federal Government trustee in Santiago del Estero, who described the social situation in this province. According to the source, the report stated that social conditions are now "totally different from those prevailing at the end of December." Concerning La Rioja, the possibility of a missile attack against the presidential plane on 30 December -- which had been mentioned by a press report -- was "totally ruled out." The SIDE chief mentioned the information gathered by his sector on the social situation in the provinces. He ruled out "any reaction like that which is happening in Mexico," the source said. In brief statements made upon leaving the Olivos residence, Camilion and Ruckauf said "there are no indications of possible social outbursts in the northern provinces," adding that "the situation in those provinces is under control." The meeting was called for by Menem in light of the reports of an attack against him and the reports -- which were also denied -- of the presence of Argentine guerrillas in Mexico. Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo today denied having compared the crisis in Santiago and the situation in Mexico, despite the fact that almost all local publications made this interpretation of the words he had uttered 24 hours before at the Finance Ministry.
