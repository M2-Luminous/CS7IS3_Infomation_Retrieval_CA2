That covers not just Rwanda and Burundi, but also a large part of eastern Zaire, and by extension, even Uganda and western Tanzania. Rwanda and Burundi are among the least developed countries. The possibility of more or less stable regimes establishing themselves there seems to have disappeared for years to come. The departure of many foreigners and the freezing of some development funding could put the countries back years economically. There is a chance that another part of black Africa will go down in a huge turmoil. The departure of most foreigners from Rwanda clears the way for a large-scale settling of scores between what remains of the regime and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]. The contrast between the two groups is based on more than an ethnic division between Hutus and Tutsis respectively. During the last two years the RPF had successfully formed coalitions -- albeit constantly changing ones -- with a number of the opposition parties which were recruiting among Hutus. But at times of crises like this one, everything is easily reduced to the ethnic component. Hutus who made "common cause" with the Front were automatically called "collaborators." Which at the moment is equivalent to "shooting target." If the Front does succeed in overrunning Kigali, thanks to its better organization and the motivation of its soldiers, there is little chance of it being able to rule the whole country alone. But it remains an open question whether by that time there will still be a sufficiently cohesive opposition to take things in hand. And whether RPF discipline will hold. The outside world is less well documented about what went wrong as regards human rights in the area controlled by the rebels. But it is absolutely certain that a large number of acts of terror were committed there too. There is a great danger of continuing instability, partly because in past years a large number of weapons entered the country via legal and illegal channels. There is also little chance that if the Front "takes power" in Rwanda, that would not have consequences in Burundi. The calm which has ruled there in recent days is deceptive and almost makes one forget that in October and November between 50,000 and 100,000 people died there, and that in a flare-up in Bujumbura at the end of March several hundred more people died. These recent experiences and the horrific scenes in Rwanda may bring the politicians in Bujumbura to a modus vivendi. But little is necessary to produce another short-circuit. But even if Burundi remains calm, and things in Rwanda simmer down too, the economic consequences will remain. The two countries are largely dependent on development aid and for years Belgium has been the largest bilateral donor to these areas which were formerly under its guardianship. "Rwanda" has suffered wounds which will be difficult to heal in the coming years. The NCOS [National Center For Development Cooperation], which groups together the Flemish nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), said in a declaration yesterday that Belgium could not abandon the people of Rwanda and that the violence was the work of an extremist group. Now, it may well be true that the continuation of development aid in "our" piece of Africa can well be defended, even on the grounds of pure self-interest -- because a large part of the money flows back to Belgium anyway, or in order to limit refugee flows. But in a first phase large sections of the public opinion risk completely turning against this. There is considerable pressure to definitively turn away from central Africa. In mid-1990 Belgium "provisionally" cut links with Zaire after President Mobutu Sese Seko had broken the cooperation agreements out of anger with Brussels' interference in the incidents in Lubumbashi. In the meantime a group of experts and professors, at the request of the state secretary for development cooperation, continued to work on a "master plan" to restart cooperation on a better basis when the time is right. But for the time being the political developments in Kinshasa are not such as to offer sufficient support to any renewed cooperation. Indifference The chance that an authentic democracy will gradually develop seems to have diminished. The shrinking but politically and symbolically important group round Etienne Tshisekedi has been completely cornered. It is unlikely that Belgian politicians can in the present circumstances accept a Zaire where there is no consensus about transition and where President Mobutu continues to play an important role. If Brussels is to change its course in this field, then it will take time. And it will certainly not be enthusiastic. The commercial interests hardly weigh up any more against an indifference which could turn into open hostility for a time, following the events in Rwanda. For many fellow countrymen, Rwanda 1994 is a rerun of Congo 1960-65. Other donor countries and the international aid organizations will in time fill the hole left by the Belgians. But much will have to be built up from zero, depending, among other things, on what remains of Rwandan NGOs, cooperative ventures and "civil society" after the storm which is now gripping the land. In the coming months Rwanda is in danger of becoming dependent on international aid for the most basic item -- food supply. Considerable time could pass before that process gets started. In the meantime there is also the threat of a potentially destabilizing disastrous situation among the many tens of thousands of Burundians who fled over the border at the end of October and start of November. The costs of restarting emergency aid will be considerably higher than having aid continue on the same level. In addition Rwanda and Burundi were the natural outlets for the most dynamic region of eastern Zaire: the Kivu. A regression in the two small countries could further endanger the perspectives of the independent development of the Zairian Kivu region. At present it is rather hopeless to look for positive points in a very somber situation.
