Kakizawa said the two contries have struck a deal on three points to pave the way for reopening the bilateral negotiations on the "priority" industry issues -- Japanese Government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment, autos and auto parts, and insurance business. Among the three points agreed by the two countries is the nature of "objective criteria," demanded by the U.S. for measuring the openness of Japanese markets, Kakizawa said. Kakizawa said Tokyo and Washington have agreed not to use numerical targets as "objective criteria" when assessing foreign penetration into the Japanese markets. He also said he is convinced that Washington will not resort to punitive measures in dealing with trade problems with Japan. The agreement came after on-and-off talks since Thursday between Sozaburo Okamatsu, Japanese vice international trade and industry minister for international affairs and Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi for economic affairs, representing Japan, and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Bowmen Cutter, deputy director of the White House National Economic Council, representing the U.S. Based on the so-called "framework" accord reached last July between then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton, the two countries launched a set of formal market-opening negotiations. The talks, however, collapsed in February at a Washington meeting between Clinton and then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa mainly due to a U.S. demand for specifying "objective criteria." Japan has been opposed to the demand, saying such measures would lead to "managed trade" and fearing Washington would resort to sanctions if such targets are not met. Under the framework accord, Japan is committed to significantly reducing its huge trade surplus by expanding domestic demand and opening its markets wider to foreign goods and services.
