The British Indian Ocean Territory considered to be of "outstanding international conservation importance," includes the strategically important Diego Garcia base, the only US nuclear base in the Indian Ocean. It failed to appear in the Government's action plan on biodiversity last week, despite featuring in a draft version. The territory lies just south of the equator approximately 2,000 miles off the coast of Kenya. It was bought by Britain from Mauritius for Â£3 million in 1965, depopulated and given to the Americans for 50 years for defence purposes. A Royal Navy detachment is also based there and Diego Garcia was the refuelling point for American B52 bombers attacking Iraq during the Gulf war. The territory contains the Great Chagos Bank, the world's largest atoll, and more than 700 species of fish and sea birds and over 500 species of hard coral and molluscs. Friends of the Earth is writing to the Department of the Environment and the Foreign Office asking why no references to the territory appeared in the UK Action Plan on Biodiversity, issued last week as a result of UK pledges at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992. A draft of the plan says: "For protection in the longer term a comprehensive conservation policy, based on a more detailed biodiversity inventory, is required." Tony Juniper, of Friends of the Earth said: "The territory is probably one of Britain's most important assets. Its omission from the final plan is very mysterious. The territory deserves official recognition followed by rigorous protection." He added: "The Diego Garcia base obviously has some role that is incompatible with nature conservation. But there is restricted access and we don't know the truth about what's going on there." A DoE spokeswoman said considering the area's "unique circumstances," it would not be included. "Nevertheless we take our responsibility very seriously and legislative measures have been implemented to protect the islands ecological system."
