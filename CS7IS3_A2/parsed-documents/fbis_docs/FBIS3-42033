Could you please tell us how long it may take to implement this process? It is not going to happen overnight, is it? Unidentified speaker in Russian: I completely agree with you that this process will not be completed in one year. This is a lengthy process that will depend on technical conditions and safe transportation capabilities. To this end, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry is putting together timetables and plans to precisely observe each provision and rule out any off-chance accident. We cannot be even an iota wrong. This is why meeting all safety requirements for transportation will call for a considerable amount of time and effort on the part of the Defense Ministry officials and military officers who are experts on this issue. In addition, the transportation and preparation for it will involve Russian specialists who developed and utilized this nuclear ammunition. Everyone is asking today: When will the first and the last [warhead] be removed? The defense minister has made it perfectly clear: The state has to have state secrets. Today, making public when a nuclear load will be transported through the Ukrainian territory -- which is a distance of from 721 km to 1223 km to our eastern border... This is a long distance. And we must secure safe conditions for this transportation. [passage omitted]
