The political forecast does not predict any break in the clouds. With two presidents for one office, it is a real predetermined battle that the two groups of senators, including those elected on 18 January, are engaged in for control of the office. Both teams confront each other on the air with public accusations. On 9 March, the office of Senator Sansaricq made a point of bringing the battle into the realm of management by the other president, Firmin Jean-Louis, and Quaestor Larosiliere. Referring to some preliminary results of an audit in progress on Jean-Louis' management, Bernard Sansaricq is already accusing these colleagues of embezzlement, and is threatening to engage Justice. [Begin recording] [Sansaricq in Creole] The former office, which was acclaimed by Caputo and Despuy, but which was not constitutionally elected in compliance with the internal rules and the Constitution, from 10 August to 4 February blocked not only the Senate of the Republic, but also the country. We have found corruption in that administration -- what else can I tell you? I will tell you to wait until the audits are over because the same thing happened in Brazil, where 20 legislators are in prison because of corruption. When the audit is over, you never know what can happen. I am determined to take things all the way. [Correspondent Jean-Max Blanc in French] Since you compare the current situation within the Senate with the situation in Brazil, do you think the Haitian senators will have the same fate as the Brazilian senators? [Sansaricq in French] Once we definitively establish proof, yes. Once we establish proof, contact our lawyers, and meet with the public prosecutor, definitely yes. I am determined to do that.
