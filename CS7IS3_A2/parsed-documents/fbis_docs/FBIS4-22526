In the comparatively recent past, almost everyone in the former Union had heard it. Kuchiyev was stand-by captain of the firstcomer of the domestic nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet, the Lenin. The first cruise in navigational history of a surface ship -- the nuclear-powered icebreaker Arktika -- in the North Pole area was made under his command. Now the honored captain of the Arktika is no longer sailing, but works on shore. As before, however, he remains a passionate champion and staunch defender of the nuclear-powered fleet. And there is something to defend and to defend against. We became acquainted back in the days when the beautiful icebreaker Arktika left on its first cruise. Quite a few years have passed since then. In all, Yuriy Kuchiyev sailed on icebreakers for more than 40 years, including more than 20 years on ships with nuclear-powered units. [Struzhentsov] How do you feel these days? -- I asked Kuchiyev. -- Did the decades spent on nuclear-powered ships, in constant proximity to nuclear reactors, have any effect on your health? [Kuchiyev] I gave up being a captain on the bridge on the insistence of physicians, because of ischemic heart disease. Did I receive an overdose of radiation exposure during the years of sailing on nuclear-powered ships? No, I did not. I make so bold as to state: not one of the crew members of nuclear-powered icebreakers has contracted radiation sickness. Moreover, I am convinced that the sojourn in the Arctic did them all good. Even though the Arctic expanses are subjected to man's destructive influence, the ecological situation is still much better there than in other areas of Russia. [Struzhentsov] Do you mean that during the entire time of your work on nuclear-powered icebreakers, there was no threat of radioactive emission, of radiation danger? [Kuchiyev] I affirm: there was not! Localized emergency situations did take place, but there were no emergencies threatening the environment or human health. The emergency safety systems on our nuclear-powered ships are absolutely reliable. All the many years of practical work and the highly professional operation of the nuclear-powered ships are convincing proof. [Struzhentsov] But this is, so to speak, your "own" opinion. What about the international estimate of the safety of the nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet? [Kuchiyev] All our nuclear-powered icebreakers were built at yards in Leningrad and Finland, and took their own route to the Arctic Ocean, with a working reactor, through Danish territorial waters. The Danes studied the air and water in the area of the icebreakers very carefully, and not once did they detect the slightest traces of radiation. Our crew watched the Danish high-speed launches take samples of the water near the very screw propellers of the Arktika, watched helicopters circling above us, taking air samples. Later on we learned from the Danish press that neither the water nor the air caused any alarm among the Danish people. In addition, cruises of nuclear-powered icebreakers carrying foreign tourists to the North Pole have now become quite popular. Is this not an argument in favor of the safety of our nuclear-powered ships? [Struzhentsov] But why, then, don't the United States and Canada, let us say, have any nuclear-powered icebreakers? [Kuchiyev] They have no North Sea route. For the time being the United States does not need a powerful icebreaker fleet with unlimited cruising capacity just for sailing in the Canadian archipelago and in Arctic waters. But we simply cannot do without it. After all, the North Sea route is the reliable transport artery, without which the development and operation of the natural riches of the Arctic -- Russia's main economic reserve -- would be unthinkable. Normal operation of the North Sea route without a modern nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet would be impossible! [Struzhentsov] Why is diesel-electric power inferior? [Kuchiyev] First of all, with respect to fuel and water, ships of this class do not have sufficient cruising capacity. The most unpleasant thing is that they are destructive to the Arctic because of their oil spills. It is onerous for the crews to operate the diesel-electric mastodons which represent yesterday's icebreaker building. There is no alternative in the foreseeable future to the powerful nuclear-powered icebreakers in the Arctic, and indeed in the freezing seas of Northern Russia. It is a pity that many people do not accept this truth. We remember an incident which occurred in Magadan, the residents of which would not let the newest nuclear-powered LASH ship, Sevmorput, with cargo for the Arctic inhabitants, into the port. This stems from technical ignorance and, of course, the Chernobyl syndrome. As they say, "once burned, twice shy." Magadan and other remote ports of the North will not survive without modern nuclear-powered ships. [Struzhentsov] You are not denying, though, that accidents have happened on nuclear-powered ships? [Kuchiyev] They have. For example, on the Arktika, in the first navigation periods, the screws broke. We repaired them ourselves at sea. Difficult, divers' work, but fully within reach of the crew. This has nothing to do, however, with the power unit. With competent servicing, it will not let us down. As for what happened at Chernobyl -- this was first and foremost the result of scandalous sloppiness, which, thank God, we don't yet have in the fleet. Indeed, the safety systems on nuclear-powered ships are very sound. You must address nuclear power only as "Sir." In the past, our chief scientific director, the now late academician, Anatoliy Aleksandrov, staunchly defended the prestige and authority of nuclear power. He seemed to foresee that any misfortune that happened in nuclear power engineering could throw everything back that science and practical experience had achieved over many years. That is what happened at Chernobyl.... [Struzhentsov] What specifically do you have in mind, in paying Academician Aleksandrov such a compliment? [Kuchiyev] Here is a simple example for you. In order for the politburo to make a decision on the Arktika's cruise to the North Pole, an official certificate, signed by the minister of the Maritime Fleet and the president of the Academy of Sciences, was required. Well, Minister Guzhenko signed this paper, but Academician Aleksandrov abstained from signing. He explained that he was completely comfortable with the nuclear-powered unit, but he was afraid that, as had already happened, the screw or propeller shaft would suddenly "fly off," and this could spoil the expedition, and then the prestige of the nuclear-powered icebreaker would inevitably be damaged. After all, our country is not accustomed to looking for reasons: if something does not turn out right -- everything is bad. Of course, we were all lucky that the cruise, which took place after all, went off successfully. The straightforward academician was the first to send on board the Arktika a telegram with the frank words: "You know that I was against your cruise, but now I am proud of you." In actuality, he was much happier about the success than others were. After all, Anatoliy Petrovich is the person whose learning and efforts created our naval and peacetime nuclear-powered fleet. [Struzhentsov] At that time Academician Aleksandrov had every reason for joy. But how do you think he would feel, if he were alive today? [Kuchiyev] It is difficult even to conjecture. Something inexplicable is taking place. The nuclear-powered fleet, which has proven itself in full measure, and which has a superb base in Murmansk, is slowly surrendering position. The icebreaker Lenin, with a power complex which has served out its utility, but still has excellently preserved interiors, made by the Petersburg experts, stands idle in Murmansk. The Arctic seamen came forth with a proposal to convert the first nuclear-powered icebreaker in the world into a museum, to preserve this amazing creation of domestic science and technology for their descendants. Anatoliy Sobchak, mayor of St. Petersburg, gave the "okay" for perpetual mooring of the nuclear-powered ship on the Neva -- the birthplace of the Lenin. Things have come to a standstill, however: there are no funds. Repair of the nuclear-powered icebreakers Arktika and Sibir is being held up for the same reason. The icebreaker fleet is not being replenished. The most modern nuclear-powered icebreaker, the Ural, is lying idle at the outfitting dock of the Baltic Shipyard. It is over 50-percent finished. It is already fitted out with main and auxiliary turbogenerators and a propeller unit, and there is a nuclear-powered unit to be finished. The icebreaker could go off on a voyage after two years of intensive work. All work on finishing construction has been suspended, though. The yard's director has sent telegrams around to the suppliers on canceling the contracts: the yard has no funds to finish work on the icebreaker, and the very expensive equipment installed finds itself threatened with ruin. All this is very alarming. The decline of the North Sea route is beginning. Unless this misfortune is averted, it will be hard to count on the regeneration of the Russian economy, since unless Arctic Siberia participates in this process, the problem cannot be solved. Finally, we have not fulfilled our duty to our ancestors, who passed down to us the baton of purposeful development of the Arctic. After all, the cruises of our nuclear-powered icebreakers to the North Pole region were made, not for the sake of publicity, but in the name of charting the shortest high-latitude routes for transit transport operations between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
