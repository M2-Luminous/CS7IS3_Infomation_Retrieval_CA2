In response to questions by Councillors Taizo Nozawa and Fumio Saito on Japan's defense system to counter threats from the DPRK's (North Korea) "Nodong-1" missiles, Kanda said: "We do not presently have an adequate defense system. We must have some sort of large-scale air defense system, such as the TMD." The United States is planning to develop the TMD with the participation of Japan and other nations; and, at the Japan-U.S. security talks in March, foreign and defense ministers of the two nations agreed to "continue talks" on whether Japan should join the project. However, the Japanese Government has not so far determined its official policy on the project.
