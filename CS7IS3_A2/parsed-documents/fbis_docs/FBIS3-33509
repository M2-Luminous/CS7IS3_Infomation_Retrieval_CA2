And this sum is relevant in pre-constituent Argentina, in view of the kind of arrangement that has appeared during recent weeks in the country's political arena: the formation of shared slates between the Radical and Justicialist Parties for the Constituent Assembly. A recent poll taken by the Javier Otaegui & Associates law office in the Federal Capital has again shed doubt on that mathematical axiom. It shows results indicating that the country's two leading parties are very far removed from automatically pooling their votes if they should run on a shared slate. The poll (in which 1,181 persons were queried by phone) was taken last Tuesday in two parts. In the first, those polled responded concerning their voting intentions in the 10 April elections if the Radical Party and the PJ appear with separate slates. Based on that hypothesis, 20.9 percent claimed that they would vote for the UCR; 19.4 percent for the PJ (the two parties add up to 40.3 percent); 8.5 percent for the Great Front; 7.3 percent for the Socialists; and 2.9 percent for Modin. A total of 21.4 percent claimed that they would not vote for any party, and 16.4 percent appeared undecided. Everything Changes Nevertheless, the situation changed substantially when they were asked about voting intentions in the event that the PJ and UCR formed an alliance: virtually the rest of the opposition spectrum, basically, the Great Front and Modin, doubled their votes. On the other hand, the two majority parties "only" totaled 28.6 percent. Result? PJ-UCR Alliance: 28.6 percent; Great Front: 15.5 percent; and Modin: 6.4 percent. Conclusion: Although two plus two is 40.3 percent, if the term "shared slate" is added to the equation, the result is appreciably smaller. According to the poll, this is a reality in the Federal Capital that could spread to other jurisdictions in which the bipartisan system is not predominant either. And, although the law office that took the poll might be considered unreliable by some, particularly after its well-remembered blunder in the elections held on 3 October of last year in Buenos Aires Province, its conclusion is the same as that of prominent PJ sources, such as Eduardo Duhalde. Last week, the Buenos Aires governor was sufficiently clear about precluding the possibility that a shared slate could be formed in his district: "The only thing that it will do is foster the chances of third political forces." Others Opposed With the same forcefulness as Duhalde's, but opting for an "off the record" comment, a top-ranking member of the Menemist team assured LA NACION that such pacts "are absurd." He predicted: "You'll see the parties at the extremes gain considerably in votes if that notion succeeds." Added to the list of "nonbelievers" in the virtues of the alliance is the minister of economy, Domingo Cavallo, who, in an article published today (see third section), claims that, if there were no shared slate, he would have agreed to be a candidate for the Constituent Assembly in Cordoba. Of course, the results possibly accrued from such an agreement depend on each district: Where the bipartisan system is a constant, the possibility of a flight of votes to third forces is far slighter, as the analysts agree. Cordoba, Catamarca, Rio Negro, and Corrientes are some of the districts in which there is talk of a PJ-UCR alliance. If such an arrangement should materialize, it is also certain to make a substantial change in the political game that has predominated in Argentina thus far. However, it no longer depends on mathematics.
