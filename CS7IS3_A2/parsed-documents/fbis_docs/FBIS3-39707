Both U.S. special envoy for Yugoslavia Charles Redman and his Russian counterpart Vitaly Churkin are attending the talks in which the 12 European Community states, Canada and UN officials are also represented. The talks, in a hotel at Bad Godesberg, come as Russia is proposing an international conference to try to settle the situation in former Yugoslavia. Moscow's return to the world diplomatic front line on the issue coincides with the despatch of Russian troops to Sarajevo to join in UN demilitarisation efforts following the withdrawal of Serb artillery under threats from NATO. Germany has also been closely associated with latest Bosnian peace efforts. Chancellor Helmut Kohl who has been in close telephone touch with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin on the Bosnian crisis, Monday backed the proposal of a "high-level" international conference. Yeltsin said Monday that the main three themes of the talks would be the situation in Sarajevo, other intended zones of security in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a peace plan. French President Francois Mitterrand said Monday he was calling on the UN Security Council to put Sarajevo under UN administration.
