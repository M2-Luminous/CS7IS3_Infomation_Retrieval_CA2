Kozachenko, chairman of the Chelyabinsk Oblast Committee for Land Resources and Land Development, by Yu. Fomin, CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY correspondent; place and date not given: "The Great Reallocation Is Not Over, but More Than a Million Landowners Have Appeared in the Three Years of Land Reform in the Oblast"] [Text] [Fomin] Anatoliy Pavlovich, how would you evaluate the situation with oblast land resources at the beginning of 1994? Has the land reallocation that started in 1990 been completed? [Kozachenko] Three years have passed under the sign of a great reallocation of land. It can be said without exaggeration: A revolution has taken place in land relationships--the monopoly of the right of the state to possess land has ended. Given the total oblast area of 8.8529 million hectares, 3.2081 million have been transferred to the ownership of citizens, joint-stock companies, and associations. There has been a transfer of 1.2195 million hectares of land resources to the jurisdiction of city, settlement, and village administrations that were also earmarked most of all for personal subsidiary plots, hayfields, and pastureland. [Fomin] What does the owner of a land parcel represent today in a generalized way? How many owners are registered on the territory of the oblast--private individual proprietors, farmer and peasant-owned farms, joint-stock companies, and firms? How much land is left under the jurisdiction of state structures? [Kozachenko] According to the status on 1 February 1994, more than 400,000 subsidiary plots with a total area of 66,700 hectares are registered in the oblast. In three years 40,000 citizens were granted land sectors for an area of 5,200 hectares for individual housing construction, and of this, 2,600 hectares were allocated to the ownership of villages and settlements free of charge. Seven thousand one hundred and thirty-two peasant farms were organized on an area of 415,400 hectares, and of these, 90,300 hectares of agricultural land were allocated free of charge, or 21.8 percent of the total area. The remaining area was turned over for leasing for a period of up to 50 years, with the right of subsequent redemption. In an area of 4,291 hectares seven communal-ancestral farms were organized on which the age-old Cossack principle of land use is being revived. The communes are operating in Agapovskiy, Verkhneuralskiy, Kartalinskiy, Krasnoarmeyskiy, Nyazepetrovskiy, and Sosnovskiy Rayons and the city of Yuzhnouralsk. One hundred and four hectares of land were turned over to the ownership of the communes free of charge. Today 386,700 citizens of our oblast own land plots earmarked for gardening. Their total area is 31,400 hectares. All told, 189,400 hectares were transferred to the ownership of more than 800,000 citizens. Significant changes have occurred in public agriculture. On the basis of the former kolkhozes and sovkhozes, 215 joint-stock companies and associations were established, to whom 3.0187 million hectares of agricultural land were turned over to collective-share and collective-joint ownership. Today we have 23 kolkhozes left that own 3 percent of the agricultural land and 25 state agricultural enterprises with commodity production that have 4 percent of the agricultural land. Thus the oblast disposes of redistribution funds that today amount to 403,600 hectares, or a total of 5.5 percent of the agricultural land. A large part of this fund has been turned over to leasing, to temporary use by agricultural enterprises, and to farmers. These are the results of our work: 84.5 percent of the agricultural land of the oblast has been transferred to citizen or collective ownership. The total number of landowners and land users is more than 1.71 million. [Fomin] Anatoliy Pavlovich, in what condition is the land cadastre of the oblast? [Kozachenko] In accordance with a government decree, owing to the resources received from payments from land, we have begun work on inventorying land of population centers and the establishment of six automated cadastre bureaus: three--in rural rayons--of the most numerous land users (Sosnovskiy, Krasnoarmeyskiy, Chebarkulskiy) and three in the cities of Chelyabinsk, Magnitogorsk, and Miass. The oblast committee has organized work for the establishment of program support of the cadastre. We will continue this work in 1994, and its results will depend on the volume of financing. We prepare an annual report on the status of the land fund of the oblast, and can provide full information on any rayon. Incidentally, this material can be used by any organizations that work with land. Although I will note that it is difficult to set up proper registration without the establishment of an automated system of land cadastre. Last year the oblast land committee developed a program for monitoring land in Chelyabinsk Oblast. Fifteen scientific production organizations were involved in implementation of the program. Five stationary sites for conducting regular observations over the status of land resources of the oblast were set up in various nature-climatic zones. This will make it possible to more fully evaluate the influence of economic activity on the condition of the environment. [Fomin] On 29 September 1993 CHELYABINSK RABOCHIY talked about pseudo-farmers in the Uvelskiy Rayon, about people who became owners of land but actually did not work on it. How did your committee react to this article? Is there an effective system for monitoring the rational use of land resources according to the law at the present time? [Kozachenko] As in any business, we unfortunately are not without deficiencies. Yes, your newspapers wrote about the pseudo-farmers in Uvelskiy Rayon, about those people who received land parcels but did not intend to work on them themselves. The rayon land committee sent each one of them a written warning, first of all to those who came under the action of the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation of 4 April 1992 No. 361 "On the Fight Against Corruption in the Civil Service System." However, the procurator of the rayon in his presentation explained to the committee about exceeding authority in the resolution of these questions. Thus, farmers like this have their defenders, although the land committee is undertaking decisive measures in the fight against the violation of land legislation and in monitoring the rational and effective use of land. As a result of such checks, decrees were published by the heads of administration of Yetkulskiy and Chebarkulskiy Rayons concerning the elimination of the subsidiary plot Groznetskoye of the trust Uralneftegazstroy consisting of an area of 2,444 hectares and the transfer of the confiscated land to the Karatabanskiy sovkhoz for agricultural use, and also concerning the confiscation of 150 hectares of arable land from oblast psychoneurological hospital No. 2 and their transfer to the rayon redistribution fund. According to materials of land inventories conducted in 1993, 800 hectares of ineffectively used land were identified on the territory of Yetkulskiy and Sosnovskiy Rayons and transferred to the redistribution fund. Regarding the Petushok horticultural association, the oblast committee prepared materials, and a decree of the head of administration of Sosnovskiy Rayon was adopted on the confiscation of land parcels from horticulturists who did not begin to develop the land parcels in three years. [Fomin] The editorial mail brings us information that ordinary citizens at times are unable to gain possession of land for personal plots and land shares in joint-stock companies. Ivan Danilovich Pigarev from the village of Nagaybakskiy writes, in particular, that he used a personal plot of 0.50 hectares for 36 years (he is a participant of the war), and now he is being given only 0.16 hectares. Valentina Aleksandrovna Lukyan worked for 23 years on the Belonosovskiy sovkhoz. But she took a pension in another place. She was refused a land share by the Belonosovskiy joint-stock company. In brief, what can you say to these people? [Kozachenko] Commenting on these letters, I can say that in neither case did officials violate land legislation with respect to them. However, it is possible to help these citizens. I.D. Pigarev can receive for his personal plot a section of land outside the boundaries of the construction project of the village, and V.A. Lukyan, if she is able to work the land, can get an average rayon share free of charge for the organization of a peasant farm in accordance with Article 60 of the Land Code of the Russian Federation from the lands of the rayon's special fund. [Fomin] In October 1993 the Edict of the President of Russia "On Regulating Land Relations and Development of Agrarian Reform in Russia," which granted owners right to sell land plots, was signed. When will the first competition (auction) on the sale of land be held in the oblast? What will be offered for sale to those who take part in it? [Kozachenko] Of late, more and more citizens have become interested in questions about the purchase and sale of land parcels. The Law of the Russian Federation "On the Right of Citizens of the Russian Federation To Receive Private Property and To Sell Land Parcels for the Conduct of Personal Subsidiary and Summer Home Farming, Gardening, and Individual Housing Construction" grants the right to citizens who received land parcels as private property for the aforementioned purposes to sell them to other citizens of Russia. This right is affirmed by the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation "On Regulating Land Relations and Development of Agrarian Reform in Russia." Purchase and sale of land transactions are conducted by citizens independently at the place of the location of the parcels with the formulation of a deed of purchase. Land parcels belonging to citizens as personal property will be sold at auctions on their petition. Moreover, the organs of local administration can offer for sale at auction vacant parcels that are valuable because of their location for individual housing construction, the accommodation of summer homes, and other purposes. The edict of the president of the Russian Federation authorizes the sale of land parcels acquired by citizens free of charge in the form of shares in the reorganization of kolkhozes and sovkhozes. However, the lack of a sale-purchase mechanism for lands of agricultural significance hinders this process. On the whole it must be said that land legislation has begun to lag behind today's practical tasks.
