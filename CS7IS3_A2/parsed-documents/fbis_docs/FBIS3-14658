FBIS3-14658 "drnes061cc_94001" FBIS-NES-94-061 Document Type:Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 Islamic Affairs Political Islam Review: AL-NUR 23 Mar NC2903131294 NC2903131294 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] The following review of the 23 March issue of Cairo AL-NUR summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature. NOTE ON AL-NUR'S PUBLICATION, FORMAT: The current editorial report describes the contents of the 23 March 1994 issue of AL-NUR, the first issue of this publication received by Nicosia Bureau since January 1994. The last issue received of AL-NUR, which has the serial number 599, does not give a day of publication, only naming the month of publication as January. The current issue, with serial number 600, is presumably consecutive to the January issue. In an inscription added to the front page's top right-hand square carrying the paper's title, the paper describes itself as an "Islamic Weekly," which did not appear in earlier issues in the Bureau's files. The paper does not give a reason for the hiatus in its publication. The current issue displays no notable change in AL-NUR's format. The front page caption still cites al-Hamzah Di'bis as chairman of the board and 'Ali Faruq as chief editor. The paper is still "issued by the Liberal Party," but the caption fails to display the information that Mustafa Kamil Murad is the "party leader," as it did in the previous editions on file here. CONTENTS: 1. Television programs denounced 2. Al-Azhar Schools Close Down 3. Red Cross Publication Praised 4. Muslim Figures Interviewed 5. Co-ed Colleges Denounced 6. Extremist Disavows AL-AKHBAR Interview TELEVISION PROGRAMS DENOUNCED An 800-word commentary by "AL-NUR's political editor" appears on page 1 under a triple headline: "Television Assails Islam and Its Tenets Under the Pretext of Fighting Terror; What Shall We Tell Our Children About the Television's Edict Banning Cucumber and Zucchini? The Solution in the Television's Opinion is That an Unveiled Girl Should Lead the Muslims Into the Desert." The political editor begins his commentary by lauding the Islamic propensities of slain President Anwar al-Sadat and denouncing what he sees as the secular policies of the current government. He writes: "The late President Anwar al-Sadat, God bless his soul, struck at communism, expelled Russian experts from Egypt, and issued presidential decrees liquidating the Vanguard Organization of the Arab Socialist Party, the Youth Organization. Having led the nation to victory in the October/Ramadan [1973] war, he restored freedoms and the multi-party system and began to Islamize the laws, a goal that he entrusted to al-Azhar professors, law experts, and members of the judiciary. Meanwhile, communists and members of the defunct Vanguard and Youth Organizations lurked in the dark. No sooner had al-Sadat passed on then those communists and Vanguard and Youth Organization officials returned to office with only one object in mind: killing al-Sadat's memory and accomplishments every living day." The editor then expands on television dramas that, he claims, "poke fun at Islam" by ridiculing religion among youth and the Islamic dress code. AL-AZHAR SCHOOLS CLOSE DOWN: A 600-word report on page 1 by Safwat al-Sandafawi cites Shaykh Muhammad Bashir 'Abd-al-'Al, director general of al-Azhar institutions, as saying that "1,500 al-Azhar institutions have been closed down due to a lack of funds needed to rehabilitate the school buildings that cracked in last year's earthquake." Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Al says that 294 million pounds [approximately $80 million] are needed to put the schools back in working order. Al-Azhar has petitioned the government for these funds, but "the government did not oblige," the al-Azhar official says. RED CROSS PUBLICATION PRAISED Chairman of the Board al-Hamzah Di'bis writes a 1,500-word editorial on the front page entitled, "International Committee of the Red Cross Applauds Islam's Global Rules of War and Peace." Di'bis says that Liberal Party leader Mustafa Kamil Murad gave him a Red Cross publication called, "From the Records of Arab Islamic History." He then reviews this publication, commending its favorable view of Islamic traditions. MUSLIM FIGURES INTERVIEWED On page 2, the paper carries interviews with Chief Bosnian Ulema Shaykh Mustafa Ibrahim and a U.S. physician, Barbara Klein, who converted to Islam. The Bosnian official deplores the attacks on Muslims in his country and says that there is "an orchestrated policy to eradicate Islam from Europe." Dr. Klein praises her adopted faith and denounces U.S. support for Israel. CO-ED COLLEGES DENOUNCED A 3,500-word report by Sayyid Farghal appears on page 3. He interviews a dozen students from various universities, all of whom believe that mixed education is both unnecessary and unethical and that all-male and all-female colleges are morally commendable and educationally superior to co-ed universities. "Distinguished Islamic scholar" Dr. 'Abd-al-Rashid Saqr, "Islamic scholar" Dr. Muhammad 'Imarah; Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman al-'Adawi, Professor of religious studies at al-Azhar University; Dr. Majdi Hasan, professor of Civil Law at 'Ayn Shams University; Dr. Muhammad Farahat, professor of shari'ah at 'Ayn Shams University; and 'Uthman Muhammad 'Uthman, an education expert, concur with this view. Farghal's interviews include no co-ed supporters. EXTREMIST DISAVOWS AL-AKHBAR INTERVIEW Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Samawi writes a 2,000-word "Rebuttal of Sabir Shawkat" on page 5. Al-Samawi, a one-time friend of Shawqi al-Shaykh and Muhammad 'Abd-al-Baqi, co-founders of al-Shawqiyun group, is rumored to have issued the license [al-istihlal] edict by which Muslim extremists are encouraged to steal from infidels, i.e., anyone that is not an extremist. Al-Samawi had been interviewed by an AL-AKHBAR journalist named Sabir Shawkat who published an account of that interview in AL-AKHBAR's issue at the beginning of Sha'ban [around 12 January], which al-Samawi vehemently disavows. For example, Shawkat wrote that he "faced al-Samawi with the details of his crimes against Egypt and the youths whom he sent into the dark tunnels of extremism." Al-Samawi says "he did not face me with one crime." Al-Samawi writes: "What crime have I committed against Egypt and its youth? Is it that I urged youth to stick to Islam and be proud of it? Is it that I made them turn to God and attend prayers? Is it that I made them desert the disreputable haunts and head to the places of worship? Or, is it that I made them follow the path of God and pray for his blessing?" He adds: "I have been imprisoned for 12 years without being indicted, without a court ruling, and without doing any wrong or committing any crime." Al-Samawi says: "The AL-AKHBAR journalist has cited me as saying, `I do not deny that I am the first who called for amirs to lead the Islamic groups in Egypt, 20 years ago, and the first who formed religious groups since the Muslim brotherhood, but now I call for paradise.' I ask you, journalist, is this what I said or what you invented?" Al-Samawi adds: "The journalist wrote, `concerning the extremist ideas that he [al-Samawi] inculcated into thousands of youth, he [al-Samawi] said: I have never sanctioned license [al-istihlal].'" Ridiculing Shawkat, al-Samawi writes: "If I have not passed the license edict, then what brand of extremism have I inculcated into the minds of thousands? Or is it that I am accused of having spread moderation through failure to pass that edict?" Al-Samawi denies having told Shawkat that "al-Shawqiyun and other groups have sanctioned the practice of license." He also denies having said that he "indoctrinated thousands of youth who then deserted me and joined other groups where they became a fuel for terror, and I am opposed to their terrorist operations." Al-Samawi continues his defiant rebuttal of Shawkat's account of the interview, but refrains from expressing his opinion on terrorism or giving any clear statement on his current political position.
