Thailand's negotiating team, led by the director-general of the Foreign Trade Department, Oranut Osathanon, held a third round of talks last Wednesday [30 March] and Thursday. Both sides signed an exchange of notes on Friday. The agreement will be back-dated to January 1 to extend the agreement that expired last year. A source in the Thai Garment Manufacturing Association (TGMA) said there is still confusion over the agreement because TGMA president Wirot Amatakunchai, who joined the private sector delegation is still abroad. The Government delegation said the only two people who can give this information are Ms Oranut and Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon but neither was available yesterday. The source said the US agreed to increase the base of quotas for exports of garments from the current 202 million square metres to 220 million. Quotas on clothes for babies aged below two years would be 4.7 million kilogrammes or 29.6 million square metres. So the total base quotas for garment exports will be 249.6 million square metres. He said the US agreed to an annual growth rate of quotas of 6 percent and increased the base quotas for Thai exports of cotton shorts and trousers by 24 percent from last year's 500,000 dozen to 622,000 dozen. However, the US wanted to add the control of wool jackets by setting the quota at 51,500 dozen, up 6,500 dozen from Thai exports last year. The source said the US allowed the swing of quotas from the unused category to other categories at 7 percent of the quotas, up from 3.5 percent in the last agreement, and permitted the special shift of quotas between woven shirts and cotton woven shirts by 10 percent. He said the private sector appreciated the new agreement, which is expected to be signed soon, because the amount of negotiated quotas is big enough to ensure the country's exports this year. Meanwhile, there are still many points of information missing, such as the duration of the agreement -- whether it will be two or four years -- and details about punishment for transshipment or re-routing of products through third countries, known as "circumvention". This had earlier been a major problem in the extension of the agreement because the US wanted to slash quotas by three times if it discovered there was circumvention.
