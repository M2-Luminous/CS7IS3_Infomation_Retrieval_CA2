In an interview with EL TIEMPO he explores his political future and says that he and Andres are both endowed with the essential qualities to beat [Ernesto] Samper and Humberto De la Calle. [EL TIEMPO] There are those who say that your nomination to the vice presidency does not add, but on the contrary, could represent a setback to Andres Pastrana... [Ramirez] No. We are a young team that represents this country's future. The Pastrana-Ramirez ticket is not merely an election maneuver that intends to fall back on party principles and platforms as has occurred in other cases. What we have here is an affinity of opinions; there is a program we both share and no fissures. The vice president does not criticize the presidential candidate, nor is the vice president to the presidential candidate as water is to oil. What takes precedence here is both our interest in having a coherent and viable platform. [EL TIEMPO] Concretely, you as a technocrat without any broad grass-root followers, how can you benefit Andres Pastrana? [Ramirez] Success no longer depends on any specific traditional politician but on the performance of those officials in public service. I believe that Andres Pastrana and I are both perceived as persons who do not speak much but execute a lot. What we have promised we have honored. That has been a constant throughout Andres' career: his word is sacred. That has also been my line of conduct. We promised we would carry out social security reforms and we did. This law will allow a more balanced and fair income distribution. [EL TIEMPO] Yet the reform has been somewhat controversial and the law has created dissatisfaction. Don't you believe that this could prove to be a disadvantage to Pastrana's campaign? [Ramirez] This is the most substantial social reform that has taken place in Colombia in the last 50 years. This reform guarantees wide-ranging health service coverage. The law provides a retirement pension, and provides senior citizens as well as the homeless with half of the minimum wage... This is something that has never been seen in Colombia. [EL TIEMPO] What specific support will you contribute to Andres Pastrana? [Ramirez] It would be worthwhile keeping in mind that I have been a public official for the past 14 years, and despite being young, I still have more experience than many older persons in the government. I have been working shoulder to shoulder since 1986 with persons such as President Gaviria. I was part of the president's economic team and took part in the economic, foreign trade, and labor reforms. In other words, we participated in those reforms that brought about institutional changes. We took part in decisions that benefited the country. We are evidently devoted to progress and willing to bet on this country's future. I am a person who likes to work and that has been a constant throughout my life. I come from a low income household; a son of farmers currently living in Santander and from that perspective I represent that department. I am not a product of the oligarchy or the aristocracy. [EL TIEMPO] It is being said that your father's kidnapping could benefit Andres Pastrana's campaign. What can you say about that observation? [Ramirez] The kidnapping and the campaign are two completely separate issues. Most naturally, the kidnapping has affected my attitude and it is something I will have to overcome. This type of experience prompts one to want to make good decisions; the ones leading to critical changes that will ensure that it does not happen to any other family. The experience does have an effect, and it is in terms of earnestly seeking for Colombian society to be more egalitarian. [EL TIEMPO] What are the most positive qualities you see in your strongest opponent, Humberto De la Calle? [Ramirez] I have the best opinion of Mr. De la Calle and agreed with most of the things he said. During the past eight months he continuously explained why we should not vote for Ernesto Samper. He said that Samper is a populist, and I agreed with that. He has indicated that the Samper-De la Calle ticket is like water and oil and I agreed with that. Now the country can't understand why he suddenly changed his mind and became a populist. [EL TIEMPO] What are the most significant differences between you and Humberto De la Calle? [Ramirez] We never relinquish our convictions or abdicate our government programs for the sake of election objectives. The Pastrana-Ramirez ticket is a ticket where there is symmetry in opinions and no splits. [EL TIEMPO] What do you consider to be the biggest blunder of the Samper-De la Calle slate? [Ramirez] To believe that an election is simply a matter of adding up votes. If they are merely interested in votes, then many of them will now lose. The people who were backing Samper are now dissatisfied as a result of having handed over their platform to De la Calle, and those who supported De la Calle are also dissatisfied because of the same reason. [EL TIEMPO] You have suggested a public debate with Humberto De la Calle. What would be the primary topic of that debate? [Ramirez] We would do it based on each ticket's government platform. Voters want to examine the programs being suggested by each candidate, to evaluate which is more convincing and to decide on which is more loaded with election promises. [EL TIEMPO] In case of winning, are you prepared to take over as president if Pastrana is forced to be absent for whatever reasons? [Ramirez] I will give you one clue. I have held many positions, and I have probably been involved in government service more than Mr. De la Calle. Without any doubt I am quite prepared to handle the government issues this country needs. I have been part of the Executive Branch during the past three administrations. I am quite clear on the changes that have been taking place during the past decades. I have also worked closely with congress. While a minister affiliated with the Conservative Party, I led a reform program in a congress controlled by the liberals.
