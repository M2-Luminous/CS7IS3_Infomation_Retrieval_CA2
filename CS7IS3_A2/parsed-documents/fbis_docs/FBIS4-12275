[passage omitted] The main aim of my tour is to strengthen and consolidate Kurdish political activity abroad, explain conditions in Kurdistan, and request aid to rebuild Kurdish society. We will also demand that the blockade imposed on Kurdistan be lifted, that a solution be found for our problems, and that the necessary protection be afforded to Kurdistan. We will ask the United States and Europe to help us with weapons and training so that we can form our own main protection force in the Kurdistan region. We will also ask them to help us build a modern police force capable of safeguarding security and stability in Kurdistan. We will ask them to continue their aerial protection on a permanent basis. With these three methods, we can provide the necessary protection for Iraqi Kurdistan. We will also try to increase the humanitarian aid for the Kurdistan region's people and explain the situation in Kurdistan. [passage omitted] On the Iraqi regime's threats to launch an offensive against liberated Iraqi Kurdistan, especially following the renewal of the UN sanctions on Baghdad, brother Talabani said: I believe the ruling dictatorial, fascist regime in Baghdad is serious in its threats. The attempt to attack the Kurdistan region is one of the dreams of the dictatorial regime. But we have seen the miscalculations of the head of the defeated Iraqi regime, such as his war against Iran and his occupation of Kuwait. He also made many mistakes during his war against Kurdistan. I believe his mistakes this time will be added to his previous mistakes. I believe the regime is serious in its threats but I am not afraid of these threats. If the regime embarks on such a desperate attempt, it will help us to liberate the remaining parts of occupied Kurdistan. The regime will meet its doom, because the Kurdistan people are prepared for sacrifice. The peshmerga forces in Kurdistan are prepared to confront the enemies. The international coalition forces will deal a deadly blow to the dictatorial regime's force. If the regime's forces come under air strikes, they will suffer utter defeat, not only in Kurdistan, but elsewhere in Iraq. [passage omitted]
