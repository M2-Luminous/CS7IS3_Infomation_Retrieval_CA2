FR940902-2-00024 FR940902-2-00019 By the terms of the proposed AOC, these PRPs will together pay $7,803,386.11 to the Hazardous Substance Superfund (Superfund). The $7,803,386.11 represents approximately 11.2% of the total anticipated costs for the Site upon which this settlement was based. In exchange for payment, U.S. EPA will provide the settling parties with a covenant not to sue for liability under sections 106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, including liability for EPA past costs, the one-time cost of remedy, future EPA oversight costs, future operation and maintenance of the as-yet unselected remedy, and under section 7003 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended (also known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)). The amount that each individual PRP will pay, as shown above, equals $2.97 multiplied by the number of gallons of waste the party sent to the Site (Base Amount), plus a premium payment of either 30% or 120% of the Base Amount, as specified by each Respondent PRP in the AOC. The per gallon charge of $2.97 was calculated by dividing the total estimated response costs for the Site ($69,594.403) by the total estimated volume of waste disposed of at the Site (23,454,592 gallons). For parties paying a 30% premium, there is an exception to the covenant not to sue if total response costs at the Site exceed $69,594,403. If this amount were exceeded, EPA could sue these parties for all or a portion of the overage. For parties paying the 120% premium, the exception to the covenant not to sue does not apply. For a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, the public may submit comments to U.S. EPA relating to the proposed de minimis settlement.
