In the wake of the recovery in the Anglo-Saxon countries, economic activity is now reviving in Europe. Does the OECD agree? [Paye] Yes. All the reports by economic institutes, national organizations, and governments agree that, in addition to the Anglo-Saxon countries which have been recovering for some time now, there are definite signs of a recovery in continental Europe and Japan. Spring is not completely with us yet, but winter is almost over. This will lead us to upwardly revise, slightly, the forecasts we made five months ago in "Perspectives Economique" [economic prospects] published at the end of December 1993. The rise varies depending on the countries involved, but on average, for 1994 and 1995, figures will be 0.2 to 0.5 percent up. [Aubert] What about in the specific case of France? [Paye] At the time of speaking I do not have any fresh data so I cannot give you a precise answer. I just know that there are indeed clear signs of a recovery in France and, in all probability, France will be one of the countries for which we will be upwardly revising our predictions. [Aubert] There is still a shadow cast over the generally improving world picture, namely the problem of unemployment. Your organization was charged with making an in-depth analysis of the causes of unemployment and to come up with some possible solutions. Can you give us some idea of the solutions the OECD should be unveiling in a few days time? [Paye] To get an idea of the solutions, you first need some understanding of the problems. Therefore we looked into all the possible causes as far as we could. We concluded that the fundamental cause of the situation our countries are in is that they have insufficiently adapted to the changes in the operation of the economy brought about by the process of globalization, i.e. the interaction between competition and technological progress. In today's global economy, competition has become very fierce. As a result, all countries, and ours in particular -- since we are the ones who have been caught up -- have to try and improve their efficiency, step up creativity, become more innovative, explore new avenues, and remain at the leading edge of economic, scientific, and technological development. If you look at what has happened in the last 20 years, it is clear that the OECD countries' capacity or will to adapt has not increased in proportion to what was required by changes on the world stage. A gap quickly opened up between what we should have done and what we have actually done to prepare for the future. [Aubert] What kind of proposals does this diagnosis give rise to? [Paye] To date, our economies have been leading the race. If they are to remain ahead of the field, they must increase their innovative and creative capacities. This is a precondition if we are to have a better standard of living and if we are to take a full share in the markets that are being created and are developing at high speed in the rest of the world. For this, we have to be competitive. The policies we should implement must strive to create the most favorable conditions for company competitiveness. This first means that the macroeconomic policies have to remain stable in the medium term, reassuring economic operators and, when necessary and possible, making full use of the room for maneuver that may exist on the monetary or budgetary levels. However, we should be under no illusions: Currently the OECD countries have very little room for maneuver. Especially on the budgetary level, you will not reassure economic operators by widening the budget deficit or increasing the public debt. Instead, it is necessary to continue getting public finances in order and trying to stabilize and then reduce the burden of debt, which has reached considerable proportions in some countries. Then, above all, you need rigorous structural policies that help improve the economy's capacities for innovation and creation. In particular, that means establishing the right conditions for the creation of economic activity and the creation of companies. Given the new methods for the production of goods and services, the reduction in the size of companies, the use of networks, and the growing share of services in manufacturing, we are in a kind of economy where activity and employment are increasingly being created by small work units. How can we favor the creation of activities and companies? There are many things we can do to contribute to this process, and I will mention only a few: By reducing uncertainty and the weight of administrative tasks, adapting our tax structures, and adopting new standards for information that are similar and as far-reaching as those that exist in the rest of the world, since information has become the lifeblood of the globalized economy and is the main product that companies now need. Creating the right conditions for the creation of companies is all very well, but this alone is not enough. We must also make it easier to actually employ people, and in any event, we must not discourage companies from taking on new employees. We all know that certain aspects of labor legislation are sometimes counterproductive in terms of employment. In France, for example, the SMIC [minimum wage] as it currently stands, seems to discourage the recruitment of unqualified and young workers. In addition, we have to modernize our education and training systems. This is now evident, at a time when economic growth is increasingly based on knowledge, and knowledge that must evolve quickly. We do have to teach people a trade, but we also have to teach them how to change professions and learn new skills. We need education and training systems that cover the whole of active life. Lastly, we should not forget that a competitive world also requires flexibility and mobility, including a certain degree of wage flexibility. This is a fact that is gradually dawning on people. Even if no one says so publicly, this policy is increasingly being practiced. In fact, all countries are realizing that nothing is more dangerous in the medium to long term than a section of the population being left out of the labor market and feeling marginalized and abandoned. It is much better to have people on albeit low wages than to have people unemployed. However, this realization, which shocks many people, will have essential consequences. Firstly, it must not be possible for someone to be indefinitely locked into a poorly remunerated job. If you start on a low salary when you are young and unqualified, you must then have access to additional education and training. Secondly, we need labor markets that operate effectively and in which we can see the opportunities that are being presented. Thirdly, geographic and professional mobility must be favored by all possible means. Lastly -- and this is part of the indispensable social cohesion -- we must make up from other sources those salaries for poorly qualified workers that are considered to be too low. This poses redistribution problems that we cannot simply sweep under the carpet. [Aubert] In the debates on labor market flexibility, there is a feeling that the Anglo-Saxon world often serves as the reference. However, the American economy, seen from Europe, does not look like a very good model where redistribution of income is concerned.... [Paye] You will see when you read our report that it is much more balanced than that. At the recent Detroit conference, the U.S. ministers said that they were not wholly satisfied with their system. It is very flexible, very adaptive, and very individualistic, enabling many jobs to be created in times of recovery. However, in the last 20 years, the lower half of the wage scale has lost out in terms of purchasing power. Some 30 million Americans now live below the poverty line. In our report, we say that in Europe, and in some ways in Japan too, there is a rigidity in the structures that is born out of the culture and social victories that have their worth as well as their disadvantages. This rigidity prevents the European economies from adapting to the challenges of the world today and tomorrow. That does not mean that everything has to be scrapped, though. We have to try and see how, by reducing the counterproductive aspects that our production systems have, we can concentrate their beneficial effects on those people who most need help, those who have to adapt or those who are unable to adapt but whom we cannot leave behind. This report in no way recommends scrapping the fruit of a century of social progress in Europe to adopt the American model in its current form. [Aubert] Where funding the reduction in company labor costs is concerned, is there a painless solution? [Paye] The additional wage costs borne by companies often discourage them from taking on new employees, especially less qualified workers or less experienced workers, such as young people. If we take the path of reducing these costs to encourage recruitment, we must make up for this reduction since we cannot arfford to further worsen social security and budget deficits. This implies reexamining all these systems to see if it is possible to make savings, in particular by reducing the extent to which the system is abused. Moreover, this means that, as far as is necessary, we have to find other fiscal resources. This is a vast area. [Aubert] The European Commission, for example, suggests levying a tax on the amount of energy consumed.... [Paye] That is one of the many possibilities we could envisage. We do not propose specifically doing one thing or another, because that would require further specific and in-depth studies. The measures that would compensate for the reduction in additional labor costs are liable to reduce consumption or investment. We would therefore have to evaluate their net effect on employment. We have drawn up a report and now the quite general recommendations we make in it must be tailored to suit each member state, taking into account all the differences in their situation, legislation, customs, and culture. Moreover, the OECD should be used in its capacity as a mutual monitoring body, to actively encourage the application of the policy guidelines that we have decided on. In many cases, the reforms that are needed will be hard to implement. It is helpful if countries are not alone in trying to buckle down to the task and in proving that in such and such a country, such and such a reform has been implemented and is yielding good results. [Aubert] Let us now return to the macroeconomic level of the employment crisis. In Europe, governments have reacted in sometimes quite different ways. On the one hand there is the British attitude which consisted of a surgical operation with the devaluation of the pound and accelerated cuts in interest rates with the subsequent positive results that that had, and on the other hand there is France which has resolutely defended its currency to the detriment of everything else. What is the correct choice? [Paye] If only there were a "correct choice!" It is very difficult to answer this question. Anyway, it has lost much of its relevance. You could understand this intellectual debate three years ago, when we could see the extent of the crisis German reunification was going to trigger. Now, however, with quite similar short term interest rates and long rates that are lower in Germany and France than in the United Kingdom or Italy.... [Aubert] Except that the choice made by France was accompanied by a worsening of the economic situation and rising unemployment.... [Paye] Of course, the choice had its consequences. However, I think it is rather late to be discussing the issue now that it holds much less significance. Above all, we must understand how the issue looked two or three years ago to the European countries that were in the exchange rate system. Should they run the risk of a late economic recovery, increased unemployment, and thus possible social or even political tension to steer a course toward a credibility that would maintain the relatively low long-term interest rates, and continue with the construction of European economic and monetary union? Those European countries that ran this risk have long-term interest rates that, until a few weeks ago, were the lowest on record. These long-term interest rates are important for investment and for the long term plans of individuals. As for this second aim, it did not have immediate economic repercussions, but the fact of safeguarding the perspective of the creation of an integrated European monetary area gave companies and institutions renewed confidence. It was therefore a choice between something easier and more gratifying in the short term, and something that was more difficult but which guaranteed the future. France and Germany chose to take the rocky path. It is true that these countries have high unemployment, but their credibility is intact, long-term and even short-term interest rates are relatively low, and companies are well on the way to adapting to the new situation -- all things that bode well for future growth, employment, and competitiveness. [Aubert] The world has changed a lot in recent years. Does the recent admission of Mexico mean, as one diplomat has suggested, that the OECD is starting to change its spots? [Paye] I do not think it is changing its spots. The OECD is an organization that is completely unique. Its aim is to make the world's leading economic countries reflect jointly to define their policies together. The OECD countries today account for 75 percent of total world trade. There can be no doubt that the OECD has always been and remains the group of the most advanced countries from the point of view of social and economic development. [Aubert] To date, in any case, your organization has been perceived rightly or wrongly as a kind of "club of rich countries...." There are many countries that are not in the OECD whose per capita income level is higher than that of Portugal or Greece or Turkey. It is just a journalistic simplification to call the OECD the "club of rich countries." The OECD is an area for working together, a workshop, and an intellectual laboratory for the leaders of our countries. So that the OECD retains this nature and this usefulness, it has to continue to unite the countries that count in the world. The number of these countries is growing. As a result, the OECD has to make contacts and open up to a greater extent to bring in more and more economies as members or observers or partners. To dialogue, as we have been doing for five years with Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, and to have brought Chile, Argentina and Brazil into this dialogue, plus Mexico which joined our organization a few days ago, is a way of recognizing that we must bring economies that are not currently members of the OECD into the reflection process. Then there are the countries of the former Soviet Bloc, with which we have been cooperating since the start of the freeze in relations, several of which have recently asked to join the OECD; and other countries, such as China.... [Paye] You talked of the laboratory-style role of your organization. It would appear that certain of your member countries want the OECD to become something other than a laboratory, for it to play a more visible role on the world scene, which would therefore imply that this role is scarcely compatible with you remaining at the head of the organization.... [Aubert] We should start by examining the function of our organization. I have just described this to you: Ensuring that the people who define and implement policies in our member countries, i.e., senior civil servants and maybe ministers, actually work together. The issue of visibility can be couched in the following terms: At what time and on what subject should we become "visible" to better serve the organization, i.e., to increase its usefulness for the governments? In some cases, it is good to be very visible, to help public opinion better understand the problem and the solutions it requires. Where unemployment is concerned, I think our organization is very visible. However, the question is whether we should systematically place everything the OECD discusses on the public stage and run the risk in some cases of appearing to take sides, thus making it harder to arrive at a consensus on the policies to be implemented. With premature publicity you always run the risk of hardening positions and making it more difficult to bring people closer together. Thus, publicity and visibility are important, but you have to be discerning. Having said that, the member states might think differently from me and differently from each other. To give the impression that the OECD is invisible and would do better to permanently remain in the public eye, is, I think, only creating a false problem. [Paye] Is the replacement of the general secretary also a false problem? [Aubert] No, it is a real problem. I am pleased that there are so many candidates for the post. That proves it is an interesting job and that the organization has a future. It is up to the member countries to choose the person they think is the most capable of doing the job in the way they want it to be done. If they believe it is better, out of principle, to have someone with a political past, it is up to them to decide. For my part, I do not think this is a necessary requirement for the job. I think the qualifications needed are as follows: knowing the issues the organization deals with; heeding the very diverse nature of the member countries; and being capable of encouraging a consensus, because the organization cannot work without one. The only power it has is the power it acquires through the quality, objectivity, and independence of its secretariat which directly determines the intimacy and efficiency of the cooperation between the member countries.
