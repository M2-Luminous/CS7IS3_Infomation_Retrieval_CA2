Full effect of the law is expected after the alleviation or lifting of the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council on May 30, 1992. As explained by the federal government, the new law is expected to ensure greater legal security for foreign investors, grant additional facilities for those who are ready to invest in the Yugoslav economy and simplify the investment procedure. The law rules that foreigners can found firms in Yugoslavia, invest capital in domestic firms, open company branches and buy shares and concessions for exploitation of natural resourses. Foreign investors will also be able to import equipment and materials for building firms in Yugoslavia tax-free. Foreigners are only not allowed to hold more than 49 percent of the shares in strategically important branches of industry, such as the miltiary industry.
