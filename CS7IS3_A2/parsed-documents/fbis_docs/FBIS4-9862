The debates will begin on the first of next month, which is International Labor Day, according to a summons published today calling for a special session. The Council of State, led by Cuban President Fidel Castro, issued the summons. The National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] made the decision to hold such a meeting at the end of last December, during its second ordinary session of the year in which the financial issue was a leading topic. According to statements by Jose Luis Rodriguez, chairman of the state committee on financial matters, the country has a currency surplus of more than 10 billion pesos, equal to the same amount in dollars, according to the official exchange rate. The fiscal deficit has reached 4.2 billion pesos while subsidies for production losses in the agricultural and sugar sector alone are more than 7 billion pesos. Rodriguez explained that such a financial imbalance seriously hampers the flow of Cuba's economy, which has been severely battered by the loss of its commercial partners and the heightened U.S. trade embargo. Cuban President Fidel Castro and other officials have said the situation will never be resolved by neoliberal methods, which have had dramatic social consequences in other nations. Osvaldo Martinez, chairman of the legislative commission on economic matters, said the members of his commission are working with the state financial committee to assess the situation and compile proposals to solve the complex problems plaguing the economy. Martinez told the local media the commission will evaluate the possible decisions and draft recommendations from there, which could be used during the debates at the ANPP. He said the basic criteria used in the analysis begins with the need to reduce the internal financial imbalance, specifically the problems of surplus cash and budget deficit. He added the purpose is to reorganize the domestic economy in order to encourage the production of goods and services, recover salary values, rescue labor discipline, and gradually regain the purchasing power of the national currency. Controlling the internal financial imbalance is like performing vital surgery on a sick patient, our economy, and the people understand this, he affirmed. Martinez said the general understanding of the measures needed to resolve the current financial situation became evident during the so-called workers parliament, a series of meetings held by the workers unions from January to March. During these assemblies, attended by more than 3 million people, methods of achieving economic efficiency at each center as well as other general measures were studied. The leaders of the Central Organization of Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), along with President Fidel Castro, examined a summary of the proposals made at these meetings. Pedro Ross, secretary general of the organization, has said none of the suggestions will be left unconsidered.
