Informed sources said the postponement is due to a delay in preparations. The China foreign exchange trading center is the culmination of China's ongoing unification of its dual track exchange rate system. It will enable the renminbi (Chinese yuan) to be freely convertible with other currencies within six years. The system has so far been given a test-run, and will now formally start operations from April 18, the sources said.
