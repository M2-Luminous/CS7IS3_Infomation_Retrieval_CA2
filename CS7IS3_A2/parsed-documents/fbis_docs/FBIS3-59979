When police searched an apartment in the Pratu Nam area, they were shocked when they opened the door. Inside the apartment, they found 5-6 blacks in each room. The police searched almost 10 rooms and found 40-50 people. Thus, it's not surprising why so many of these people can be seen walking around the Pratu Nam area in the day. From examining their passports, it was found that all had entered the country legally as tourists and businessmen. Thus, the police had to release them. Police Colonel Khongdet Chusi, the deputy commander of the Northern Bangkok Metropolitan Police and a former police superintendent known for suppressing godfathers, said that ``we are very suspicious about what they are doing here.'' Police files show that many blacks from African countries work as heroin couriers. They use Thailand as a transit point for smuggling heroin to a third country, including the United States and countries in Europe. In those countries, heroin is worth 10 times as much as it is here, that is, it increases from 200,000 baht per kg to 2 million baht per kg. The data matches that of narcotics control units. It was also discovered that traffickers were using the parking lot of a well-known shop in the Pratu Nam area as a narcotics delivery point. ``Those who are caught red-handed usually ask if they will be sentenced to death. After they are told that they won't be, they feel better. They have said that there is much poverty in their native country and so they have to take this risk. If they can get away with this, their lives will improve greatly. And even if they are caught, their families won't suffer, because the agents who hired them will take care of their families as agreed on beforehand,'' said Police Colonel Khongdet. During the past 2-3 years, many blacks have been arrested on charges of trying to smuggle narcotics out of the country. Most have been arrested while waiting to board an airplane to a third country. They use a variety of techniques for smuggling drugs. In the past, they used to pack heroin in condoms and ingest the packets. One person could smuggle out only about 1 kg this way, which meant that many people had to be used each trip. This brought them to the attention of narcotics units. Also, this was very dangerous. Some of the couriers died because the heroin-filled packets burst in their stomachs. Thus, traffickers changed their method by concealing the heroin in bottles of sauce, cans of flour, cosmetic bottles, and secret compartments in their suitcases. This made it difficult for officials to find the narcotics because the containers had to be torn apart to find the drugs. It is thought that the amount of heroin seized is much less than the amount that slips by Thai officials. Statistics on heroin seizures nationwide show that in 1992, officials seized a total of 1,062 kg. During the first six months of 1993, officials seized 988.6 kg with a domestic value of more than 197 million baht, or 1,970 million baht in Europe or the United States. The statistics show that seizures have increased this year. Considering the amount of heroin successfully smuggled out of the country, the amount of money involved is staggering and seems worth the risk. In particular, officials have not been able to get at the chief culprits behind the heroin smuggling. This is because the heroin smuggling routes are divided into sections. In 1992, officials arrested 536 suspected couriers in 169 cases. Most, 242, were Burmese, who were caught smuggling 43 kg of heroin. Twelve blacks from Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana were arrested with 19 kg of heroin. Altogether, officials seized 239 kg. During the first six months of 1993, officials arrested 489 suspects and seized 418 kg of heroin. Most were Burmese, who were caught with 32 kg of heroin. Also arrested were two Taiwanese with 114 kg, 10 blacks with 25 kg, and six Hong Kong Chinese with 15 kg. Even though the number of arrests has increased, a large number have managed to avoid being arrested and smuggle the heroin out of the country. The methods used to smuggle heroin, including both methods of concealment and the selection of couriers, have improved. When the heroin traffickers learned that narcotics units were keeping close watch on blacks, they started to hire others to work as couriers, particularly people from poor Asian countries. Today, officials have been told to keep a close watch on Burmese.
