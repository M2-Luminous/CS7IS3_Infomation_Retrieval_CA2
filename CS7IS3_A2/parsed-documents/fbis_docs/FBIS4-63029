FBIS4-63029 "drsov097_b_94052" FBIS-SOV-94-097 Daily Report 18 May 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Military & Nuclear Issues No Safety Accessories on 50 Research Reactors in Moscow No Safety Accessories on 50 Research Reactors in Moscow LD1805203694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1819 GMT 18 May 94 LD1805203694 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] At the moment, more than 50 research nuclear reactors are functioning in Moscow, but none of them is equipped with safety accessories such as protection shields. Nevertheless, only three reactors of the Kurchatov research center have been closed down since 1992. To make matters worse, they are likely to be brought on-line again in the near future, the former head of the Moscow inspection unit of the State Atomic Supervision Committee (SASC), Vladimir Kuznetsov, told Interfax Wednesday. Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, he said the situation with safety precautions on the territories of research centers in Moscow was "disastrous." "The inspection revealed an awful lot of violations. For example, a reactor in the Kurchatov institute has been exploited at two times the capacity it was designed for. While halting another reactor in the Theoretical and Experimental Physics Institute, all its territory was contaminated, and radioactivity is likely to proliferate beyond its limits," he said. Kuznetsov disagreed with the wide-spread opinion that research reactors are low-capacity, and that the contamination will not be serious in case of an accident. As many research centers, in particular, the Kurchatov Institute, were located within the city limits, an accident will lead to the contamination of homes, hospitals, kindergartens, etc. Another participant of the news conference, employee of the SASC Research and Scientific Center Vladimir Moskalenko pointed to the "outrageous condition of technical equipment of the reactors." He said the obligatory check for ionizing emanation was either neglected, or the equipment was so insensitive that the probes could not be correct. He also said there was practically no control of leakages of radioactive gases and aerosols to the atmosphere. The former employees of the SASC sent an open letter to the State Duma and the Federation Council with a proposal to consider the inexpediency of further use of nuclear installations in Moscow due to a possible disaster.
