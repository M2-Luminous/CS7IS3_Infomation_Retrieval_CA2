FR940114-1-00018 FR940114-1-00004 The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify Class D airspace at Roswell, NM. The current Class D airspace at Roswell Industrial Air Center, NM, was modified by rulemaking action dated December 12, 1993 (58 FR 63885). That modification included an extension of the Class D airspace within 3.7 miles each side of the Chisum Very High Omni-Directional Radio Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) 290 ○ radial extending from the 5.0-mile radius to 14.8 miles northwest of the airport. That extension to the Class D airpace in excess of 2 nautical miles should have been classified as Class E airspace. The intended effect of this proposal is to reclassify a portion of the current Class D airspace extension at Roswell, NM to a Class E airspace extension to contain instrument approach procedures and to provide adequate Class D airspace to contain IFR operations and require two-way radio communications at Roswell Industrial Air Center. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published in Paragraph 5000 and Class E airspace areas designated as extensions to Class D surface areas are published in Paragraph 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
