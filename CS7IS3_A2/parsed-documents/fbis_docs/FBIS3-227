Mr Ramaphosa made the call in a resoluation submitted to the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] at its Cape Town sitting on Tuesday. [1 March] Quoting newspaper reports and producing the official media release, he said Mr Shill had arrogantly proceeded to make an announcement on an as yet incomplete package negotiated by the multi-party National Housing Forum [NHF]. "He is clearly taking the housing issue and making it a party political matter," he said. Mr Ramaphosa told the council that when it was heard that Mr Shill was going to make the announcement, he was asked to wait and do so jointly with the NHF. "They (NHF) say the announcement is premature and has the potential to put at risk everything they have done." It was quite clear that by making the announcement Mr Shill was trying to demonstarte to the country that one party, the NP government, was solely responsible for the plan. "He is abusing his position as a minister by using a package negotiated at a multi-party forum to boost the fortunes of the National Party. "It is the most arrogant, the cheapest shot Mr Shill could take on an issue like this," he said. Housing was a national issue and had to be handled on a multi-party level. The issue affected the levelling of the playing field (the primary function of the TEC). Mr Shill had made it unlevel. "We have had enormous problems with this minister." When the housing board was formed he had made it clear he would not be dictated to. "This minister must be brought to book." He should be brought before the council, along with the NHF, to explain his actions. "I would like to say that this government is on its way out, and that ministers should not make announcements on issues that affect all our people without first making sure at multi-partyy level that there is agreement." After listening to the response of some members, including Dr Dawie de Villiers, who called for fuller information before condemnatory action was taken, Mr Ramaphosa called for the minister's resignation. "We have had good relations with other ministers who have constrained themselves and not acted on a unilateral basis but consulted on a multi-party basis." He named Dr de Villiers and the complicated issue of cellular phones. The minister of finance and of foreign affairs were other examples. Mr Shill's actions was upsetting the tenuous balance which the council was trying to establish over the transition. "He has done the country a disservice -- he must go," Mr Ramaphosa said. The debate on his proposal was adjourned to allow efforts to be made to get Mr Shill to attend the session and explain himself.
