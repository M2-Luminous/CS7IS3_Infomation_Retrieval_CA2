FR940725-1-00060 FR940725-1-00010 Section 23.157␣Rate of Roll This proposal would revise §23.157(d) power and trim requirements and would clarify the flap position. Proposed §23.157(d)(1) would clarify that the flaps should be in the landing position. Proposed §23.157(d)(3) would make the power consistent with the approach configuration, which is the configuration being tested. Proposed §23.157(d)(4) would relate the trim speed to the proposed V REF . (See proposal for §23.73.) Section 23.161␣Trim This proposal would revise §23.161 power, configurations, and speeds. Proposed §23.161(a) would state the safety principles underlying the trim requirements and would provide a regulatory requirement for considering conditions that might be encountered outside the requirements addressed in paragraphs (b) through (d). Proposed §23.161(b)(1) would add a requirement to trim at M MO in addition to V MO . This proposed change only clarifies that the airplane must trim in the Mach limited speed range. Proposed §23.161(b)(2) would require lateral and directional trim over a range of 1.4 V S1 to V H or V MO /M MO for commuter category airplanes instead of only the high speed requirement in the present rules. It is appropriate for commuter category airplanes to trim in the proposed range. It would not be burdensome because all present commuter category airplanes were designed to the proposed standard. The proposed introductory paragraph of §23.161(c) would delete the reference to V MO /M MO , since it is addressed in other appropriate places. Proposed §23.161(c)(1) would require trim at takeoff power, as this is a likely operational scenario for most airplanes and the condition should be tested. In addition, the proposed change would relate the maximum continuous power climb speeds and configuration to §23.69, the enroute climb requirement. Current §23.161(c)(2) moves to §23.161(c)(4), changes the reference V REF for a landing speed, and adds a requirement for the airplane to trim at the steepest landing approach gradient the applicant chooses under §23.75. It is appropriate for the airplane to trim at all landing conditions. Current §23.161(c)(3) moves to §23.161(c)(2) with editorial changes. Current §23.161(c)(4) moves to §23.161(c)(3) with an increase in the trim speed from 0.9 V NO or V MO to V NO or V MO /M MO . The increase in trim speed is appropriate because descent is permitted and is common at V MO . Proposed §23.161(d) would make editorial changes in the introductory paragraph. It would reference the appropriate §23.67 requirements and delete commuter category speed ranges, which are moved to the new §23.161(e). Section §23.161(d)(4) is revised to specify flaps retracted instead of referencing the §23.67 configurations. Flaps retracted is the likely sustained configuration where a pilot would need to trim. Also, the flaps retracted configuration for §23.161(d)(4) would be consistent with the proposed §23.67.
