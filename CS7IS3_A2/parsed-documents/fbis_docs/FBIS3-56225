Will the Politicians Revive It at the Russian-Belarusian Talks?"] [Text] Undoubtedly Stanislav Shushkevich, the head of the Belarusian parliament, who visited Moscow 12 January at the head of a Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet delegation left Minsk in a mood that was far from jovial. A most grave economic situation has developed in the republic. Since New Year more than 20 of Belarus' largest enterprises have stopped work. In addition, the vehicle and agricultural machine building enterprises have not begun work. The BelAZ Belarusian Truck Plant, MAZ Minsk Truck Plant, and "Gomselmash" plants are standing idle. The situation is no better at enterprises in the radioelectronics sector, which together with machine building constitute over 80 percent of the republic's industrial potential. The "vacation" at the "Vychislitelnaya tekhnika [computer equipment]" republic industrial association will last until 1 February and the "Integral" Science-and-Production Association, BelOMO [Optical and Mechanical Association], and other enterprises are standing idle. One of the main causes of the economic crisis in Belarus is the sharp rise in prices for energy resources and the lack of cash in Russian rubles. According to certain statistics payment for energy sources already accounts for 60 percent of production costs in the republic. In this situation, however, the Belarus leadership is pinning great hopes on the unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and Russia: A decision on that was adopted last week. However, even here it is not all plain sailing. For example, in the opinion of Stanislav Bogdankevich, chairman of the board of the National Bank of Belarus, the statement on the forthcoming unification of the monetary systems leaves an ambiguous impression. On the one hand it is stated that the sides are ready to carry out this unification but on the other there is a marked lack of agreement on a whole series of questions. In particular, Bogdankevich stressed that from the date of the republic's switch to the Russian ruble it is stipulated that standard prices must be set for energy sources and basic raw materials within the confines of the common customs territory. Otherwise any unification becomes pointless because Belarusian enterprises will obviously be uncompetitive in the Russian market. In short, the statement on the unification of the two countries' monetary systems has produced conflicting interpretations both in Russia and in Belarus. The opponents and supporters of this move have considerable justification for their view. Skeptics, for example, consider that the unification of the monetary systems could lead to an infringement of Belarusian sovereignty whereas the realists are ready to forego a proportion of that sovereignty for the sake of saving the economy.
