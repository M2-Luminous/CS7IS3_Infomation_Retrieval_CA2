How does your government want to govern, and how will it be able to govern in the six months allotted to it? [Moravcik] Although the factor of the six-month term significantly affects our operation and decisionmaking, we do not want to limit our program to this term--i.e., we are designing the program so that it is based on a long-term concept and development trends we want to outline and, in the coming six months, do something for their implementation. That is the general approach. From this point of view, we do not want to limit our ideas in designing the government policy to the six-month term. [Kotian] Could you be more specific regarding the most important long-term trends? [Moravcik] The economy is our number-one priority, although development trends must also be launched in the social sphere. In the economy, it is the fast transformation, which in turn requires accelerated privatization. Privatization must be executed so that it is a part of the economic concept--i.e., that it create conditions for the solution of economic problems. [Kotian] A lot has been heard recently about legal and ethical doubts, about hectic privatization measures of the previous government. How do you intend to deal with this problem? [Moravcik] From the vantage point of privatization, in general, it is a minor problem. We do not want to lose much time on this. It must be settled as fast as possible. [Kotian] Your political adversaries claim that the broad coalition is held together by fear of Meciar and the interest in privatization. How do you argue against claims that the interests of political entities are your main concern in privatization? [Moravcik] That cannot be argued, but, by deeds--we must consistently implement the basic approach of achieving transparency in privatization--projects will be published so that everybody can learn who privatizes what--i.e., make privatization subject to public control. [Kotian] What is the place of the second wave of privatization in your concept? [Moravcik] We are just now contemplating its extent. However, if we wish it to have a meaning, its extent cannot be significantly smaller than in the first wave. We want to do everything in our power for it to be executed before or at least soon after the elections. [Kotian] Milan Knazko told SME that your government will not be election-conscious but, rather, has to implement some very unpopular measures. How do you personally deal with the internal dilemma of not being election-conscious but, at the same time, not fail in the elections. You certainly want you or a similar government to continue in the aforementioned trends. [Moravcik] Obviously, a balanced approach must be found. To act with just the elections in mind would be in direct contradiction to our political beliefs. It is necessary to work for the benefit of the country--if I can phrase it so--and I believe that we can convince the citizens of this country that some measures are necessary even if they are unpopular. From this point of view, I would not perceive election interests as an effort to be popular at any cost. After all, that would not even be convincing. [Kotian] It may be convincing for a citizen, in the negative sense, if you adopt unpopular measures without a convincing justification or if you adopt solely unpopular measures. [Moravcik] Of course, we have reckoned with that. There is a limit in the unpopular measures, beyond which we cannot go, not because of the elections but, rather, because we have to consider the social acceptability. We have to move within these limits. [Kotian] Could you possibly indicate now some of the measures that could make life easier for, let us say, physicians, teachers, pensioners, businessmen...? [Moravcik] It is difficult to talk about it now because we have to take another look at the budget first. Even if we take some measures concerning transport or pension indexation, or public catering in educational and health-care institutions, we would like the impact to differentiate between those who are at a certain level of social minimum and those who can afford it. In simple words, regardless of the position of the vantage point in the political spectrum, we cannot impoverish the country or move a large number of people below the sustenance minimum. [Kotian] How do you want to convincingly address the trade unions, to whom the former prime minister laid it on with a trowel by the adopted General Agreement? [Moravcik] We propose to change the General Agreement, in general, and some of its stipulations, in particular. The biggest problem is the arduous question of the social fund, and we must explain in actual figures whether the implementation of such a demand would bring the desired effect. We must reflect this problem onto its macroeconomic correlations and consider its feedback in the social sphere. [Kotian] The IMF supplement to the Slovak Government Memorandum is a considerable problem. You decided to accept it, although it will translate into restrictive measures. Can you give us some details of this amendment as well as the measures to moderate its impact? [Moravcik] So far, this supplement is not really topical because we are building on the assumption that, if we find another way of securing the objective, an agreement with the IMF can always be reached. [Kotian] Do you know another way of securing the objective? [Moravcik] For example, it is not acceptable to us that we implement the value-added tax according to this proposal. This means that we will have to distribute the cost of these measures to society in a differentiating fashion, according to the social strata. Hence, if the price of food were increased, we would have to take care of a pay raise for certain groups of population. Thus, the increase in the price of food would not be so drastic. [Kotian] Do you have in mind some sort of compensatory allowance? [Moravcik] It is rather a raising of pensions and income. This society must maintain a certain culture, and this includes security for people with lower incomes. [Kotian] A new body emerged at the time of the coalition talks--the Coalition Council, which is to smooth the rough edges between the individual entities represented in the government. Does the Coalition Council limit your powers? [Moravcik] So far, the Coalition Council has been helping. I am convinced that I will be able to repeat this at the end of my term of office. We discuss the principal problems at these talks. We come up with certain ideas that are examined here, and thereby we are assured that our decision is correct. [Kotian] How do you see the prospects of such a coalition council, of such a cooperative form of government? [Moravcik] I believe, that, in the positive sense of the word, we have been forced to such a form of government. We would like to continue in this fashion. We have to do our best to achieve favorable results in the next elections, to convince our citizens that this form of government brings them agreeable conditions for their work. [Kotian] What holds together such entities as the Party of the Democratic Left and the Christian Democratic Movement so that they are capable of governing together? [Moravcik] I believe the political responsibility for the fate of this country that they assumed, and I believe that, if they assumed this responsibility, they must not gamble, they must reach an agreement. The agreement will be a complex one, but the experience to date has not revealed any significant differences. [Kotian] Does it mean that the difference between the left and the right wings is vanishing in Slovakia, or, the farther down or in the corner Slovakia is, the more unequivocal is the way out? [Moravcik] However we look at it, one thing is clear: The time for pragmatic solutions is here. We are able to unite on that. This society must get out of its predicament and isolation--i.e., the society at any cost, and subsequently we can implement right- or left-wing policies. At this time, all entities united in a certain orientation, and it is important that they agreed on the acceleration of the transformation. [Kotian] You referred to pragmatic solutions and the agreement between the left and the right wings. How do you perceive through the prism of your words a certain tension and strife in the center regarding the liberal or conservative orientation? [Moravcik] I believe it of marginal importance. The logical disintegration of political forces and the formation of a rational political scene is taking place in Slovakia only now. It is a process that is marked also by numerous subjective factors, but I firmly believe that it will eventually lead to a rational distribution of political entities. From this point of view, I regret that we have not managed to form a single party with Cermakites, but, if they feel that their place is on the right, they are likely to approach the Christian Democratic Movement. We want to cooperate with the National Democratic Party; at least we would like to go jointly to the elections. The fact that we have not formed an integral entity certainly makes us weaker, but it would not do to try forcing something that is not internally consistent. [Kotian] A problem of the government that failed in the 1992 elections was the media rendition of their intentions, their objectives, their lack of convincibility. Despite having a very short term of office, this problem also pertains to you. Do you feel certain weaknesses of your government in the sphere of media influence? [Moravcik] No, to tell the truth, even if we do not push ourselves through as markedly as Vladimir Meciar, for instance. I believe it correct. We do not wish to follow the path we criticize, and, furthermore, the situation is different from what it was after the first recall of Meciar. Now, a large part of the population has undergone adverse experiences with his government.
