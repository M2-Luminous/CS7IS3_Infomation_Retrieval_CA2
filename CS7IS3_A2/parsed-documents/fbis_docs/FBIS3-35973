According to the colonel-general, the Russian Defence Ministry hopes the contacts will "improve planning, organization, preparation and implementation of peace-keeping operations that involve Russian units". "The Russian Armed Forces General Staff and the Defence Ministry pay much attention to the peace-keeping operations. We analyze the experience of our peace-making battalion in former Yugoslavia and that of our military observers acting under the U.N. aegis," he said. The official informed the NATO general of a peace-making role of Russian troops in the Trans-Dniester region, Tajikistan and other areas of the commonwealth. In his turn, General von Ondarza said NATO plans to discuss details of cooperation with Russia. The general arrived in Russia on Monday on a four-day visit. He has met Russian Army Commander-in-Chief Colonel-General Vladimir Semenov, visited the Kantemirovskaya Guard tank division and acquainted himself with combat training and the military routine. A draft program of Russian-NATO military cooperation for 1994 was discussed at a meeting of representatives of the Russian Defence Ministry and NATO last week in Moscow. The draft includes 50 military arrangements, namely exchange visits of Russian and NATO military command and experts, joint exercises and training, training of Russian officers at NATO units and educational establishments and mutual invitations to military exercises.
