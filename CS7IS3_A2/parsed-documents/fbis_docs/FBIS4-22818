An equimolar quantity of CuCl[.sub]2[/][.sup].[/]2H[.sub]2[/]O solid crystal hydrate was added to a solution of 0.3 mmol of ligand in 5 ml CH[.sub]3[/]CN at room temperature. The mixture was stirred intensively until the salt dissolved and then held for 2 days. The resultant light green crystals were filtered off, rinsed with hexane, and dried over CaCl[.sub]2[/]. When chemically pure acetone was used as the solvent, small acicular yellow crystals were formed. The CuCl[.sub]2[/]L complexes were subjected to x-ray crystallographic analysis on a CAD-4 diffractometer, infrared spectroscopy on a Specord 751R, and EPR studies on an SE/X-2544 EPR spectrometer (Radiopan). The crystals of the compounds formed were classified as triclinic with lattice parameters as follows: a = 8.391(1), b = 10.486(2), and c = 6.42(7) angstroms; _a_ = 81.07(3), _b_ = 87.27(3), and _g_ = 72.04(1)�; V = 962.5(6) A[.sup]3[/]; Z = 2; and limiting boundary = P1. The x-ray crystallographic analysis established that in the complex, the cyclohexanedioneisoquinoline functions as a bridge ligand that is coordinated to its two neighboring copper atoms through the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups of the cyclohexanedione fragment of the molecule. The studies further established that the ligand in the complex has the very same tautomeric form as in a uncoordinated state. The spectrochemical characteristics of the tautomeric form and the method of coordination of dihydroisoquinolinecyclohexanedione were determined. The EPR spectroscopy studies confirmed Cu-Cu magnetic interaction in polycrystalline samples of the complexes. The degree of polymerism of the polycrystalline specimens studied was found to depend on the quantity of crystallization water present in them.
