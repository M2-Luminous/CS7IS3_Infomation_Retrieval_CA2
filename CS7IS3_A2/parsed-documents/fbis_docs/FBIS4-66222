It has set up branch companies in 11 countries, including Germany, America, Russia, Thailand, and Malaysia. Not only the CPC Politburo and high-ranking military officers attach importance to the outstanding achievements of the Sanjiu Enterprise Group; some major financial groups abroad with solid strength have sought cooperation with this enterprise group. What is the secret of the Sanjiu Enterprise Group's amazing achievements over two years? Not long ago we interviewed Zhao Xinxian [6392 2450 0341], general director of the Sanjiu Enterprise Group. Recorded in Cambridge World Who's Who Zhao Xinxian is China's first enterprise star, and in 1993 he was selected by the editor in chief at England's Cambridge International Biography Center for inclusion in its Who's Who. The talents and the wisdom and courage of this entrepreneur in management and in enterprise development were displayed for the first time when he set up the Southern Pharmaceutical Factory with its famous "Sanjiu Stomach Tonic," and his fame spread abroad. In 1985 he led five young people in obtaining a 5 million-yuan loan in preparation for setting up the pharmaceutical factory. In the first year after it went into production in 1987 it achieved an output value of 11 million yuan and a profits tax of 1.78 million yuan. Afterward, the plant expanded the scale of its production year by year, and its returns multiplied year by year. In seven years' time the output value and the profits tax increased respectively by 60 and 52 times, becoming above average in the pharmaceutical industry of the People's Liberation Army and even of the whole country. Pharmacy Holds Sway Over Entire Country In 1991 the Sanjiu Enterprise Group was formally established, and it had a total output value of 640 million yuan; in 1993 the output value sharply increased to 2.2 billion yuan, with an increase of 330 million yuan in fixed assets, an increase in per capita output value of 900,000 yuan, and an increase in profits tax of 290 million yuan, not only holding say in China's pharmaceutical industry but also jumping to 74th position among China's 100 largest industrial enterprises. Zhu Rongji Says: Armed Forces Enterprises March at the Head What is noteworthy is that, during the application of the Sanjiu Group's armed forces-style management to enterprises, effective "Sanjiu mechanisms" were found and summed up. First of all, in fitting out the leading body of an enterprise, they boldly broke with the tradition of the "multihead system" forbidden zone and put effect the enterprise's corporate representative "single-head system," thereby taking the lead in the reform of the rights structure of Chinese enterprises, which for the Chinese military was unprecedented. The year before last Zhu Rongji went to the Sanjiu Enterprise Group to inspect it. He found quite admirable the fact that it did not set up the position of deputy to the head of the leading group, and he said to important officials of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen City accompanying him: "Foreign enterprises are run like this. The armed forces enterprises are marching at the head. We must learn from the Liberation Army!" Doing things in this way means that there is quick decision making by the leading mechanism, there is no internal dawdling, and the sense of responsibility of the corporate representative is strong. In the words of Zhao Xinxian: "If there is one carrier then there will still be water to drink; if there are three carriers then even if they still carry water there will be no water to drink!" At present the several leading groups of China's state-owned enterprises are often bodies in which the collective has the final say. If there is a loss or an accident, the members of the leading group can shift responsibility on each other and "it is not known whose backside the bamboo rod should strike." Zhao Xinxian thinks that an enterprise may be compared to an orchestra: an orchestra can have only one conductor and can absolutely not have two conductors. If there were two conductors the orchestra would be in a total muddle. What the Sanjiu Group put into effect was precisely the corporate representative responsibility system, which "lets one person conduct the orchestra, i.e., the enterprise." Of course, the enterprise's corporate representative responsibility system does not mean that the corporate representative can make decisions at will and do what he wants; there must be corresponding restraining mechanisms that ensure that the decisions of the corporate representative are made on a scientific basis, and ensure that the corporate representative is restrained by rules and regulations and the supervision of relevant departments, thereby protecting the state-owned enterprises' maintained value and increased value. Boldly Improving Sanjiu's Wage System The "Sanjiu mechanisms" of the Sanjiu Enterprise Group, in distribution criteria, put into practice the 1:18 ratio wage system of "drawing salaries according to responsibility, calculating remuneration according to work, and dividing work according to profit," which for the first time set a precedent for China's enterprise wage system. Zhao Xinxian said that in the initial period of its establishment the Sanjiu Enterprise Group, when the enterprise was growing and needed manpower, several competent cadres resigned, giving as their reason that the "Sanjiu" wages and benefits were too low. The families of some staff members and workers played the stock market, and in one year made 18,000 to 20,000 yuan; and the cadres, who had made several tens of millions and even several hundreds of millions of yuan for the state, had an annual income of several thousand yuan, and therefore pyschologically there could not be a balance. Not long ago Zhao Xinxian went to Singapore on an inspection trip, and he discovered that in Singapore there are enterprises in which the wage differential ranges from high to low by more than 20 times, and these enterprises are managed very well. After returning to Shenzhen he reformed the fixed wages system in the old way of distribution, and exanded the difference in wages so that there was a differential between the highest and the lowest of 18 times. At present, the monthly wage in the enterprise at the lowest is several hundred yuan and at the highest can exceed 10,000 yuan. The Sanjiu Group's new wage system also stipulates that the group's subordinate enterprises, under the premise of improving economic returns year by year and of ensuring that state-owned enterprises multiply their output value, can put into effect a distribution in which the differential ratio is higher than 1:18 times. Fifteen percent of an enterprise's after-tax profits are to be put into the enterprise's distribution fund for wages and bonuses. For enterprises that greatly exceed the quota for profits the standard level for share-out bonuses may float up to 20 percent. For enterprises that cannot fulfill the quota for profits to be handed over to the higher authority, the standard level for share-out bonuses must fall 10 to 5 percent. If You Have the Ability, You Will Be Given Money as an Investment in Letting You Display Your Talents Zhao Xinxian says to people: If you have ability and also a feasible project, we will give you money to start up a company, run a business, and be the boss. If you are a talented person, before you come to Sanjiu we will prepare a home, furniture, and other living conditions for you. If you have a scientific research topic worth developing and using, we will give you money for the cost of the scientific research, and if results are obtained, besides doubling your bonus, we will deduct a proportional percentage from the profits made by the result and give it to you, thereby making you a "millionaire" overnight. For two years the Sanjiu Group has had a total of more than 90 competent persons in charge of leadership work at all levels, and more than 40 cadres who did not perform well either have had their wages cut or have been dismissed. The personnel elimination rate is being maintained at about 15 percent. After the Sanjiu Group reformed its distribution system, the enterprises put into effect three major supervisory systems (political supervision, economic supervision, and quality supervision), and the effect of "high salaries fostering honesty" is manifested there, because up to now there has not been discovered one case of using authority to seek private gain or of graft and bribe taking. Over the past two years, according to statistics: cadres have refused to take 100,000 yuan in cash gifts and have turned over to the higher authority 320,000 yuan for return to the factory. With regard to this "healthy phenomenon," Zhao Xinxian made an analogy: "If a cadre's monthly wage were one carton of cigarettes or one bottle of spirits, then, of course, one carton of cigarettes or one bottle of spirits would be attractive to him. If his monthly wage were equal to 10 cartons of cigarettes or several dozen bottles of spirits, it would not be worthwhile for him to accept one carton of cigarettes or one bottle of spirits in return for committing a mistake, because they would be of too little worth." Li Chia-ch'eng Invests in Sanjiu Group The Sanjiu Enterprise Group, which has nearly 2 billion yuan in fixed assets, which makes pharmaceuticals primary, and conducts pluralistic operations, has now developed the scope of its operations to 12 industries, including real estate, motor vehicles, import and export trade, electronics, foodstuffs, clothing, and banking, and has set up branch companies in 12 countries. Wealthy businessman Li Chia-ch'eng [2621 0857 6134], the head of Hong Kong's 10 major financial groups, at the spring of the year before last began to invest in real estate with the Sanjiu Group, and in Shenzhen he built the 81-storey Sanjiu International Building. Shortly afterward, some major financial groups, including America's First National Bank of New York and Thailand's (Chungta) Group, competed to become shareholders in the group. An inspection team formed by (Yi Kim-chi) [2621 6885 0892], chairman of the board and concurrently general director of South Korea's (Chukao and Nito) Pharmaceutical Corporation, and (Kim In-san) [6855 0690 3595], general director of South Korea's Pharmaceutical Trading Comnpany, inspected the Sanjiu Group and its core enterprise--the Southern Pharmaceutical Factory--and in South Korea signed an agreement under which they will the general agents for the products of the Southern Pharamaceutical Factory. America's San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan led a 25-member commercial delegation to the Southern Pharmaceutical Factory, and the two sides signed an agreement to set up in San Francisco an American Sanjiu company. Recently, Hawke, a former prime minister of Australia, made a special trip from Hong Kong to the Sanjiu Group, and the two sides explored cooperation in tourism.
