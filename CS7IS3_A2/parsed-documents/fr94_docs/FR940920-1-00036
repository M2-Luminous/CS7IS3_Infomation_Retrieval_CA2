Refer to section V.D of this preamble for a discussion of these proposed requirements. Records of all data, including results of emission tests and compliance reports, would be maintained for 5 years following the date of submission of the data. III. Impacts of the Proposed Standards The EPA projects that about 72 new MWC plants with a total MSW combustion capacity of about 17.6 million Mg/yr will begin construction by the year 2000. Of those 72 plants, 48 are projected to be large plants and 24 are projected to be small plants. The proposed subpart Eb NSPS would cover both the small and large plants, while the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS covers only large plants. This section describes the impacts (i.e., air, water, solid waste, energy, control cost, and economic impacts) of the proposed NSPS. The impacts of the proposed rule are provided in two forms. First, the incremental impacts of the proposed NSPS over the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS are presented. Second, the impacts of the proposed NSPS over a pre-1989 baseline (i.e., a baseline prior to the effective date of the subpart Ea NSPS) are presented. A summary of these impacts is provided in table 3.

These impacts would be equivalent to the total impacts of the proposed NSPS over a pre-1989 baseline. c kg/yr=kilograms per year. d g/yr=grams per year.
