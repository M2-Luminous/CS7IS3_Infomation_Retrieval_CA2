FR940303-2-00169 FR940303-2-00093 Section II: Fuel Economy Improvement by Manufacturers The fuel economy achievements for domestic and foreign manufacturers in MY 1992 were updated to include final EPA calculations, where available, since the publication of the Seventeenth annual Report to the Congress. These fuel economy achievements and current projected data for MY 1993 are listed in Tables II&hyph;1 and II&hyph;2. Overall fleet fuel economy for passenger cars was 28.3 mpg in MY 1993. For MY 1993, CAFE values increased over MY 1992 levels for 15 of 21 passenger car manufacturers' fleets. (See Table II&hyph;1.) These 15 companies accounted for over 74 percent of the total MY 1993 production. Manufacturers continued to introduce new technologies, more fuel efficient models, and less fuel-efficient larger models. For MY 1993, the overall domestic manufacturers' fleet average fuel economy was the highest it has ever been with 27.7 mpg, exceeding the CAFE standard by 0.2 mpg. The overall domestic manufacturers' fleet average fuel economy is the closest it has been to that of the import manufacturers, differing by only 1.8 mpg. For MY 1993, Ford and GM raised their domestic passenger car CAFE 0.7 and 0.6 mpg, respectively, from their 1992 levels, while Chrysler fell 0.3 mpg below its MY 1992 level.
