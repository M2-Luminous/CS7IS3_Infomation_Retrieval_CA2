In an interview with the Yugoslav TANJUG News Agency and the Army newspaper, VOJSKA, Perisic accused foreign powers of pursuing a policy of instigation of war in Bosnia, which was to a large extent successful in spreading the war. Most of the European countries had supported the separatist forces in the former Yugoslavia and provided them with military assistance, the chief of the general staff said, adding that the world's biggest firearm salesmen and war Mafia had a hand in the Balkan war. Perisic stressed that the superpowers, in seeking their strategic interests in the Balkans, had used their trump card of military force. Even the U.N. force had become a tool in their pursuit of these interests, he added. The Yugoslav military chief warned that the civil war in Bosnia, once spreading to the whole region, would run beyond control and threaten the security of those countries which had helped splitting the former Yugoslavia.
