The problem of brain drain from the developing nations to the developed nations has drawn wide-range attention from the developing countries, and the meeting is expected to exchange views on that problem and to probe for solutions, said Wei Yu, vice-minister in charge of China's State Education Commission. Talents flow along with greater regional economic cooperation and an open international market, Wei said at the meeting. He said that from a long-term viewpoint, the shift of talented people helps promote cultural and technological exchange between different countries. But developing nations often suffer from a brain drain that has negative effects on the local economy because often more talented people drift from the developing nations to the developed countries than in the reverse direction, he said. "Talented people are a kind of wealth," he said. "The training of talented people costs a long term investment."
