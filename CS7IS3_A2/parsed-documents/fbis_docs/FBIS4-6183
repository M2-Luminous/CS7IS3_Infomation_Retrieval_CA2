"We took our base back at 12:45 P.M., captured eight government tanks in good condition and destroyed seven," the Khmer Rouge's spokesman in Phnom Penh said, adding that casualty figures had not yet been confirmed. The spokesman said 3,000 guerrillas attacked and forced back some 7,000 government troops. "I am very excited to hear we can get back our houses," he said. Co-Defence Minister Tie Banh admitted that the Khmer Rouge had recaptured part of Pailin. "But remember Pailin is a very big place," he said. "Some of our troops are countering the attack and there is fighting going on there," he added. Tie Banh said the government had only six tanks in operation at Pailin and questioned how the guerrillas could talk about 15 tanks. Other military officials said the situation in Pailin was not yet clear. "We should wait until tomorrow," one general said. " The nature of military operations is like that, there is pushing up and down," he said. The Cambodian Army seized Pailin on March 19, claiming a body blow to the guerrillas' opposition to the government that emerged from the UN-organised elections in Cambodia last May. Pailin is a town near the Thai border that has been in the guerrillas' zone of influence for years. Its ruby mines and rich forests of teak have provided the Khmer Rouge with a huge source of income. Experts agreed that the government's seizure of Pailin was of symbolic weight, but questioned whether the Phnom Penh forces would be able to -- or even should -- hold on to the strategic site. The Khmer Rouge's classic tactic in such setbacks is to fall back into the jungle, harass the government's supply lines and then suddenly regroup, launching an offensive to recapture lost terrain.
