In an exclusive interview he told Interfax Sunday that everything will depend on the government team, its crediting and financial policy and what the prime minister and president have to say to him. He said that the distribution of top positions would largely dictate his decision. He did not rule out the possibility that the announcement that there would be fewer vice premiers in the new governmental line up had been made so as to leave out Sergey Shakhray, Aleksandr Shokhin and himself. "If there are one or two vice premiers, I will agree to be just a finance minister. If, however, there are four or five of them and Aleksandr Zaveryukha is one of them while I am to be only a finance minister, then I will not be a cabinet member because this would be an insult to me," Fedorov said. He thinks that "a reduction of the number of like-minded people" among the vice premiers would indicate a policy change. Fedorov said that he had had no prior knowledge of Gaydar's resignation but that he had not ruled out that possibility. In his words, he reacted "calmly" to the news of Gaydar's resignation. "Gaydar was not in the government for months, yet it stayed on the reform course and I would not attribute all our achievements to his return," Fedorov emphasized. He did not think that Gaydar's resignation would have a strong impact on the ruble's rate of exchange but admitted that it was not welcome news for the ruble. "The ruble cannot collapse as long as I am the finance minister," the vice premier said. He believes, however, that the ruble has been falling since December because of the rumors about the government set up and that it would be adversely affected by the merger of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, possible writing off of Ukraine's debt, and allocation of immense amounts for construction of a parliamentary building. Commenting on the statements made by some Russia's Choice leaders about his resignation from all his cabinet posts Fedorov said that he had not endorsed them. He was dissatisfied about the way the parliamentary group is run. Fedorov emphasized that he was not formally a group member. No meetings with the president or prime minister were scheduled for Monday, but he hoped that he would have a meeting with his superiors because the situation has drastically changed with Gaydar's resignation. Fedorov intended to pose conditions for his stay on the government but declined to specify them. He said he had scheduled a news conference for about 10:00 Tuesday and hoped that he would have something to say then.
