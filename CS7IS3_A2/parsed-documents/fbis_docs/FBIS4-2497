They hauled one of the inspectors to the security office and there beat him up using a baton. Two inspectors who later entered the office to negotiate with them were also beaten, abused, and held in custody for nearly two hours, thus severely obstructing the price inspectors from carrying out their official duties. Leaders of Shanxi Province, the Xinzhou Prefectural Administrative Office, and Xinzhou city took the incident rather seriously. The Xinzhou Prefectural Administrative Office instructed the Xinzhou city government to strictly handle the incident, and the Xinzhou city Public Security Bureau has assigned police to investigate. Guo Yuhuai, member of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee and executive deputy governor, instructed the secretary of the Xinzhou Prefectural Party Committee to take personal charge of the matter and see to it that the offenders are duly punished. SHANXI RIBAO was going to report the incident and express its support for price inspectors' exercising their regular powers and functions. The incident is still under investigation. On 1 April, Wang Dahu, deputy chief of the security section at the Guangxiu Department Store and the principal offender in the attack, was taken into custody for interrogation in Xinzhou city.
