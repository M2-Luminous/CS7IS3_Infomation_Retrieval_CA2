[Manuel] It certainly provides a fairly important start. Where do you look? Firstly, the 2.5 billion rand which the president raised in his state of the nation address as a contribution towards the RDP [Research and Development Program] is a small sum. But within all of the budget, within each of the programs, certainly where I sit within trade and industry, what I need to do is to stimulate those areas that the RDP asks of me. Every budget line must be reexamined, and you've got to look at issues that relate to the quality of life of people. In that way we can address the RDP. It's not going to happen in one year. It's certainly a process more than a single event. But I think we're well on the way. So clearly within the budget there's sufficient room to do that. Take account of the fact that to draw up a budget takes about 14 months. You've had your election just two months ago, and so all of the inputs aren't there, but within the big picture I think there's enough room. There are certain things that we believe are important as well. You would have found that in the ANC election manifesto there were taxes for people earning less than 4,000 rand a month, would be one example. The very unfair burden placed on women, especially married women in respect of taxation would be another example. Now with this once-off levy to pay for the transition costs, and they were fairly high, you would find special relief for those two groups of people, so the terms are in place. [Mashokwe] Let's look at one relief, one particular relief that we think ANC used very strongly -- zero rating on foods stuffs. Nothing is coming out of this budget in that regard, and one would have expected an ANC government to pioneer at least something along those lines? [Manuel] Okay, clearly it is an omission for the moment. But in looking at the overall tax structure it's important that you don't just do things piecemeal. You don't want to zero-rate bread and add 2 percent on the price of the jam that will go on that bread. And so the commission that was set up on taxation under the chairpersonship, Professor Michael Katz, is actually going to be important. All South Africans across the board can then make input into that commission. And that commission will advise government on a new system of taxation. Overall it will take account of pay-as-you-earn, SITE [standard income tax on employees], corporate tax in the longer term sense, but certainly also VAT [value added tax]. It is important, and I say that unless democracy puts more food of a better quality on the tables of the majority of South Africans we wouldn't have achieved anything. So that is why the zero rating, increasing that basket of goods that could be zero rated, is an important issue. But it will come, and I'm sure that it would be announced even before the next budget. [Mashokwe] The reason why I'm asking you this is because when you were not in government you were calling for the scrapping, the zero rating of foodstuffs, and now you're not saying anything about it. You're saying to me that it's coming? [Manuel] I'm saying it's coming. I'm saying that it needs to be done in the context of complete revision of the tax structure that obtains -- that commission was announced today -- Michael Katz, Dennis Davis, a few other people on that commission, I think it will hear what South Africans want, and make the necessary input, so government can be advised on the new tax system. [Mashokwe] You said earlier that where you sit in trade and industry, this budget is of importance. In what way? Import surcharge being canceled, what does that mean to me? [Manuel] Well, it means a fair amount to any South African. Firstly, the way in which corporate tax, or company tax is now structured so that you have a reduction to 35 percent, and then the secondary tax on companies which effects dividends primarily, being increased, is an important signal to small and medium business people because they are the major beneficiaries out of this. But what all South Africans need is an economy that grows, and clearly this is an investment budget. At a corporate rate of 35 percent, investments, new investments are encouraged, dividend pay-outs are not encouraged, and so more investment, more jobs, all of those issues become important. [Mashokwe] What about reduction of tax on individuals, people who made an X next to ANC? [Manuel] Yes, I'm saying that one would expect the terms of reference of the commission established on taxation to include issues of personal income tax.
