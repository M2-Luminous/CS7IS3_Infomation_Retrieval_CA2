On October 31 this year at Aurangabad, Indian peasant leaders from six states under the leadership of Mr Sharad Joshi, of Shetkari Sangathana fame, took a major step towards putting together a united farm lobby in favour of economic liberalisation. A national level Kisan Coordination Committee was formed to pool the resources of farmers who support all out liberalisation, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Dunkel proposals. An earlier attempt to form such a union fell apart after farmer leaders fell out with each other during the Delhi Boat Club rally in October last year. Against this backdrop the birth of a revamped KCC assumes added significance. The new committee includes Mr Bipin Bhai Desai of Gujarat, Mr Sharad Joshi and Mr Pasha Patel, both of the Shetkari Sangathana, Mr S.P. Sharkara Reddy, president of the Andhra Ryotu Sangam, Mr Bhupinder Singh Mann, member of parliament and Mr Harpal Singh, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Harpal faction) of Uttar Pradesh, and a couple of other leaders on its executive council. The KCC has delineated a platform that positions itself carefully in the present ideological debate within India's farming community. It has endorsed the resolutions adopted at the fifth convention of the Shetkari Sangathana in October. It also drew up a list of demands and planned a programme of agitations. Provided the KCC mobilises even one million of farmers in this country, 1994 will witness a gruelling contest for peasant leadership. The KCC will represent one point of view. It will be battling it out with Mr Mahendra Singh Tikait, Mr R. Nanjundswamy, president of the Karnataka Raja Ryota Sangha, and other leftist leaders. Though opposition to the Dunkel draft and attacks on multinationals like Cargill by some farmers have received wide publicity, the KCC represents widespread antagonism among farmers to the statist Nehruvian model under which they have suffered for 45 years. A major source of disgruntlement is the belief they have for years been forced to sell their crops at below market rates under this model. Echoing the stand the Shetkari Sangathana, the KCC's main grievance is that the government has done little about lifting restrictions in agriculture other than to produce considerable rhetoric. Mr Mann and Mr Desai are particularly harsh about the fact that monopoly purchasing systems, zonal restrictions, barriers to the self-processing of agricultural produce and export restrictions will remain. They point to the government's accepting of "dumped" products from abroad. They complain that three million tonnes of wheat was imported last year from North America and Australia to fill up the public distribution system when farmers from Punjab boycotted government purchasing. Farmer representatives contend the government was refusing to pay them Rs 300 per quintal while it paid over Rs 525 for the imported wheat. The KCC argue the Indian farmer is internationally competitive. Under the Dunkel draft proposals, they argue, there will be a curbing of subsidies for European and United States farmers. Coupled with the lifting of the Indian government's restrictions this will allow the more cheaply produced vegetables, fruits and even grains of India to capture markets the world over. It also believes that in a totally open global agrarian economy Indian farmers and other primary producers who have the benefits of relatively low cost methods of production can outsell the "modern" farmers of Europe and North America. The latter they argue have become slaves to an agricultural system of government subsidies and energy intensive chemicals and industrial inputs. The KCC has endorsed the "fourfold" agricultural policy envisaged by the Shetkari Sangathana. The key elements to this manifesto include agricultural exports, the establishment of shops to build direct links with consumers of agricultural produce, the direct home processing of such produce, and experimental agriculture which seeks to minimise the costs of chemical fertilisers and other inputs. Pro-Dunkel farmers groups are organisationally far weaker than those standing for swadeshi and restrictions on multinationals. Except for Maharashtra and Punjab, they do not have a significant presence in most states, irrespective of the claims of the leaders. However if the KCC sticks to some popular demands--like raising the government's procurement prices--their support base may expand in the long run. The KCC also voices the popular view that in the name of ending subsidies, the rates for electricity, water and so on were being unreasonably increased. But there was no effort to improve these services. It suggests that administrative expenditure should be slashed through the introduction of a fixed tenure system, stopping all further recruitments and freezing the scales of salaries and allowances. The KCC in principle also supports the abolition of subsidies and the provision of only commercial loans by banks for farmers. For obvious reasons however the organisation is not pushing these points of view too loudly when it speaks to ordinary farmers. The KCC main challenge will be to ably answer the criticisms of the Dunkel proposals and liberalisation put forth by other farmers' leaders. Mr Nanjundaswamy, for example, argues that the proposed Dunkel patenting of agricultural products and processes will deprive third world research and development and poses ethical questions regarding the ownership of biodiversity. After making the Indian peasantry dependent on subsidies, quotas, chemical fertilisers and high yielding seeds promoted by the West, the sudden withdrawal of all these under liberalisation may cripple the Indian farmer rather than teach him to stand on his own. This is something else the KCC needs to give some thought to. The leftist farmer groups are critical of the KCC's opposition to radical land redistribution and the strong support it receives from the rich farmer class. The KCC needs to respond to these questions before Indian farmers will lend their full support to Dunkel.
