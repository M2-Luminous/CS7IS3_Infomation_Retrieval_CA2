It turns out that, in addition to household installations, collective purification installations are being set up for hospitals, cafes, or organizations wishing to provide their staff with good water. The Polimersintez Scientific Production Association [NPO], in particular, is manufacturing such devices. The developers have given one of their products as a gift to Vladimir Lying-in Hospital No. 2. By the way, the Rucheek-1S and the Rucheek-2S household water purifiers, which we had mentioned in a previous publication, already have certificates of compliance, so that now only the price can be a cause for reflection for a purchaser. `` Most of the inhabitants of our planet are aware of the necessity of purifying water'', says Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Yu. Rakhmanin, Chief of the Laboratory of Drinking Water Supply of the Sysyn Scientific Research Institute of Ecology and Environmental Hygiene. Yuriy Antonevich, chief of the water country, as his instrument developers jokingly call him, as he is the chief expert of the WHO on water supply questions, knows everything there is to know about water purifiers, all the more so since domestic water purifiers undergo testing in his laboratory. He divides these devices into two generations. Devices based on the principle of filtration or absorption purification belong to the first. These instruments have one essential deficiency: they only partially reduce the bacterial and chemical contamination of the water. The best-known representative of filters of this type is the Rodnichok. They also include the TRosaU of both modifications, the TMechtaU, and the TKolokolchikU. A whole collection of water purifying devices has been gathered in Professor Rakhmanin's laboratory, from individual devices, in the form of a small tube, through which one can drink water from any source on a hike, to stationary devices, installed in kindergartens, hospitals, and cafes. The individual filters have proven to be better than foreign ones in effectiveness, although more poorly designed: the service life is three times longer, and in addition they kill viruses. The individual filter, RodnikS, of the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Medical Polymers [VNIIMEDPOLIMER] was in its time even awarded a prize of the Council of Ministers of the former Soviet Union. All of these are water purifiers of the second generation, in which complete decontamination of the water of both viruses and bacteria and agents of the parasitic diseases is ensured through iodine-containing reagents. But there are no analogs of this device in the world, says the professor, pointing to a light plastic cylinder with an intake tube attached to the valve, and an output tube delivering prepared water. The device is called the Izumrud. And it purifies water on the basis of an entirely different principle, through electrolysis. In it water passes through three stages of purification. First it is subjected to anodic oxidation; micro-organisms and organic and other contaminants are decomposed in the process. Then compounds of active chloride are destroyed, and finally neutralization of heavy metal ions takes place in the anodic chamber; these become nontoxic, harmless for man. Electrochemical activation does not simply purify water, it makes it, in the words of the development engineers of the Russian-American Emerald company, active; this is living water, close in quality to spring water or to the melt water of glaciers. And such water is especially useful.
