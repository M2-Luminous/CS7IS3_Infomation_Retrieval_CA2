These are the new demands on all customs personnel in the revised "Customs Regulations on Maintaining a Clean and Honest Government" recently promulgated by the General Administration of Customs. Customs first enacted and promulgated the "Customs Regulations on Maintaining a Clean and Honest Government" in 1990. In the course of implementing these regulations, it was discovered that dishonest acts occurred mostly during contact between customs personnel and recipients of their services. Based on this, Customs enacted and promulgated in 1991 the "Regulations Governing Specific Problems During Contact Between Customs Personnel and Recipients of Their Services." These two regulations played an important role in regulating customs personnel's conduct, rectifying malpractice in customs departments, and promoting the construction of clean and honest customs administration. In light of the development of the situation and the characteristics of customs departments, Customs again amended the two regulations to make them more oriented toward current problems and more practicable. While retaining most of the original contents, the revised regulations also incorporate the requirements for maintaining honest and clean government reiterated and practiced in customs departments over the past year. They include: Customs are forbidden, without exception, to engage in service trades, with the exception of logistics and science and technology services; to demand, for any reason, assistance from recipients of their services; to take part in highly expensive entertainment sponsored in their honor by recipients of their services; and to intercede for someone else or interfere in law enforcement during customs investigations.
