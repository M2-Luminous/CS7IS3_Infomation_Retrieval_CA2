His excellency the president attended and chaired the meeting. The Council of Ministers devoted its extraordinary meeting to the attack against state security, which took the form of an explosion at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il this morning. At the beginning of the meeting, his excellency the president briefed the ministers on his contacts with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, who denounced the attack and placed Syria's resources at the disposal of Lebanese authorities to discover the perpetrators. He also briefed the ministers on his contact with his majesty the king of Jordan for the same purpose. His excellency the president also briefed the Council of Ministers on all his contacts from within the country and abroad denouncing the attack. The Council of Ministers then examined the implications of the crime and its intention to weaken confidence in the security situation and the economic and social stability in Lebanon, fan sectarian fanaticism in the country, and divert the attention of world public opinion from the massacre committed by Israel in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron in the occupied Palestinian territory. The Council of Ministers praised the overwhelming reaction through which the Lebanese expressed comprehensive national unity in the face of this attack that was directed against the country's security and unity. The Council of Ministers decided to refer the attack against the state security in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il to the Judicial Council. Following the statement issued by his excellency the president, the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, and the prime minister this morning calling for public mourning tomorrow, the Council of Ministers also decided to call for a general strike tomorrow.

[Correspondent] Mr. Minister, [words indistinct] the crime that took place, have you specified the [words indistinct]? [Samahah] All that was said by the officials today refers to whoever we think, and we can confirm, is behind this attack, crime, massacre this morning against the worshipers in Sayyidat al-Najat Church. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, [words indistinct] referred to those who opposed the pope's visit to Lebanon. You hoped that they had no hand in the church explosion. Did you mean Minister Walid Junblatt? [Samahah] Not at all. Minister Walid Junblatt is one of those who has welcomed the visit of his holiness the pope and has cooperated with the Lebanese authorities. He has adopted declared positions with regard to domestic unity and receiving the pope in Lebanon. The ones I meant know who they are. They issued statements on this matter last week. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? [Samahah] Perhaps. Let us leave it to the investigation to determine that. We hope it will end soon and that the perpetrators will be discovered soon so that everyone will be reassured and we can know the aim and background of this attack. [passage omitted]
