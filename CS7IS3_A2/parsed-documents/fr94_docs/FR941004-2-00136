FR941004-2-00136 FR941004-2-00077 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,942] Fuelco, Denver, CO.; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration On September 13, 1994, the company requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on August 9, 1994 and published in the Federal register on August 25, 1994 (59 FR 43866). The company submitted information indicating that the same conditions still exist when it was certified earlier under TA&hyph;W&hyph;27,295. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 19th of September 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24482 Filed 10&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
