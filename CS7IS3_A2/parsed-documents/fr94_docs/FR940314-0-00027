This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM. ``If flap 0 is selected, and if a takeoff is rejected at a speed greater than 90 percent of the scheduled takeoff decision speed (V 1 ) for the applicable weight, altitude, temperature, wind conditions, runway slope, and brake configuration (if applicable), as specified in the FAA-approved AFM, report the rejected takeoff conditions to maintenance prior to next takeoff. Dispatch may be affected.'' (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.
