In Tamanrasset, the discussions will also be on the "National Peace Pact" signed in April 1992 between the Malian Government and the Tuareg rebels, whose implementation has already shown its limits on the ground. This pact made for the integration of former Tuareg combatants into the regular Army, but after the integration several Tuareg combatants recently deserted the ranks of the Army after exchanging gunshots with the soldiers. The Malian Government delegation to the meeting is led by Defense Minister Diocunda Traore, while that of the rebels is led by Zeidane Sid' Lamine of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of the Azawad, one of the four tendencies of the Malian Tuareg rebellion.
