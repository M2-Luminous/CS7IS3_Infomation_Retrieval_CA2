There are many mutual interests, as well as numerous reasons for that. A few minutes ago President Iliescu mentioned some figures. These are our joint modest estimates of the possibilities for developing our cooperation. This is why it is absurd that presently we cannot realize much of that and improve the standard of living and our economies, because of the administrative measures and sanctions that represent an anachronism at the end of the 20th century, and which were unfortunately imposed by the countries that consider themselves to be more cultured and more civilized. However, I am convinced that life itself will bring down such an approach, which is not civilized and which runs counter to the basic laws of the modern world that is integrating and uniting itself, the world that is permeating itself. In other words, the world that is opposite to these processes will have to go where it belongs, into the inglorious past, and I hope, will do so very quickly. In any case, I am sure that regarding our country and friendly Romania, both sides will maximally contribute to this. There is no doubt, and this is something we jointly concluded today, that good mutual relations between our two countries represent an important factor of stability in this region. We rate our mutual cooperation very highly. We rate very highly the objective approach by Romania and President Iliescu to the problems of the Yugoslav crisis and believe that there is every reason for our cooperation in future to only improve and increase in the interest of both peoples and both countries. We are very satisfied with everything we heard and saw and we are convinced in the success of our mutual cooperation.
