At a seminar entitled "International Capital Market and Inland Economic Development in China", Xiao said that the most important link in economic development lies in correct analysis of the capacity of market. He said that the larger a market is, the more funds it will attract. He said that Sichuan Province has formed a large market involving 400 billion yuan, which has even been regarded as the ninth largest market in the world by some American economists. As one of the largest provinces in China, Sichuan occupies 570,000 square kilometers and has a huge population of 110 million. It has rich natural and labor resources. The governor said that now Sichuan is expanding its market at a rate of 10 percent annually. He said that if his province can introduce 2 billion U.S. dollars per year, the gross domestic product of Sichuan is expected to grow at an annual rate of more than 10 percent. By the end of this century, the gap between the economic growth of Sichuan and provinces in coastal regions will be markedly narrowed, he said. The governor said that now some large international consortiums have begun to invest in basic construction projects in the energy and communications sectors. Last year, Sichuan introduced 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds and approved 1,900 foreign-funded enterprises.
