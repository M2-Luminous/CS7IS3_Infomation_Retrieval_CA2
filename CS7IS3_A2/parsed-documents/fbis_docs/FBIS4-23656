For Mali, maintaining peace and security has no price because it is convinced that without peace and security there cannot be smooth development, an indispensable condition for the improvement of the living standards of our people. Based on this principle, our country has made every effort to make its modest contribution to peacekeeping operations in various African countries. Yesterday, it was in Congo -- now Zaire -- and today, it is in Liberia, Burundi, and Rwanda. Confronted with the magnitude of that human tragedy, the UN Security Council in Resolution No. 918/1994 of 17 May, launched an appeal to the international community to bring the number of the soldiers of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda to 7,500. In line with the implementation of this resolution, the Malian Government has decided to send 150 men to Rwanda in addition to the 10 officers already present on the field. This contribution, although modest, concretizes our country's willingness to act in line with its international commitments and to express its solidarity with our Rwandan brothers. Indeed, nothing can justify the genocide that is raging in that country and Africa's silence in the face of such a tragedy constitutes a dangerous precedent. Despite a difficult internal situation, we do not have the right to live in ostracism because we have to assume our historic mission in Africa and for the African people to the end.
