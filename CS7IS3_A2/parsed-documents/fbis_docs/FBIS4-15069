Brazauskas briefly surveyed the results of the summit meeting of the three Baltic presidents in Palanga and replied to journalists' questions. Asked why the Palanga meeting did not set up the Council of the Baltic Presidents, A. Brazauskas replied: "Presidents' meetings and contacts should not be squeezed into a fixed and regulated framework." The experience of the Nordic countries also confirms this. Therefore, all the three presidents came to the conclusion that it was inexpedient to establish such an institution. The free trade agreement among Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania comes into effect as of 1 April. Did not the meeting discuss other inter-state agreements and the possibility of creating a Baltic bloc? According to A. Brazauskas, there was no mention of any blocs. [passage omitted] As usual, journalists wanted to hear the president's opinion on some pressing domestic policy issues. Asked whether he, as the chief commander of armed forces, has sanctioned the searches in the national defense system, A. Brazauskas replied: "I as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces deal with the latter rather than with matters of criminal persecution or searches." The state has institutions that must perform this work, although it is sometimes very unpleasant and difficult. The searches were approved by the Prosecutor General's Office, and the prosecutor general is responsible for this move. "Certainly, it is unpleasant when politics is confused with crime," said the president. Normal persecution should be conducted in line with the Penal Code, while no one should look for sanctions where they should not be. At the same time, the president expressed his discontent with the fact that "television and other mass media want to adopt the role of the prosecutor's office. According to the speaker, "no case can be resolved on the television screen." Such attempts only arouse unnecessary human emotions, "many hints, illusions, reflections, rumors, and so on." In the president's opinion, such political moves are "too conceited and picturesque, but with no content." It is the latter that law enforcement institutions must find and assess calmly, with skill and responsibility, and without turning it into a show. A. Brazauskas called the statement by the association "Selma," which threatens to suspend the construction of housing for the Russian military in Kaliningrad and demands the release of association President V. Laurinavicius, a political challenge and a shot into the air. "They have an agreement and must execute it. Judicial institutions will establish whether their president is guilty or not," said the state leader. Commenting on the conservatives' statement concerning the construction of the oil terminal, the president did not want to agree that it was delayed. The key decisions have already been adopted, and the government should announce the winner of the competition shortly. The issue of financing is urgent. The business plan should be ready by late March, which "will be a good basis for talks with large financial organizations and foreign banks that would undertake to subsidize this endeavor." Asked about the law on land recently adopted by the Seimas [parliament], A. Brazauskas said that he had received it only that Monday [28 March]. Thus, "the clock has begun counting 10 days and nights" since yesterday, within which time the president must study and discuss the law. The president said that he knew the emotional and even unhealthy reaction that the adoption of the document had caused in the Seimas. Before signing (or rejecting) the law, the president promised to study it thoroughly along with specialists.
