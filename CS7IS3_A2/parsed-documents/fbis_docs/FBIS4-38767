Simultaneously, he called for correcting Ukraine's laws on the security and police services so that Crimea's "so-called power structures" be unconditionally subordinate to the central authorities. He proposed an early reform of Ukraine's Constitutional Court, which, in his opinion, is called upon to abolish all Crimean administration decisions as "illegal." He motivated such a reform by scarce powers of the Supreme Soviet, which, in his words, "can only suspend illegal autonomy acts rather than abolish them." He is ready to submit as soon as possible for parliamentary endorsement candidates to Constitutional Court judges. He spoke in favour of a subcommission to be set up in Supreme Soviet to deal exclusively with Crimea's problems and accepted a proposal to set up within the cabinet an office of a vice-premier on territorial issues. Stressing his desire for a peace settlement without conflict, Kravchuk pointed out that "calm and peace are possible only if the Crimean leadership recognized the priority of Ukraine's Constitution and laws. He observed for this reason that "power in Crimea has been taken over by the party that proclaimed as its strategy Crimea's secession from Ukraine and its return to Russia." IF Note: May 30 marked the expiration of Kiev's ultimatum to Simferopol, which was demanded to reverse its decision to restore the May 6, 1992 Constitution. The dual citizenship and formal bilateral ties envisaged by the Constitution have proved unacceptable for Kiev. As Interfax has learned from parliamentary circles in Simferopol, at a session of the faction of the Russia bloc of parties -- the major Crimean parliament's faction -- lawmakers found it inexpedient to go on its decision and reconsider the Constitution. Kravchuk believes that the situation in Crimea might be greatly improved by an early solution to the Black Sea Fleet's problem, above all setting up separate naval bases for Ukraine and Russia. As the chief Ukrainian negotiator to negotiations with Crimean lawmakers, Boris Oleinik has reported to Interfax that Crimea may be discussed in the Ukrainian parliament in linkage with the Black Sea Fleet's problem on Wednesday. The main task for the Ukrainian delegation is to "find out whether Crimea's parliament is in principle prepared to make concessions and abolish its last decisions as unconstitutional".
