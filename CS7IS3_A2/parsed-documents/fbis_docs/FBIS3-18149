Kaspar Villiger and Flavio Cotti said such participation would be in line with Switzerland's tradition of supporting peaceful solutions for political conflicts. [Defense Minister] Mr. Villiger, speaking ahead of a national vote on the issue in June, said all Swiss blue helmet personnel would take part on a purely voluntary basis. He said the Swiss contingent would only take part in noncombat missions, that all parties in a conflict would have to agree to a UN deployment, and that Swiss troops could be withdrawn at any time.
