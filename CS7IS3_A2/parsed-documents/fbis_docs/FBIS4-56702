On 50th Street, a car carrying former Costa Rican President Rodrigo Carazo Odio collided with another vehicle, but there were no serious problems for the distinguished guest who has been invited here by the Electoral Tribunal [TE] as an observer. Carazo later met with ex-U.S. President Jimmy Carter. In Bocas del Toro, a TE source reported that the process is proceeding smoothly at the province's 211 voting sites. This is one of the few provinces where there are no independent candidates. As for Cocle Province, it has been reported that a phone call warning that a bomb had been planted was received at the Dominican Republic School voting site. The incident was handled by the Police Investigations Department, the Public Force, and the National Civil Protection System. The area was evacuated for 30 minutes. It was confirmed that the call had been a false alarm. In Colon, the 346 voting sites opened normally. Nothing unusual has happened in the province. Our correspondent in Chiriqui reports that the voting is going smoothly and that the people are displaying a great sense of civic responsibility. In David, electoral officials penalized certain businesses which, in violation of the law, sold alcoholic beverages. Everything is normal in Herrera Province, it was reported at noon. A large voter turnout is reported in Los Santos Province. In Panama Province, voters went to the voting sites in an orderly manner, particularly in metropolitan Panama. In Canita de Chepo, a candidate for representative was detained when he was caught with electoral material in a state-owned vehicle. The candidate also verbally abused the electoral official who questioned him. The vehicle was confiscated. Voting sites 1832 and 1833 in Rio Iglesias opened to voters at 1300 after damaged ballots for corregimiento representatives were replaced. The general consensus, at least in Panama City, is that the doubts on the use of the single ballot have been dispelled. The ballot is being used with no problem.
