According to him, the Smallholders could become the most significant opposition force because, he said, after the Hungarian Democratic Forum's bad performance, there is still an internal explosion awaiting it. Torgyan also said that the Hungarian Socialist Party's success has to be accepted. Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] is of the view that in the past four years his party has traveled the path that it set itself in 1990. According to him, this was sufficient for it to achieve its election result. [passage omitted]
