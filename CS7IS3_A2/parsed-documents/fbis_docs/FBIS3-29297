The declaration dated Feb. 12 noted the seminar was a more significant gathering as it was held on the occasion of the 52d birthday of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who is consistently developing in depth the chuche idea. It said: The participants in the seminar unanimously stressed that it is the most urgent matter for the independent development of developing countries at present to liquidate neocolonialism, establish a fair international economic order based on the principle of democracy and achieve the unity of the patriotic forces by establishing political formula suited to realities of each country. We consider that a new international economic order should be an independent l one which can ensure the interests of all countries, strong and weak, irrespective of differences between the rich and the poor on the principle of democracy. The developing countries should reject the unlimited opening of markets and conditioned "aids", which may cause the bankruptcy of the national economy and economic dependence, and positively develop the South-South cooperation on the principle of the collective self-reliance. We are convinced that the fundamental interests of the developing nations lie in building an independent sovereign state in a political aspect by uniting the patriotic forces. The developing countries should not follow the western-style multi-party system and destroy the national unity achieved through the arduous struggle, but firmly ensure unity and solidarity among the popular masses by means of building up the united front of different political parties around the patriotic political party.
