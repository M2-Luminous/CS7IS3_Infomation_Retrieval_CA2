FBIS4-6219 "dreas075_m_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 Thailand Army Chief on Cambodia's `Insincere' Friendship Army Chief on Cambodia's `Insincere' Friendship BK1904024494 Bangkok THE NATION in English 19 Apr 94 pp A1, A3 BK1904024494 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] ARMY Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit yesterday issued a veiled threat to Cambodian leaders, warning them that Thailand cannot maintain a good relationship with an "insincere friend", referring to repeated complaints from Phnom Penh that Thailand is helping Khmer Rouge leaders escape justice. "Between human beings, true friendship is sacred. So it is with international relations. Without sincerity, there can be no friendship," Gen Wimon said in his strongest denials of Thai aid to the Khmer Rouge in a week. Gen Wimon also warned that without Thailand as "a true friend", Cambodia would be in trouble. "I doubt whether the friendship offered (to Cambodia) by others is as genuine as ours," Wimon said. Likening the Cambodia of the recent past to "a person without clothing, food, or shelter", Gen Wimon said Thailand has demonstrated its commitment to its neighbour repeatedly with various forms of assistance. "We have given them help despite problems of our own. Now that things have improved, the Cambodians have forgotten all we have done for them," he said. Wimon interspersed his accusations of ingratitude with hinted allegations that enemies of Thailand had bribed Cambodian leaders to make these accusations. Reiterating Thailand's anti-Khmer Rouge stance, Gen Wimon said the army is losing its patience and will not tolerate further accusations. Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut, both of whom maintained a good relationship with the Thai military during their struggle against the Vietnamese-backed former government in Phnom Penh, have stepped up their allegations over the last week. Last Wednesday Ranariddh went so far as to say he would order Cambodian troops to fire on any Khmer Rouge tanks observed on Thai soil. Armed Forces' spokesman Lt Gen Anuson Kritsanaserani, meanwhile, confirmed that the cancellation of Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari's trip to Cambodia was a protest over the Cambodian accusations. The decision came on Friday, one day after the Cambodian Foreign Ministry informed its Thai counterpart of the postponement of Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen's trip to Thailand, following a closed-door session which included members of the Foreign Ministry and the armed forces. Gen Anuson does not believe, however, that the cancellations will necessarily worsen the situation. The Thai Foreign Ministry also lodged a formal protest when Thai Ambassador to Cambodia Sakthip Krairoek paid a courtesy call on Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut yesterday. "Now we wait and see," said Gen Anuson. Anuson denied reports that Khmer Rouge leaders are hiding in the Phnom Dong-Rak mountain range, which straddles the Thai-Cambodian border, saying the immigration controls in the area are very strict. The spokesman suspects the spill-over of Cambodian shelling onto Thai soil was deliberate and said it could have been avoided if the Cambodian military commanders were serious about it. He also believes the accusations against Thailand were in retaliation for the unwanted repatriation of Cambodians believed to be the families of Khmer Rouge guerrillas fleeing the town of Pailin, a former Khmer Rouge stronghold, which fell to government troops on March 19.
