They were handling so much sterling daily that one gang leader employed four people full-time simply to count it, said Mr Neil Dickens, who recently returned from a trip to Holland. Specialising in amphetamines, LSD, cannabis and cocaine, Dutch gangs act as wholesalers to British dealers. "If drug distributors in the UK paid 1 billion pounds for their source of supply, one can begin to estimate the value of crime committed to finance the purchase of those drugs on the streets," he said. Mr Dickens said the threat from foreign gangs expanding into markets in this country was one the police service, with its locally-directed constabulary system, was illequipped to meet. He told chief constables at Bramshill police staff college in Hampshire a national detective force should be created. "A national structure would provide experienced senior managers to ensure the international work is undertaken in an appropriate manner," he said. Mr Dickens said the seven regional squads and the Scottish Crime Squad should be amalgamated into a National Crime Squad with central funding. "Each region designs its own objectives, business plan, quality of service, or strategy, which in my view now needs to be more centrally directed to address the major criminal who knows no boundaries," he said. "It is perhaps understandable that individual squads, whilst to a certain extent recognising themselves in a national structure, remain parochial and self-interested concerning their activities. "Teams of officers are often travelling the length and breadth of the country to undertake surveillance when RCS (regional crime squad) colleagues from that target area could more costeffectively undertake the work." A national structure would provided a single reference point for strategic planning the update of information technology, technical surveillance and training.
