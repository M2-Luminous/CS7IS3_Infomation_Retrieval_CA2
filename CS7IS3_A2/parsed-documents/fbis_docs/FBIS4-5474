[Truong Tan Sang] "As far as Ho Chi Minh City is concerned, foreign economic activities are a very important part of the city's socioeconomic development strategy. They have had a positive impact on various economic activities and have helped increasingly develop the economic growth rate." The export volume of industrial products and processed farm produce have increased with every passing day. "We have been able to maintain an annual increase in our import-export volume of approximately 15 percent. In 1993 the export volume of processed industrial products accounted for 64 percent of the city's total exports. Over 80 percent of the city's equipment and machinery were imported. Tourism and support services made up 15 percent of the city's annual revenue." Foreign capital invested in the city is increasing. "Foreign invested capital in 1991 was as large as the figures of many previous years combined. In 1992, foreign invested capital increased 1.3 fold over 1991. In 1993, it was 1.8 times as much as that of 1992." In the years to come, especially 1994, the city's foreign economic efforts will be directed at consolidating our existing markets, opening new markets, strengthening and establishing more market monitoring organizations, encouraging economic firms to find new foreign markets, striving to attract more foreign capital investment in the infrastructure and in the development of advanced technologies, and promoting the production of export-oriented goods. [Correspondent] Could you, comrade, tell us whether effective foreign economic activities have had any impact on the city's economic development? [Truong Tan Sang] "Foreign economic activities have been and are a very important factor for socioeconomic development in the city." Noteworthy is the fact that they have become a source of revenue for the state budget. "In 1993, revenue from taxes levied on imports and exports was estimated at 2,600 billion dong. This helped increase the city's 1993 budget revenue by 44 percent over 1992." So far, "the city has licensed 280 investment projects with a total investment capital of $2,238 million, of which 159 projects with a total capital investment of $500 million have been deployed, providing jobs for 25,000 workers." [Correspondent] "The operations of party and mass organizations in joint ventures with foreign countries have become an issue. What is the city party committee's policy toward this issue?" [Truong Tan Sang] There are trade union organizations in a number of joint ventures with foreign countries. "But in general, setting up party and mass organizations in joint venture establishments has not been given due attention. That is why there have been disputes over privileges between workers and enterprise owners in certain establishments. These disputes have not been settled promptly, thus adversely affecting production and business environments. As the scope of investment will grow bigger in the future, the establishment and consolidation of such party and mass organizations must be carried out urgently in order to protect the legal interest of investors and workers within the framework of the law now in force." [Correspondent]: Thank you, Comrade Chairman.
