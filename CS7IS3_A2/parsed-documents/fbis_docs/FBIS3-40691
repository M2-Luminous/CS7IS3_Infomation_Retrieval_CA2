They could not have meant it, after all. For, it is difficult to believe that those who are aware of the mores of international trade could seriously oppose the decision. India accounts for less than 0.6 per cent of current international trade, whereas the European Community and the US share 40 per cent of world trade. Had India abstained, it would have made little difference to the proceedings, except that the marginal gains it has made would not have been available either. In fact, staying out of the GATT negotiations would have created many other problems for India. For example, it would have meant India's withdrawal from the economic mainstream of today's world which was not feasible as it does not have the capacity to withstand such isolation. Thus, joining the negotiations and trying to wrest the maximum advantage out of it was the most sensible step on India's part. The biggest advantage of acceding to the GATT treaty is that a multilateral trading organisation (MTO) has at last been formed to conduct international trade. In the absence of such a framework, trade would have to be conducted bilaterally between two countries in which the junle [as printed] law of "might is right" would inevitably prevail. Trade can now be conducted on the basis of well-defined rules which have to be followed by both strong and weak trading partners. A rule-based system is by and large predictable and this should stabilise international trading. So far, so good. However, while arriving at these broad parameters, certain interests have been sacrificed which many believe smacks of colonialism. The two biggest economic powers in the world, the US and the EC, have virtually dictated terms. The weakest economic entities, namely the developing world, have had to concede the most. This was painfully apparent in the penultimate stages of the Uruguay Round of negotiations. Till the very last moment, the fate of the talks was uncertain because the US and the EC could not agree on some point. But once the two Big Brothers hammered out a solution, the agreement was pronounced complete irrespective of any remaining differences. The US and the EC have even humbled the economic giant Japan, and forced it to concede to a series of their demands. The country had to capitulate on the highly emotional issue of rice imports. Again, Argentina had to agree to a kind of market sharing arrangement for its principal exports, which are all agrarian products like wheat and beef. In its present form, the completed round provides some relief to India. The agreement stipulates the phasing out of the Multi-fibres Agreement (MFA) and quotas for the export of textile items to the developed world. This should take care of India's interests to some extent. However, till the last moment, the US had tried to stall the phasing out of the MFA and wanted the period to be extended from 10 to 15 years. As for the provisions of phasing out agricultural subsidies and continuation of a subsidised public food distribution system, fortunately, the levels of subsidies in the western economies are so high that ours are just a fraction of theirs. Hence, there should be no compulsion to lower farm subsidies just to accede to the Dunkel draft. India, of course, would have to abide by the stricter codes of the agreement for the protection of patents and trade-related intellectual property rights. No doubt, these would affect some sectoral activities in India, like sections of the Indian drugs industry. However, even in a worst case scenario, the impact would be minimal. In the broader interests of the country, it might be better to honour the intellectual property rights because Indian entities could soon have some claims on them. With the GATT accord taking final shape, what remains to be seen is the fine print of the agreement and the way it is implemented. For the ultimate test will be how "fairly" the agreement is adhered to.
