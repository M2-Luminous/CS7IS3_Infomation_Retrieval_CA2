However, They Should Not Be Reformed Indefinitely Either, the State Duma Chairman Thinks"] [Excerpts] [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Each country has its own national security concept on the basis of which it organizes the activity of its special services. Given that the Russian state security agencies are being reformed for the sixth time in the past two years, can one say that our national security concept has changed six times? [Rybkin] As for Russia, we do have a concept. Reform is under way in the special services. Sometimes it is very painful, unfortunately. They say correctly that there is nothing more wasteful than reorganization. Special service staffers are probably realizing that. This sphere is very sensitive, so there is no need to go into particular detail regarding this subject. Russia must be securely covered from this flank regardless of political changes. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Each year our country is rocked by conflicts between the branches of power. Not long ago, the mass media carried reports about yet another coup allegedly designed to remove President Boris Yeltsin from power. There have been reports that this "version" was advantageous for some people in the government. What can you say in that respect? [Rybkin] What I have is information required for my work as chairman of the State Duma. My main work today is the budget. The country is living without a budget for 1994. That won't do at all. As for emergency scenarios. I think all of us have enough powers to act within the framework of the law, and effectively so, even in conditions of an all-encompassing crisis suffered by the economy. But this is possible only when there is civil peace in society. We must not let what happened on 4 October 1993 recur; 4 October was our common defeat. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] How realistic is the recurrence of that situation? [Rybkin] I think that given the collaboration between the authorities that has currently been emerging, its chances are nil. If, of course, the collaboration holds out. The president, the chairman of the government, the chairmen of the State Duma and the Federation Council, leaders of all prominent parties that have been chosen by the voters, representatives of various confessions and trade union leaders will sign an agreement on civil peace. This is a condition for our moving ahead, for our reform. [passage omitted] [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Let us recall the not so distant past. Formidable KGB units were operating against a handful of dissidents; now, when attempts to shake the Constitution loose are being made all the time, this area of the special services' work is being scaled down. Maybe it would make sense to give the functions of protecting the Constitution back to the special services? [Rybkin] I would probably agree with you. Even what we have does not work. The Constitutional Court at least operated in a normal fashion... [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] So what is to be done? The Constitutional Court is no longer in operation; the militia combats terrorism, it has no time for other things. Who is protecting us then? [Rybkin] I do not want to be the special services' or the militia's advocate. The protection of the constitutional order is a multifaceted process, it must come to the attention of both the special services and the Constitutional Court. Now we are ready to pass the law on the Constitutional Court. It has already been drawn up. All tensions between the Main Legal Administration and the Constitutional Court have been eliminated. The next meeting will consider these matters. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] You claim that the tensions have been eliminated. This is a questionable statement. At a recent press conference, Nikolay Vitruk, Constitutional Court member, had complaints to make against the Main Legal Administration, the Main Security Administration, and the Federal Agency of Government Communications and Information. For instance, he said that Mikhail Barsukov (Main Security Administration chief -- editorial board) allegedly tapped all his telephones and that no one could do anything about it. [Rybkin] I approach this matter rather philosophically. When I dealt with the economy, a man was sitting above my office who was in charge of my communications, and he was probably able to listen to my telephone conversations at any moment. At present, this also accompanies me. He who installs telephones can tap them, too. It is another matter that this should be done in accordance with the law. I cannot bring such charges against Barsukov, Ivanov, or Petrov. If someone is tapping somebody, he must be doing so if state interests are at stake, but such actions should be regulated by law. He who does so without legitimate reasons is a criminal. But until I can prove that he is a criminal, I do not have the right to accuse him. [passage omitted] [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] As of today we have effectively no special services. They have been "victimized." Professionals have been abandoning them for commercial businesses. The only real effective law-enforcement agency we have been left with is the Internal Affairs Ministry. Do you agree? [Rybkin] No, I do not. My view is not so pessimistic. It is very regrettable that some professionals in the prime of their career have found themselves out on the street. But you should agree that the special services cannot be stretched indefinitely. Presently we are parting with the past, the differentiation of people is under way -- this is, naturally, painful -- but necessary. The sphere of the special services' activity is very sensitive. The intelligence services of Great Britain, the United States, France, Israel, and other countries are operating both against us and against each other. But at the same time they cooperate. We should forge a partnership, but carefully so. I have Yevgeniy Primakov's (Foreign Intelligence Service director -- editorial board) proposal sitting on my desk saying that we should keep as much as to make our relations "transparent," so that we will trust each other. What is redundant may be cut. [passage omitted] [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But it is our own authorities that are beginning to slice and cut the special services, trying to fit them into some models; as a result the new does not emerge, but the old stops working... [Rybkin] This is not an easy time. Everything is undergoing reform, but reforms should be carried out so as to make them less painful. People ought to find application for their knowledge and talents. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Or, maybe, reform in the structures of authorities should be temporarily suspended until we get back on our feet economically? [Rybkin] I think we should take into account the so-called Parkinson's Law. The country has shrunk to one-half its former size. But the number of bureaucrats has doubled. How should we combat this trend? There are plenty of prescriptions: both American experience and the experience of other countries. In Russia, however, drawing on foreign experience is often counterproductive. [passage omitted]
