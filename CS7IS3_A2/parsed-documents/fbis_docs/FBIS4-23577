The Ugandan leader stated this in a speech broadcast live on Radio Uganda from (Kisawera) in Mukono District, where this year's Heroes Day was celebrated at the national level. He told an attentive audience that he feels there is now a basis for a cease- fire in Rwanda because of the Arusha Accord signed in the northern Tanzania town last year and the resolution passed by the United Nations Human Rights Commission recently condemning genocide in Rwanda. The resolution called for precaution for persecution of those found responsible. He said the Arusha Accord, which provides for the sharing of power, is a good basis. Maybe, he added, it now needs modification because (?some) of the people who would have taken part in power-sharing have been involved in genocide. On the UN Human Rights Commission's resolution condemning genocide, the president said genocide is not an internal issue and pledged that the Ugandan Government will (?call) on the United Nations to hand those responsible.
