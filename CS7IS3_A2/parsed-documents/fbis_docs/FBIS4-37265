The forces of the military regime ruling in Sanaa launched three surface to surface missiles toward the capital city of Aden. Our air defense systems confronted them and shot down two of them in mid-air while the third missile fell into the sea. This failed savage missiles attack on the city of Aden falls within the framework of the flagrant defiance of the Arab and international will by the military savage regime in Sanaa. The Defense Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, while still exercising self-restraint, will not stand with hands tied amid the killing and destruction inflicted on our people by the adventurous gang of Al al-Ahmar.
