The allegation that Hekmatyar is favoured by the government here is not really new. It goes way back to the Zia years and the successive governments that followed him when the concerned agencies supposedly showed a preference for Hekmatyar, leading to the conclusion of their partisanship. But that was in the past. The present government's policy, as recently articulated by the Prime Minister herself, is not to interfere in any way in Afghanistan's infighting. But it seems the government here needs to do more than making a simple statement of good intent to ensure that the perception about Pakistan's alleged interference or a partisan policy does not persist. Pakistan has to outgrow that perception if it has to play the role of an honest broker of peace in Afghanistan. As things are, Hekmatyar does have an advantage over his rival groups in that he is in control of territory that is contiguous to Pakistan and thus aid supplies from this country cannot reach Kabul without his consent. What it also means is that, even if the Pakistani Government did not approve of it, he could get the needed food and fuel from the illegal channels that have traditionally been operational in the area. But for that he would still need the money. Hence the question raised by a Kabul government official, "If he is buying it, how is he paying for it", needs a convincing answer. One seemingly simple choice before the government of Pakistan is to wash its hands completely of Afghanistan, which of course it cannot possibly do, given the level of its own interests there. The other more productive course for it would be to find ways and means of having direct communication with the rival groups while remaining strictly neutral. The recent efforts in that direction made by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali though commendable, are not enough. What is even more important, the ISI and the Foreign Office should not be working at cross purposes and if the ISI is not helping the cause of reconciliation between rival groups and is actually, as alleged, aggravating it, it must be reeducated as to the grave political consequences such a role could lead to. The situation calls for a detailed review of the country's Afghan policy at the highest government level.
