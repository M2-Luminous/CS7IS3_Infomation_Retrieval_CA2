Afonso Dhlakama's visit to the United States is primarily aimed at briefing the American people on the progress of the peace process and reaffirming Renamo's acceptance of the UN Security Council Resolution on Mozambique. In an interview with journalists shortly before departure, Dhlakama said that if the United States today recognizes that there is peace and freedom in Mozambique, this is due to Renamo's struggle. He was answering a question on existing misunderstandings between the U.S. Administration and Renamo. [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] I am fully convinced that the situation is different now. We all know that historically the United States played a very bad role in Mozambique. It supported the Communist regime of the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party. They never tried to pressure Frelimo to accept peace talks. This made the war last longer, causing more deaths. I think, however, that with the end of war the United States recognizes that there is now peace, democracy, and freedom due to Renamo's struggle. I am fully convinced that changes exist there. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] at a time when we are preparing for the beginning of voter registration? What is [words indistinct] Renamo areas have not yet been opened? [Dhlakama] Well, the areas have been opened. They have been opened. I have said on several occasions that it is the Frelimo government which is sabotaging the process. Mechanisms have been created to reunite the two administrations. Renamo advisers were appointed to carry out work jointly with the provincial governors. What is happening now? These advisers are not doing their work because the Frelimo government is sabotaging it. It does not provide them transportation and thus they cannot move about. I believe, however, that a solution is being found now. The territorial commission, established during the General Peace Accord to deal with these issues, held a meeting last week and it was agreed that the Mozambican Government would immediately appoint administrators in areas under Renamo control. The meeting also agreed that the government would establish police stations in Renamo-controlled districts and posts, under the supervision of the United Nations and the National Commission for Police Affairs [Compol]. This means that we are moving forward. Evidently, Frelimo tried to sabotage this process which should have begun months back. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] voter registration process will [words indistinct]? [Dhlakama] Absolutely. There are no problems. This will depend on the work of the voter registration teams. The teams are made up of elements close to the Frelimo Party. According to the law, it is the public service [words indistinct] the Frelimo Party doing this. Opposition parties have their elements in each team, however, in order to monitor the voter registration process. If we observe that there are irregularities [words indistinct]. We want all the Mozambican people, without discrimination, to take part in voter registration. [end recording] [Announcer] Referring to the national conference unarmed opposition parties and Renamo held in Xai-Xai, Afonso Dhlakama said the meeting was positive, pointing out that it made positive steps forward toward defeating Frelimo in the October elections.
