The delegation was received at the Damascus International Airport by Khalid al-Fahum, head of the Palestinian National Salvation Front, and Muhammad Walid Hammamiyah, the governor of Damascus. In a statement to journalists, Darawshah expressed happiness to be in Syria, his second homeland, this Arab country known for its history, deep roots, heroism, and sacrifices for the Palestine question and the Arab nation. He said: We have come to offer sincere condolences to His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad and his family, to the Syrian Government, and to the fraternal Syrian people whose positions we greatly appreciate. This is the main objective of the visit to Syria, and we thank the Syrian Government, led by President al-Asad, for allowing us to enter the Syrian land. This is something we are proud of. Answering a question, Darawshah said: We are not carrying any political message and we do not represent any official stance in Israel. We represent the Palestinians in the Galilee, in the Negev, and other cities. We are proud to be a part of the Palestinian people. Our visit to Syria today entrenches our affiliation to this deep-rooted nation. We have not bowed and our heads remain high, and we are proud of our homeland and of our Arab and Palestinian affiliation. Answering another question, Darawshah said: We have not come here for negotiations but to offer condolences. This is our noble objective. In reply to another question, Darawshah said: The horrible massacre that took place in the Ibrahimi Mosque, and the subsequent suppression and atrocities, have increased the number of Palestinian martyrs and injured, and aggravated the situation. The Israeli Government is responsible for this escalation. The Israeli Government should embark on practical measures to prevent the continuation of settlers' aggressions against the Palestinians by disarming these settlers and removing the settlements from the occupied Arab territories. Concluding his statement, Darawshah said: Our position has always been the same as the position of the Palestinians, and this position is identical with the Syrian position and the Arab position in general. We want to end the occupation and we support an independent Palestinian state on Palestinian soil, and we call for full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and from the Syrian Golan, which we consider an inseparable part of Syria. Before leaving Cairo, Darawshah said: We, as part of the Palestinian people and the Arab nation, decided that it is a pan-Arab and humanitarian duty to offer condolences to President Hafiz al-Asad on the death of his son Basil.
