FBIS4-28298 "dreas111_c_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-111 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 North Korea 1969 U.S.-Japan `Secret' Nuclear Accord Alleged 1969 U.S.-Japan `Secret' Nuclear Accord Alleged SK0806104394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1029 GMT 8 Jun 94 SK0806104394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["`Nuclear Hide-and-Seek' Under `Nuclear Umbrella'"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The Japanese SANKEI SHIMBUN recently exposed that a Japan-U.S. nuclear secret agreement was signed in November, 1969, allowing the introduction and passage of U.S. nuclear weapons to Okinawa, Japan. Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today says the signing of the agreement has rendered legality to the introduction, deployment and use of U.S. nuclear weapons in Japan and reduced the islands of Japan to a U.S. nuclear forward base against socialist and Asian countries. The disclosure of the agreement has made it all the clearer that the "three non-nuclear principles" which the Japanese rulers have claimed to be "a symbol of a non-nuclear, peaceful state" is nothing but a screen for covering up the introduction of U.S. nuclear weapons and Japan's nuclear armament, the article says, and goes on: It was with a view to promoting their own nuclear armament program under the U.S. "nuclear umbrella" and with the U.S. assistance that the Japanese reactionaries made a secret nuclear deal with the United States even by harming the dignity and interests of the Japanese people. The Japanese ruling quarters have, in actuality, been accelerating their nuclear armament behind the screen of the "three non-nuclear principles". They have already secured technologies and facilities for the development of nuclear weapons and even their launching system. The operation of Monju, a fast breeder reactor for abstracting quantities of plutonium, means a new dangerous step in the Japanese reactionaries' nuclear armament. Now, Japan can become a nuclear power any moment it decides to. Their noisy talk over the DPRK's "nuclear issue" is a clumsy trick to divert elsewhere the public attention at home and abroad and find an excuse for their own nuclear armament and reinvasion of Korea. Stupid and reckless are the Japanese reactionary ruling quarters' acts of bringing another nuclear disaster to Japan, far from drawing a lesson from their defeat in the past. They would be well advised to stop playing a "nuclear hide-and- seek" under the U.S. "nuclear umbrella".
