It was attended by representatives of 55 countries and regions, including China. Achieving the fourth general capital increase was an important achievement made at the meeting. At the close of the meeting, new ADB President Teruo Sato announced that the meeting already had enough votes to guarantee the doubling of the ADB's current $24- billion capital to $48 billion. This was the result of the Asia- Pacific region's relative political stability and economic vibrancy, and of the confidence of international capital in the region. The decision conforms to the aspirations of the vast numbers of developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region and is also in the interests of the creditor countries. Therefore it is generally welcomed. Nonetheless, when discussing the question of the general capital increase during the meeting, some creditor countries linked the question of capital increase with some policy conditions, thus adding political conditions to the capital increase. The U.S. representative once remarked that "good management" was a key part of the ADB's credit terms. Asked what "good management" meant, he spoke only evasively, but did not give a direct reply. The vast numbers of developing Asian countries showed concern and objected to this U.S. advocacy, pointing out justly that when increasing capital on the past three occasions, the ADB has never linked a capital increase with political considerations, and that the ADB therefore should continue to observe these rules. The Chinese representative solemnly pointed out: China supports the ADB's capital increase, but disagrees with linking policy questions with the capital increase. Moreover, it proposes that the ADB should place economic growth in the first place when formulating its credit policy. The practice of some who stubbornly link impertinent matters together will not work under the common struggle of developing Asian countries. However, this once again reminds us that attempts to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries using economic and other issues are worth guarding against. It goes without saying that only the developing countries themselves best understand their national conditions and the importance and urgency of loan items. Over the years, the ADB has made unremitting efforts to improve and upgrade the quality of loan items, and the majority of creditor countries have put forward many rational proposals on loans and have helped improve the quality of loan items. This is welcomed by vast numbers of developing countries. In the ADB's future cooperation, creditor countries should continue to respect debtor countries, rather than do anything contrary to this. If so, the developed and developing countries can cooperate much better in the ADB, which is an important organization. Such cooperation is in the basic interests of all parties.
