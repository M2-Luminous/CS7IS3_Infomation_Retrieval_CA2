After attending the meeting of the Islamic Conference Organization's Bosnia-Herzegovina Contact Group in New York, Cetin returned to Turkey. In a statement he issued at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport on his return, Cetin said Turkey wants a Cyprus solution more than anybody else. Cetin stressed, however, that a solution which will result in reestablishing the pre-1974 hardships is not possible. Indicating that the leaders of the two communities meeting between themselves is a means toward a realistic solution, Cetin stated that on this issue Turkey supports the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and will continue to do so. Cetin further noted that there can be no question of applying pressure regarding this issue.
