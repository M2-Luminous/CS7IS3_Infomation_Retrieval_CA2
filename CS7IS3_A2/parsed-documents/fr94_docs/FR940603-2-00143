FR940603-2-00143 FR940603-2-00088 Citing 49 CFR 172.701, CWTI/NTTC object to the requirement that operators not domiciled in Maryland be certified. This regulation authorizes a State to impose training requirements more strict than HMR requirements only on motor vehicle operators domiciled in that State. They refer to the preamble to the final rule enacting 49 CFR 172.700-.704, 57 FR 20944, 20947 (May 15, 1992), which states that 49 CFR 172.701 reflects RSPA's recognition of the ``traditional regulation by States of their own resident drivers␣*␣*␣*␣through drivers' licensing requirements and procedures.'' CWTI/NTTC appear to argue that RSPA intended to preserve State authority to regulate its own drivers only when that authority is exercised by the State agency traditionally responsible for driver licensing. If section 172.701 is read in this way, CWTI/NTTC imply, it would authorize regulation only by the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration, the agency that issues the CDL, and not by MDE. The CWTI/NTTC application maintains that the Maryland requirements violate both the ``dual compliance'' test and the ``obstacle'' test under 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). The ``dual compliance'' test, CWTI/NTTC assert, is violated in two respects: 1. A driver cannot comply with both the Maryland requirements and 49 CFR 383.21(a), which prohibits a commercial motor vehicle operator from having more than one driver's license at any time. 2. A non-domiciled driver cannot comply with both the Maryland requirements and 49 CFR 172.701(b), which prohibits the application of State training requirements stricter than those of the HMR to non-domiciled drivers. According to CWTI/NTTC, the Maryland requirements also are ``obstacles'' to accomplishing the purposes of the HMR because transporters' burden of complying with paperwork and training requirements of a potentially large number of States, particularly burdens of pre-registering for and attending State-administered tests, would be significant. CWTI/NTTC also suggest that the certification requirements for hazardous waste transporters should be reviewed under 49 CFR 171.3(c), which strictly limits the ability of States to regulate hazardous waste differently than do the HMR. Finally, CWTI/NTTC assert that the Maryland requirements are not ``otherwise authorized by Federal law.'' See 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). B. Comments Supporting Preemption RSPA has received comments supporting preemption of one or both operator certification requirements from ten additional parties, including one oil transporter, one hazardous materials transporter, six hazardous waste transporters, an environmental services firm and the Hazardous Materials Advisory Council (HMAC), an association representing the hazardous materials transportation industry. With respect to Maryland's oil cargo tank operator certification, COMAR 26.10.01.16.D, Amoco Oil Company, Nortru, Inc., Heritage Transport, Inc. and Laidlaw Environmental Services Inc. share the view of CWTI/NTTC that the Maryland requirements duplicate the HMR and the CDL hazardous materials endorsement. Nortru asks how changes in Federal requirements would be incorporated into the substantive requirements of Maryland's certification process. Amoco, Nortru and Heritage Transport emphasize the administrative burden that could result from a determination that Maryland's certification requirements were not preempted. They assert that these burdens, multiplied by the number of States imposing separate requirements, would include paperwork burdens, the difficulty of maintaining a current knowledge of changing State requirements, and lost business opportunities and delays from failing to obtain certifications before entering Maryland. Nortru and HMAC join CWTI/NTTC in citing 49 CFR 172.701(a), which allows a State to impose training requirements more strict than those of the HMR only on drivers domiciled in that State. Regarding Maryland's hazardous waste vehicle operator certification, COMAR 26.13.04.01.F, commenters' arguments mirror those for the oil cargo tank operator certification. Nortru, Environmental Transport, Inc., McCutcheon Enterprises, Inc., Dart Trucking Company, Inc., Heritage Transport, Laidlaw and Custom Environmental Transport, Inc. charge that the certification duplicates the HMR and the CDL hazardous materials endorsement. Nortru, Environmental Transport and Custom Environmental Transport assert that the certification requirement fails to address how changes in Federal requirements will affect the validity of existing certificates, or how such changes are to be incorporated into revised training programs. Nortru, Environmental Transport, McCutcheon, Heritage Transport, Custom Environmental Transport and Eldredge, Inc. claim administrative burdens similar to those claimed for the oil cargo tank operator certification. Nortru and HMAC, again, point to the 49 CFR 172.701(a) prohibition on imposing requirements stricter than the HMR on non-domiciled drivers. HMAC argues that this conflict results in a violation of the dual compliance test. Eldredge and Dart Trucking, concurring with CWTI/NTTC, assert that the 49 CFR 383.21 prohibition against multiple licenses makes dual compliance impossible. C. Comments Opposing Preemption MDE has filed comments opposing preemption of the oil cargo tank operator certification requirement. It takes no position on preemption of the hazardous waste vehicle operator certification requirement.
