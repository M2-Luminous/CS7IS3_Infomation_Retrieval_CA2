I have been called upon to help him in this work. My current role, that of presidential adviser, as I see it is basically a continuation of what I have done as a member of the Presidential Council, that is, to help the president collaborate with other bodies of power. As for my specific steps, in the near future I plan to present to the president my program, my vision of the problems, but so far I would not like to talk about that. As I have said, I see my new role as creating a requisite political atmosphere where relations between the president and the Federal Assembly would be based on information flows coming from both sides. As I mull over why Boris Yeltsin chose me as an aide, although I have far from always "expressed my full approval," I come to the conclusion that the president realizes that he needs to rely on those who put up resistance, who are not afraid to speak up and to defend their views.
