The ground situation also has vastly changed and India has now a clear 2 to 1 superiority over Pakistan. Their state of weaponry is vastly better than that of Pakistan because of their huge indigenisation programme resulting in ready and easy replacements of the old, used up and outdated weaponry and spares, Pakistan's support even in respect of the Kashmir issue is not what it should have been i e the two resolutions presented before the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Commission on human rights violations, had to be withdrawn and deferred. Even the purchased and paid for military equipment in USA has not been made available with the result that military initiatives has passed on to India. The relaxation of Sino-Indian relationship has enabled India to withdraw two more divisions and concentrate against Pakistan. The security environment has, therefore greatly deteriorated. Indian writers are now confident that Pakistan is no longer a military problem in terms of conventional warfare. Ravi Rikhy in his book "The war that never was" has the following remark to make, "Trident (name of a defence exercise) called for an attack on 8th February 1987 at 0430 hours with Skardu as the first objective and Gilgit as the second. The operation was expected to last two weeks, within which time the Northern Areas under Pakistani occupation since 1947-48 would be recovered. If Pakistan chose to keep the conflict limited to Northern Areas, this was fine with India. But suppose pakistan wanted to retaliate and escalate say by attacking Punjab, then "Brass Tacks" which was originally planned as a gigantic strategic deception to focus Pakistan's attention on Sindh while we went for Northern Areas, would have been converted into an actual operation with the aim of reaching Mixpur Khas within three days and Hyderabad City within seven". India has been keeping such contingency plans ready ever since and is in a position to launch them as and when it suited her. Her superiority in numbers and equipment makes it clear that she is quite capable of launching such operations. India may have wrong notions about our defence capabilities and her claim to run over may not be quite as easy as she imagines but what is quite clear is that India is now clearly in a position to take initiatives as and when she likes and we have only the option to react effectively to what India does. This possibility makes us highly vulnerable. What has kept India away from launching such adventures is the fact that according to her, Pakistan has developed the nuclear capacity. Even here India claims 1 to 10 superiority over Pakistan but Pakistan's ability to launch nuclear retaliation according to India is such that she is capable of destroying New Delhi and Tarapur causing immense destruction and crippling India to such and extent that she would be effectively neutralised for years to come. The fact that Pakistan will also be extensively destroyed, is hardly a matter of any satisfaction and will hardly provide India any edge over her. What is worse from India's point of view is that in this respect Pakistan has the initiatives and can launch a nuclear retaliation at her will. In fact, it should be a normal expectation that if operations like Trident or Brass Tacks were launched and Pakistan was squeezed as Indians hoped she would be, she would resort to nuclear warfare and being a weaker nation, may be the first to use it out of insecurity. This is a very real possibility of which the Indian Magazine "India Today" dated 15th February 1994, has referred to. There are three aspects of the nuclear problem which are causing great worry to India. Firstly, that Pakistan has both, the nuclear weapons and the delivery system. How many weapons they have is not to important. They may have six or more but they are capable of inflicting irreparable damage upon india. Secondly, that Pakistan has effectively safeguarded her nuclear arsenal. Kahuta which was vulnerable to Indian attack has been vacated. The present nuclear storage facility is located at Chagai in Balochistan and is in a ready state for the pilots to take off before Indians could attempt to destroy them. Thirdly, Pakistan is building another 70 megawatt reactor at a secret location along the Indus. According to Indians, by 1992 half of the construction and assembly work had been completed. Indian military experts believe that the programme when completed could yield bombs that would counterbalance India's vastly superior conventional force. The above facts indicate that even if the Indian claims to their conventional military superiority are to be believed they fear they have been effectively neutralised by the emergences of Pakistan's nuclear capability, India has no effective answer to this new phenomenon. The fact is that whatever Indians may allege, the programme is peaceful but it poses a threat to India because they visualise it the same way as their own nuclear programme which they claim to be peaceful. The only option open to India is roll back our entire programme and they are working towards that end. USA is being cultivated and Indians have apparently made some headway. There are clear indications that the programme has been frozen and as such a very effective weapon in the hands of Pakistan is being blunted due to the intervention of our erstwhile friend USA. This is being done in addition to a ban being put on the release of military weapons even where we had paid for them. This is a very unenviable position which makes us highly vulnerable and places India in a position to take initiatives which Pakistan may have no ability to effectively counter. As far as our friend USA is concerned whose policies are now weakening our defence capability, we cannot rely on them in moments of crisis and war. Our own experience leads us to that. Where do we go from here? This is what DCC is apparently meeting to consider. How do we meet this challenge? Our approach should be two fold. Firstly we should tell our friends that our security has to be ensured. This would be in American interest also as we have always been their most allied ally. Verbal or even written undertakings as to our security will not be enough because they have not helped us in the past. What we need is that out defence capability be-built up to a point where we are able to defend ourselves effectively against India. Secondly, we have to realise that our real assets are those people who have helped attain the present nuclear capability. They have to be looked after and duly safeguarded. They should not be allowed to be neutralised. Their abilities should be utilised on research and on further development of nuclear potential for peace, So long as these people are there we cannot be betrayed even if our political leadership sucumbs to pressures, our nuclear experts are quite capable of giving what we need during the war and in moments of crisis. So let them work on peaceful nuclear projects. There is no reason why we should not follow Indian example in this respect who continue to claim that their programme is strictly peaceful and as innocent and non-violent as Buddha. Let us also continue with our peaceful and non-violent nuclear programme. Our electricity requirements alone justify such continuation and in fact, further advancement of our nuclear programme. We should, however, make one thing clear to the rest of the world i e that our nuclear programme is far more peaceful and non-violent than the Indian programme.
