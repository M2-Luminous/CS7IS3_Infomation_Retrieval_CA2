The evil ayatollahs in Tehran had been eagerly awaiting any opportunity to take revenge on Iraq and its historic leadership for their miserable defeat in the second Iraq-Iran War. [passage omitted] What tempted the Iranian rulers to blindly pursue their evil delusions and mean intentions was the Iraqi Army's preoccupation with the potential invasion by the allied forces. Thus, the Iranian role was to stab the Iraqi fighters in the back in a premeditated act that was motivated by hypocrisy and misguided policies. It was an act carrying all the meanings of treachery, hatred, meanness, and cowardice, displaying a complete lack of morals or honorable values. [passage omitted] In order to conceal their collusion with Washington, the Tehran rulers resorted to their known methods of maneuvering and cheating. They pursued a strange line showing a contradiction between the policies and stands announced over the media -- which appeared neutral and opposed to the U.S. and Western military buildup and military aggression on Iraq -- and the actual practices and stands of those rulers -- which in substance and results harmed Iraq, especially its policies and stands, and cast aspersions about its historic leadership. The timing of the Iranian role was important. The ayatollahs' deceptive role was to express verbal opposition to the U.S. military aggression against Iraq and at the same time turn the Iranian media into an active supporter for the propaganda and psychological warfare against Iraq and its people by casting doubts by devious means about Iraq's policy and the soundness and correctness of the stands of its historic leadership. The general tone of the Iranian media during the aggression was inciteful at times and subtle at others. [passage omitted] Following Iraq's final victory by tearing up the chapter of treachery and treason in record time, which caused the enemies to lose their senses and balance, and the introduction of measures marked by a high degree of national responsibility, wisdom, and ability, the march of steadfastness and challenge in our country proceeded with vigor. More opportunities were given to pool the Iraqi people's inventive and creative resources for the counter-offensive of reconstructing what the aggressors had destroyed, for rebuilding life in Iraq, and for moving to the new phase of steadfastness and resistance against the blockade and the conspiratorial plans.
