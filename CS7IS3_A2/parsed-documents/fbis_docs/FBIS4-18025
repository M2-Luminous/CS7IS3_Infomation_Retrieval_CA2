And the tanks firing on the parliament building, Russian officers firing on Russian deputies, are still before many people's eyes. Yearning for civil peace and a normal, calm life in society is undoubtedly growing. That is why April's main domestic political event was the discussion of the "treaty on social accord" proposed in the president's name. From the formal legal viewpoint the draft clearly does not stand up to criticism. Primarily what is disputed is the proposed "signatories" -- those acceding to the agreement. Of course if they want to political parties and social and religious organizations and trade unions can take part in this matter if they want.... But the state? What its role is is unclear. If the proposed agreement reiterates the Constitution then there is no need for it. There is still less need for it if it goes beyond the framework of the Constitution. Let me be frank. I have never been a supporter of the former constitution, which was not democratic enough. Still less am I a supporter of the present, entirely authoritarian constitution. The history of all kinds of unconstitutional agreements did not begin today and should seemingly have taught us something. An imperfect law is better than any lawlessness. If the Federation COuncil and the State Duma want to express their support for civil peace, then let them adopt the relevant appeal to the Russian peoples, political movements, religions, and organs of power, including the president himself. The facts make us doubt how seriously the authors of the proposed agreement on accord are treating not only the Constitution but also the agreement itself. Let me remind you that article 5 of the Constitution stipulates the equality of the components of the Federation as regards the federal organs of power. The proposed draft agreement proposes a moratorium on the conclusion of bilateral treaties on the demarcation of powers between these organs and components. But what is actually happening? At the same time a treaty is being successfully concluded between the Russian Federation and Tatarstan and the preparation of a similar treaty with Chechnya is being announced. The assessment of their expediency is a separate issue. But the talks run counter to the Constitution and the draft agreement. That is a medical fact, as they say. And will the agreement's initiators punish themselves for violating it? And now? On the social plane the document also gives rise to doubts. Some agreement is being proposed "for everyone's attention." The need to base it only on mutual concessions is perfectly obvious. But the draft contains no real steps to meet the demands of the "dissenters." For instance, trade unions are given the duty of renouncing the organization of strikes connected with the redistribution of budget funds. It would seem that they might expect in response a promise to step up social guarantees for hired workers. Nothing of the kind! The president and government are "tossing" into the Duma a draft budget which can only be assessed as antisocial, anti-education, and anticulture. At a joint session of the State Duma and Federation Council committees studying questions of education, science, and culture, in my presence it was decided to vote against the draft budget. And how could they do otherwise? The president is not fulfilling his own edict no. 1. The government is not fulfilling the president's edict and the Russian Federation legislation on education and culture. My conscience does not permit me to urge my colleagues who are workers in education to abandon the struggle for their legitimate demands by all legal means. The signing of the agreement for the trade unions is tantamount to political suicide! A general political assessment should be based on the feasibility or otherwise of the practical embodiment of the idea involved. And so the country has been presented not with a declaration on the mutual accord of the political forces but with a protocol on universal agreement with the president! Instead of uniting the country is now split into two camps: those who agree with accord and those who do not. I do not rule out the possibility that after the agreement has been signed there will be a persecution of the "dissenters." "Penalties" are already envisaged for them in the document. If the president's side is really thinking of civil peace and not of propaganda campaigns it should suggest to the opposition real countersteps: a new course in the economy, a government of national trust in politics. Otherwise the draft is a noose. The opposition should use it to tie its own hands, leaving its opponents complete freedom of maneuver. Without a new economic course and a government of national trust a pact on civil accord in Russia is either another Utopian idea or a trap for all those who disagree with their country's destruction.
