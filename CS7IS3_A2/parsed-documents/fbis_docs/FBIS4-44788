So with this in mind, the Committee members decided on April 26 to adopt a report by Christian Rovsing (EPP, DK), calling on the European Commission to prepare wide-ranging proposals on how to promote the competitiveness of Europe's space industry. The Committee first of all wants the Commission to improve its cooperation with the European Space Agency and other relevant European bodies. But more than this, the Committee members are making a plea for the Union to develop a full-blooded policy on space matters and so the Commission is urged to table proposals aimed at promoting European space technology applications and markets. MEPs are all in favor of defining a satellite navigation strategy to make sure the European industry makes its mark in the satellite technology sector. On the research front, Euro-MPs believe in giving encouragement to European laboratories to get involved in developing space experiments, promoting training in space technology at EU level and making arrangements for the telecommunications dimension of the space policy to be mirrored in the EU's telecommunications policy. As for external policy, MEPs want multilateral rules to be adopted so as to ensure that all is fair and above board when it comes to providing space launch and transport services. This report should be examined by the European Parliament on May 6.
