FBIS4-53038 "dreas095__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-095-A Daily Report 9 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Agency To Revise Nuclear Fuel Recycling Policy Agency To Revise Nuclear Fuel Recycling Policy OW1305123894 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 9 May 94 Evening Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1305123894 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] On 9 May, the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy [ANRE] under the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] disclosed a plan to drastically revise the current nuclear fuel recycling policy aimed at securing the nation's own energy resources by increasing production of plutonium. The government's plan for a second reprocessing plant to produce plutonimum by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel will be given another review "in or around 2010 as to whether the plant is really needed." As for the enriched uranium plant now under construction in Rokkasho-mura, Aomori Prefecture, ANRE will freeze its second expansion plan which envisages producing 1,500 tons of enriched uranium per year beginning in 2000. By revising Japan's longstanding nuclear policy toward containing production and minimizing the amount of plutonium in stock, ANRE wants to show people at home and abroad that Japan will use plutonium only for peaceful purposes. The ANRE will formally announce the policy revision after the Atomic Energy Division of the General Advisory Committee for Energy, an advisory panel to the MITI minister, makes a recommendation on the revision in its interim report to be compiled in June. The government's Atomic Energy Commission will then incorporate the revision into a new long-term atomic power program to be worked out this summer. The ANRE decision on the revision stems from the realization that, with the world crying for a need to put a stop to nuclear proliferation as a result of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program, it is difficult for Japan to obtain understanding at home and abroad on its nuclear policy, however hard the government may insist that it is strictly for peaceful purposes. Another reason is that the uranium supply is large enough to last until about 2020 or 2030. The agency has also taken into consideration the fact that the United States and Europe are reviewing their own nuclear fuel recycling policies. However, as Japan is heavily dependent on energy resources from overseas, its basic nuclear fuel recycling policy will be maintained from the viewpoint of securing the nation's own energy resources. As such, as far as a reprocessing plant for spent nuclear fuel is concerned, ongoing construction of the first plant (that can reprocess 800 tons of spent nuclear fuel a year) in Rukkasho-mura will be completed in 2000. But construction of a fast breeder reactor for demonstration purpose will be delayed from the late 1990's to the early 2000's. The agency wants to dispel apprehensions about nuclear proliferation by reducing the amount of plutonium in stock. It will seek to reduce the volume of plutonium by burning it, for instance, by adopting the plutonium thermal system in the light-water reactors. It thus wants to set an international example in making peaceful use of nuclear power.
