Potapov believes that "revolutionary romanticism, liberalism and monetarism should give way to the processes of state regulation during the transition to a market economy, while personnel changes in the government should correct the course of economic reform to bring it in line with the existing monopolised economy." He stressed that "pragmatists in the new government can find specialists who will be able to move reforms from `the worst to the best' and expand the social basis of reform." At the same time, he pointed to the importance of the constructive opposition to the government on the part of "supporters of radical economic approaches who have resigned."
