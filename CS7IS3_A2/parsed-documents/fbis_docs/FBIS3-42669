Their interaction with Russian authorities on production sharing terms now gets a legal base. At the same time, the Ministry of Fuels and Power Generation, in whose bowels the edict had been drafted, was swamped with inquiries. The ministry's first reaction to this avalanche of questions were clarifications made yesterday by the leaders of the group that drafted the edict--Gennadiy Shalmanov, chief of the main combined administration for legislative and legal-normative support, and Professor Aleksandr Perchik. Until now, in the environment of legal uncertainty Western companies by necessity practiced the method of "sequential approximation," signing protocols of intentions and reaching agreements with the authorities of the federal and regional level. When it came to concrete decisions of project implementation, however, it would turn out that they either were in conflict with various instructions or were not envisaged by legislation. The decree liquidates many blank spots and, according to Aleksandr Perchik, "is worth a law." First, the notion of "production sharing" becomes legitimized. Second, the parties that have a right to participate in an agreement are clearly defined. Investors are not limited to legal entities--a group of subjects without setting up a legal entity now falls under the definition. The point in question is legalization of consortiums that have already de facto emerged in Russia--in particular, when Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2 tenders were conducted--but in legal terms lived a precarious existence. Third, it is specified that the state may participate in the agreement either as itself or as represented by a state company that is carrying out appropriate instructions--such a company may participate directly in the project implementation. Of keenest interest to foreign investors are the issues of taxation and regulation of export of the share of the output due them. The decree substantially reduces the number of taxes the investors will have to pay. There are only two now: the tax on profit and a fee for mineral resource use, which, in the opinion of the authors, will permit the circumstances of every deposit's development to be treated in a flexible manner. In the event that the deposit is rather difficult, the production sharing agreement may specify terms that will ensure that a foreign investor will get an adequate return, which will remove the need to beg for additional preferences. In addition, the imported equipment brought in for the project implementation is exempted from the value-added tax and customs duties. Raw materials that constitute a foreign investor's share by the terms of agreement may be exported "in keeping with procedures set for export of home-produced output." This means that exporting them does not require quotas and licenses. At the same time, these procedures do not relieve exporters of strategic materials (a joint enterprise or a foreign company) of the requirement to register with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, which undoubtedly reduces the attractiveness of production sharing agreements for foreign investors. The future of the edict is not entirely clear. In any event, it will be submitted to the Federal Assembly for approval and most likely will indeed be approved. It is possible, however, that the deputies will then decide to revive the consideration of the draft law "On Concessions and Other Agreements Entered With Foreign Investors," which also includes regulation of production sharing relations--especially considering that this draft law had been adopted by the Supreme Soviet in the second reading but was not signed by the president because of the exacerbation of the political situation in the country. The edict's weak point is that it bypasses the issue of the regions' powers in attracting foreign investors into cooperative ventures on production sharing terms. The edict assumes that the current process of property division between the Federation and its components will be completed without conflicts. Meanwhile, the draft law contained a rather precisely defined mechanism for division of powers, which the lawmakers can easily resurrect. Besides, it envisaged the possibility of exempting foreign investors who are parties to production sharing agreements from the requirement to register as special exporters. It is quite possible, however, that this norm may be dropped from the final version of the law. [Box, p 2] The Edict `Issues of Production Sharing Agreements in the Utilization of Natural Resources' --retains the requirement to obtain a mineral resource use license --legalizes consortiums as a form for a group of investors to join together without forming a legal entity --permits exports of mineral raw materials that become the property of the investor as home-produced by the investor --exempts imports of producer goods within the boundaries of the implementation of a production sharing agreement from import duties and the value-added tax --leaves capital assets newly created in the course of project implementation in the ownership of the investor unless specified otherwise in the agreement --keeps the provisions of a production sharing agreement in effect for the entire term of the agreement regardless of whether Russia adopts legislative norms that may have a detrimental effect on the commercial results of the investor's activities under the production sharing agreement
