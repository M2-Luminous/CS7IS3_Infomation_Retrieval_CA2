The government has demarcated fewer areas than in 1991 and 1992, over 80 percent of the lands already confirmed are still being invaded by lumbermen, prospectors, and ranchers, and violence is on the rise. The massacre of the Ianomamis in Roraima increased the number of murders to almost twice the total recorded during the past three years. Suicide among Guaranis is continuing. The new statute has not been approved, and the rights guaranteed by the 1988 Constitution may be undermined by revision. It is an alarming picture, and it is made worse by the authorities' lack of commitment to solving such serious problems as the complete lack of health care for the Indian communities. Malaria and tuberculosis, Hansen's disease, and other illnesses are affecting the Ianomamis, whooping cough is claiming new victims among the Uru-eu-uau-uaus in Rondonia, and even influenza and measles are not under control because there is a complete absence of health workers and medicines in the area. Transferring responsibility for medical care to the Ministry of Health has resulted in chaos. Not because Funai [National Indian Foundation] was able to handle things adequately, but because the ministry, even though it has funds for providing the Indians with health care, has been unable to implement actions to provide the villages with the things planned during exhaustive meetings on the Esplanade of Ministries. After two long years of quarreling over health care for Brazil's Indians, Funai and the Ministry of Health decided to meet during a seminar at CNTI [National Confederation of Industrial Workers] headquarters in Luziania and discuss long-awaited cooperation. That meeting had the effect of balancing the ministry's need to spend the thousands of real cruzeiros it has set aside with Funai's need to reactivate the village posts, which have deteriorated and, in most cases, been closed completely. That cooperation is to be modeled on the Ianomami Area Health District, the only unit that the ministry has managed to begin operating reasonably well in recent years. Quarrels--As though the needs of the Indian communities--needs created precisely by the government's assistance policy--were not enough, quarrels over possession of the land on which they live or from where they have been expelled are making the daily life of many tribes a real hell. That is the case, for instance, with the Caiova Guaranis in Mato Grosso do Sul, who are in permanent conflict with the ranchers who have settled on their land. The Indians have been driven from their villages, and although their land has been demarcated, they cannot enter it. Judge Suzana de Camargo Gomes in Campo Grande recently handed down a decision unfavorable to the Indians. It invalidated the president of the republic's directives and recognized the ranchers' right of possession as legitimate. The Indians are threatening to invade the area and die for their land. In Roraima, where encouragement from Roraima society and Governor Ottomar de Souza Pinto in particular has been justifying incursions by prospectors into Indian areas, the conflicts in Ianomami territory culminated in the massacre of 17 Indians, including women and children, in August. In the opinion of Francisco Loebens, secretary of Cimi [Native Missionary Council], that massacre was merely the continuation of the extermination process being imposed on the Ianomamis, who are perhaps the only group in the country to show a declining population curve. Also in Roraima, the Macuxi and Ingarico tribes, which live in the Raposa/Serra do Sol area, are being forced to coexist with the thousands of prospectors who have left Ianomami territory to settle along the rivers in the extreme northeastern part of the state. The Raposa/Serra do Sol area is one of the two major areas which the Brazilian Government failed to demarcate this year, the reason being pressure from politicians in the North Region and from the military. The other area was the Upper Negro River area in the Amazon Region, which is also a border region. That area has been chopped up like the Ianomami area. Under the Sarney administration, as attorney Juliana Santilli of Cimi pointed out, the area had been divided into islands. Half the area that had been taken away was restored this year, but it has not been demarcated. Demarcation the Big Battle The Upper Negro River area was ready to be demarcated, but the Ministry of Justice felt that in order to continue the process, previous decrees would have to be revoked. The military felt that demarcation along the border presented a danger to sovereignty. Everything came to a halt. In Bahia, the Ha-Ha-Ha Pataxo Indians in Paul-Brasil have been struggling for decades to recover their lands, which are currently occupied by ranchers. They recently invaded three of the ranches in their territory and took hostages. The Military Police moved in, broke up the operation, and removed the 800 Indians from the properties. The Indians do not have access to the river that runs through the area, and the local municipal government has stopped supplying them with water by water truck. In southern Para, the exploitation of mahogany and other valuable species is jeopardizing vast Indian areas. The same thing is happening in Rondonia, where the leaders themselves participate in illegal deals and agreements. Besides harming the environment, that exploitation is causing a serious social problem by causing by breaking up the communities. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Situation With Indian Lands | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Description |Number |Hectares | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total Indian Lands |532 |90,970,570 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Demarcated |266 |46,239,481 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |To be demarcated |266 |44,731,089 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |To be identified |135 |- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Needing revision |72 |- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Confirmed |198 |44,049,794 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: Directorate of Land Affairs, Funai (4 November 1993). | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The above figures show that Indian lands constitute 11 percent of the nation-| |al territory.

In Amazonas State alone, the Indians have 31 rank-and-file representative bodies, among them the Coordination Board for Indian Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon Region (COIAB) in Manaus and the Federation of Negro River Indian Organizations (FOIRN) in Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira. In the course of this year, they have held two major congresses in Brasilia and established the National Forum for the Defense of Indian Rights, which operates at Brasilia University (UnB) with the immediate objective of forcing the demarcation of Indian lands. The union of those groups has resulted in more political debate and considerable progress in the struggle for autonomy. Many communities have started a struggle to recover their lands and even to demarcate those lands themselves. The Capaputo Indians in Alagoas have recovered areas which belonged to them traditionally and legally. The same thing has happened with the Bracui Guaranis in Rio de Janeiro and the Ha-Ha-Ha Pataxos in Bahia. In the South, the Caingangs were able, partly by force, to demarcate their lands in an area being used for agrarian reform. The Jaguapires are continuing to confront the ranchers in an attempt to get back their lands in Mato Grosso do Sul. In Amazonas, the Culinas are also continuing to demarcate their own areas, which are in dispute between them and the owners of rubber plantations. But in addition to demarcating their land, the Culinas are evicting the rubber plantation owners in a peaceful atmosphere and also seeking ways to survive in a delimited area. The problem is that culturally, the Culinas move about a great deal, and now they need to plan ways to ensure their subsistence in a restricted territory. Brazil Establishes Commission In Brazil, where the Indian question is arousing the concern and interest of organizations all over the world, the International Year of the Indian could not possibly have slipped by peaceably. Although it took four months to wake up to that fact, the Brazilian Government was eager to free itself any major guilt, so in April it issued a decree establishing the Commission on the International Year of Native Peoples. The commission consisted of representatives of the Ministries of Justice (Funai), Foreign Affairs, Education and Sports, Health, and Environment. But at the commission's first meetings, which were held at Funai headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said firmly that it would not accept the terminology "Native Peoples" in the name of the commission: the expression should be "Native Populations." Although responsible for coordinating activities related to the international year, the commission did not take a single step forward; it wasted hour after hour quarreling about the name. The quarreling discouraged the other members of the commission, who were surprised at the end of August by another decree from President Itamar changing the commission's name to Commission for the International Year of the Indian. Opinion Still Divided on Guardianship Three proposals for the new Indian Statute were submitted to Congress: one from the Center for Indian Rights [NDI], another from Cimi, and the third also from the NDI. The special committee appointed to debate the bill submitted a substitute bill. The committee spokesman has been replaced, and now the new spokesman, Deputy Luciano Pizzato, after establishing a consensus between Funai, Cimi, and the NDI with the support of the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, will submit the results of the debates to the Indians themselves. The most controversial issue in the new statute is unquestionably that of guardianship. The bill's authors agree that guardianship as it exists amounts to institutionalization and domination. The Indian is regarded as being relatively incompetent, since he is not a full citizen with complete rights. Funai would wind up being more of a protective force--a police body--and give up its social welfare or paternalistic activities. That is what the great majority of Indians want, although some groups such as the Caiapos, the Xavantes, and some of the Caingangs still associate the end of guardianship with the end of protection. Revision--The Indians, nongovernmental organizations, and congressmen involved in the Indian cause in Brazil mobilized to oppose constitutional revision, feeling that the gains provided in the 1988 Constitution might be reversed by the current members of Congress. But revision was approved, and as a result, the move now is to mobilize in favor of retaining the articles dealing with the Indians. According to Deputy Marco Penaforte (PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], Ceara), chances are good that they will be retained in view of the short time remaining. The chapter on Indians and those on the environment and consumer protection have been taken off the constitutional agenda. If the articles are not retained, the next step will be to submit amendments reversing amendments aimed at destroying the rights already gained. There are many such amendments, but some are causing more concern than others, one example being that by Deputy Nicias Ribeiro (PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Para) (Constitutional Amendment No. 133/92), which bans the demarcation of lands in border areas and makes demarcations subject to approval by the National Congress. The hope of the Indian leaders and of organizations defending the environment and the minorities is that as a result of the scandals in the National Congress, constitutional revision will be postponed. It has not made much progress so far despite the efforts of the supporters of constitutional revision. In any case, the way in which it is being proposed means that only a few aspects of the Constitution will be revised. Individual Opinions Rubens Ricupero, minister of environment and the Legal Amazon Region: "The international year dedicated to the Indians should serve to remind us that respecting them, preserving their culture, and giving them dignified living conditions in their traditional environment means respecting ourselves." Dinarte Madeiro, president of Funai: "The greatest gift we could have given the Indians in this international year would have been the demarcation of their lands. Unfortunately, that has not been possible because of the lack of funds. But we cannot blame President Itamar, because this situation has been dragging on for years." Guenter Francisco Loebens, secretary of Cimi: "This year has led to closer coordination among the organizations concerned thanks to the establishment of the Forum for the Defense of Indian Rights. Those organizations have united and cast aside their particular differences in a struggle that has sought to make up for the government's ineffectiveness. The general realization today is that if the government will not do it, we will." Waldir Tobias Macuxi, president of the Council for the Coordination of Native Peoples and Organizations of Brazil: "We Indians are all being used for propaganda purposes both in Brazil and abroad. They use us and invite us to international events, but they do not allow us to talk about the problems we face. Violence is increasing steadily, and the people committing that violence go unpunished." Marco Penaforte, president of the Commission on Environment, Minorities, and Consumer Protection of the Chamber of Deputies: "The International Year of the Indian has not achieved its objectives in Brazil." Juliana Santilli of the Center for Indian Rights (NDI): "There has been a lot of rhetoric, but little has been done. As far as demarcation is concerned, there has been progress, but it is far short of what should have been accomplished. Moreover, the conflicts in various areas are growing worse, and even though half of the Indian territories in Brazil have been demarcated, the Indians have not been given secure possession of their land."
