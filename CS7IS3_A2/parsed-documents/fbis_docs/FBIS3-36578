The crew's working programme for the period from February 5-7 included some astrophysical and medical experiments. The cosmonauts also had to unload the "Progress M-21" cargo vehicle. Several observations of the stellar sky were carried out in accordance with the international "Roentgen" programme to study extra-atmospheric astronomy. A regular cycle of experiments was carried out with the use of the "Maria" magnetic spectrometer. One of their tasks was to determine the possible interconnection between the intensity of the flow of elementary high-energy charged particles of cosmic origin and the seismic activity on our planet. A radio session is expected to take place today afternoon between the crews of the Russian "Mir" space station and the American "Discovery" vehicle.
