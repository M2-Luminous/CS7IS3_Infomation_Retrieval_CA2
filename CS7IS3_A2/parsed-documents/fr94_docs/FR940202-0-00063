FR940202-0-00063 FR940202-0-00006 ยง1.1273&hyph;2 Determination of issue price and issue date. (a) Debt instruments issued for money_ (1) Issue price. If a substantial amount of the debt instruments in an issue is issued for money, the issue price of each debt instrument in the issue is the first price at which a substantial amount of the debt instruments is sold for money. Thus, if an issue consists of a single debt instrument that is issued for money, the issue price of the debt instrument is the amount paid for the instrument. For example, in the case of a debt instrument evidencing a loan to a natural person, the issue price of the instrument is the amount loaned. See ยง1.1275&hyph;2(d) for rules regarding Treasury securities. For purposes of this paragraph (a), money includes functional currency and, in certain circumstances, nonfunctional currency. See ยง1.988&hyph;2(b)(2) for circumstances when nonfunctional currency is treated as money rather than as property. (2) Issue date. The issue date of an issue described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is the first settlement date or closing date, whichever is applicable, on which a substantial amount of the debt instruments in the issue is sold for money. (b) Publicly traded debt instruments issued for property_ (1) Issue price. If a substantial amount of the debt instruments in an issue is traded on an established market (within the meaning of paragraph (f) of this section) and the issue is not described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the issue price of each debt instrument in the issue is the fair market value of the debt instrument, determined as of the issue date (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section). (2) Issue date. The issue date of an issue described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is the first date on which a substantial amount of the traded debt instruments in the issue is issued.
