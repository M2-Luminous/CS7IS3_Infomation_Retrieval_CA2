This is a new form of using direct foreign investment. Economic and trade departments in various localities should properly handle examination, approval, and management work. Second, the establishment of corporations issuing special renminbi shares or the issuance of special renminbi shares by existing companies should be regarded as using foreign capital, and economic and trade departments in all localities should examine their contracts and rules according to the state's relevant laws, regulations, and approval procedures for using foreign capital. If any existing foreign-funded enterprises are to be reorganized into corporations, their assets should be reevaluated, and their revised contracts and rules should be examined and approved by the authorities concerned. Third, apart from Shanghai and Shenzhen, the establishment of Sino-foreign corporations should be reported to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation for examination so that they can determine whether they are able to enjoy (or continue to enjoy) the status of foreign-funded enterprises. Certificates will be issued to them if such a status is approved. The corporations should apply for the issuance of special renminbi shares according to the relevant regulations of the State Council and the management regulations of the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities exchanges. Fourth, the establishment of Sino-foreign corporations should be in keeping with China's industrial policy on using foreign capital, and is now limited to industries in which the state encourages and allows foreign investment. No Sino-foreign corporations can be set up in industries in which they are not allowed to do so or where the interim regulations on the operational terms of Sino-foreign joint ventures do not allow them to do so.
