Prof Seftel said he had been authorised to release limited details on Mr Mandela's medical condition. Mr Mandela's "sore throat" had correctly been diagnosed as laryngitis and the laryngitis had responded to treatment. Prof Seftel had seen Mr Mandela about 3PM Monday and also gave him a general examination. The ANC leader was generally "in good physical shape -- particularly taking into account his age and punishing schedule". Mr Mandela had also appeared "very calm" in the face of the violence that broke out in Johannesburg on Monday, the professor said.
