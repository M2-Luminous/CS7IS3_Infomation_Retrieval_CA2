After leaving politics in 1992, Kim devoted himself to forming a "strictly-non-political" foundation while waving aside a cloud of rumors on his return to the political picture. The KDJ (for Kim's initials) Peace Foundation has been in the public eye since Kim first spoke of it last year, not only because of the influence he has in the political world but also because of the list of political, religious, and scholastic bigtimers at home and abroad who willingly took part in the foundation. Foreign advisers are former presidents Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and Corazon Aquino of the Philippines, and former German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Advisers from home are Cardinal Stephen Kim Su-hwan of the Roman Catholic Church, the Ven. So We-hyon, head of the Chokye Order of the Buddhism, the Rev. Kang Won-yong, president of the Institute of Christian Academy, and Yi Tae-yong, president of the Family Law Counseling Institute. The 21-man committee of consultants that will be deeply engaged in foundation activities, include poet Ko Un, Seoul National University President Kim Chong-un, Korea University President Kim Hui-chip, former Korea Broadcasting System General Director So Yong-hun, Yi Se-chung, president of the Korea Association of Lawyers, and former Vice Prime Minister Cho Sun. Among the 10 foreign consultants are Moscow University President Viktor Sadovnichi; Selig Harrison, senior research fellow of the Carnegie Foundation of International Peace; Former U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James Lilley; Harvard University President Edward Baker; Former East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere; Mushakoji Kinhide, chairman of the Japanese Council on International Affairs; and Smiya Mikiyo, an honorary professor at Tokyo University. Directors of the board under Kim's chairmanship are his wife, Yi Hui-ho; Yi Mun-yong, dean of the graduate school of Kyongki University; Choe Yong-kun, a former member of the National Assembly; and Cho Sung-hung, a lawyer. Dr. Cho Yung-hwan, director of the Institute of Far Eastern Affairs, serves as secretary-general of the foundation. Eight young permanent researchers, who include six holders of political science doctorates and one of administration science, were selected after public screening and 18 professors were named non-permanent researchers. The foundation was founded on capital of 3 billion won by selling real estate of Kim's wife and will financially depend on public patronage for future management. As it first official event, the foundation hosts an international seminar on Wednesday on topics of changes of the world order and democratization in Asia, prospects for inter-Korean relations, and assessment and challenge of the future. John Dunn, a professor at Cambridge University; Na Chong-il, a professor of Kyonghee University; and former East German Premier Lothar de Maiziere will speak. On Thursday, at the founding ceremony, Cardinal Kim and Aquino will make the opening speeches, and congratulatory messages from former Presidents Jimmy Carter of the United States and Gorbachev will be read. The foundation, located in a commercial building near Kim's house in Tongkyo-tong, has already agreed on partnership with the Gorbachev Foundation. Gorbachev has promised to preside over a seminar in Seoul and many Asian human rights and democracy leaders are lined up to visit Korea, a foundation spokesman said. Kim is to tour Denmark, Norway and Sweden from Sunday to seek cooperation with peace institutes there.
