FR941117-1-00004 FR941117-1-00001 List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Teledyne Continental Motors: Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;07. Applicability: Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) (formerly Bendix) S&hyph;20, S&hyph;1200, D&hyph;2000, and D&hyph;3000 series magnetos equipped with impulse couplings, installed on but not limited to reciprocating engine powered aircraft manufactured by Beech, Cessna, Mooney, and Piper. Note: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received reports of some confusion as to what is meant by S&hyph;20, S&hyph;1200, D&hyph;2000, and D&hyph;3000 series magnetos as referenced in TCM Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) No. MSB645, dated April 4, 1994, and this airworthiness directive (AD). A typical example is S6RN&hyph;25, where the S designates single type ignition unit (a D designates a dual ignition unit), the 6 designates the number of cylinders, the R designates right hand rotation, the N is the manufacturer designation (this did not change when TCM purchased the Bendix magneto product line), and the number after the dash indicates the series (a&hyph;25 is a S&hyph;20 series magneto while a&hyph;3200 is a D&hyph;3000 series magneto, etc.). Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent magneto failure and subsequent engine failure, accomplish the following: (a) For magnetos with riveted or snap ring impulse coupling assemblies, having less than 450 hours time in service (TIS) since new, or overhaul, or since last inspection, on the effective date of this AD, accomplish the following: (1) Prior to the accumulation of 500 hours TIS since new, or overhaul, or since last inspection, inspect riveted or snap ring impulse coupling assemblies for wear, and replace, if necessary, prior to further flight, with serviceable snap ring impulse coupling assemblies, in accordance with the Detailed Instructions of TCM MSB No. MSB645, dated April 4, 1994, and TCM SB No. 639, dated March 1993. (2) Thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS since the last inspection, inspect riveted or snap ring impulse coupling assemblies for wear, and replace, if necessary, prior to further flight, with serviceable snap ring impulse coupling assemblies, in accordance with the Detailed Instructions of TCM MSB No. MSB645, dated April 4, 1994, and TCM SB No. 639, dated March 1993. (b) For magnetos with riveted or snap ring impulse coupling assemblies, having 450 or more hours TIS since new, or overhaul, or since last inspection, on the effective date of this AD, or an unknown TIS on the effective date of this AD, accomplish the following: (1) Within the next 50 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, inspect riveted or snap ring impulse coupling assemblies for wear, and replace, if necessary, prior to further flight, with serviceable snap ring impulse coupling assemblies in accordance with the Detailed Instructions of TCM MSB No. MSB645, dated April 4, 1994, and TCM SB No. 639, dated March 1993. (2) Thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 500 hours TIS since the last inspection, inspect riveted or snap ring impulse coupling assemblies for wear, and replace, if necessary, prior to further flight, with serviceable snap ring impulse coupling assemblies, in accordance with the Detailed Instruction of TCM MSB No. MSB645, dated April 4, 1994, and TCM SB No. 639, dated March 1993. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive, if any, may be obtained from the Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the aircraft to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Burlington, Massachusetts, on November 9, 1994. James C. Jones, Acting Manager, Engine and Propeller Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
