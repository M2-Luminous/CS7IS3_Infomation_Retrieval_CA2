He is, of course, aware that six reactors already stand idle on the territory of the former Soviet Union, including: - reactor 1 at the Metsamor nuclear power plant, idle since February 25, 1989, and reactor 2, idle since March 18, 1989; - reactor 1 at the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant, idle since August 6, 1984, and reactor 2, idle since August 29, 1990; - reactors 1 and 2 at the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant, idle since September 10, 1981, and September 10, 1989, respectively. - Sixteen other reactor systems, including research reactors as well as critical and subcritical test reactors, are also being shut down. The development of nuclear energy worldwide is closely regulated by the domestic nuclear policies of individual nations and by international law. Russia, however, although it regulates the design, start-up, and operation of its nuclear power plants, has no guidelines for decommissioning them. In a number of cases, this means delays in proceeding with the dismantling of plants that are currently in safe storage. Meanwhile, since 1979, the Commission of the European Community has been assisting the international community in coordinating its efforts to resolve problems associated with decommissioning nuclear power plants. The commission establishes and finances from its general fund five-year research programs geared towards safety issues and protection from radiation during nuclear facility decommissioning. Between 1979 and 1993, the CEC sponsored three programs for a total of 93.8 million European currency units (in December 1993, 1 ECU equaled 1.11 dollars), and 126 program-related contracts were drawn up. Programs administered by the International Atomic Energy Agency have established data bases on handling radioactive wastes and safely transporting radioactive materials. In Japan, the RAN-DEC (Research Association for Nuclear Facility Decommissioning) was founded to study ways to safely dismantle obsolete nuclear facilities. In 1979, the Technical Information Center was established at the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory to provide information on the dismantling and decontamination of nuclear facilities. And what is happening with the four idle reactors we now have in Russia? At the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant, work is being done to complete the radiation survey of the equipment and structures (the work is about 70% complete), to develop experimental technologies for reprocessing radioactive wastes, and to decontaminate and dismantle the equipment. Spent nuclear fuel is completely removed and stored on site due to problems associated with transporting the containers and with the Mayak production association's (Chelyabinsk-65) refusal to take delivery of the fuel. The first and second reactors of the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant, which are uranium-graphite RBMK-type reactors, were shut down because their critical components had reached the end of their rated service life and no longer complied with modern safety standards, and because they are not slated for reconditioning. Beloyarsk-1 was shut down clear back in 1981. All of the fuel assemblies have been completely removed from the reactor. No more than 180 kg of fuel (measured with the gamma method, or 130 kg if the neutron method is used) remains in the form of ``spillage'' scattered throughout the reactor's pressure vessel lining. The reactor power control, active ventilation, and energy conservation systems are still running. Beloyarsk-2 was shut down in September 1989. Removal of the spent fuel assemblies is nearing completion. Emissions of radionuclides into the unit's ventilation system are lower than levels detectable by the original monitoring equipment. The plant's spent-fuel pools hold 4990 spent fuel assemblies in casks designed for ``dry'' storage. Because the seals of some of the containers have lost their integrity, uranium sometimes comes in direct contact with the cooling water, the radioactivity of which has increased 1.6-fold over the last three years. Technical safety requirements for storing spent fuel and handling radioactive wastes are not being observed. Unfortunately, Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy has pretty much left reactor decommissioning up to local authorities, resulting in missed objectives and unfinished work. Moreover, inspections by federal agencies have turned up violations of nuclear power safety practices and procedures, and, as a result, further decommissioning work has been suspended at the Beloyarsk nuclear plant until safe and proper working conditions are restored. Beginning sometime between the years 2000 and 2005, most of the reactors at Russia's nuclear power plants will begin decommissioning, to wit: reactors 1 and 2 at the Kola nuclear power plant; reactors 3 and 4 at Novovoronezh; reactors 1-4 at Bilibino; and reactors 1 and 2 at Leningrad. Regardless of the reasons for decommissioning, it is an inevitable stage in the service life of a nuclear power plant. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate a comprehensive policy for decommissioning nuclear power plants, and this can only be accomplished with a great deal of theoretical and experimental information. The current inability to understand this or move this work forward will only cause additional problems for future generations.
