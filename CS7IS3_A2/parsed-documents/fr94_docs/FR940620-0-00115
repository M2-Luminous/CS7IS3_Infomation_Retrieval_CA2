FR940620-0-00115 FR940620-0-00029 Response. The Board under its ADA mandate is responsible for developing a minimum level of accessibility in the construction and alteration of buildings and facilities, including those of a detention or correctional system. The programs and services of such a system lie beyond the Board's legislative mandate and the scope of these guidelines. This is also true of a system's existing buildings and facilities, except in cases of alteration. As previously noted, the operational aspects of State or local systems, and its existing buildings, are subject to regulations issued by the Department of Justice. See 28 CFR part 35. Consistent with the ADA, the Department of Justice's regulations prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability in a public entity's programs and services but may well afford some of the flexibility and discretion desired by corrections operators in addressing accessibility through operational or programmatic methods. Under its statutory authority, the Board finds that it can only address these concerns with respect to the location of accessible cells in new construction or alterations. The ADA and its legislative history require a level of accessibility in new construction that ensures that the features, elements, and amenities of a facility are available to all, including persons with disabilities, in an integrated setting. Thus, in developing ADAAG, the Board has sought to ensure that various facility elements and spaces are not only accessible, but integral to the overall design. Similar requirements for integration are found in ADAAG requirements pertaining to the dispersion of accessible seating in assembly areas, restaurants and cafeterias and accessible rooms in transient lodging. The restricted environment of detention and correctional facilities may bring into question the concept of an integrated setting with respect to accessibility, but it is an important principle of the ADA. Consequently, the NPRM sought information on various issues critical in determining whether accessible cells should be dispersed throughout a facility. A dispersion requirement was not proposed although the NPRM noted that such a requirement might be included in the final rule. Since issues of safety and security may have bearing on the question of dispersion, the NPRM also asked whether inmates with disabilities are generally at greater risk of violence in the general population than are other inmates. Comment. A majority of comments stated that inmates with disabilities could be at greater risk among the general population, although many admitted to a lack of evidence or documentation to support this. Still, some of these comments argued against any requirement to ``mainstream'' inmates with disabilities into the general population. On the other hand, a significant number of comments, many from State corrections officials, stated that inmates with disabilities are not considered to be less safe in the prison environment. It was noted that assessing an inmate's degree of safety depends on a variety of factors and should not be based solely on disability. The NPRM also asked whether inmates with disabilities present less of a security risk. A majority of the responses felt that inmates could not be considered less of a security risk based solely on their physical condition or level of disability. Assessing the potential threat to security, posed by inmates, must take into account other factors, such as their personality and criminal history. Furthermore, some correctional authorities noted that inmates with disabilities may present more of a threat to security since mobility aids may be used as weapons or to hide contraband. A comment from the California Department of Corrections (CDC), is representative of many comments on safety and security risks: The CDC finds that disabled inmates are not necessarily at a greater risk. However, dependent upon their degree and type of disability a security or safety problem could exist which places them in jeopardy .␣.␣. The Department has not found that disabled inmates, as a whole, can be considered to be less of a security risk. Rather, the degree of an individual inmate's security risk must be determined by classification on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the inmate's criminal history, commitment offense, individual case factors, medical/psychological history and overall institutional behavior. Disabled inmates, although they may appear to be less of a security risk, have assaulted staff and other inmates. Response. It is clear from comments that generalizations regarding risk factors associated with inmates with disabilities cannot be substantiated. Such assumptions do not provide sufficient rationale for fully exempting accessible cells or rooms from any kind of dispersion. Comment. In addition to questions regarding safety and security risks, the NPRM asked whether accessible cells should be required to be dispersed among all categories of housing or levels of security. The NPRM further asked whether housing of a certain security level, such as maximum security, should be exempt from a requirement to contain accessible cells. A majority of the responses supported some kind of exception to a requirement for dispersion. Most of these comments, represented by the Illinois Department of Corrections and the 22 States that endorsed its comments, supported an exception that would be applicable to all categories of housing, not just maximum security areas. Several commenters, including the Bureau of Prisons, supported an exception limited to maximum security. Support for an exception was based on the supervision and safety of inmates with disabilities, effective provision of programs and services, security, and cost. The Paralyzed Veterans of America regarded the importance of dispersion of accessible cells as secondary to the safety of inmates. Some corrections officials, as well as several State and local government agencies, local disability groups, and a design professional supported a requirement for accessible cells in all categories or security levels. Since assumptions on an inmate's safety or perceived risk to security cannot be made on disability alone, the California Department of Corrections recommended that accessible cells be required among all categories of housing. Several State correctional agencies in responding to the ASCA survey supported dispersion, including South Dakota which stated that: ``a majority of inmates move to different classification levels over time, which necessitates accessibility at each level,'' and Kansas, which stated that: ``Inmates should be mainstreamed with the general population as much as possible. Once the disabled inmates are released from prison they must interact with the general population in society.'' Some comments supported dispersion with respect to county or local facilities. The California Board of Corrections, which oversees all city and county correctional agencies and facilities, surveyed operators of 11 county systems and found that eight considered accessible cells necessary in all classification categories while three did not.
