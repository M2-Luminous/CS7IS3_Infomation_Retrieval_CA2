Perry and other U.S. brasshats cried that "a war must be imagined", threatening "sanctions" against the DPRK, the paper said. On the 14th of May, Woolsey, director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, at a meeting held in Boston openly argued that the U.S. intelligence agents should be "infiltrated" into the DPRK "in the disguise of forwarding agents or seamen" over the "nuclear issue". U.S. President Clinton in his recent interview with the U.S. CNN TV, taking issue with the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, declared that "a decisive stand" would be taken in the U.S.- led international moves for a solution to it. These facts prove that the United States is bringing the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war, invariably pursuing the policy of stifling the DPRK.
