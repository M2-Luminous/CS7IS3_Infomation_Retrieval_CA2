The program is moderated by Serhiy Omelchuk and the guest is Mikhaylo Umanets, chairman of the State Committee for Nuclear Energy (Derzhkomatom). Mikhaylo Umanets speaks Russian throughout the program. In his introduction, the moderator states that "an economy without power engineering is like a car without an engine." Such an opinion, according to him, can be also expressed with regard to nuclear power engineering. Having stated that the "seemingly most difficult winter" in the history of Ukraine's power engineering has just concluded, the moderator asks Umanets to make some preliminary conclusions "without going into details." Umanets begins with a statement that "one can be satisfied with the results" and says: "We have fully met our obligations to the state by producing 75 billion kilowatt-hours of energy, that is, 3 billion more than in 1992. Energy produced in Ukraine constituted 33 percent [of all energy production]. We have had 12 incidents at various stations, but, fortunately for us, none of them could be rated as an accident on the international scale NS [as heard], which is now being used throughout the world. I think that our radio listeners already know that this system has seven levels. The seventh degree means the worst accident, of the Chernobyl type. The first three levels are related to minor incidents, while the last four, are the nearest to accidents. So, we have not had any accidents. Of those events, eleven were rated at the first level, and only one -- at the second degree. Thus, at first glance, it may seem that we should be satisfied with our results, but, unfortunately, it is not the case. I do not know what your second question will be -- maybe, I will answer it without being asked -- but we are not satisfied with the results, because this winter, in principle, we have totally exhausted our reserves to accomplish what we have done." Asked to comment on how nonpayments for energy supplies affect the nuclear power industry, Umanets states that "we have worked for free over these past seven months, or even longer." The reasons for this, he explains, are twofold: "First, the monetary system is not working, and we have permanent debtors who today owe us 1.8 trillion karbovanetses. Second, the tariffs for electrical energy are not being updated in proper time." By now, Umanets continues, many power units are being shut down due to the "spring and summer repair campaign." "However," he states, "we have neither spare parts nor fuel to make these repairs in due time." According to him, the problems of nuclear power engineering could be solved if all the debts were settled with a "ruble exchange rate of 1:7," which was established by the National Bank according to "calculated production costs." "If this is not going to happen," he says, "it is not excluded that a number of power units will not be ready for winter to keep the energy system going." Further, he states: "This morning I saw that the system had a frequency rating of 49.35 Hz. The system is close to disintegration." The moderator recalls that the Ukrainian-U.S.-Russian trilateral agreement on nuclear disarmament stipulates that Ukraine is to obtain nuclear fuel as compensation for its nuclear warheads. He asks Umanets whether Russia is fulfilling this agreement. Umanets states that the first shipment with nuclear warheads has been dispatched to Russia and says: "As of today, we have not obtained any fuel. For the time being, I am not able to say when we might receive a shipment. An agreement on the procedures and terms for fuel deliveries has not been signed with the Russian side. The United States has not fulfilled its obligations, either; it has not given initial [pervyye oborotnyye] means for this process -- the promised $60 million. During his visit to Ukraine, the U.S. secretary of defense promised that the $60 million would be in Russia within ten days of his return to the United States. However, time goes on, and there is still no money. At my level, I have contacts with the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Power Engineering and Industry, and I know that they have no means with which to pay the factory -- and nowadays the factory will not give its nuclear fuel away for free -- they have no means to pay the factory to have the fuel shipped here. Therefore, the question must still be resolved at very high levels, in any case, at the Cabinet of Ministers level." The moderator goes on to ask Umanets to provide some information on the personnel situation at nuclear power facilities, because "there is a trend of nuclear specialists leaving Ukraine to take jobs in the neighboring state." Umanets says that "much good has been done during this year" in the training of nuclear specialists, in particular, "a full-scale training simulator" was established at the Zaporozhskaya Nuclear Power Plant, and preparations were made to establish such a simulator at the Khmelnitskaya Nuclear Power Plant. "Small-scale simulators," he continues, will be established at the Yuzhnoukrayinska and Rovenskaya plants with French assistance. Ukrainian nuclear specialists, he adds, are being trained in Germany. Next, Umanets states: "This year's outflow of cadres from nuclear plants was a terrible blow to us. There are three reasons for this, and all three of them should be named here: First, the attractiveness of the private sector; this cannot be ignored -- many talented people go there. Second, the disintegration of the Soviet Union -- it is natural that under these circumstances everyone is free to choose his or her fatherland. However, the most prevailing factor is low salaries." Umanets says that his own salary amounts to around $40, while his son-in-law, who is working as an engineer at a nuclear power plant in Lithuania, earns over $300. He adds: "In comparison with Russia, our salaries are six times lower." He also points out that Russia provides nuclear specialists with housing, while Ukraine has problems doing that. Umanets states that "a brain drain has begun" and that "our personnel reserves are almost exhausted, because about 2,500 men left us in 1993." He says that Ukraine has made a move to train its own "national cadres" by opening the faculty of power engineering at the Sevastopol Naval Institute in September 1993, where 72 students have already begun their studies. The moderator proposes to answer some questions from listeners, which have been received during the program. The first question raises doubt whether it is expedient for Ukraine to produce its own nuclear fuel rods, which must currently be supplied by Russia. Umanets states that, by using all of Ukraine's technical and scientific potential to produce rods, "the contribution of nuclear fuel to [energy] production costs can be reduced by a factor of two, from 62 percent to about 30 percent." He also says that all the expenditures to produce Ukraine's own nuclear fuel, according to preliminary estimates, can be earned back in no more than four years. The second question from a listener concerns the disposal of nuclear waste. The moderator adds to this his own questions about the ways to secure the technological processes in the production of Ukraine's nuclear fuel. Umanets begins by saying that "one has to be extremely frank on this issue." He states that there is a need to create a system of nuclear waste disposal in Ukraine. The most important issue, in his opinion, is the disposal of nuclear waste from the Chernobyl disaster; namely, "unit no. 4 at the Chernobyl plant and polluted zones within a 30-km radius." Answering the moderator's question about "the most probable scheme" for storing nuclear waste, Umanets states that "there should be intermediate depositories for 50-60 years, as well as permanent depositories." Emphasizing that this is his personal opinion, Umanets says that intermediate depositories can be located in the 30-km radius around Chernobyl which "can still play a positive role in Ukraine's national economy, namely in dealings with nuclear waste." With regard to permanent depositories, Umanets says that this issue should be examined by geologists. He adds that he prefers to deal with nuclear waste in England, where geologists have found suitable formations for storing nuclear waste. Next, the moderator asks Umanets to report on the implementation of an international project to build a new sarcophagus over unit no. 4 at the Chernobyl plant. Umanets states that there is no such international project. In Kiev, he explains, an international contest was held, which selected six projects; the authors of these projects formed "a consortium" to continue work on the "project's economic feasibility." This consortium, Umanets adds, to get money from "foreign banks" for the implementation of its project, has to win "a tender." Umanets did not rule out the possibility that there will be a special fund created for the Chernobyl plant. Talks toward this end, he adds, are already being conducted "at the presidential level." Asked to specify which countries will participate in the project, Umanets names France, Germany, and Great Britain. He adds that there will be no delay in the building of a new sarcophagus if Ukraine gets the money for it. Asked to comment on the possibility of introducing share capital in Ukraine's nuclear power engineering system, Umanets says that, in his personal opinion, this can be done following the creation of a "nuclear fuel cycle" by Ukraine, the completion of nuclear units, and arrangements for the disposal of nuclear waste. At the end of the program, Umanets states that his committee will try to pass through the new parliament a law on "privileges" for workers living in the 30-km radius around Chernobyl. He also promises that the committee will do everything to put the largest possible number of power units in operation by next winter.
