He acquainted himself with the power supply situation in the country. The visit was linked to the lignite miners' strike, which might lead to cuts in the power supply. "We told the prime minister that we are meeting demands for electricity in full but that we have no reserves and have to open all hard-coal-fired power stations and heat- and power-generating plants," Ireneusz Radzio, KDM deputy manager, told a PAP journalist. According to him, if the lignite-fired power stations work at low capacity, using hard coal as they are today, there should be no problems with energy supplies this coming weekend. "If nothing changes on Monday, some power cuts might be expected," he added.
