FR940323-2-00021 FR940323-2-00013 With regard to petitioners' concerns regarding the inclusion of the U.S. commissions in the ESP cap, our regulations state that where there is a commission paid in one market and none in the other market, we offset the commission with indirect selling expenses incurred in the other market to the extent of the lesser of the commission or the selling expenses ( see 19 CFR 353.56(b), see, also, Antidumping Manual, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Chapter 8, p. 31). Comment 9: Goldstar requests that the Department conform its COS adjustments in the ESP price comparisons to the methodology ordered by the CIT in Timken Co. v. United States, 673 F. Supp. 495 (CIT 1987) ( Timken ) and in a number of other cases. In Timken, the CIT held that, in ESP situations, the COS adjustments for U.S. direct selling expenses should be added to FMV rather than deducted from USP. Department's Position: We disagree with Goldstar. Section 772(e)(2) of the Tariff Act states that ESP sales shall be adjusted by being reduced by the amount of ``expenses generally incurred by or for the account of the exporter in the United States in selling identical or substantially identical merchandise'' (emphasis added). Therefore, we make COS adjustments in ESP comparisons by deducting all selling expenses from ESP, rather than retaining them in ESP and adding the relevant amounts to FMV. The litigation in Timken was withdrawn and there was no conclusive decision in the case. Further, because the issue of deducting direct selling expenses from USP or adding them to FMV is currently on appeal before the CAFC, we have followed our longstanding practice of making COS adjustments in ESP comparisons by deducting all selling expenses from the ESP for these final results. See our positions in the Fifth Review, Comment 33, and Eighth Review, Comment 17. Samwon's Comments Comment 10: Samwon argues that the Department erred by excluding two U.S. sales which occurred outside the POR. Although Samwon acknowledges that, traditionally, the Department uses the sales date as a basis for a review, Samwon notes that the products covered by these sales entered the United States within the POR. Additionally, Samwon points out that it did not participate in the prior (eighth review); thus there is no risk of analyzing certain transactions twice. Petitioners object to the inclusion of sales that fall outside the POR. They point out the Samwon could have participated in the prior review but decided against it. Additionally, petitioners urge the Department to continue its traditional policy of including sales within the POR using the date of sale and not the date of entry. Department's Position: We disagree with Samwon. Samwon voluntarily chose not to participate in the eighth administrative review and, therefore, forfeited the opportunity to have those sales reviewed. Because the use of date of sale, rather than date of entry, as a basis for inclusion in a POR has been the Department's longstanding policy in this case, we have retained this methodology in these final results ( see Color Picture Tubes from Republic of Korea, 52 FR 44186 (Nov. 18, 1987)). Final Results of Review Based on our analysis of comments received, and the correction of certain clerical errors, we have revised our preliminary results. We determine the final margins for the period April 1, 1991, through March 31, 1992, to be: ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/Exporter 1Margin percentage Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd 1.23 Goldstar Electronics Co., Ltd 0.00 Samwon Electronics, Inc 0.53 Cosmos Electronics Manufacturing Korea 16.57 Quantronics Manufacturing Korea, Ltd 13.63 Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd 10.37 Tangkook General Electronics, Inc 16.57 1No shipments; rate from previous review.
