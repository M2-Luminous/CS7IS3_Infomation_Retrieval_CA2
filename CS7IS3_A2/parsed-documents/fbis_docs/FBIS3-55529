Kostikov told a briefing on Monday [10 January] that there are signs that communists are planning to launch attacks on the president and the new Constitution in parliament thus resuming what the former anti-Yeltsin legislature had failed to complete. "Unfortunately, according to information which we possess, there are big fears that some factions, in particular the communists, are getting ready for attacks on the government, the president. We have all grounds to expect that attacks on the new Constitution will be launched", he said. Kostikov called on communist leaders to remember "the bloody trace left by communists and learn lessons from it" while criticising the young Russian democracy and accusing the president of dictatorship. "On the eve of the first session of the State Duma I would like to recall the tragic events connected with the bolshevik history", he said referring, in particular, to the anti-Bolshevik uprising in the fortress of Kronstadt in 1921 which was drowned in blood. On Monday the Russian president decreed to rehabilitate the soldiers and navymen who were executed during and after the anti-Bolshevik uprising. Kostikov said the president wants that cooperation with Duma goes calmly and constructively. "Tomorrow a new page of the Russian democracy begins and we are all interested that this stage of cooperation of the president, the government with the legislature is quiet and constructive", he stressed adding that the executive authority would "keep a close eye on the behaviour" of all parliamentary groups.
