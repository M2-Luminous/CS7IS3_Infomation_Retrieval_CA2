[Pasqua] The recovery has been started. When we came to power, one year ago, the situation which we found was much worse than we had imagined: 350 billion francs [Fr] of budget deficit; Fr100 billion of social security deficit; a pension system on the verge of explosion; and 30,000 jobs being lost each month. We found a France in collapse, threatened by social division. From our government experience in 1986, we had already learned that it takes 18 months for any measure to produce an effect. The economic recovery which we are already detecting today in several sectors will be really noticeable by the end of the year. [PARIS MATCH] Does the revolt which is brewing against the CIP [Job Training Contracts] not condemn the government to refrain from introducing any more reforms? [Pasqua] It is well known that it is when the economy starts to recover that tensions are most acute. The demonstrations by young people could be predicted. They were part of my diagnosis when I toured France's 22 regions to present my regional development plan. I really saw this danger when I saw all those young people unemployed who are entitled to nothing until they are 25. But, above all, we must not stop introducing reforms; instead we should go further and faster. This does not mean that we should not listen to the French people. Consultation is more necessary than ever. It is vital to listen to the people, to meet with them, to ask them their opinion on every questions. In Japan, that is called "wasting your time usefully." [PARIS MATCH] Precisely on the subject of the CIP, has the government made the mistake of communicating badly? [Pasqua] Perhaps there was not enough explanation. But what strikes me most is the trade unions' attitude. I sometimes dream of very strong and powerful trade unions in France, as there are in Germany, with which we could really negotiate without ulterior motives and without archaic attitudes. Although some trade unions have made considerable efforts to change, others are locked in suicidal obstinacy. To give an example: Look at what happened in some big French ports like Marseilles. [PARIS MATCH] What assessment would Pasqua, the teacher, write on the government's school report? "Could do better" or "satisfactory results?" [Pasqua] The government has done as well as it could. Moreover, the French people are under no illusion because, in the canton elections, they have just expressed their confidence in it, which is a way of saying to the others: "Let it do its work." But the government's handicap is that it cannot move more quickly than the country's complex and archaic structures permit. To carry out a reform, it often takes a year. My bill on regional development, which will be presented to Parliament in July during an extraordinary session, will reduce the cumbersome procedures which the state imposes on any reform. Today, you really have to have fierce determination to succeed! [PARIS MATCH] You just have one year left before the presidential election in which to make progress. Is that not too little? [Pasqua] We have even less time left because we must carry out the reforms before the start of the presidential election campaign, which will start on 1 January 1995 at the latest. [PARIS MATCH] In this connection, surely the statements by Francois Leotard and Simone Veil at the end of December, and then those by Patrick Balkany, deputy mayor of Levallois -- one of those close to you -- in favor of Balladur declaring his candidacy early, have already launched major maneuvers? [Pasqua] All these statements, which I deplore, make me fear that we may already have launched into a kind of incredible race! I personally do not want the campaign to start now. Everybody should decide on his candidate at the end of the year. Edouard Balladur does not want this debate to be launched before the end of the year any more than I do. It is not in anybody's interest, not that of Chirac, nor that of Balladur. [PARIS MATCH] Some people claim that you have already chosen the Balladur camp.... [Pasqua] That is impossible! I will tell you why. Quite simply because, for the time being, Balladur is not a candidate. But it is natural that I should be loyal to the head of the government in which, I remind you, I am one of the ministers of state. [PARIS MATCH] Let us put the question differently. What is your judgment of Edouard Balladur and his first year in the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office]? [Pasqua] Edouard Balladur has an essential quality: He is pragmatic. He does not prejudge anything. He is the reverse of an ideologue, but that does not prevent him from having ideas. That suits me. [PARIS MATCH] Do you not think that the majority has had enough and is criticizing him a great deal? [Pasqua] It is natural that the deputies should play their role in the Assembly, even when they complain a little. What is dubious is the criticism made outside Parliament by some of the majority's leaders. [PARIS MATCH] Let us return to the presidential election. Are you still convinced that only primaries will prevent the Right from division? [Pasqua] My approach has not changed. I will do all I can to ensure that my plan for primaries leads to there being a single majority candidate in the first round of the presidential election. In the spirit of the Fifth Republic Constitution, it is not the parties which choose the candidates; it is a man who decides alone and who makes a personal choice in presenting himself to the country. Only then is it the parties who decide to support him. This is the principle which the majority parties have accepted in accepting the system of primaries. [PARIS MATCH] How do you see these primaries? [Pasqua] It is a good thing for there to be several prospective candidates. Within the RPR [Rally for the Republic] and UDF [Union for French Democracy], this would be indicative of the majority's vitality and richness! It should not become its handicap. The advantage of these primaries is that these candidates will not stand against each other but on the same line, agreeing to support the one who emerges. [PARIS MATCH] How will you submit this bill, if there is one? [Pasqua] There are various ways of going about it. The simplest would consist of just reforming the law on the funding of election campaigns, adding to it the funding of primaries to ensure that their funding is not included in the funding of the presidential campaign. [PARIS MATCH] How will you convince all the potential candidates -- Chirac, Barre, Balladur, Giscard, Monory, and others -- to bow to this unaccustomed ritual of primaries? [Pasqua] They will all be so pressured by public opinion, which will not tolerate the idea of a conflict or a division, that they will have no choice. When we were in opposition, all the majority leaders signed an agreement in favor of primaries. I think that their signature is a commitment by each of them. We have succeeded in having a single union candidate in all the elections. That has worked for the parliamentary elections, for the canton elections, and for the European elections. Who would understand it if the majority was divided in the first round of the presidential election? [PARIS MATCH] Will you be a candidate? [Pasqua] There are enough candidates in the majority, I am not doing this for myself! [PARIS MATCH] And yet, your faultless performance in the Interior and Regional Development Ministry would justify your candidacy. Some are thinking about it on your behalf. [Pasqua] When I am in one camp, I am always loyal. I learned this lesson from General de Gaulle and I apply it every day: "The general interest prevails over all private interests." Those who have forgotten this lesson ought to belong to a different political family from mine.
