Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), said co-operation with foreign governments and companies, unfurling offshore as well as onshore, will take more flexible forms. In an interview with Business Weekly, Wang said a wide range of joint ventures is to be forged to tap the country's petroleum resources. Wang revealed that Chinese and international oil firms are working on possible joint ventures in upstream as well as downstream operations. Big projects can be expected to begin immediately once approved by the government, China's oil industry, which annually produces 144 million tons of oil and 16 billion cubic metres of natural gas, has absorbed $15 billion in overseas investment over the past 16 years. Wang is leading a 54-member Chinese delegation to the 14th World Petroleum Congress opening today in Stavanger, Norway. Wang said the oil delegation, the largest the country has ever sent abroad, will promote Chinese views and ideas on overcoming global challenges in energy development. China, which is to host the 15th World Petroleum Congress in Beijing in 1997, expects important information to emerge in Stavanger. The Chinese delegates are to cultivate foreign countries' views on energy development and discover new measures for protecting the environment. "We hope exchanges on a wide range of topics in Norway will help pave the way for greater foreign co-operation," Wang said. He praised China's oil development over the past 15 years, saying foreign co-operation has helped raise operations to a new stage. Chief among the accomplishments are that: --About one-fifth of the country's land has been opened to foreign oil exploration and development. Foreign co-operation started 15 years ago in the country's offshore areas, and was extended onshore last year with the opening of international bidding for exploration in the Tarim desert basin in XinJiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Wang said exploration contracts with foreign firms are being carried out. Encouraged by China's open policies, foreign firms are not only exploring virgin territory but are also enhancing the recovery of oil in existing oilfields. More than 70 foreign oil firms from 15 countries have applied for another round of bidding for onshore operations. Results of the bidding are due within three months. The foreign firms expect to explore 26 blocks and start 11 enhanced-recovery projects. --Co-operative projects in oil refining and petrochemical manufacturing are expected to satisfy the rising demand in China, which anticipates 9 per cent economic growth in the next seven years. --Foreign companies will also work with Chinese on engineering, technical research and equipment manufacturing. Last year, CNPC signed $206 million worth of contracts for engineering and labour services abroad. The volume equalled the total for all of the 1980s. --Preparations for overseas oil operations and financing are under way.
