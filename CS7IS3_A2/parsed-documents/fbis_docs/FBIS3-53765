The Walsh report is expected to be officially published this week. The report levels criticism at Shim'on Peres and Yitzhaq Rabin, who were prime minister and defense minister during the Irangate affair. The Walsh report claims that Israel's Government was involved in law violations by U.S. Administration officials. In its reaction, Israel will announce that when the affair first started, in 1985, the Israeli Government acts followed the assumption that the arms deals with Iran were carried out with the knowledge and approval of the senior U.S. political echelons. The Israeli reaction will say that all of the government actions were taken in accordance with Israeli law, and that according to it, the acts were legal because the Israeli Government had assumed that the U.S. elements involved in the affair had the authority and approval required. The Israeli reaction, drafted by (reserves) Major General Refa'el Vardi, special adviser to the prime minister and defense minister, will also include a legal reference to the U.S. prosecutor's claims and will address the claims which the Walsh report details. Apparently, the Americans will allow Israeli civilians mentioned in the report -- such as Ya'aqov Nimrodi, Al Schwimmer, and David Kimche -- to respond to claims against them in the Walsh report. Jerusalem sources said over the weekend that "Prosecutor Walsh has totally failed in his attempt to turn Irangate, an affair which caused a public and political storm in the United States, into a criminal affair. "They failed to press charges against most of the Americans involved in the affair, and even Colonel Oliver North, who was put on trial, was eventually acquitted." According to the sources, "this is a distant and old story. The United States is tired of it, and the report is an artificial attempt by Walsh to revive it." The prime minister's bureau said in response to the reports about the Walsh report that it has not yet been published, therefore the bureau will not refer to its content or consequences at this stage.
