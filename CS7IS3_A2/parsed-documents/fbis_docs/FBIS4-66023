Our London correspondent, Brian O'Connell, asked the taoiseach for his reaction to [Sinn Fein President] Mr. Adams' remarks: [Begin recording] [Reynolds] Well, I hope it turns out to be a genuine and a positive response to the situation as it is in the post-clarification era. At the end of the day, as far as both governments are concerned, what we want to hear from both sets of paramilitaries is a cessation of violence so that the talks process can get under way. [O'Connell] Should he not, though, make a decision now? Why wait until after the European elections? What would be the delay? [Reynolds] Well, I don't mind the delay. I don't mind a couple of weeks or a month, or whatever, as long as there is no more loss of life in the meantime. And I think the message I want to give to both sets of paramilitaries is that there is no vestige of justification for the taking of one more, single life. Can we stop the violence now and whatever period that people want to discuss and debate between themselves, that's fine. What we want from the paramilitaries is a cessation of violence to respond to the will and the wishes of the vast majority of the Irish and the British people, so that the talks process can get under way. That is the only sensible way in which these complex problems can be addressed and be settled in the end of the day. [O'Connell] On the three-stranded talks process, your government and the British Government are in the process of putting together a framework or a blueprint or a document to try and get the parties around the table together. When can we expect that to be finalized? [Reynolds] Well, it's always difficult to judge those things and they're always difficult documents to put together, but the ground rules have been set by the Downing Street Declaration, and it's a question of building on those ground rules to produce a framework document. We will certainly be doing our best to try and get it ready by the end of June or there abouts. [O'Connell] There is still very little chance, though, of the unionists coming on board in any renewed three-stranded process. [Reynolds] Well, I think they have a responsibility to their own community -- and indeed to the community at large -- to take a very responsible and a leadership line in this, and to point out to the paramilitaries that it's futile to continue taking loss of life, that this tit-for-tat vicious sectarian murder has to stop. Why not stop it now? I would hope that the community leaders and the political leaders in all the communities in the north of Ireland take that same line and try and impress upon the men of violence to stop now and let the people's problems be solved around the table.
