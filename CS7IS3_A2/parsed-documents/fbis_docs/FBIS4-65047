The UN Security Council is meeting again in the middle of May to discuss Iraq. What is the IAEA position toward Iraq? ['Aziz] We have satisfactory, normal relations with the IAEA. The IAEA has noted the major progress we have achieved in fulfilling the conditions, and we want this information to be conveyed to New York. [Harrer] The last time the Council met, in the middle of March, it voted against the lifting of the sanctions vis-a-vis Iraq. ['Aziz] If a free, secret vote were to be held, the majority of the Council would vote for the lifting, or at least a relaxation, of the sanctions. Even in March, some Council members were in favor of issuing a public statement recognizing Iraq's progress. The U.S. side opposed the idea. But, for the first time, the Council failed to adopt a statement against the lifting of the sanctions because a consensus was not reached on this matter. That says a lot. [Harrer] Are you optimistic this time? ['Aziz] It is the Council's credibility that is at stake. The Council adopted resolutions that were formulated in clear language. Iraq has fulfilled these resolutions. If certain Council members choose to ignore this fact -- and this has been documented not by Iraq, but by UN bodies -- they are undermining the credibility of the Council itself and its resolutions. Most countries, including Austria, merely want Iraq to fulfill the resolutions that were adopted in connection with Kuwait -- nothing more and nothing less. However, when other things are suddenly brought into play, such as a unilateral U.S. policy vis-a-vis Iraq, and the United States attempts to impose its unilateral wishes on the Council, the Council's image is bound to suffer. [Harrer] How much progress has been achieved in installing control systems inside Iraqi armaments plants? ['Aziz] Things are moving quickly, and we are doing what is necessary in this connection. UN special envoy Rolf Ekeus confirmed this in his report at the end of April. [Harrer] Apart from France and China, Russia also spoke out in favor of Iraq at the March Security Council meeting. What are your relations with Russia like, and is there any truth to the rumors that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy supports the Iraqi Ba'ath Party? ['Aziz] Our relations are good. Russia has great economic interests in Iraq. Zhirinovskiy visited Iraq in 1992 and expressed support for our standpoint. But we do not imagine we can influence Russian domestic policy, and we certainly have no money to support other parties. Zhirinovskiy invited a Ba'ath delegation to his party's latest congress, but the Iraqis also used this opportunity to talk to all other parties with the exception of Russia's Choice, as well as holding talks at the Russian Foreign Ministry. [Harrer] What are moods like in Iraq after four years of sanctions? Is a radicalization of the population to be feared? What about the opinions that Iraq's claim to Kuwait is by no means a closed chapter? ['Aziz] The Iraqi population is suffering much hardship because of the sanctions, but we are an ancient civilization, and we will survive. You will hardly find anyone who says he hates the American people. For the government, the Kuwait issue is finished, but one cannot stop people from thinking whatever they want to think. One cannot erase historical facts either. But the Iraqis support the government and know that what the government is doing -- for example, implementing the resolutions in order to permit the lifting of the sanctions, is good for the country. I think frustration is the cause of such opinions concerning the Kuwait issue. People see Iraq doing everything the United Nations wants, but this does nothing to help them, and their situation gets even worse. But this has nothing do with the government's stance. [Harrer] What is Baghdad's relationship with the Kurdish leaders Talabani and Barzani? ['Aziz] In 1991, they spent several months in Baghdad, and one reached a consensus with them concerning the extent and form of autonomy, Kurdish involvement in the central government, elections, and so on. Barzani told us later that no sooner had he and Talabani returned to northern Iraq when they were summoned to Washington. Talabani went, but Barzani did not. In Washington, Talabani was told: "Are you crazy supporting Saddam Husayn's government when we want to topple it?" That was the end for the time being. The Kurds are not free to decide.
