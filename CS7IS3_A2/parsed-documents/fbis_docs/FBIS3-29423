The source well versed with North Korea's internal affairs said this is why he has been staying away from various recent public gatherings designed to mark his 52nd birthday on Feb. 16, one of major North Korean national holidays. The junior Kim is known to have been managing day-to-day state affairs on behalf of his aging father for years. "It has been learned that the senior Kim reprimanded his son for engineering Pyongyang's nuclear policy in a hardline direction, a policy which has made North Korea's position very difficult," the source said. As Kim Il-song has lately been raising his voice in major policies and as nuclear talks with the United States were progressing, Kim Chong-il voluntarily chose to be on his good behavior, the source said. He was quick to add, however, that this does not mean that Kim Chong-il's position as the future ruler has been shaken. The junior Kim enjoys a broad power base built elaborately in the party, administration and military, the source said. Yet, he said, it is true that moderate people with Kim Il-song in the center, who advocate the resolution of the nuclear question through negotiations, are rising fast in North Korea today. The source also showed skepticism over various rumors surrounding the junior Kim, saying none of such rumors could be verified. The rumors include an alleged brain damage he suffered in a traffic accident last autumn and his being in an awkward position over the uncovery of his misuse of a large amount of foreign exchanges.
