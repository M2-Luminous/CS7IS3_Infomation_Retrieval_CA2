FR940613-2-00095 FR940613-2-00058 Federal Aviation Administration RTCA, Inc.; New Document Releases Pursuant to section 10(a)(2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92&hyph;463, 5 U.S.C., Appendix I), notice is hereby given for the release of the following new documents: RCRA DO&hyph;221␣ Guidance and Recommended Requirements For Airport Surface Movement Sensors, provides recommended standards for both sensor and system characteristics. The primary purpose for these sensors is to operate stop bars located on taxiways which provide entrance to low visibility runways. The sensors may also be used for other low visibility functions such as taxiway light sequencing, runway exiting notification and presence detection. This document provides guidance to airport system designers, manufacturers, installers and user. The cost of DO&hyph;221 is US$50.00 for U.S./Canada/Mexico and US$65.00 for all other countries, plus applicable shipping and handling charges. RTCA DO&hyph;222␣ Guidelines on AMS(R)S Near-Term Voice Implementation and Utilization, contains operational guidelines and recommendations for the implementation and utilization of Aeronautical Mobile Satellite (Route) Services, voice communication functions in the near-term (circa 1993&hyph;1996) air traffic environment. It presents a system-level view of how satellite voice services can be implemented and used in the Air Traffic Services (ATS) and Aeronautical Operational Control (AOC) environments inclusive of aircraft installation requirements, ground infrastructure requirements and available AMS(R)S services. This document defines the functions and performance needed to facilitate the development, implementation, certification and operational use of satellite voice in an environment where satellite voice communication is not yet a required capability for air navigation. It uses as its basis the existing standards for satellite avionics and ground equipment. It should be useful to designers, manufacturers, installers and operators of equipment used in AMSS voice service. The cost of DO&hyph;222 is US$60.00 for U.S./Canada/Mexico and US$75.00 for all other countries, plus applicable shipping and handling charges. Dave Ford, Designated Officer.
