The number of first consumers of drugs increased to 4,538 between January and May. That is 20.4 percent up on the same period last year. The government's drug expert, State Secretary Eduard Lintner, told WELT AM SONNTAG that in the first five months of 1994, 643 people were killed by drugs. He warned against "misinterpreting the Karlsruhe ruling on liberalizing small amounts of drugs for personal use." Lintner fears that "the danger of a clear increase in consumption will be played down if prosecution is predictable." From the beginning of January to the end of May, 566 kg of heroin were seized in Germany. In addition, authorities seized 246 kg of cocaine, 1,540 kg of cannabis, 125 kg of marijuana, 45 kg of amphetamines, and 7,121 LSD doses. Asked about the ongoing discussion about small amounts of hashish or marijuana for personal consumption going unpunished, the drugs expert said: "Guidelines that clearly determine small amounts in absolute figures lead to prosecutions also being predictable for dealers and their instigators." Dealers could disguise themselves as consumers of small amounts. That way they could easily evade the police. Since North Rhine-Westphalia's SPD [Social Democratic Party] government decided in May to liberalize the possession of small amounts of heroin, cocaine, and other narcotics, Federal Health Minister Seehofer (Christian Democratic Union--CDU) has examined whether the narcotics law needs to be amended. An additional struggle among the parties can be expected, because Frankfurt's SPD Mayor Andreas von Schoeler wants to have the courts decontrol the possession of heroin for heavy addicts. On the activities in Frankfurt, which is governed by a red-green alliance, the parliamentary manager of the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union], Juergen Ruettgers, told WELT AM SONNTAG: "Liberalization of heroin means giving the go-ahead for the drugs mafia in Frankfurt; with Frankfurt a city that has almost 10,000 drug addicts, of whom some 5,000 are consumers of hard drugs. With 146,000 criminal offenses a year, Frankfurt is a stronghold of crime in Germany."
