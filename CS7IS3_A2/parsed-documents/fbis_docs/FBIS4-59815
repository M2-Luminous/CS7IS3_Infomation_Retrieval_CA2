On April 10, a half-day strike was observed in the three districts of CHTs under the auspices of the Parbattya Gano Parishad [organization of Bengali settlers in CHTs] in protest against the kidnapping of several Bengali-speaking people from Naniarchar by the Shanti Bahini. The Shanti Bahini also kidnapped one person from Manikchhari last December and another person from Kutubchhari in January. The kidnapping and killing of Bengalees by the Shanti Bahini continues. Perhaps, the members of the so-called Shanti Bahini and the Pahari Chhatra Parishad [Hill Students Council] who are followers of Upendra Lal Chakma and Santu Larma [both leaders of the tribal insurgents] are carrying on these nefarious activities to obstruct the repatriation of tribal refugees to CHTs from India's Tripura State. Though the Pahari Chhatra Parishad has appealed to the tribal population of CHTs not to celebrate the Biju [religious festival of the tribals], the tribals have not responded. The Shanti Bahini wanted to prove to the world that religious minorities are being repressed in Bangladesh by preventing the observance of this festival. In the past, the Shanti Bahini had made several false propaganda in this regard both at home and abroad. At present, the Shanti Bahini has set up several bases inside the CHTs. They have this opportunity as the security forces have been withdrawn from the border areas. Apart from Tripura, the Shanti Bahini has recently opened new camps in Haryana [a state of India] for training newly-recruited youths. These terrortist elements have the opportunity to organize themselves due to the general amnesty declared by the Bangladesh Government and the closure of several army camps in the region. It is learnt that arrangements are being made to withdraw more army camps from the CHTs. This is a matter of grave concern. After visiting the CHTs, the governor of Tripura, Romesh Bhandari, said he believed that the situation in the region is very favorable for repatriation. Despite this, the Shanti Bahini which is responsible for killing over 25,000 people in the CHTs is making efforts to foil the repatriation of the second batch of tribal refugees from Tripura to the CHTs. The Shanti Bahini has become desperate to launch massive destruction in the region to foil the peace initiative under any pretext. It may be mentioned that at least 25 percent of the women of Bangipara [village of CHTs] have become widows due to the activities of the Shanti Bahini. After the peace talks held last November, the killer Shanti Bahini launched a series of attacks and killed a large number of the members of the security forces, the police, the Bangladesh Rifles [paramilitary force], and Bengalees living in the region. So far, it has not been possible to record all their activities. Reliable sources, however, said such incidents exceed 200. They said the aim of the Shanti Bahini is to foil the peace process and complicate the situation. The reason is that the leaders of the Shanti Bahini and the Jana Sanghati Samity [political wing of Shanti Bahini] are gradually becoming frustrated with India. Recently, the Shanti Bahini has established links with the secessionist forces in seven Indian states including Tripura, Mizoram, Assam, Nagaland, and Meghalaya. Due to this, the Shanti Bahini has become a problem for India. According to observers, Indian leaders are therefore in favor of driving out the Shanti Bahini from their country. They add that owing to this the Shanti Bahini has become desperate to let loose anarchy. The people of the CHTs have become fed up with the large-scale extortion of the Shanti Bahini. Several protest rallies against the activities of the Shanti Bahini have been held in different parts of the region. Severe discontent prevails among the Bengalees living in the three districts of Chittagong Hill Tracts. They are fighting against the demand of the tribals to curb their rights and convert them to second-class citizens. The quota for the representation of the Bengalees in the district councils of the CHTs is very small. The opportunity for the education of their children is also very limited. In contrast, there are special quotas in educational institutions for the tribals. Bengalees do not have the right to purchase land in the CHTs. On the other hand, the government has surrendered to the demand of the Shanti Bahini and is forcibly evicting thousands of Bengalees from their homes. This is being widely criticized. A massive rally was held last November in Rangamati town under the auspices of the Parbattya Gano Parishad which clearly stated that the people of the CHTs will not accept any talks with the murderous Shanti Bahini. They added that if any talks are necessary, then it should be held with the Parbattya Gano Parishad, an organization of peace-loving people from the three districts of the CHTs. In this regard, they also handed over a memorandum to the government. In this memorandum, the Bengalees have demanded the abolition of special tribal quotas and the introduction of hill quotas. On April 10, a half-day strike was observed peacefully in the three districts of the CHTs -- Rangamati, Bandarban, and Khagrachhari -- at the call of the Parbattya Gano Parishad, which demanded that the Bengalees kidnapped by the Shanti Bahini be released. Addressing a rally held on the occasion, the Gano Parishad leaders declared that a solution to the CHTs problem is only possible through the implementation of the seven-point and 18-point proposals they have given. They added that the repression of the Bengalees in the CHTs, which is also a Bangladesh territory, will not be tolerated. A rumor is being heard saying that the government has recently decided to hand over to the district councils of the CHTs the responsibility of dealing with land matters in the region. If this is done, then this will be equal to giving the Bengalees a death blow. It is learnt that the Bengalees are preparing to resist this move. The Jatiyatabadi Landless Organization, which has about 10,000 landless families living in Khagrachhari, are planning to lay siege to the local district council office to press the implementation of their five-point demands. The chairman of the Parbattya Gano Parishad, Jalaluddin Ahmed, and the secretary general, Moniruzzaman Monir, in a joint statement criticized the governor of Tripura, Romesh Bhandari, for saying that he is unaware that secessionist training is being given to the misled Chakma [tribals of CHTs] youths at the (Maini) Mission Academy and other secret places in Agartala. They alleged that the administration in Chittagong Hill Tracts is being compelled to work in accordance with the prescription of the local leftists and the so-called international human rights organizations. They added that the MP from Khagrachhari, Kalpa Ranjan Chakma, and Upendra Lal Chakma are playing a game centering on the Chakma refugee issue. The Parbattya Gano Parishad has evidence that these two people have links with the Shanti Bahini. Hence, they cannot be friends of Bangladesh. The leaders of the parishad in their statement has called on the government to call a round-table conference at the national level to resist the conspiracy and terrorism going on in the CHTs.
