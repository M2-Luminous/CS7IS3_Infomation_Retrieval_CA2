FR940627-0-00026 FR940627-0-00009 I. Introduction In the matter of: Before Commissioners: Elizabeth Anne Moler, Chair; Vicky A. Bailey, James J. Hoecker, William L. Massey, and Donald F. Santa, Jr. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is amending its regulations governing Standards of Conduct and reporting requirements for transportation and affiliate transactions. The Commission is significantly reducing its reporting requirements based on changes in the way pipelines will be allocating capacity after implementation of Order No. 636 1 and the Commission's experience with the reporting requirements. 1 Pipeline Service Obligations and Revisions to Regulations Governing Self-Implementing Transportation; and Regulation of Natural Gas Pipelines After Partial Wellhead Decontrol, 57 FR 13267 (Apr. 16, 1992), III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles ¶ 30,939 (Apr. 8, 1992), order on reh'g, Order No. 636&hyph;A, 57 FR 36128 (Aug. 12, 1992), III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles ¶ 30,950 (Aug. 3, 1992), order on reh'g, Order No. 636&hyph;B, 57 FR 57911 (Dec. 8, 1992), 61 FERC ¶ 61,272 (1992), appeal re-docketed sub nom., Atlanta Gas Light Company and Chattanooga Gas Company, et al. v. FERC, No. 94&hyph;1171 (D.C. Cir. May 27, 1994). II. Reporting Requirements The Commission estimates the public reporting burden for this collection of information under the final rule to average 60 hours per respondent, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. In lieu of being physically filed with the Commission on a periodic basis as a ``response'' or ``filing'', the data will be posted on pipeline Electronic Bulletin Boards (EBBs), established and maintained by the pipeline respondents pursuant to Order No. 636, and collected under FERC&hyph;592, Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines to be provided to the Commission upon request. The annual reporting burden for some 61 respondents under the rule is estimated to total approximately 3,500 hours. Because the rule provides for fewer information items, eliminates regular, periodic filings, and requires certain information to be posted or made available upon request in text format, the burden estimate for FERC&hyph;592 in the Final Rule represents a burden reduction of about 70 hours per respondent_or a total reduction of about 4,300 hours. The current annual reporting burden attributable to the FERC&hyph;592 information collection is 7,881.2 hours. A copy of this final rule is being provided to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Interested persons may send comments regarding the burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for further reductions of this burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415, FAX (202) 208&hyph;2425]. Comments on the requirements of this rule may also be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Washington, D.C. 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (202) 395&hyph;6880]. III. Background The Commission, in Order No. 497, 2 issued a rule intended to prevent pipelines from providing preferential treatment to their marketing or brokering affiliates. The rule adopted Standards of Conduct (codified at Part 161 of the Commission's regulations) 3 and tariff and reporting requirements (codified in §250.16) 4 The Standards of Conduct establish the principles applicable to relationships between pipelines and their affiliates. In general, they provide that the pipeline cannot favor affiliates with information or transportation discounts not available to non-affiliates. The tariff provisions require pipelines to include in their tariffs a list of operating personnel shared with affiliates, the information and format for transportation service requests, the procedures used to resolve complaints, the procedures used to inform shippers about the availability and pricing of transportation services. 2 Inquiry Into Alleged Anticompetitive Practices Related to Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines, Order No. 497, 53 FR 22139 (June 14, 1988), FERC Stats. & Regs.
