He said Slovakia's place in Europe was illustrated by the agreements the country had signed, for instance the Association Agreement with the European Union (EU). He reiterated that Slovakia was seeking EU membership. Asked whether Meciar's premiership had led the West to rather overlook Slovakia in assessing countries most fit for integration, Moravcik said: "It's more a question of the style of politics and the creation of guarantees for the development of the institutions of parliamentary democracy. It is a domestic policy question, which in my view will have less and less importance. I wouldn't overestimate that." He confirmed that cooperation within the Visegrad Group -- Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary -- remained attractive for Slovakia. Its importance resided principally in accelerating admission to the EU. If the Group did not achieve that it would become senseless, he said. "I, however, am convinced it still is meaningful," Moravcik said.
