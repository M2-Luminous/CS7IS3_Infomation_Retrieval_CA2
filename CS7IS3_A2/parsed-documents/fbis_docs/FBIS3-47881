During the meeting which lasted for about an hour, they keenly discussed prospects for political reform debates and desirable directions of the coalition government. According to Yamaguchi, Hosokawa expressed his resolve to stand out firmly to enact the political reform bills. Regarding his strategies for the next ordinary Diet session, Hosokawa reportedly clarified his stance to maintain and further strengthen cooperative relations among the eight coalition parties. After the meeting, Yamaguchi told reporters that, "while some quarters in the coalition are seeking new grouping, the prime minister still considers the eight-party alliance must be the foundation of the coalition government." It is believed that those remarks by Hosokawa were made to check moves by Akira Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo who recently proposed a unification of liberal parties except Komeito and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party].
