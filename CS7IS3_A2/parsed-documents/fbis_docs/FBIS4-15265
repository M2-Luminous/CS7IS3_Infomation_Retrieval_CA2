First Deputy Russian Minister of Finance Vladimir Petrov tried to convince the deputies that the draft will help to overcome the economic crisis and start economic revival. Petrov described the budget to include 120,000,000,000,000 rubles worth of revenues and 62,400,000,000,000 rubles worth of deficit as realistic and the only correct from among all the suggested drafts. The budget is expected to cut the inflation to monthly seven-eight per cent at the year end and halve credit emission as compared to 1993. Many spending items, including social needs, will remain at the 1993 level as compared to the gross domestic product. The defence spending is expected to reach 37,100,000,000,000 rubles or 5.1 per cent of the gross domestic product. Some 5,000,000,000,000 rubles will be spend on state management bodies, which is more than last year. "We came to conclusion that the validity of the presidential decree on civil service shall be suspended till 1995. The decree's implementation would mean 11,000,000,000,000 rubles worth of spending on the state machinery," said petrov. The draft budget takes into account the moratorium on increased salaries in budget-financed spheres in the second quarter of 1994, which would require additional 2,000,000,000,000 rubles. The government thinks it should fulfill all of its previous promises and then start further indexation of salaries with due account of the state financial position. The first quarter of 1993 brought 8,400,000,000,000 rubles worth of revenues to the budget, which is less than it was planned. A reason for this is that a number of territories, primarily Bashkortostan and the Republic of Sakha dodged the payment of taxes to the federal budget. Negotiations with their leadership is underway to settle the problem. The first quarter's spending amounted to 17,200,000,000,000 rubles.
