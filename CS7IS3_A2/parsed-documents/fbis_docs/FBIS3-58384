Against his will. The U.S. President did not even want the Bosnian question to be included on the agenda of the NATO summit in Brussels. What is more: Addressing young Europeans in the Belgian capital on Sunday evening [9 January], he did not even deign to mention the word Bosnia in his speech. He eventually had to do so, on pain of opening up a gulf in the alliance, which he wanted to avoid on his first European visit. Amid the wholesale slaughter in Sarajevo, French diplomacy has therefore scored a point by forcing the United States to abandon its extremely cautious silence. Francois Mitterrand undoubtedly wanted to attribute this point to himself by making belligerent statements which contrast strangely with what he was saying about the former Yugoslavia not so long ago. Everybody can change, including Mitterrand and Clinton. However, there is reason to wonder about the scope of a change, which essentially consists of citing UN Resolution No. 836 on the "security areas" adopted last June. And we know what has happened since then. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who addressed the National Assembly Foreign Affairs Commission in Paris yesterday, took pleasure in reaffirming this. He reminded the states that it is they who could be blamed for refusing to use force. Speeches will not change anything, added the UN secretary general, who was probably not in a charitable mood. In Brussels, Clinton and Mitterrand chorused that talking served no purpose if action did not follow. They will not be criticized for saying that. Because they have already talked too much, they have contributed -- especially the Americans -- to sustaining the Bosnian conflagration rather than extinguishing it. By allowing the unfortunate President Izetbegovic to believe that a military intervention was imminent, they encouraged him to reject all peace plans in succession, although the latest ones were consistent with the demands previously formulated by the Muslim side. The same causes are now likely to produce the same effects.... We will see what will come of the Brussels war drums. How can we predict the future after almost two years of almost daily contradictions, denials, and about-faces? The United Nations, NATO, and Europe have exhausted their credibility in it. They have cried wolf one time too many....
