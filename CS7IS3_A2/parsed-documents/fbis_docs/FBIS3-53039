The latest round came last Friday [7 January] when he launched a public relations campaign entitled "The Likud's Information Airline," consisting of flights from Tel Aviv's Sede Dov Airfield to Jericho and back to illustrate the security dangers looming over Israel as a result of the implementation of the agreement with the PLO. "Netanyahu failed to get the masses out on the streets, and he is now trying his luck in the skies," said a senior Likud member commenting on the campaign. "A folly," said Knesset Member Ari'el Sharon. The latter does not take part in the airborne campaign and will continue his independent public relations campaign on the ground. As he usually does, he will stop at the same old spot near the settlement of Bet Arye overlooking Ben-Gurion Airport and lecture his audience about the dangers posed by a Palestinian state. Sharon brought the internal ferment against Netanyahu's leadership to a peak last week when he announced his plans to run for the premiership. Two days earlier he described Netanyahu as "a man who got caught with his pants down, in more ways than one, but put the blame on others." Not to be outdone, Netanyahu retorted by accusing Sharon of "relentless subversion which began under Menahem Begin and continued under Yitzhaq Shamir, and now it is my turn." Over the weekend he even went as far as warning that "the Likud might once again enter a collision course." His associates say that Netanyahu will henceforth change his ways and fight back. "I will not agree to be the punching bag of frustrated Likud members, as Yitzhaq Shamir was," he told his associates last week as he launched his counteroffensive. His men accused Sharon of encouraging a group of U.S. businessmen to accuse Netanyahu of diverting money collected for the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza to the Likud's coffers. Sharon categorically denied it, but Netanyahu's men persisted. They leaked to the press that the Likud was forced to pay 40,000 shekels for a private information campaign Sharon conducted on the eve of the last Knesset election. This claim, too, was emphatically denied by Sharon. A journalist who nevertheless published it without seeking Sharon's comment was reprimanded after Sharon complained. Netanyahu will hold his fire against the other "subversives" -- David Levi, David Magen, and Dan Meridor -- as long as they do not come out against him in public. Still, Netanyahu's men have already warned them "not to stoke the fire." Rumors at Likud headquarters in Tel Aviv have it that "Netanyahu's followers have compiled a dossier about each rival." Perhaps this is the reason why Magen refuses to be interviewed for Friday night's weekly newsreel on Channel 1. He asked the television people "to wait until February," by which time he will have finished gathering the data about the number of drop-outs from Likud ranks and exposing them to the public as part of his campaign to bring about new primaries. It is estimated that some 100,000 of the Likud's 250,000 registered members will have dropped out by then. David Levi has adopted different tactics from that of Sharon and Magen, but not because he fears Netanyahu's reaction. His associates claim that his thundering silence is a calculated and well-planned move. Levi has learned from experience and is no longer willing to be the main opposition activist, with all others hiding behind him. His associates say that this time around Levi is waiting for others to do the job for him. However, most of those senior Likud members who question Netanyahu's leadership and sharply criticize him still prefer to do so off-the-record and in private meetings. In the wake of the HA'ARETZ report about the secret contacts Magen has been holding in a bid to bring about new primaries in the Likud, in which Dan Meridor would run, Netanyahu's associates began collecting signatures against such a move. As was expected, Levi and Sharon did not sign it. Meridor and Beni Begin did, and went on to side publicly with Netanyahu in order to dispel reports that he had lent a hand to Magen's secret contacts. Some of the signatories sharply criticized Netanyahu in off-the-record talks, nevertheless, arguing that new primaries before the next Knesset elections are inevitable if the Likud really wants to return to power. However, holding new primaries is not that simple. A clause Netanyahu introduced in the Likud's constitution actually guarantees his election as chairman of the Likud -- who also is its candidate for the premiership -- until the year 2000. A decision to hold new primaries before an elected chairman ends his term requires a 75-percent majority in the 3,600-member Likud Central Committee and such a majority would seem unattainable at the moment. According to a poll conducted by Channel 2 over the weekend, Netanyahu still commands the support of 49 percent of the Likud (he got 52 percent in the primaries), compared with Sharon's 15 percent, Levi's 7 percent (as opposed to 27 percent in the primaries), and Meridor's 7 percent. Levi's men claim that the poll does not reflect reality and that support for Levi is larger. However, they too understand that he does not yet have the required majority to bring about new primaries, even if his followers were joined by those of Sharon and Meridor. Nevertheless, "when the time comes," Levi's followers (and not just them) plan to submit a motion to the Central Committee to hold primaries. Their idea is to attain over 50 percent of the vote, and depict it as a show of no confidence in Netanyahu. As they see it, such a move would pressure him to agree to primaries. At the same time, Sharon's and Levi's followers are examining alternative scenarios and are not ruling out the possibility of a split. A group of Levi's followers, which includes his brother Maxim, believes that if the peace process succeeds the entire political map will change, and then it will be possible to set up a new political movement led by David Levi which will focus on socioeconomic issues. Maxim recently asked his brother to tone down his pronouncements against the peace process so as not to impair the chances of such an independent movement to attain the support of the political mainstream. However, it would seem from David Levi's latest statements that he has not been heeding this advice. Ari'el Sharon has been saying that he will not bring about the disbandment of the Likud, and stressing that if and when he decides to run for the premiership he will want to do it only in the framework of the Likud. At the same time, he said he had no idea how to go about it in view of the obstacle posed by the Likud constitution. His followers argue that if he fails to bring about new primaries in the Likud he may collect 50,000 signatures to present his candidacy for the premiership in accordance with the new law. Likud members claim that through such a move Sharon would be driving himself out of the Likud. Despite Sharon's and Refa'el Eytan's denials, rumors persist in the political establishment about an ongoing dialogue between the two concerning the establishment of a new right-wing political movement. It has even been speculated that in such an event Eytan would be willing to give up running for the premiership and become Sharon's second-in-command. However, some in the Likud believe that Sharon's move was merely designed to neutralize Netanyahu through the creation of a collective leadership which would include all those who served as ministers in the Likud government, including David Levi. Everybody agrees that developments in the Likud depend on the date of the next elections to the Knesset and the premiership. If Yosi Sarid's predictions come true and elections are brought forward either to the end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995 in anticipation of the signing of peace agreements, Netanyahu's rivals stand a very slim chance of challenging the Likud's leadership. It is believed that in such an event a formula will be found to reinstate Levi in the Likud's leadership as Netanyahu's second-in-command, perhaps on the basis of a proposal consolidated by Tzahi Hanegbi and Re'uven Rivlin. If the elections are held on schedule in 1996, some people in the Likud assess that the infighting at the top will lead to a new contest for the leadership of the party.
