Dr Suphachai revealed yesterday it was possible Australia and New Zealand would be asked to join AFTA, despite not being members of ASEAN. Thailand will chair the ASEAN Economic Ministers' meeting this year and one of the issues to be discussed may be inviting new countries to join AFTA, he said. Dr Suphachai said he personally believed the AFTA should include more countries, particularly Australia and New Zealand, to expand its multilateral trading opportunities. If Thailand could compete effectively in terms of trade with Singapore, it was not out of the question that it could compete equally well with the developed Australia and New Zealand. Both countries are potentially large markets for Thai exports which are produced at low cost such as chicken and textiles. The issue may meet with resistance at the meeting as Malaysia and Indonesia had made it clear long ago that they did not want non-Asian countries to join the group. Speeding up the implementation of AFTA, very likely from 15 years to 10 years, ought to be approved in principle by all members. The terms and conditions, such as those involving exclusion lists and local content, may call for further discussion, he said. It was widely believed that China may dominate all Indochinese and ASEAN countries in the future because of its strong potential and relationships with the people of these countries. Market expansion as a result of this may prove beneficial for Thailand since China is one of the largest markets in the world.
