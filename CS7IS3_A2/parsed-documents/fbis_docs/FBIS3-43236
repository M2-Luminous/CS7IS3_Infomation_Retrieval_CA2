In a New Year message to the nation broadcast on radio Uganda and Uganda television, Mr. Museveni strongly advised his fellow countrymen not to allow their narrow interests to stand in the way of a smooth transition to a democratic elected government. He confirmed that a parliament and a president will be elected under the new constitution made by the people this year. He called upon all Ugandans to take the completion of the constitution-making exercise as seriously as they took the earlier phases of civic education and the submission of their views to the constitutional commission. "We must now complete the task we embarked upon more than four years ago and nobody should divert you at this 11th hour", he said. He commended the commissioner of the Constituent Assembly elections and his staff for the civic awareness they have generated, which has made the registration exercise successful. He appealed to all Ugandans to take the Constituent Assembly elections very seriously so that they elect people who are committed to the nation and can competently debate the draft constitution, which is the compendium of the views of the people of Uganda, which they are at liberty to amend, add to, or subtract from through their representatives or directly. On the question of having a level playing field, the president said the National Resistance Movement [NRM] government is committed to free and fair elections. However, he added: "We wish to appeal to the intending candidates not to tilt the field through the bribing of voters. The level playing field we all cherish", he went on, "will therefore very much depend on the behavior of the candidates." He said government policy is to have the best men and women in the business of representing the people. On the future of the country the president said the democratic system we are building must be premised on peace and stability. We must therefore, he said, eschew the politics of division of the past and build political platforms on programs and not on ethnicity, religion or region. In that way, peace, stability, and democratic governance will take firm root in this country and become enduring. He said in the excitement and noise of the coming elections it will serve as well to remember the tortured history of our country since independence. He said institutions which we have always had and whose continuity some are advocating did not give us the peace and stability we all cherish. Why should some people therefore, he asked, think that those self-same institutions and the people behind them who in the past have been the authors of chaos and tragedy can now lead us along the golden path? We now have an opportunity to put right the wrongs of the past. If we do not, he declared, history will condemn us. He reiterated the NRM policy of reconciliation, adding that Ugandans should never again be stampeded into exile on baseless grounds. On the question of monarchs in Uganda, the president made it clear that the NRM government is not opposed to the restoration and formalization of any of our cultural institutions, provided the majority within the community concerned so desire. On cooperation among the three east African countries: Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, president Museveni said the NRM government is fully committed to the revival and restoration of the historical links between the three countries to promote trade and common services. On efforts being made to end minority rule in South Africa, President Museveni said Uganda hopes and prays that the forces of unity and reconciliation will prevail over disunity and hatred in the months ahead. On the situation in Africa, the Ugandan leader said Africa has got one destiny and it cannot be realized until stability, peace and order prevail everywhere. We therefore earnestly call on the forces ranged against each other in fratricidal wars in the Sudan, Somalia, Burundi, and Angola to sheath their swords. President Yoweri Museveni has said that in terms of economic performance, 1993 has been the brightest year for Uganda's economy since the early 1970's. In a New Year's message to the nation, Mr. Museveni said the last 12 months have been of prosperity, tranquillity and peace, and he declared we should be grateful to the Lord for all the blessings on our country. He said over the last 12 months, the government has accelerated the pace of macroeconomic and structural reforms aimed at achieving increased stability and efficiency of the country's economy. The main elements in the strategy of maintaining macroeconomic stability, he added, are: firm control over public expenditure, keeping a tight lid on monetary expansion consistent with economic growth, and liberalization of the foreign exchange market, which has allowed increased foreign exchange inflows. The president said that as a result of implementing this strategy, inflation has been brought under control. He disclosed that the rate of inflation dropped to 1.5 percent in November last year compared to 52 percent in November 1992. He promised that inflation will not be allowed to exceed 5 percent. The sharp fall in the rate of inflation has resulted in the reduction of interest rates. Due to these achievements, considerable private inflows, estimated at 241 million dollars in 1992/93, rose sharply, from 136 million in 1991/92. The president added that the government has been able to service its external debt obligations satisfactorily and has reduced its external debt arrears from 585 million dollars in June 1992 to 253 million dollars in June 1993. Mr. Museveni said, moreover, this has been achieved at a time when the country's external reserves at the Bank of Uganda are also increasing, reaching a level of 135.5 million dollars at the end of November 1993 from a level of only 60 million dollars in September 1992. And for the period July 1992 to June 1993 our GDP is estimated to have grown by about 7.0 percent. In the field of structural reforms the government has undertaken a number of measures. These include a return of over 3,000 properties expropriated by the Idi Amin regime in the early 1970s to their owners. As a result of this action the country is beginning to see major rehabilitation and investments in properties repossessed by their owners, which has opened up opportunities for employment. Other measures taken are rationalization of public expenditure to improve services increasing the pace of divestiture reform of parastatals, and reform of the civil service through the restructuring of ministries, and the reduction of staff and the first phase of the reduction of the size of the Armed Forces has been completed. He said in the New Year 1994, the government intends to pursue policies that will help us to consolidate macroeconomic stability. The government will accelerate the pace of the finance sector restructuring. In this connection Mr. Museveni said the government will intensify the restructuring of the Uganda Commercial Bank and cooperate [as heard] banks. He disclosed that early in the year the government will table in the NRC a non-performing loans recovery bill which seeks to clear the Uganda Commercial Bank of all non-performing loans from its balance sheet. The government will also sign a performance contract agreement with the Uganda Commercial Bank management: the government further intends to accelerate economic growth by improving the incentive framework for the private sector. Accordingly, early in the year, the government will implement the following measures to reduce further the regulatory barriers to trade and investment: the cotton subsector will be revitalized through a change of policy relating to cotton production, ginning and marketing. The Ministry of Trade and Industry will to this effect table a cotton bill in the NRC early next month which aims at abolishing the lint marketing monopoly over exports and that of the unions over ginning. The coffee subsector will be further liberalized through the implementation of the following measures: the requirements that coffee must be transported to ports by rail will be abolished. Exports will be free to choose the mode of transport for their coffee to the sea. The price formula used to calculate the export flow price will be abolished. The Ministry of Trade and Industry will announce the details in due course. The Uganda Coffee Development Authority, UCDA, statute will be amended to restructure its board so that the majority of directors represent the coffee industry and to define UCDA's role in the extension of coffee nurseries. The Coffee Marketing Board Limited, CMBL, will also be structured to reduce its operating costs to reflect current market realities. Pump prices for petrol will be liberalized, and the minister of natural resources will announce the detailed measures that will accompany this policy. The government will implement the final phase of the divestiture of the custodian board properties in 1994. In this regard the government will implement the following measures early in the year: return of remaining properties with valid repossession claims to their owners by the end of January 1994. The government will also sell all unclaimed properties by competitive tender beginning September 1994.
