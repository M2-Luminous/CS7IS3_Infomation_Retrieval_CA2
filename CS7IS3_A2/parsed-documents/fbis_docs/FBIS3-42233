Diplomatic sources in Cairo noted that the Khartoum government intends to pass a new draft law on naturalization. This law stipulates granting Sudanese citizenship to every Muslim this coming month. The sources added that if this happens, large numbers of extremist terrorists will find shelter and a land to use as a springboard for their terrorist activities. It is worth noting here that the current naturalization law stipulates that the applicant for citizenship must have resided in Sudan for not less than 12 years and should not have a criminal record of a crime that violates security and honor. These diplomatic sources noted that there are more than 5,000 men and women extremist Muslims residing in Sudan. Most of them are from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Palestine. The number of Islamists from Morocco known to these sources is 50. There are over 370 Egyptians known by their "code" [preceding word in English] names. There are also over 300 Tunisians who belong to the Ennahda Movement headed by Rachid Ghanouchi. These sources noted that among these groups, there are some Syrians, Iraqis, and Yemenis who live in Sudan under the cover of being businessmen and contractors. Most of these Islamists live in the areas of al-Riyad, al-Ta'if, al-Manshiyah, Kawbar, and Madinat al-Mughtaribin in Madinat al-Khartoum Bahri.
