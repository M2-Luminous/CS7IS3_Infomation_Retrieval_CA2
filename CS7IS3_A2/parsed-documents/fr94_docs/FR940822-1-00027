FR940822-1-00027 FR940822-1-00006 Response. The staff agrees that all significant public and environmental risks should be considered. The GEIS for this rulemaking assesses both radiological and non-radiological impacts for the proposed rule and several alternative actions, including the alternative of no remedial action. In addition, the proposed rule would require that the licensee, when determining ALARA for a specific decommissioning, consider all significant radiological and non-radiological risks resulting from residual radioactivity and from the decommissioning process itself (including transportation and disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the process). In some cases, the necessary ALARA analysis will go beyond the relatively simple cost-benefit analysis that has typically been applied in the nuclear industry in limiting worker exposures because the types of risks being considered are not things that can be easily quantified or compared. For example, transportation poses immediate risks in terms of fatalities due to highway accidents in hauling the radioactive contamination to appropriate disposal sites. Some individuals and organizations have suggested that these anticipated fatalities should not be considered as having the same seriousness or likelihood as the potential deaths at some point in the future of individuals that may inhabit former nuclear sites after license termination. ALARA, or perceptions of what should be considered as ALARA, may also vary because of values placed on minimizing the number of new disposal sites, preserving existing resources, or preserving viable industries for jobs. Each of these factors were discussed in the workshops, and the staff believes that these same factors may need to be considered in determining the ALARA level for remediation at a particular site. The NRC is developing guidance on how the ALARA process could be applied in evaluating alternative radiological criteria for decommissioning on a site-specific basis. Comment. Another commenter stated that, ``there is no ecological or conservation basis for establishing radiation protection standards different from those *␣*␣* involved in any other health issue for which benefits are weighed against costs.'' Response. The NRC staff agrees with this stated conclusion that, as a guiding principle, radiation protection standards do not warrant different treatment than those for other health issues. In this regard, the staff has carefully considered both the criteria and the implementation of those criteria in other environmental remediation programs (e.g., the EPA Superfund program). The staff believes the criteria proposed in this rulemaking are generally consistent with those used in other environmental remediation programs. Comment. Several commenters stated that cleaning up to any specified level is technically achievable and is simply a matter of how much it will cost. Some believed that decommissioning costs to return sites to unrestricted use could be so high that the sites should be kept under continued control and maintained as a restricted area. Some commenters suggested that money saved on unnecessary decommissioning activities might be used in other activities more beneficial to the public. Other commenters stated that money saved on decommissioning costs would not necessarily be available for societal betterment. Response. The proposed rule recognizes that it may not be reasonable to remediate some sites to a level that permits release for unrestricted use. The costs involved, either in dollars or in potential harm to the environment or people, may be prohibitive. In these cases, the proposed rule provides for termination of the license under restricted conditions. The staff is also aware that in some unusual cases sites may have to remain under license indefinitely. For example, the NRC is aware of certain sites that are so contaminated by elevated levels of the naturally occurring radionuclides uranium, thorium, and their decay products that it would be extremely difficult and costly to satisfy the proposed criteria for unrestricted or restricted release. In these cases, the staff anticipates that the sites would have to remain under a license indefinitely until new, more efficient technologies are developed or the financial resources become available to pay for more complete remediation. The Commission has no authority over expenditure of funds that might be saved by avoiding what were termed ``unnecessary decommissioning activities.'' 10. Site Remediation Comment. Several commenters stated that, although the cost of decommissioning could be high, remediation technologies are available for achieving whatever level is set by the NRC. The NRC should describe acceptable methodologies for remediation and measurement to reduce subjective judgments and should ensure that workers who perform remediation are appropriately trained and protected. Response. Before the effective date of the final rule, the NRC will provide interim guidance for use and comment on acceptable methodologies for demonstrating compliance with the Commission's residual radioactivity criteria. After one to two years' implementation experience is gained from use of the interim guidance, the collected comments will be addressed and the final guidance will be issued. However, the NRC staff does not believe that it would be appropriate to prescribe, a priori, the methods to be used. Licensees must be able to take advantage of whatever safe methodologies may be available for achieving remediation that complies with the criteria for decommissioning. Workers performing decommissioning must receive training in radiation protection according to the requirements of the Commission's requirements in 10 CFR 19.12, ``Instructions to Workers.'' Likewise, workers participating in decommissioning activities will be subject to all of the provisions of 10 CFR Part 20, including requirements related to personnel monitoring, respiratory protection, occupational dose limits, and ALARA. In this regard, the staff does not view the conduct of decommissioning activities to be any different from other operational activities licensed by the Commission. 11. Demonstrating Compliance Comment. Several commenters stated that demonstration of compliance with NRC decommissioning rules and applicable radiological limits is a major issue. The commenters believe the NRC must provide clear guidelines with respect to the kinds of measurements that are necessary and the models that are acceptable to demonstrate compliance. With respect to measurements, guidance should cover: (1) Acceptable measurement methods; (2) Extent of measurements needed; (3) Use of field instruments versus laboratory instruments; (4) Statistical sampling; and (5) Calibration standards and measurement certification. With respect to models and methodologies, guidance should be provided on their use, uncertainties, and how to apply site-specific characteristics. The NRC must make sufficient confirmatory measurements to check that the standards have been met and NRC should enforce the standards. Several commenters pointed out that, whatever risk standard the NRC may adopt, compliance will likely need to be determined by a computer model except for small operations when contamination levels are within specified generic criteria. Other commenters stated that decontamination limits should be established and dose modeling should not be relied on to demonstrate compliance. Comments were split on whether risk limits might be needed for different exposure pathways. Response. Before the effective date of the final rule, NRC plans to issue specific guidance that includes conservative radiation levels, surface contamination limits, and radioactivity concentrations for use by licensees who elect to apply a generic model to demonstrate compliance. Guidance on measurements covering the above listed five subjects will also be provided. The NRC appreciates that guidance is essential especially where the licensee must demonstrate compliance with criteria that require reduction of residual radioactivity to near background levels. The NRC expects to make sufficient confirmatory measurements to ensure compliance with the criteria. The proposed rule limits the total exposure from all pathways and, except for the purpose of groundwater protection, does not set limits for individual pathways. The groundwater protection requirement has been included at the request of the EPA to ensure conformance with EPA groundwater protection requirements. Because exposure pathways vary in importance to public dose depending on the radioisotope involved, site-specific parameters, and the circumstances under which the site might be used after decommissioning, the staff believes that, as a general rule, no useful purpose would be served by placing limits on individual pathways. In the selection of conservative default values for use by licensees who do not wish to utilize site-specific modeling, the most critical pathways and scenarios of exposure are assumed to be dominant. The absence of limits on individual pathways provides the licensee with more flexibility in limiting radiation exposures while at the same time providing adequate overall public protection.
