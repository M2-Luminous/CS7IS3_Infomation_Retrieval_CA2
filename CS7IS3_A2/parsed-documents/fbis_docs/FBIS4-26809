A lot of Japanese ultra-rightist groups, including the one involved this time, are connected with organized criminal groups and other violence groups. This is the fourth time for ASAHI SHIMBUN to be attacked by ultra-rightist groups since April 1, when two of its staff members were taken hostage by members of a Tokyo ultra-rightist group in the newspaper's headquarters in Tokyo.
