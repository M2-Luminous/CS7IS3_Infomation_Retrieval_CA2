Only 49 out of 450 deputies were elected, while the parliament can work if the number of its members is no less than 226. The Central Election Committee enacted that the second round must be held until 10 April, and each election district must establish the date on its own. The elections in Ukraine were held in the atmosphere of unprecedented activity. More than 28 million citizens, that is almost 75 per cent of all voters took part in the elections. Residents of western Ukraine where the idea of national independence has been forged for many years were most active. The dream about breaking all ties with "imperial Russia" has almost become a religious obsession. That is why almost all leaders of many nationalist parties strive to run in that region. The distribution of "colours" of the Ukrainian political palette was manifested last Sunday. Only nine out of the 49 deputies represent various nationalist parties, 12 deputies -- the Ukrainian Communist Party, which was registered last October, four deputies -- leftist parties-social and agrarian. Among the so called "non-party deputies" elected on Sunday, there are people, who are not independent politicians -- speaker of the current parliament Ivan Plyushch, former prime minister Leonid Kuchma, former vice-premiers Viktor Pinzenik and Igor Yukhnovskiy. Residents of eastern Ukraine definitely voted for "their own colour." For example, in Donetsk and Lugansk regions, 11 deputies out of 14 will represent Ukrainian Communist Party. Moreover, none out of 132 communists running for parliament there dropped out. The positions of socialists and agrarians are also very strong. No doubt, local referendums and public-opinion polls held in the Crimea and in Donbass contributed to political acuteness of current election campaign. Despite firm pressure undertaken by official Kiev, residents of these regions could openly express their opinions on concrete and vital questions. The bulk of Crimea's residents confirmed their strive for dual citizenship and raised their voices against Kiev's dictate. Almost 90 per cent of residents of Donetsk and Lugansk regions did not only protected the right of Russian language to exist here, but confirmed their will to see it fixed by the Constitution as the second official language along with the Ukrainian. Nearly the same percentage of voters supported the immediate joining of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the necessity of participating in the CIS interparliament assembly. Official Kiev will fail to play down the results of the Crimean and Donbass' referendums and to rule them as illegal, observers believe. Res dents of the "obstinate regions" who are tired of prolonged and senseless struggle with the centre expressed their will and deputies and regional authorities now have to take it into account.
