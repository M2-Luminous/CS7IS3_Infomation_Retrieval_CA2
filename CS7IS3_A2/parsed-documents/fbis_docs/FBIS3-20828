We did not want to participate in it, and especially we did not want to take part in putting pressure on the republic of Srpska and the republic of Serbian Krajina to accept the ultimatum and renounce the fulfillment of their goals," Seselj stressed. Speaking about the Program of Monetary Reform, Seselj stressed that he did not believe it would be possible to implement it in the way it is being done now. "I believe that the monetary reform will not survive beyond the harvest," SRS leader said. During his presentation, someone interrupted Vojislav Seselj several times. After two casual warnings, Seselj threatened the unknown person with the following words: "Calm down or get out, otherwise I will personally come to throw you out of the room." The person was not heard again.
