Brazil purchases wheat from Canada, the EU, and Argentina. The United States argue that the Canadian wheat is subsidized and represents unfair competition. "Brazil must adopt an antidumping measure against Canada," said Espy, who occupied a seat in the U.S. Congress since 1986, has a long career lobbying [preceding word given in English] in favor of U.S. wheat producers, and was a member of the Agriculture and Budget committees since 1986. Negotiated Solution After the meeting, Gov. Fleury Filho said the Brazilian Government will receive the U.S. proposal with reservations. "Our solution must be negotiated. Wheat purchases should be discussed based on some reciprocity regarding orange juice, shoes, and alcohol," said the governor, who believes Brazilian interests were not well defended during the GATT negotiations. The U.S. agriculture secretary seems to be willing to leave Brasilia today with some results. "If the talks in Brasilia are satisfactory, we may include Brazil in our program of exports incentives," Espy said in reference to the EEP (Export Enhancement Program) [preceding three words in English] that, with subsidies, could reduce the price of U.S. wheat offered to Brazil. Notwithstanding, Mike Espy pointed out that the measure would be adopted "in coordination with Argentina" in order not to harm its wheat sales to Brazil.
