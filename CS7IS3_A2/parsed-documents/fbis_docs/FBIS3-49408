Is this organization of services, which is actually inert and bulky, a reflection of the democratic face of the Croatian authorities, or is this nevertheless the seamy side of a regime that displays all the hallmarks of a police state? The Number of Services Is Not Too High Although it would be interesting to see what the foreign intelligence officers wrote in their reports in reply to the questions they asked, their opinion, for the time being, is not available for public scrutiny, not even in countries from which they originate. We will, therefore, attempt to supply some answers on our own and dispel at least some of the mystification about the regrouping of the Croatian intelligence and security apparatus. In the past three years, Croatia as a sovereign country, in addition to the army, has also created its own police force, as well as the security services without which no independent country in the world can function. Considering that Croatia is still involved in a very complex conflict with Serbia and local rebel Serbs, and is significantly involved in the war still raging in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the number of Croatian intelligence services is not too high. However, something else is more important in this matter. In countries with a developed intelligence and security apparatus and parliamentary democracy, it is very important who controls the entire system, whether it has 500 or 20,000 intelligence officers and security clerks. Specialized parliamentary commissions and committees can definitely not do this. They only serve as a kind of occasional democratic inspection. Consequently, within an intelligence system, there is always an internal watch dog, taken from that walk of life and appointed as main supervisor, that is, the controller of all the intelligence and security agencies. In Croatia, after Manolic's official era, the HIS [Croatian Information Service] had that function, and not Sarinic's UNS [Office for National Security] (an advisory body to the Croatian president). What disturbs the world is that Miroslav Tudjman, the son of Franjo Tudjman, has been appointed head of the HIS. That is usually seen in undemocratic political systems, Arabian sheikdoms, or in openly autocratic dictatorial regimes. In Syria, President Assad appointed his brother controller of all the civilian and military intelligence and counterintelligence services and he has held that position for decades. In Rumania, Nicu Ceausescu, the omnipotent son of his father -- the dictator -- was the same. In North Korea, Kim Il Sung trusts only his own son Kim Il Yong, who maintains strict discipline and party rule in the huge apparatus of the state security (115,000 people). The West Is Sensitive to That The West is really sensitive to this. In Great Britain, there would be a crisis in the cabinet if the queen asked the prime minister to appoint her brother or her son as the main controller of the board of directors that supervises British intelligence services MI5, MI6, DIS, and GCHQ. In Israel, in that case there would be a quarrel in the Knesset and new elections. In Germany, something like that would be taken as a good joke, and in France, Sweden, and Italy, as a dangerous political move and precedent. In our case, the unpleasantness of such a comparison may be alleviated by the knowledge of the balance of political forces not only in the state but also in the ruling HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community]. Of several candidates, Miroslav Tudjman is presently the best choice for the head of HIS. In addition to having successfully, and in a scientific manner, studied the principles of information society [previous two words printed in bold type], Miroslav Tudjman's elitist humanist education gives him the following advantage in relation to his competition (of course, all of whom were members of the HDZ): He has modern thoughts and is not inferior to those he commands (and controls) and, more important for this job, he never publicly asserts his personal views. No Gojko Susak [minister of defense] will be able to afford to ignore (as during the era of coordinator Manolic) the opinion of the new head of the HIS, who also has high formal authority in the field of national security. For that function, Miroslav Tudjman is a better solution than Hrvoje Sarinic, who is, on the other hand, ideal for the job of principal adviser in the president's cabinet, and not for the keeper of the key who can put into motion or halt such an expensive and sensitive organization as the national intelligence system. The UNS will now function exactly as was originally planned -- as an national security advisory office of the head of state (something that exists in most Western democratic systems), and not as an independent intelligence agency superior to everyone. We also have to consider something else. Miroslav Tudjman is an intellectual who has been developing a social-democratic profile for years. That means that the head of the HIS will not be an inexperienced, but aggressive hawk that will kill everyone in the hen house to take but one hen as its prey. In other words: He will assert his authority through his knowledge and fierce professional debate (which is a common practice in intelligence methodology), and not by intolerance and bureaucratic court games; he will stimulate mutual cooperation and not rivalry in the Croatian intelligence community. Those who pretend to his position and advocate the so called hard line in the HDZ, whose philosophy of life naturally contains nepotism and connections, will carefully consider whether it pays directly or indirectly to attack someone who is, after all, the son of the president (both of the party and of the state). And there is another thing, which commentaries in the Croatian and international press have neglected to point out, on the occasion of Miroslav Tudjman's appointment to the position of the head of HIS: The military and civilian security and intelligence system in Croatia will, in future, act within its legal province. The SIS [Security and Information Service], conceived as a military [last word printed in bold type] counterintelligence service, will remain firmly in the domain of the army and army barracks (it cannot go beyond that area), while the VOS [Military Intelligence Service] will continue to do his job: procuring and analyzing intelligence data of military and strategic importance. Double-Faced Coat The head of the HIS is to see to that this limit is not exceeded, that authorizations and information are not intertwined, and that rivalry is reduced to the minimum. The reconstruction of the Croatian intelligence security apparatus also shows that the intelligence capability of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will definitely have to improve, while a good part of the remaining field in the Croatian intelligence community will be plowed exclusively by the SZUP -- the (civilian) Service for Protecting the Constitutional System. If there are any doubts as to why the SIS exists at all, there should be no doubts as to the purpose of the SZUP. That service could even change its name (a common practice in, for example, Germany for similar agencies), but one should nevertheless admit that this is a security organization that is, technologically and professionally speaking, the strongest and the most professional in Croatia, because of one small advantage: In addition to continued counterintelligence and anti-terrorist operational activities, it can also serve as an intelligence organization against its opponents. The SZUP is, therefore, like a reversible coat -- on one side it has a standard (civilian) color, and on the other camouflage. Still, do we really need so many security services? Bearing in mind several external and internal factors, the question is equal to the dilemma of the Croatian citizen earning 10 million Croatian dinars a month asking: "Must I pay tax?"
