But, if India wants Pakistan to accept the current situation in Kashmir as it is, Pakistan is not ready for it. Whenever India accuses Pakistan of interfering in occupied Kashmir, Pakistan puts up a proposal to have the LOC under U.N. supervision. But, India does not accept it. India also does not want the representatives of human rights organizations to visit occupied Kashmir and see for themselves the human rights violations there. Pakistan has positively responded to every positive proposal and will continue to do so. India should have the moral courage within itself to accept the proposal to let the LOC be supervised by the U.N. forces or the member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. Pakistan is also ready to consider the reduction of forces along the LOC.
