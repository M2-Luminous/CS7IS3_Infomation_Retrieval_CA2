FR941206-1-00127 FR941206-1-00010 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 76 [MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266 and 93&hyph;215, FCC 94&hyph;286] Cable Television Act of 1992 AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Seventh Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. SUMMARY: This seventh notice of proposed rulemaking is one segment of the Sixth Order on Reconsideration, Fifth Report and Order and Seventh Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding. The final rules adopted in this decision may be found elsewhere in this issue. In the Seventh Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission sought comment on whether cable operators electing to use the per channel adjustment under the Commission's new rules should be allowed to take the 7.5% mark-up on programming cost increases for channels added to the system before May 15, 1994; and whether operators electing to use the current going forward rules should be permitted to pass-through the 7.5% mark-up on new programming cost increases after the initial mark-up on programming costs of new channels. The intended effect of this proposal is to eliminate the pass-through to subscribers of unnecessary cost increases. DATES: Comments are due on or before January 13, 1995 and reply comments are due on or before February 13, 1995. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC, 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul D'Ari or Joel Kaufman, (202) 416&hyph;0800. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is the proposed rules segment of the Commission's Sixth Order on Reconsideration, Fifth Report and Order and Seventh Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266 and MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215, FCC 94&hyph;286, adopted November 10, 1994, and released November 18, 1994.

The Commission's existing rate regulation rules permit operators to increase rates by a per channel amount when channels are added to basic service tiers (BSTs) and cable programming service tiers (CPSTs), with the per channel amount decreasing as the number of channels on a system increases. 47 CFR 76.922(e). These rules also permit operators to pass through to subscribers the costs of obtaining programming plus a 7.5% mark-up on new programming costs. 47 CFR 76.922(d)(3)(xi). B. The revised regulations adopted pursuant to the Sixth Order on Reconsideration and Fifth Report and Order provide that operators may adjust their rates after December 31, 1994, for channel additions occurring after May 14, 1994. Operators electing to use the new rules will be allowed to take a per channel mark-up of up to 20 cents for each channel added to cable programming service tiers (``CPSTs). Operators may make rate adjustments under this rule at any time during the three-year period beginning on January 1, 1995. They may not make per channel adjustments to monthly rates totalling more than $1.20 per subscriber over the first two years of the three-year period for new channels added on CPSTs or by more than $1.40 over the full three-year period. Operators may use any portion of the Operator's Cap to recover license fees associated with adding new channels to CPSTs. In addition, operators may recover an additional amount of not more than 30 cents per subscriber per month for license fees associated with adding new channels during the first and second years the Operator's Cap is in effect. In the third year, license fees will not be subject to special rules, but will be subject to the general rate rules. C. In addition, the Commission determined that operators electing to use the 20 cent per channel adjustment may not take the 7.5% mark-up on programming cost increases, including retransmission consent fees and copyright fees incurred for carriage of broadcast signals, for channels added on or after May 15, 1994. The Commission made this determination because its analysis indicates that the 20 cent per channel adjustment will provide full and fair compensation to operators adding new channels to CPSTs. Discussion D. The Commission believes that for operators using the per channel adjustment of up to 20 cents, maintaining the 7.5% mark-up on programming cost increases for channels offered before May 15, 1994, may no longer be necessary given the total incentive structure provided in the revised going forward rules. In addition, the 7.5% mark-up on such channels may create an artificial incentive for the operator to continue to offer programming that the operator would not otherwise continue to offer. For these reasons, the Commission tentatively concludes that the 7.5% mark-up is unnecessary for such operators with respect to increases in programming costs for channels offered before May 15, 1994. The Commission solicits comment on whether operators electing to use the per channel adjustment of up to 20 cents under the new rules should be allowed to take the 7.5% mark-up on increases in programming costs, including retransmission consent fees and copyright fees incurred for carriage of broadcast signals, for channels added before May 15, 1994. If the Commission decides that such operators may not take a 7.5% mark-up on increases in programming costs, it will not consider requiring cable operators to prospectively remove from rates any 7.5% mark-up added prior to the effective date of a final rule on this issue. E. The Commission believes that the 7.5% mark-up on new programming costs when channels are initially added to a system ought be preserved for systems that continue to use the existing going forward rules because the 7.5% mark-up is an important part of the total package of incentives to add new programming under the existing rules. The Commission's rules permitting operators to pass through external costs are generally intended to compensate for added costs outside the operators' control and not to provide an additional mark-up without a clear policy purpose. In contrast to the situation where the goal of providing incentives to add new programming services justifies a mark-up, there appears to be no strong reason to allow a mark-up programming cost increases for a service already being offered. The Commission therefore solicits comment on whether operators electing to use the current going forward rules should be permitted to pass-through the 7.5% mark-up on programming cost increases after the initial mark-up on the programming cost of new channels. The Commission will not, however, consider prospectively removing from rates any 7.5% mark-up that was reflected in rates prior to our reaching a decision on this issue.
