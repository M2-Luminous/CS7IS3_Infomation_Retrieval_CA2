The corresponding law, taking to effect from July 1, was adopted today by the State Duma (lower house) of the Russian parliament. The new minimum wage in the state-run sector will be provided by corresponding budget sources, whereas all other companies and agencies should ensure it from their own sources, the law stated. Labour Minister Gennadiy Melikyan, speaking before the Duma, noted that only 3.5 per cent of Russians live off the minimum wage. According to the minister, the survival minimum (what the West calls poverty line--TASS) for Russia amounts now to 72 thousand roubles. The new law is to be submitted for approval to the Federation Council (upper house) of the Russian parliament.
