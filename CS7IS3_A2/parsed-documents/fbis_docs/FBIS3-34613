Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that even if the loopholes in the Oslo agreement have been closed, the agreement with the Palestinians still entails great risks. Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan said that he does not believe that the Arabs will be able to keep the agreement. Eytan anticipates further terrorist attacks and a struggle over the roads. Moledet chairman Rehav'am Ze'evi said that in Cairo, Peres and Sarid had signed a capitulation agreement which did not even meet Israel's security needs. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0830 GMT on 10 February reports that "the leaders of the Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip are now holding an emergency meeting to decide upon their reaction to the Cairo agreement. Knesset Member Ran Kohen, the chairman of the Meretz Knesset faction, firmly rejected what he called the right- wing's intimidation campaign against the Cairo agreement. Kohen said that the agreement was a huge historic achievement for Israel and for Zionism, because in addition to opening the road to the implementation of peace, the Palestinians had for the first time accepted security arrangements on the basis of Israel's positions and with the Israeli Army retaining overall responsibility."]
