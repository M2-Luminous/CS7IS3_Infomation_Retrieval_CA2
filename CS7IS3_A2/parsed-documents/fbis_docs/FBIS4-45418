In a telephone interview, Morales Lechuga remarks: "It is obvious that the Baja California authorities have been protecting the Arellano Felix group since November 1992." He adds: "The incidents in Tijuana are hard evidence. Neither the Attorney General's Office [PGR] nor Baja California society has any further doubt that the state justice system is responsible for the protection given to drug traffickers, and for the wave of violence associated with that phenomenon." Just days before the arrest of the Baja California state deputy attorney general, Sergio Ortiz Lara, Morales Lechuga gave his version of the relationship between the Baja California government and the Attorney General's Office while he headed that department. From the beginning of his administration, the drug trafficking problem has hounded Ruffo, who even told Lechuga confidentially that "certain persons had approached his family. He did not say much, but referred to drug traffickers. He told me this incidentally, in a casual manner, while waiting for a hearing. He never made any further comment about it." [passage omitted] Lechuga gave his own account: "It is public knowledge that, during the investigation of the incidents that occurred at a discotheque in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, credentials in the names of drug dealers were found, accrediting them as Baja California Judicial Police agents. This was officially reported to that state's attorney general and governor (there is even a specific report in the respective preliminary investigation), so that the authenticity of those credentials and, particularly, how they were obtained, could be investigated. No results of the investigation have yet been published. Of course, if there is a culpable default, it will have to be established based on the previous data that have been reported nationally. "Furthermore, the Baja California governor would have to be asked whether he is familiar with Article 120 of the Constitution, because that regulation requires the local executive branch to ensure compliance with federal laws. In other words, if he knew of the existence of violations or crimes, he should have acted, and not merely given notice. He is the responsible official elected by the population for that purpose, and is answerable to the nation for anything that occurs in his state's territory. We officials do our duty with acts and results, and not with alleged charges and reports. "All of us, including the aforementioned governor and the Baja California population, would fully agree that the violence, killing, and drug trafficking have increased since his government took office. Part of the explanation lies with a close relative of the state's chief executive." [passage omitted] According to Morales Lechuga, Ruffo "minimized or underestimated the state's serious insecurity problem. His explanation always was that the drug traffic was a federal responsibility. "The governor acted contrary to Article 120 of the Constitution, which not only authorizes, but obliges Mr. Ruffo to relinquish his pretense, so as to fight and take action against the drug traffic." [passage omitted] "Governor Ruffo never provided us with evidence or proof regarding murders connected with the drug traffic. I would be satisfied if he had explained to me the origin of his Judicial Police credentials, and the way in which those drug traffickers, later killed in Puerto Vallarta, obtained them. "We are striving to counteract antisocial behavior, not against the governor, nor on behalf of anyone in particular." [passage omitted] PROCESO: Governor Ruffo also complained that the Federal Judicial Police were involved in the drug traffic and in the disappearance of the existing information. Lechuga: I made that statement publicly and privately. I told him several times: Any PGR public servant who commits violations of the law should be the object or subject of the pertinent legal procedure. The fact that one holds a federal position is no license for impunity, nor for undermining the power of the local authorities. I asked that of all the governors: that they not be permissive, just as I was not. Do you know how many remands we made to courts for crimes of PGR public servants? PROCESO: No, I do not know. Lechuga: It was 376, between 1 June 1991 and 31 December 1992. We remanded 258 Federal Judicial Police agents, 26 commanders, 34 group chiefs, 34 agents of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, and 24 civil servants from other PGR areas. Ruffo Should Be Investigated: Clark Alfaro Moreover, the Binational Human Rights Center (CBDH) petitioned the Baja California Congress (for the second time in less than three months) to investigate Governor Ruffo and the state's now ex-attorney general, Juan Francisco Franco Rios, "for concealing and tolerating the drug traffic." According to Victor Clark Alfaro, director of the CBDH (a nongovernmental agency in Tijuana), the petition is based "on its own investigations, on meetings with high-ranking officials of the Attorney General's Office, and on investigations 3355/DGM93 and 540/94, opened by the PGR." On 9 March, the CBDH petitioned the local congress for the first time to investigate the governor and the then still state attorney general. Ruffo's investigation was requested "for acting irresponsibly, concealing information, and not taking appropriate action"; and Franco's, for the confrontation between State Judicial agents under his command and Federal Judicial agents, on 3 March, in Tijuana. Now, with the arrest of Deputy Attorney General Ortiz Lara, the CBDH claims to be "encouraged to see the PGR finally deciding to intervene in the matter with two investigations. For the first of them, at least, it has all the evidence at hand for taking appropriate action against Ruffo's officials." It admits that this move is being made "in a highly dangerous environment, with politico-electoral connotations, because anything associated with corruption in Baja California assumes a different dimension, since it has the first PAN [National Action Party] government in the country.... Until yesterday, that had deterred the PGR from acting."
