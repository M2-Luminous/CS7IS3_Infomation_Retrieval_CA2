Accordingly, it has been holding in-depth discussions with the United States regarding the issue. The government's view is based on the fact that the replacement of fuel rods by North Korea has not yet reached the point in which the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] call for the selection and preservation of some fuel rods would not be met. Therefore, the ROK and U.S. Governments agree on the holding of the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks when IAEA inspectors -- who are scheduled to visit North Korea on 17 May -- satisfactorily complete their additional inspections or follow-up [husok] inspections. The government has decided, however, to urge North Korea through many channels, including North Korea-U.S. working-level contacts and China, not to carry out the work of replacing fuel rods any further. A high-level government official said on 14 May that "although North Korea said it had begun replacing fuel rods at its nuclear reactor, it is not sure to what extent it has done so."
