Airline tickets already may be adjusted using URV's. Afterward, it will be fuel, electricity, and postal rates' turn. Resolution No. 134, signed on 18 March in Brasilia, authorizes the adjustments of airline tickets, using the previous period, that is, on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of every month. The 11 March increase had been postponed waiting for this guideline. Airline companies still are negotiating the conversion of airline tickets into URV's. Two weeks ago, airline companies increased tickets 26.33 percent. The other rates also will be indexed using URV's, but they will still be expressed in real cruzeiros to avoid losses in the collections by state-run companies over the conversion [into URV's] by using the average prices of the last four months of 1993, as determined by Provisional Measure No. 434. Finance Ministry experts reported that the next increase will be implemented in April, already using the URV's variation. This regulation is not compulsory for the rates of state-run companies. The federal government will monitor the variation in these state rates to prevent abusive adjustments. In Sao Paulo, Finance Ministry special adviser Jose Milton Dallari on 21 March asked the manufacturers of car paints -- Basf, Renner, and Akzo -- for an explanation of prices in URV's between 15- and 20-percent higher than the average prices of the last four months of 1993. The entrepreneurs told him the increase was caused by a price increase in vinyl acetate, a raw material manufactured only by Rhodia. Dallari asked them to send him a cost sheet by 25 March. If the explanations are unconvincing, he said, this case may be submitted to the free competition defense organizations for consideration under the law on oligopolies control. The Finance Ministry adviser also met meat-packing plant owners and transportation company executives. The National Association of Overland Transportation Companies reported that it already has been implementing the adjustments using the URV's for one week with an 11- to 20-percent reduction in freight charges, depending on the cargo, and the removal of financial costs and inflation adjustments. A National Association of Overland Transportation Companies director said the reduction will be maintained if the manufacturing companies do the same. In Dallari's opinion, most entrepreneurial circles "still are negotiating and seeking an agreement." He said it is quite likely that by late March most prices will still be adjusted by using real cruzeiros. In Rio de Janeiro, pharmaceutical representatives on 21 March delivered to Finance Ministry experts in Rio de Janeiro documents with information on the variation of their prices since the URV's implementation. The data will be reviewed by Jose Milton Dallari, who already has declared that he believes the price adjustments of medicines are high and that he will ask for a revision. The meeting had been scheduled to begin at 1400 with the presence of Dallari, who was delayed in Sao Paulo. At Dallari's request, the meeting was not canceled, but his absence somewhat minimized the meeting's importance. Some important pharmaceutical entrepreneurs preferred not to attend the meeting.
