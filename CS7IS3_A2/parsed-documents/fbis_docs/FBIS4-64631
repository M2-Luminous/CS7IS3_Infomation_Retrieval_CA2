The spokesman made his statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation commenting on a letter from Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas to the UN secretary general. In his letter Denktas criticizes the UN envoys and says that he is ready to continue with the talks if the proposals included in the UN documents are changed. The spokesman said: In his letter, Denktas is again trying to implement a policy of delaying. The Greek Cypriot side's actions and demarches will be made after the UN secretary general submits his report and the National Council confers. At the National Council, President Glavkos Kliridhis will explain his thoughts for discussion and decisionmaking.
