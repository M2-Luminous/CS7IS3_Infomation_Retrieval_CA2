Yar'adua, who was second in command under Nigeria's military regime of 1976-1979, Ibrahim Babangida, is claiming 50 million naira (about 229,000 U.S. dollars) in damages for his arrest and detention at the weekend. In the suit filed at a high court in Kaduna, northern Nigeria, on Tuesday [15 February], the retired general, described his detention as "unlawful, illegal and unconstitutional". Family sources said he was arrested soon after he arrived home from a foreign trip. There has still to be an official comment on his detention, apart from a press statement credited to a defence spokesman in Lagos Wednesday. "It is the government that knows the intention of the detained general and it is the same government that can account for its actions", the spokesman, Brigadier General Fred Chijuka was quoted by the statement as saying. The current problems Gen. Yar'adua is facing can be traced back to a press conference he gave on 12 January. At that news conference, he asked the three-month-old government of Gen. Abacha to hand over to a national government by December of this year. Police authorities in Lagos reacted a day later by warning Nigerian politicians against "utterances capable of threatening government's good intention to bequeath a viable democratic institution in the country". Pro-democracy groups have criticized the detention of the general, who was a leading Social Democratic Party (SPD) presidential candidate before being disqualified because of what the then military government of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida described as widespread electoral fraud by the aspirants. Meanwhile, the retired Nigerian head of state, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, who prosecuted the 30-month Biafra civil war (1967-70), to keep Nigeria one, has stressed that the country's unity was not negotiable. Gowon, toppled in 1975 after nine years in power, told journalists in Minna, northern Nigeria, Tuesday after visiting former head of state, Gen. Babangida, that "whatever we do, this nation is more important than any of us and we must continue to keep it one". He condemned public statements that could inflame passion and hasten the disintegration of the country.
