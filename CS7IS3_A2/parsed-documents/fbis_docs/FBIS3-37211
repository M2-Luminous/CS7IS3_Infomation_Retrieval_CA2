Churkin met in particular with Yashushi Akashi, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative in the former Yugoslavia, and General Michael Rose, commander of the U.N. Force. "The purpose of my arrival in Zagreb can be formulated in one phrase: to secure that there are no air strikes in the area of Sarajevo. This is a dual task, though. The siege of Sarajevo must be lifted", Churkin told ITAR-TASS. Asked what would be Russia's actions if air strikes are not avoided, Churkin emphasised that "everything will depend on a specific situation". "If air strikes are delivered under conditions which we would deem unjustified, that would have inevitable consequences for our relations with the rest of the world," he said, pointing out that this is his personal point of view. On Tuesday Churkin is to visit Sarajevo and then return to Zagreb for a continuation of the talks.
