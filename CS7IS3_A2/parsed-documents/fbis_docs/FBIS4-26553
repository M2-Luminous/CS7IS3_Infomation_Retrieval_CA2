About 16 newly-recruited staff will join the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office in the face of the increasing workload on transitional matters. The extra staff will mainly work under the two major departments on political and economic affairs, headed by Xu Ze and Zhang Liangdong. At present, each department has about 20 staff who help formulate China's strategy on matters ranging from the airport plan, localisation of civil service and Joint Liaison Group issues. The extra staff have been recruited in the past few months following a decision by the Chinese Government to increase staffing of the office in view of the growing workload. Sources said the new recruits were all fresh graduates from major universities in Beijing. "Of course, it's most ideal to have people who have already had some experience on Hong Kong affairs transferred from other departments. But the pool of experienced staff is really too small. We can only look for fresh university graduates," an official said. The official said the extra staff would have to be given training on the background to the Hong Kong issues. He said the additional staff would help strengthen the research team of the two departments and the sup porting team for the Preliminary Working Committee. Officials said the staff in crease was imperative because workloads had risen in the lead-up to 1997.
