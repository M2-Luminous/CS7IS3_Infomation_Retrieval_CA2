First of all, all of us should answer simple questions honestly. Why has Ukraine, one of the richest countries of Europe, ended up in a catastrophic economic situation, with a majority of its population turned into beggars? Why does the wage of a working person range between $55 and $90 at present in the Baltic republics of the former Soviet Union, whereas it is dozens of times less in our country? A tremendous deficit of the state budget is the main cause of our misfortune. Unfortunately, our government has long been living beyond its means. Some politicians and members of the government are now assuring the people that commercial banks are to blame for high prices, a shortage of goods, and the buildup of inflation. All of this is slander. Commercial banks that have been established control only about 10 percent of all state finance. They have never carried out credit emissions; they mainly serve market structures. Moreover, it is precisely the established commercial banks that provided and still provide services to citizens that protect their savings in a hyperinflationary environment far better than the state. They accuse the commercial banks of generating great profits, assuring us that the banks are "getting fat." This does not conform to the truth, either. The greatest profits have been derived through the circulation of the "free-of-charge" emission money which our banks do not have anything to do with directly. We are warning you, citizens, that the current offensive against the established commercial bank is an offensive against private enterprises. It is the abandonment of the market-economy path which all of humanity is taking. Our people have been drenched in the blood of the revolution, and have survived famine and Stalin's dungeons. Do we really have to once again go through all the torture in order to ascertain that market-based regulation of the economy is the most effective, and that it is impossible without commercial banks? Inflation is not a natural disaster; it is created by governments and the economic forces that stand behind them. In view of this, a government of social accord with a market orientation, which will be capable of containing inflation, is an urgent necessity. The Supreme Soviet has been passing laws which have been mostly prepared by the government. However, our prime ministers have demanded additional extraordinary powers all along. As we see it, the reason has been that people who were not familiar with market-economy relations undertook to provide state leadership. They, rather than the commercial banks have led the people of Ukraine into the current catastrophic situation. We understand that the people are tired, and pessimism prevails in our society. However, under the circumstances we call on you to support people with market-oriented thinking rather than demagogues who are promising you social equality for the n-th time. Commercial banks have now been turned into a target for dubious economic experiments. As a result of this, the state loses enormous funds, and the life of the people worsens still more. Credit "ceilings," bans on credit extension, and other nonsensical ideas have put commercial banks and enterprises in a very difficult situation. It is precisely for this reason that store shelves have become barren, heat and light are in short supply, and transportation operates poorly. Economic problems are being solved in an administrative manner; a regulatory and legislative base for the development of entrepreneurship is lacking. However, we believe that reason, professionalism, and balance will ultimately prevail. We call on all citizens who are not indifferent to a future prosperous Ukraine to pool their efforts in order to create, rather than destroy the economy. We are also addressing our colleagues with a proposal to hold a meeting of all Ukrainian bankers shortly in order to consolidate positions regarding the restoration of the credit and finance system. A group of bankers from Kiev has agreed to immediately begin the development of the drafts of key laws, and is prepared to take part in the development of a government program for overcoming the economic catastrophe. We consider it feasible to create the Kiev Banking Union which will have an opportunity to respond quickly and effectively to all changes in the life of the state and its capital city. In the future, commercial banks will continue efforts to maintain and enhance the well-being of their depositors, proving by their deeds that commercial banks serve the good of Ukraine and each of its citizens. On the eve of the New Year we wish you, fellow countrymen, happiness and accord! [Signed] O. Assonov--the Yunivers Joint-Stock Investment Bank S. Arzhevitin--the Azhio Joint-Stock Bank V.
