Members of the two delegations arrived at the meeting lounge at approximately 1130. This meeting was preceded by a meeting between heads of the two delegations Dr. Nabil Sha'th and Major General Amnon Shahaq. The head of the Palestinian delegation reiterated that it is possible to resolve pending issues within three weeks. He expressed the hope that the Israeli side will also be ready. [Sha'th] Our expectations are that we are here to write the final agreement. We should end this work in three weeks in the interest of our peoples. I believe that if intentions are good, three weeks will be enough time to reach an agreement that will then be submitted to our political leaderships, for amendment, approval, and then finally for signing so the implementation of this agreement can begin. [Abu-Zayid] Israeli sources ruled out reaching an agreement within three week, saying it will take three months? [Sha'th] In this case, you should ask who is ready and who is not ready. He who says that we need three months violates the agreement and does not want to finalize it. The agreement should have been finalized on 13 December. However, it was postponed due to certain circumstances. We were ready to finalize the agreement in one week. So, what happened to make this take three months. I believe that this is a test of both sides' intentions? [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, are you just going to discuss formal issues at today's meeting? [Sha'th] There are things concerning essence and others concerning form. In fact, we have not yet discussed the form. Therefore, we should write the agreement in a way that will enable us to implement it concerning everything on which we have agreed. We should use the time to discuss what we do not agree on. [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, how would al-Asad-Clinton meeting affect the talks? [Sha'th] I believe that the al-Asad-Clinton summit will succeed in returning Syria to the peace process. This is something very positive, and we are looking forward to it because we want the entire peace process to succeed--all its tracks--not only the Palestinian track. When the al-Asad-Clinton summit succeeds to return Syria to the peace process, Lebanon and Jordan will also go back to the peace process. At that time, we will all be working in the same direction; something which supports the entire peace process. [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, what are the points on which differences are centered? [Sha'th] The truth is that this expression was the result of the talks that were held in Cairo, Oslo, and Paris. At that time, we decided to focus on the issues of crossings, the size of the Jericho area, and the area of the Israeli settlements and the security area surrounding them in the Gaza Strip. We believe that we made progress concerning these three issues although we did not reach full agreement on them. However, there are other issues on which we must concentrate this time other than these three issues. I believe that these three issues, in addition to other points, such as security on land and in the sea, security on roads, and the transfer of civil powers, are all issues on which we can reach an agreement. This is not impossible. We knew that these issues were difficult when we began these negotiations, and we also knew that they were difficult when we signed the Washington agreement. So, there is no surprise here. Differences should not surprise anyone, for negotiations constitute a means to reach an agreement on points of disagreement through both sides' flexibility based on the principles we set in Washington. I believe that this is possible.
