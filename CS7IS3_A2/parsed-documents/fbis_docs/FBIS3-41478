The year 1974 marked the end of a cruiser of the Krest class which burned down in the North Sea; 450 sailors were lost. In April 1987 a small rocket-armed boat blew up; 39 sailors died. Tragedies on Soviet Navy ships were a common occurrence. In the old days, the truth was simply covered up. The large destroyer Otvazhnyy sank on 30 August 1974 in the Black Sea, near Sevastopol. Ammunition stores blew up and fire kept rescue ships from coming close. According to some information, hundreds of sailors perished. Some time in the 1970's, a Soviet diesel boat also went down. The helicopter carrier Moskva caught fire several times. First time in 1971-72, then in 1989. In 1969, it hit itself with its own torpedo; thank God, it failed to explode. In the winter of 1991, the engine on board the large destroyer Admiral Zakharov blew up near Vladivostok. The fire burned for 31 hours. Overall, from 1945 to 1989, some 200 serious accidents took place in the Soviet Navy. While the destruction of navy boats was often the result of general negligence, unreliability of Soviet military technology and simple accidents, the dumping of ammunition into the sea occurred deliberately and maliciously--against the people and against nature. Until 1989, the USSR Ministry of Defense had a secret order which permitted the dumping of ammunition into the sea. From February to May 1956, chemical weapons were transported from Obozerskaya Station in Arkhangelsk Oblast to Severodvinsk. They were unloaded and dumped in the White Sea. A year later, similar weapons were dumped around Spitsbergen. In 1960-61, from Saratov Oblast to Pechenega came trainloads of bombs weighing 100 kilograms, 250 kilograms and 500 kilograms, of the 1939 vintage. The bombs contained mustard gas, lysite and zarine. Later, using Murmansk merchant marine vessels leased by the USSR Ministry of Defense, those chemical weapons were sunk in the vicinity of Novaya Semlya. Altogether, 183 trainloads of chemical weapons were shipped out of Pechenega. During the past 40 years, metal casings have rusted through. Chemical weapons, like the genie from the fairy tale, got out of the bottle. The star fish were first to feel it. At the Cape of Dvina alone, 6 million of them were washed up. Then came the turn of the humans. According to data provided by Correspondent Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences A.Yablokov, advisor to President B.Yeltsin on environmental issues, mortality around Arkhangelsk has risen since 1991 by 10 percent. At the bottom of the Baltic Sea lie between 100,000 tons and 300,000 tons of poisonous compounds, mainly zarine and mustard gas. The Navy began sinking containers and weapons in the late 1940's, and continued until 1965. It was done mainly in the vicinity of the Kristianse island and 56 miles south-west of the town of Liepaja, at the depth of just a few dozen meters, in the area of 780 square kilometers. One shot of mustard gas diluted in 50 cubic meters of salt water is capable of killing a horse. Specialists predict that if, God forbid, the gas seeps out of the rusted casings and shells, the total amount would be sufficient to kill the Baltic Sea four times over. Danger threatens the 30 million people who live along the shores of the Baltic. The deadline for the weapons is drawing near: only 10 years remain. The number of victims is already growing. Some 100 Danish fishermen became disabled after catching old chemical shells in their nets. The same happened to fishermen from Klaipeda. Who will be the next victim? The sea often washes pieces of yellow phosphorus onto the shore. God forbid you pick one up, mistaking it for amber. Soviet strategists did not neglect other seas, either, namely the Barents and Karsk seas. Orders were issued to dump there nuclear waste from nuclear-powered submarines. Containers with liquid and solid nuclear wastes were transported on the same Murmansk Merchant Marine vessels and dumped into the sea; as they did not sink, they where blasted with assault rifles. Somewhere here is the final resting place of the expired engine from the nuclear-powered ice breaker Lenin. According to Greenpeace, in the vicinity of Novaya Zemlya lie tens of thousands of containers with radioactive materials; the Soviet Northern Fleet annually dumped into the sea 10,000 cubic meters of liquid and 200,000 cubic meters of solid wastes in different stages of nuclear decay. In the Karsk Sea, 13 to 20 Soviet nuclear reactors have been dumped, some still containing nuclear fuel. Total radioactive pollution of the northern seas by the Soviet Union reaches 2.2-3.2 million curie, which is between 2 and 4 times higher than the level of harm caused to the Atlantic by Western countries. In May 1941, Soviet sailors dumped mustard gas, which was no longer needed at military bases, into the Sea of Japan, not far from Vladivostok, at the depth of only 1 kilometer. On 9 October 1990 the Tsezar Kunikov was loaded at the port of the Kamish-Burunskiy iron ore complex in Kerch with unused ammunition. On orders from the technical administration of the Black Sea Fleet, it was transported to the ship from one of the military warehouses in Kerch. The environmental protection agency wanted to intervene, but it was rebuffed. The cargo was dumped in the Black Sea at the depth of 2 kilometers; according to some data, it has been done more than once. What has been done cannot be undone, says ancient philosopher Theognides. But what could be done is find out what had been dumped, punish the guilty, forbid such actions in the future and raise the weapons from the bottom of the sea and discharge them. But the leadership of the former UkSSR State Committee on the Environment (V.Filonenko, chairman; I.Lyakh, first deputy; and V.Cherednychenko, head of the water resources protection department) took no steps in that direction. Only an investigative commission was set up, without informing either the government or the press. A report was sent to Moscow, to the USSR State Committee on the Environment, to Deputy Director V.Kostrin, numbered 11-S and dated 26 February 1991. But there, another reorganization was underway at the time and no answer came to Kiev. (Former Admiral Kasatonov, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, later officially admitted that weapons of a certain type were dumped into the Black Sea, quadrant 72-73, without the sanction of environmental protection authorities.) Highly placed protectors of the environment in Ukraine calmed down. They kept their well-paid positions. For example, Lyakh was not only a deputy minister but also chief state inspector for environmental protection issues. According to the Sevastopol newspaper OSTROV KRYM, in June 1942, on orders of Commander F.Oktyabrskyy, ``poisonous compounds of military use''--mainly mustard gas--were dumped by Soviet sailors in the Black Sea, around Kazachya Bukhta, at the depth of up to 50 meters. The terrible genie is buried at the bottom of the Black Sea. In the Baltic and the White Sea it will come out in 10 years. How long will it be for Ukraine? How One Admiral Scared Three Ministers One day Podgornyy visited a submarine from the Northern Fleet and wrote down in the log: ``I was here. Very impressive. Nikolay Podgornyy.'' But he would have been even more impressed if he had stopped by the main base of the Black Sea Fleet. Sevastopol harbor. Some 7,000 cubic meters of polluted water and 10 tons of oil flowed into it every 24 hours. Estimate damage: R328,000 at the prices of the time. In the mid-1980s, there were 10 major oil spills. They cost R211,000. In 1990 the damage rose to R1 million. Pollution in the Sevastopol harbor surpasses the acceptable level by 30 to 100 times. In June 1988, it was 2,000 times above normal. Add to this some 10 military boats and submarines, half-sunken and rusting there. Fleet fuel base at Inkerman. Who ever said that there are shortages of oil in Ukraine? There is a veritable source here, a magic lake the size of Independence Square in Kiev. And there is even more under ground. Where did it come from? At first, the Navy blamed the Romans, who supposedly stored the Greek fire here during the Second Punic War. Then they put the blame on the Nazis. But the truth is different. In the 1970s, some fool thought of storing oil in abandoned mine shafts: an inexpensive and practical solution. Apparently, he was even decorated for his ingenuity. But in time the shafts developed cracks and the oil seeped into the sea. And there is more. A proposal is being discussed to turn the Sevastopol harbor into a terminal for shipping oil to foreign money bags. Not only the harbor, but Lake Donuzlav, may be polluted with oil. The base at Inkerman has been poisoning the sea since 1904. Especially strongly from the mid-1950's. But environmental protection authorities discovered this only in the mid-1980's. Incidentally, the famous Central Committee and USSR Council of Ministers Resolution No. 42, dated 16 January 1976, ``On Measures to Prevent Pollution of the Black and Azov Seas'' died in infancy. 26 March 1976. The Navy supply ship Vasiliy Golovin, upon leaving Artbukhta, secretly dumped sewerage. This was noticed by some tourists who reported the incident to the State Inspection for the Protection of the Black Sea. The environmentalists confirmed: 24 kilos was dumped, and damages amounted to R5,000. But they were not allowed onto the military ship; the Navy itself wrote a report declaring the the Vasiliy Golovin caused no harm to the sea. Early 1992. The beautiful cruiser Moskva spilled fuel into the sea. Fortunately, it did not form a film but spilled as a wave. But, once again, no one was allowed to investigate: the excuse of secrecy never failed. Meanwhile, the military prosecutor's office was asleep. Its full official name was the Military Prosecutor's Office of the Black Sea Fleet: they would not be sticking their necks out. Yu. Shcherbak, the former minister of environmental protection of Ukraine, kept sending angry cables to the commander of the Black Sea, but the old salt did not even blink. The state spent considerable sums to equip Navy ships with special containers for refuse, but the mighty Black Sea Fleet has virtually no ships to collect them. Ships the world over transfer their left-over fuel to special collection boats, but the admirals have few of them, as well. Soviet military boats, unlike Western ones, have no environmental protection equipment and dump all their garbage into the sea. While they often drive their sailors to exhaustion by making them scrub the decks until they shine, mates, captains and admirals at the same time successfully turn the Black Sea into a cesspool. The Sevastopol Navy Plant named after Sergo Ordzhonikidze, the Iron Commissar, quietly dumped sulfuric acid into the Chernaya river. The navy wharf in Nikolaev, Plant imeni 61 Communards, was building the flagship Komsomolets Ukrainy, the pride of the Navy. The ship was not finished, but the Ingul river was polluted with paint, diesel and oil. The well-known resort Kuyalnik is harmed by the navy installation in the village of Krasnosilka. The same happens in Yevpatoria, Kerch, Feodosia, Balaklava, Khersones, Ismail and Nikolaev, in short, everywhere where the Navy has a presence. In the late 1980's, spurred on by perestroyka, two ministers--D.Protsenko, the head of the UkSSR State Environmental Protection Committee, and V.Tkach, the UkSSR minister of water resources--entered into a mild confrontation with Admiral Khronopulo, the commander of the Black Sea Fleet. Please be so kind to forgive us, respected comrade admiral, for disturbing you in your important work, but could you reduce just a little the dumping of oil into the sea? Khronopulo paid them no attention; on the contrary, he apparently ordered his assistants to telephone Kiev and to cut the ministers down to size. What does it matter, nature, if we are protecting the sacred borders of our Motherland? The ministers held their tongues. But soon Dina Yosipivna Protsenko was caught up in the Golsiyskyy forest scandal and was replaced by Viktor Lazarovych Fidonenko, a man who had risen through the ranks of the republic's agricultural industry sector. A new broom sweeps in a new way, and the fresh minister, who had not yet suffered his share of hard knocks, decided to set things straight on the Black Sea. He sent one petition to Sevastopol, then another. He also ordered his services to start catching old salts on the spot, and fining them. This was the response he received from the admiral: Since 1989, the Special Inspection for the Protection of the Black Sea, which is currently under your management, has started to make claims and conduct investigations of the fuel base of the Fleet for the purpose of extracting damages for the pollution of the Sevastopol harbor with oil products. This year, the fuel base has already received three claims totaling R85,800, of which two were reviewed by the state arbitrage commission of the Crimea Oblast (for R9,300), and one by the state arbitrage commission of the UkSSR (for R76,500). In September came yet another claim for the sum of R168,600; another, for R250,000, is being prepared even though the special reserve at the fuel base bears no responsibility for the pollution of the sea with oil products and has experienced no accidental spills... Taking everything stated above into consideration, I request that you, as the head of the UkSSR State Environmental Protection Committee, take all objective circumstances into account and order the Special Inspection for the Protection of the Black Sea to DESIST from submitting complaints and suits against the fuel base of the Fleet... Systematic extortion of large monetary sums from the Fleet for the alleged violations of water protection laws, which were not, objectively, the result of the Fleet's activity, catastrophically reduces the Fleet's ability to contribute to the repair and construction of capital water protection structures. Please inform me of your decision. Admiral M.Khronopulo, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. That was exactly how he signed it, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, without any ``respectfully yours.'' The hint was clear. To poison the life of the environmental protection minister further, he also complained to the Council of Ministers, to Anatoliy Sergeevich Statinov. Viktor Lazarovych Filonenko bit his tongue and began to fear Khronopulo, shifting his efforts to the strengthening of friendly ties with foreign countries. Incidentally, under the new minister of the Environmental Ministry Yuriy Mykolayovych Shcherbak, the position responsible for the protection of the sea disappeared. Out of sight, as the saying goes. As for Khronopulo, he began to ignore the environment altogether. Of the R5.2 million of capital investment funds allocated in 1990 to the Black Sea Fleet, he did not give a kopek for the environment. He postponed the construction of treatment plants in many harbors to the period to the year 2005. At least in the past they used to control oil spills from aircraft, but now this practice was discontinued. And at Foros and other supersecret resorts such overflights were never allowed. Khronopulo has since retired, and has become a business leader. Hold the flag high, Admiral. March 13, 1991. In the Black Sea, at 44.08 northern latitude and 34.37 eastern longitude a heavy oil spill is discovered. Apparently, it was another destoyer that got washed. But while flights are coordinated with the military and the papers signed, the spill moves into the resort area, which are under special security protection and where environmentalists are not allowed within a rifle shot. Today, with the excuse of an ``unhealthy political situation surrounding the Fleet,'' ships have become completely off limits to environmental inspections; Sevastopol captains have now been given a unique opportunity to paint the Black Sea an oil-black color. In the early days of the Russian Navy, legendary Admiral Sinyavin issued a strict order forbidding the pollution of the Don with refuse and sewerage. He understood that defense cannot be the used as an excuse for spoiling the environment. His modern heirs on the Black Sea, while constantly talking about building up the glorious traditions of the Russian Navy, in reality act differently. Dolphins as Torpedoes The No.7 bus goes to Khersones, to Kazachya Bukhta. There, at the outskirts of Sevastopol, a supersecret Navy installation is located, a dolphin aquarium. It opened in 1966. No money was spared: a villa was built and imported equipment was installed. The installation had two goals: two teach military science to dolphins and to entertain the powers that be. The Fleet commander had his private yacht and dacha here. Next door was the Central Committee's resort Foros. Brezhnev and Ustinov came regularly, with their kids, friends and grandchildren, to admire the dolphins. Very exotic. The military goal presented greater difficulties. Dolphins were drafted into military service by certain fishing boats which received the sanction of local fishing inspections. Their catching methods were barbaric, causing great losses. Sometimes up to 80 percent of the catch was lost. At the Sevastopol aquarium, some 50 dolphins, beluga whales and sea lions began guarding navy bases and anchorages against enemy commandos, clearing sea lanes of mines, searching and lifting weapons from the bottom of the sea, destroying ships and commandos and repairing river dams. The imperialist tricks had to be guarded against not only on the ground and in the air, but under water, as well. The idea was as follows. Special buoys would be installed along the perimeter of the base. A dolphin would swim to it, press a button, get a fish and continue on. If it noticed enemy divers, it would shoot at them with an explosive packet and get away. An explosion--and the enemy commandos are no more. And what about the dolphin? The idea was barbarically stupid. What if the dolphin gets ill or confused and blows up its own boat. Or shoots a wrong diver? Each action provokes counteraction. Offensive weapons produce defensive weapons. The enemy, suspecting a possible attack from dolphins, seals, sea lions, the Loch Ness monster or any other creature with a tail, may simply poison the given section of the sea. Intelligent and kind dolphins, which have been registered in the Red Book, and their friends would perish. But the admirals do not care. The goal has been set, the task has determined, the funds have been allocated. Let us go fishing, to catch more dolphins. According to our information, bases where sea animals used to carry out their military service, or where they may continue to serve today, are spread throughout the former USSR: in the Far East, in Murmansk Oblast and in the town of Dalniye Zelentsy, where apparently experiments on seals were conducted. It is sad that the evolution of our admirals' conscience lags behind the development of technology and the progress of reason. The Americans have long given up on Navy dolphins. But not we.
