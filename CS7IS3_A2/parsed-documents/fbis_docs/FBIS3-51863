I have always tried to make decisions that would guarantee security for the population. With determination, I opened the path for a peaceful solution of the conflict. The Mexican Army's role prevented the conflict from extending to other parts of Chiapas State. The Army fulfilled its constitutional duty with loyalty and will continue protecting the towns. Today's main task is to seek peace by every means. You have witnessed all the efforts made to attain peace and the results obtained so far. Recent developments call for serious meditation from all of us to change old procedures and methods that did not work. I have come to Chiapas to offer my steadfast support to the state in promoting peace, development, and justice. The most important factor will be a change in state relations. Projects and assistance will be defined by the municipalities, social organizations, and the state's congress, with political guidance from Governor Lopez Moreno. Your plans and most urgent projects will be supported by federal government institutions. Along with meeting your most urgent needs, we will redouble efforts to find in-depth solutions for the state's problems. Our most urgent task is to work together toward reconciliation. We know that when there are major differences, this is not easy, and therefore, we must try again and again. The task we have ahead of us is everyone's responsibility and everyone must share it, including government employees, from the most simple service to the highest responsibility. It is also a task for the people of Chiapas and all of the communities. All of us, with the people of Chiapas united for security, justice, peace, and democracy, will have to establish better relations with Indian communities by modifying priorities and accepting their decisions. The task we have ahead will not be easy. In facing divisions and rancor, humanitarian feelings and new actions of justice must prevail. To each family in Chiapas, I want to express my concern and also my sadness over the recent incidents. At the same time, I assure you we have been and will always be attentive to your needs. We will do whatever we can to guarantee your safety and promote justice, which are the bases for the tranquillity of every family and community. Here we are. I have just held another meeting with the social organizations. We will continue to center our efforts on consolidating peace, justice, and promoting a better climate of coexistence in Chiapas. Together, united, I am sure we can make it. Thank you very much.
