Some provincial leaders, including Ma Guoliang, Wang Xianmin, and Sun Kuiwen, were present at the forum. Leaders of the cities of Shangzhi, Suihua, Zhaodong, Shuangcheng, Nehe, Fujin, Acheng, and Hailin; Mulin and Hulan Counties; and provincial-level departments concerned introduced the experiences in becoming rich ahead of others and the situation of supporting the rich counties to seek wealth. Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee, made a speech at the forum. Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, also made a speech. Sun Weiben pointed out in his speech that the nine counties and cities should lose no opportunities to quicken the pace of industrialization and regard it as a strategic priority of development. The strategy of being the first to become rich was set forth by the provincial party committee and the provincial government at the beginning of 1993 with a view to promoting the development of the county-level economy. Over the past, these nine cities and counties have firmly implemented the strategic arrangements of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, worked in line with their different actual conditions, fruitfully carried out their work, and rapidly promoted the economic development. Their overall economic development level is higher than the national average. These nine cities' and counties' GNP in 1993 rose by 20.7 percent over 1992 and was 15.8 percent higher than the provincial growth rate. Hulan County, which had not been put on the list of nine rich counties, also made sustained and fast increases in the rural economy and industrial production. So, this county was listed as one of the rich counties at this forum. Comrade Sun Weiben pointed out: Viewing the provincial situation, we know that industry is a weak link in the development of the county-level economy. When compared with the national average level, these nine rich cities and counties still have such problems as industry accounts for a small proportion, the development speed is slow, and the economic results are poor. If they do not rapidly make up the deficiency in industry, it will be difficult for them to take the lead in becoming rich and the pace of stepping toward the target of becoming fairly well-off will slow down. Therefore, in line with the thinking of the socialist market economy, the rich counties should accelerate the pace of industrializing the county-level economy and concentrate their energy on vigorously developing town and township enterprises. In regard to the selection of projects, we should persistently link the projects with less investment, fast efficiency, and short construction periods with key large-scale and export-oriented projects with high starting points. In regard to the construction of projects, we should carry out the legal person responsibility system. Simultaneously, we should attend to the reform and reconstruction of the existing enterprises. Persistently in line with the principle of appropriate concentration, we should pay equal attention to the construction of key projects, small industrial zones, and small towns. He said: To ensure the sound development of the county-level economy, we should take the path of making trade, science, agriculture, and industry a coordinate process. In regard to the organizational leadership, we should eliminate the division of administrative work, break the barriers between different regions and between different departments, and exercise organizational leadership according to the principle of systems engineering. In regard to the distribution of benefits, we should organize and set up a community of benefits in line with the principle of equally sharing benefits and risks. Key enterprises should concentrate efforts on reforming the property right system, conducting the technological transformation, improving management, and offering serialized service. Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, urged that the rich counties should thoroughly understand the situation, firmly attend to work, unswervingly implement the strategies of becoming rich ahead of others, take the readjustment of the economic structure as a priority to map out a new pattern for county-level economic development, deepen the reform of the county- level economy, quicken the pace of entering the market economy, increase the dynamics of introducing businessmen and capital, support the fast development of the county-level economy, and accurately handle the relationship between reform and development and stability, and concentrate energy to make development.
