The signing of the treaty by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim in Mexico City on 30 May closed a period that was filled with distrust and misunderstanding. This period was fueled by the Cold War, the Brazil-Argentina rivalry, alignment and misalignment, and an era that -- in the end and hopefully for a long time -- was buried after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Brazil and Argentina signed the treaty in 1967 but did not ratify it. Brazil informed the preparatory commission that it considered that Article 18 of the treaty authorized signatory countries to make nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes including "the detonation of devices similar to the ones used in military weapons." This interpretation clashed with that of the United States, which was outlined during the signing of the additional Protocol 11. This disagreement lasted almost two decades. But the world has undergone such big changes with the deterioration of one of the superpowers -- the Soviet empire -- that it did not make sense to insist on the same points, as if the Cold War were still polluting the diplomatic atmosphere. Everything began with the 1962 missile crisis involving Kennedy and Kruschev, when the USSR attempted to install a nuclear base in Cuba. The Tlatelolco Treaty set a world precedent, hailed by the UN secretary general as a "major factor in the long and difficult fight for disarmament." A treaty had been signed in 1959 to preserve Antarctica. The accumulation of nuclear weapons in space was banned in 1966. The Tlatelolco Treaty made Latin America the first inhabited region to be declared a banned territory for the production of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction. The safeguards demanded by Argentina and Brazil, however, seemed unacceptable to the United States, which did not agree to including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in the "banned area" because of the existence of U.S. bases in those places. Then-Panamanian chief of state Omar Torrijos said the United States kept nuclear weapons in stock in the Panama Canal zone. Furthermore, at the end of the 1960's, when the treaty was signed in the Mexican city of Tlatelolco, Brazil and Argentina were in the middle of an arms race to be the first to detonate a nuclear bomb. The regional thaw began in 1985 when [Presidents] Sarney and Alfonsin visited Argentina's nuclear facilities, reaching a climax when [Presidents] Collor and Menem opened their nuclear facilities to mutual inspection. Last month, two days before Brazil decided to fully join the treaty following the Senate's approval, Strategic Affairs Secretary Admiral Mario Cesar Flores said: "If we do not want to produce a nuclear bomb, there is no reason to fear ratifying the treaty." In the end, as Celso Amorim said in Mexico City, the Tlatelolco Treaty was freely signed by each of the 30 signatory countries "without any imposition whatsoever." Gone is the "Cold War period, full of tension, distrust, and uncertainty," and the denuclearization commitments that "entailed arbitrary limits on the use of nuclear energy and sophisticated technology for legitimate purposes." Brazil could not have done otherwise at a time when the United States and Russia have agreed to no longer aim their long-range missiles at cities and strategic targets in each country. The 21st century has practically begun.
