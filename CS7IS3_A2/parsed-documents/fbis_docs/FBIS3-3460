Li said that China welcomes British businesses to participate in fair competition on the Chinese market and cooperate with their Chinese partners on an equal and mutually-beneficial footing. Li Peng made the remarks at a reception here this afternoon sponsored by Zhou Jue, spokesman for the just-ended Second Session of the National People's Congress. He said that there has been traditional cooperation between Chinese and British businesses and that such cooperation has not been interrupted because of the current state of bilateral relations. Yet, the premier said, sound political and diplomatic relations between the two countries will surely help promote bilateral trade and economic cooperation and, if the two countries do not have good political and diplomatic relations, it is impossible for bilateral economic and trade ties not to suffer at all. Li said that the Chinese side is willing to make efforts to minimize any negative impact on British businesses when they compete on the Chinese market and make investment in the country.
