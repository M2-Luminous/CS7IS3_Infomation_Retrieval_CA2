Last year, China's grain output topped 456 million tons, according to today's PEOPLE'S DAILY. Under a responsibility system which ties farmers' earnings to production, the country's grain harvest surpassed the 400 million ton mark in 1984, with per-capita output of grain approaching 400 kilograms for the first time, the paper said. "Since 1984 market supply and demand has been in near balance, without steep ups or downs," the paper said. Even in 1991, which witnessed severe floodings in eastern China, grain prices remained stable, it added. While ensuring grain production, farmers now pay close attention to the grain quality. As a result, the ratio of quality rice and wheat to total grain output has risen markedly, the paper said. Counties with per-hectare grain production exceeding 15 tons have appeared not only in South China, but also in Shandong, Henan and other provinces in North China. "We still need to redouble our efforts to attain the goal for harvesting 500 million tons a year by the end of the century," the paper said. It expressed the belief that correct government policies and effective measures will enable Chinese farmers to turn out more grain on limited croplands.
