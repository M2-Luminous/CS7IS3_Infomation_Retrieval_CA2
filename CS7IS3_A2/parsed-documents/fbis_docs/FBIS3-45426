Owing to 15 years of economic reforms, China has witnessed significant economic growth that has laid a solid base for the further development of the country's economy. As the world's most populous country, China owns a huge domestic market. With incomes rising, the domestic market has strongly stimulated the country's economy. In 1992, the Chinese put 32.7 per cent of their total income into banks. And last year the figure was even higher. The high savings ratio has enabled banks to lend to projects in the country's infrastructure projects. To reform the existing economic structure, China will pour a large amount of investment into its infrastructure and basic industries. With improvement in the nation's economy, foreigners have become more interested in investing in China. They are bringing with them capital, resources, science and technology, and management expertise. Foreign funds have become a vital ingredient to the country's rapid growth. China now has a large pool of high level managerial, scientific and educational personnel who are working to build up the country. With the country's rapid economic and scientific development, the fear of native talent leaving for overseas opportunities has diminished. After a decade of market reforms and enterprise restructuring, large and medium-sized State-owned firms will play a more important role in the country's booming economy. The co-existence of State-owned enterprises, foreign-funded companies and private firms has also laid a sound basis for the country's rapid economic growth. Although great achievements have been made during the past decade, agriculture is still one of China's weakest sectors. Yet the future is bright for one of the country's primary industries. The government should emphasize agriculture while establishing the market-oriented system. Laws and regulations on farm production should be put into effect and perfected to ensure reform is effective in the countryside. And more money should be channeled into agriculture. Likewise, rural industries should be encouraged to expand production and improve efficiency. Last year China registered the world's highest economic growth rate--13 per cent. However, the overheated economy overshadowed several sectors last year. Over-investment in real estate and development zones caused a disorder in the country's economy. Since last June, the central government has adopted an austerity package to control growth. The measure has been effective in stopping wild speculation and the extending of risky loans. Financial and economic order has also been improved. The austerity measure has enabled China to enjoy a "soft landing" rather than a sudden brake. The government plans a 9 per cent economic growth this year and hopes to keep prices from rising more than 10 per cent. To achieve this goal, the country should speed up reforms in the investment structure. The scale of capital investment should be controlled. The industrial structure and production scale need to be regulated to improve product quality. Quality and marketable products should be developed and distributed. Commercial departments should be encouraged to tap the potential of rural markets to boost sales of industrial products. And production, marketing, storage and transportation of agricultural produce and by-products should be strengthened. It is important for the government to control price hikes of daily necessities to safeguard sustained, healthy and rapid economic growth. The government should be cautious when it increases employee wages so as to avoid inflation that may result from rising incomes. Beside maintaining strong momentum of economic development, efficiency of enterprises should be highlighted. The country should speed up turning the traditional planned economic system into a market one. Enterprises should base decisions on market factors. As living conditions of the Chinese people greatly improve and consuming habits of common people have changed, it is imperative to study the market so as to maintain the balance between supply and demand.
