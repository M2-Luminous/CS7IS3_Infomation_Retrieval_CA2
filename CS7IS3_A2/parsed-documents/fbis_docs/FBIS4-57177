Such were the remarks of Dr. Daniel Cordorniu, vice secretary of the secretariat of nuclear affairs, during a recent news conference. Next week, a meeting will be held in Bogota, Colombia, by the regional cooperation agreement program [programa arreglos regionales cooperativos] for the development of nuclear sciences and technology in Latin America, in which our scientists will play an important role. The secretariat of nuclear affairs carries out hundreds of projects for the use of these techniques in the diagnosis, prevention, and healing of human and animal diseases, animal nutrition and reproduction, the creation of new varieties of useful plants, the rational use of fertilizers, the detection of defects in construction, oil drilling and extraction, studies in environmental contamination, nuclear safety, and many other areas. In November, our country will host two regional workshops on advances in the use of nuclear energy, the development of radiopharmaceuticals, and on the final meeting of the Latin American project for the use of nuclear energy, which for five years has given nations of the region access to advanced technologies in this field. Only four Latin American countries are pursuing research in this field: Cuba, with almost 200 entities that use nuclear techniques; Brazil; Chile; and Venezuela. It is for that reason that, despite pressures and the Yankee blockade, our country was welcomed into the Latin American section of the American Nuclear Society, which in July will hold its annual meeting in Argentina. This important meeting will include a roundtable in which, for the first time, the situation of the nuclear power plants in the region will be analyzed in a multilateral approach. Dr. Daniel Cordorniu also announced that efforts are being made to establish an economic association that will allow resumption of the work at the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant.
