There will be grounds for accusing the Dublin government of folly, if not mischief, in pressing Britain so hard to extend the written dialogue with the Republicans. For now, Sir Patrick's explanation -- that merely answering questions does not represent the "clarification" which he and Mr Major ruled out when Sinn Fein first responded to the Downing Street Declaration -- seems narrowly tenable. The original demand for "clarification" seemed to mean negotiation in all but name -- an impression borne out by Mr Adams's refusal to say exactly what he wanted -- while the IRA continued to exert pressure by means of terrorism. If Mr Adams is still merely playing for time, further disingenuous inquiries will no doubt be forthcoming from Sinn Fein, designed to inch the Government ever closer to the negotiating table. The form of some of Sinn Fein's current questions invites such suspicion. For instance, "What are the means and within what time does Britain expect to see agreement reached between all the Irish people?" is tantamount to demanding a timetable for a united Ireland. On this and other points, Mr Adams should be directed towards the relevant passages of the Declaration. The Government cannot prudently go further, in advance of a permanent IRA cease-fire. There remains the possibility, however, that Britain's uncompromising tactics have started to bear fruit. Sinn Fein may at last realise that negotiation is unattainable without a cease-fire. Answers to his questions may enable Mr Adams, who is alleged to be among the Sinn Fein "peace party", to win over some of the more militant IRA cadres without losing face. If Sir Patrick is merely issuing prolix statements of the obvious, thereby assisting Mr Adams to get off the hook on which he has publicly impaled himself, the risk he is taking might yet prove worthwhile. Dublin's position is less straight-forward. By adding its own voice to Mr Adams's request for answers from Sir Patrick, the Irish government has chosen to vouch for the good faith of this latest initiative. But the Irish government's agreement to use its influence with Britain in this way imposes a duty to apply equal pressure in the other direction. As we have said before, Dublin's principal responsibility now is to use its weight to educate and moderate Nationalist and Republican sentiment, in Ireland and elsewhere, while not upsetting, Ulster Unionist opinion. In the wake of Sir Patrick's replies, Dublin must move to assure Irish and world opinion that Britain will have done all it could reasonably be expected to do.
