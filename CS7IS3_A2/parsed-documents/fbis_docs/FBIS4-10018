Granados: "OAS: Looking for New Clothes"] [Text] Just like an old lady getting ready for a love affair, the OAS is looking for modern clothes and attractive makeup as if to try and erase the unpleasant memories of its past coexistence with military dictatorships and U.S. invasions. The only thing new up to now is its secretary general, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, who was elected to this post on 27 March following an unusually difficult race against Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus. Gaviria, who will have to wait until the end of his term in office on 7 August before assuming the leadership of the OAS, trusts that the hemispheric organization will begin a new chapter of relations "respecting the path chosen by each country...without the disagreements and controversies of the past." The truth is that these are new words, perhaps a preview of what could be a readjustment of this regional mechanism to the new post-Cold War realities, something the United States should also seek with all its Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. But Gaviria's statements seem to head down a path different from that of the theories of U.S. officials linked to this region, such as Michael Skol, regarding a "hemispheric convergence." According to the assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, this convergence is understood as a way to identify with the fundamentals of Washington's foreign policy, in other words: the protection of national security, fomenting economic growth, and encouraging democracy in the world. In statements during a 23 February news conference in Miami, Skol did not say whether the national interests of neighbor countries would be included in this convergence. But he did say that Washington is planning to establish "a relationship in which talks and reciprocity, rather than unilateralism, would be foremost." After the East-West confrontation was buried under the ruins of the Berlin Wall and since the days of Washington's crusade against the advance of communism in that part of the world has changed, this could be the time for the OAS to try and win the credibility it never enjoyed. Toward this end, a majority of countries of the region supported Gaviria, some of them dragged (Foreign Minister Niehaus said pressured) by U.S. influence. Michael McCurry, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department in Washington, explained that the Colombian president "has proven to be committed to democracy, to have solid economic policies, to be a strong leader, and to have the capacity to lead." Now, the former Fresno, California lyceum student faces the not so easy task of recovering the trust the OAS lost in the eyes of several generations of Latin American politicians because of its indolence before the outbreaks of military dictatorships and complicity with the U.S. invasions in the Dominican Republic (1965), Grenada (1983), and Panama (1989), as well as its incapacity during the Falklands conflict (1982) between Argentina and Great Britain. He will also have to do something to solve the OAS' lack of prestige, as expressed when in 1983 countries like Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, and Colombia chose to disregard it and form the Contadora Group as the forum for the discussion and solution of the Central American conflict. This move, considered to be the first genuinely Latin American initiative without U.S. participation, was followed by the creation of other groups in which the White House is not represented, such as the Rio Group, and since 1991, the holding of the annual Ibero-American Summit conference. According to the opinion of various Latin American foreign ministries, Gaviria will have the task of developing the image of "a new OAS," immersed in consolidating democracy on the continent, dedicated to promoting American integration, and willing to become the center for dialogue that will draft the basic guidelines for continental policy. Even though methods for the crusade against communism in this part of the world are a thing of the past, today, the expectations are in confirming if "this new OAS" will be able to adjust itself to the needs of development and the struggle against poverty in the region being sidetracked by controversial theories of "limited sovereignty, humanitarian intervention," and "preventive democracy." These theories were put into practice for the first time in Somalia where thousands of U.S. soldiers played a starring role under the protection of the United Nations. But after the setbacks suffered by those troops in early October 1993, Washington understood that regional groups like the OAS must play a more active role in this type of operations, whether these operations are intended to maintain peace or to supervise the reestablishment of constitutional order. Military and diplomatic experts broached this subject during a meeting in mid-March in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The OAS called the meeting to discuss new measures related to hemispheric security and its results could lead to the creation of a new regional military mechanism that will replace the old structures of the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty, TIAR, and the Inter-American Defense Board, IADB. Previously, a special meeting in Washington in mid-December 1992 approved an amendment to the OAS Charter, sponsored by Argentina, opposed by Mexico, and Jamaica and El Salvador abstained, to the OAS Charter that allows the "suspension" of any member state that disregards the democratically-established norms. The OAS Charter calls for respect for the principles of sovereignty and self-determination of the peoples. Gaviria will now be responsible for proving the practical value of these precepts or seeing if they are just words.
