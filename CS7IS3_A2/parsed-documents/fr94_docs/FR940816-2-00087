FR940816-2-00087 FR940816-2-00067 [Docket No. AB&hyph;333X] Unity Railways Company_Abandonment Exemption_In Allegheny County, PA Unity Railways Company (Unity) has filed a notice of exemption, under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_Exempt Abandonments, to abandon its entire line between survey station 3+50 at Unity Junction and the end of its line at survey station 205+82 at Renton Road, a distance of approximately 3.9 miles, located in Plum Borough, Allegheny County, PA. 1 1 Unity states that it intends to consummate this abandonment on or after August 30, 1994. Because the notice must be filed with the Commission at least 50 days before the abandonment is to be consummated, consummation could not in any event take place before September 13, 1994. See 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(2). As noted subsequently in this notice, however, the exemption will not be effective until September 15, 1994. Unity has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead traffic on the line; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a state or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of a complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic reports), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to government agencies) have been met. Where as here, the carrier is abandoning its entire line, the Commission does not normally impose labor protection under 49 U.S.C. 10505(g) unless the evidence indicates the existence of a corporate affiliate that will: (1) continue rail operations; or (2) realize significant benefits in addition to being relieved of the burden of deficit operations by its affiliated railroad. See T and P Rwy._Aband._in Shawnee, Jefferson, and Atchison Counties, KS, Docket No. AB&hyph;381, et al. (ICC served Apr. 27, 1993). Because these conditions do not appear to exist here, employee protective conditions will not be imposed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on September 15, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 2 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 3 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29 4 must be filed by August 26, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by September 6, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 2 A stay will be issued routinely by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation) cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay on environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit the Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption. 3 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 4 The Commission will accept a late-filed trail use request as long as it retains jurisdiction to do so. A copy of any pleading filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Richard R. Wilson, Vuono, Lavelle & Gray, 2310 Grant Building, Pittsburgh, PA 15219. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Unity has filed an environmental report that addresses the abandonment's effect, if any, on the environment and historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by August 19, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA becomes available to the public. Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: August 11, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary.
