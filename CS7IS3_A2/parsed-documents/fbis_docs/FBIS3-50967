The "final offensive" to be launched by the military this week will have the town of Guadalupe Tepeyac -- the only one still under rebel control -- as its main objective, the Mexican media asserted today, Monday. Several Social Security employees have indicated that approximately 200 rebels are holding approximately 100 Guadalupe Tepeyac Hospital physicians and nurses hostage at those installations. The hospital is 800 meters from the Guatemalan border. Unofficial reports also indicate that former Chiapas Governor General Absalon Castellanos could also be held in Guadalupe Tepeyac. Castellanos was kidnapped by the rebels a day after the conflict began, and the rebels announced that they intended to subject him to a summary trial. None of the reporters assigned to the area or the residents of the cities negatively affected by the conflict have been able to confirm reports on the Armed Forces offensive because the roads that lead to the area have been closed by the Mexican Army. There continues to be an important movement of troops at the colonial city of San Cristobal de las Casas, the entrances to which are guarded by tanks, and according to the media, large numbers of soldiers are constantly arriving. Military checkpoints in the Chiapas jungle and mountain regions have also been reinforced. Not even the civilians who want to take potable water, medicine, and food to relatives trapped in the conflict area are allowed to pass. Local radio stations are constantly broadcasting messages requesting help for the besieged residents or reports that they are well so relatives in other regions can be at ease. On 1 January the EZLN took up arms against the Mexican Government, declared war on the Armed Forces, and seized several communities. Since then the confrontations have not stopped, and according to unofficial reports, at least 200 are dead and 1,000 injured. In its counteroffensive, the Mexican Army managed to push the rebels to the mountainous area surrounding San Cristobal de las Casas and is currently searching for the guerrilla's general headquarters, which is hidden in Lacandona jungle. The last reported clash took place at the 31st Military Zone garrison in Rancho Nuevo, 10 km from Ocosingo, yesterday, Sunday. The National Defense Secretariat has not reported casualties on either side. On that same day the Army arrested Mexican priest Isidro Guillermo Badillo Brana at the border between Chiapas and Tabasco States. He is charged with commanding a group of rebels and was transferred to the military installations in San Cristobal de las Casas. The local church has demanded the parish priest's immediate dismissal and announced that if it is not done the church will ask for intervention by the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH.) According to the National Defense Secretariat, the 106 rebels who have been arrested revealed important information regarding the EZLN's organization, its ties with Central American rebel groups, and the orientation of its leaders. The Attorney General's Office reported in a communique that according to the rebels' testimony, at least two of the EZLN leaders are Guatemalans -- Commanders Marcos and Jesus -- and it is they who headed the takeover of San Cristobal de las Casas. The Judicial Police and the Army have begun to search for both leaders, who apparently participated in the Rancho Nuevo clash at the beginning of the hostilities when five soldiers were killed.
