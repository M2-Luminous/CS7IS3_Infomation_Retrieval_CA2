Instead of the 35 percent at which it is aiming, your party is hardly believed to be capable of gaining 5 percent. Is the adventure of the League of Free Citizens (BfB) already over before it really started? [Brunner] No, the heated stage of the European election campaign is only beginning now -- with television and radio spots on the planned abolition of the German mark and 20 meetings with Joerg Haider. We will concentrate on a double-digit result. [FOCUS] You are calling for an election that is to serve as a lesson. However, protest parties are no longer well received by the voters. [Brunner] We are not a protest party. We are a programmatic party of determination. We have a concept for Europe that develops from the friendly concentration of diversity and rejects standardization and egalitarianism. [FOCUS] Proceed on the assumption that you will really get into the Strasbourg parliament. What can you change with your small team? [Brunner] We are not so few. Recently a meeting of the anti-Maastricht parties took place in Paris. They come from almost all states of the European Union. We agreed on the formation of a parliamentary group. We want to reform the European Parliament from the inside and push through the ruling of the FRG Constitutional Court that it is basically the national parliaments that have to legitimize Europe democratically. [FOCUS] The parliament is to be nothing but a debating society? Is your objective the abolition of the parliament? [Brunner] One of my first motions will certainly be that the European Parliament change its name to "European Assembly." [FOCUS] Do you think that the efforts to grant the parliament more legislative powers are wrong? [Brunner] Absolutely. This would only mean the transfer of centralism from Brussels to Strasbourg. [FOCUS] Then your first motion in Strasbourg should not be the change of its name, but its abolition. [Brunner] The "assembly" can be an important accompanying factor for gradual Europeanization. However, one does not need special deputies with their own attendance fees, but can dispatch its members from the national parliaments. [FOCUS] Your common interests with controversial Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] politician Haider are causing you problems. People left the party. Is the BfB drifting to the extreme right? [Brunner] Joerg Haider was presented as a bogeyman in a particular smart form of xenophobia. I am deploring that Erwin Wickert and Hans Schauer left the party. They did not reproach Haider. However, they believe that the polarization is harming us. I see it as an advantage. One cannot win elections without polarization. [FOCUS] Do you declare yourself for nationalism? [Brunner] I reject nationalism. Nationalism means for me that a nation puts its interests above the interests of other nations. What I declare myself for is moderate patriotism: Yes to Europe, but not against Germany. A politician must be able to define national interests. By the way, this is also a prerequisite for compromise. In my speech to the British Parliament I said that we Germans must increasingly use the numerous agreements in substance with British politics. It is bad for Europe and Germany that France and Germany first agree alone on results that are presented to Great Britain and other states. The German-French friendship has degenerated into a policy against Great Britain, although free trade, overall Europe, and a gradual growth of Europe are joint German-British objectives. [FOCUS] Will the result of the European elections have an influence on whether the BfB will run in the Bundestag elections? [Brunner] We will run in the Bundestag elections in any case. [FOCUS] ... and in the landtag elections? [Brunner] The respective results of the European elections in the laender will give the answer. [FOCUS] How are you financing the election campaign? [Brunner] By donations, above all from the medium-sized industry. The big enterprises regard European unification as an opportunity to outmaneuver the medium-sized enterprises. The promotion policy of the European Community [EC] is only aimed at the big ones. The value-added tax clearing requires special tax administrations in the enterprises. The new EC liability guidelines reverse the burden of proof. Law and tax departments and expensive indemnity insurances that only big enterprises can afford -- all that is a program that harms medium-sized enterprises. [FOCUS] The BfB makes propaganda for itself as a German-mark party. Can it really save the German mark -- perhaps together with the Christian Social Union [CSU]? [Brunner] The CSU is the anti-German mark party as such. Its chairman, Theo Waigel, confirmed the automatism for the abolition of the German mark with his signature in Maastricht as the FRG finance minister. With my complaint, I forced the FRG Constitutional Court's ruling that rejects this automatism.
