A ranking northern Yemeni official told AFP that Lakhdar Brahimi contacted the leaders in Sanaa and communicated to them a list of questions and points pertaining to the guarantees the southerners want fulfilled to initiate negotiations with Sanaa. The official added that the working group, chaired by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and tasked with holding contacts with Aden, will meet today to discuss these questions. The northern official did not elaborate further on these questions. However, Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, unilaterally proclaimed by the southerners, said that Aden calls for an unconditional and immediate cease-fire, the deployment of international observers to supervise its implementation, and the return of the aggressors, as he called them, to the pre-22 May 1990 borders, the date unity was declared. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas said this following his meeting with UN Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi in al-Mukalla yesterday evening, who later met with southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Following the meeting, 'Ali Salim al-Bid said that he briefed Brahimi on the deteriorating situation in Yemen, reemphasizing that priority should be given to a cease-fire. Lakhdar Brahimi, contrary to what the southern officials wanted, did not visit Aden. He said this is due to the security instability there. Brahimi left al-Mukalla for Abu Dhabi where he arrived yesterday evening accompanied by Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. The Emirates News Agency says that Brahimi's visit to Abu Dhabi is part of a tour of several Arab countries in the region.
