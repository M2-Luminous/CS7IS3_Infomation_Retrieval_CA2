He said he was mainly referring to local military conflicts in Austria's vicinity, and other phenomena threatening stability, such as uncontrolled mass migration, international crime, drug trafficking, and threats to the environment by, for example, transit freight transport or nuclear power plants. "That is why Austria is highly interested in further strengthening of security and stability in Central Europe," Klestil said. He also said he favored the closest possible Austrian-Czech relations. In view of Austria's forthcoming membership in the European Union (EU), Klestil said he supported the EU's future extension to Central Europe's post-communist countries. "Austria ranks among the resolute advocates of the quickest possible expansion of the EU to the east," he said, adding that if a referendum on Austria's joining the EU has a positive result, Austria would, as a EU member, "defend the interests of all these countries."
