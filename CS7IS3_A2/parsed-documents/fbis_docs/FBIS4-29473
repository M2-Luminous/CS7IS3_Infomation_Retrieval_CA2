Do you think that can happen? [Kubo] It is important that the Hata administration completes its missions first. [Reporter] How is your party planning to negotiate with the ruling parties concerning a new government? [Kubo] It must be done very carefully. The negotiations cannot make headway if the SDPJ only adheres to its position and wants other parties to follow it. We will consolidate views within the party, but a consolidated view should be a flexible one to gain agreement on it from other parties that will participate (in the negotiations). [Reporter] What are the conditions the SDPJ cannot accept at the negotiations? [Kubo] As long as we are asking the Hata Cabinet to resign en masse, "Kaishin" (the parliamentary group) must be disbanded. We do not mind parties with the same ideas forming a floor group. But we think they should do so openly so that other floor groups can see what is going on. [Reporter] What about the running of the government? [Kubo] It should be run in a transparent and democratic way. As the final decision-making body, what we need is (not a representatives conference but) something like a general council comprised of 20-30 members, with the number of members apportioned by the size of the groups they represent. [Reporter] Will your party submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet? [Kubo] This is not a question of having to choose whether the cabinet should resign to enable formation of a new government or the House of Representatives should be dissolved for a general election. If the Hata administration completes its missions and we can make headway in forming a new administration, there will be neither the dissolution of the House for a general election nor a no-confidence motion. But if this course of action is rejected, we will go for submission of the no-confidence motion. As long as we follow that step, I think the SDPJ can act in perfect union. [Reporter] Some members of the ruling parties talk about a large scale cabinet reshuffle. What do you think about that? [Kubo] There has been no specific proposal for it. Hence I think commenting on that at this point can be a barrier to possible new developments. But the cause that resulted in the SDPJ's departure from the coalition must be eliminated. [Reporter] What do you think of a move on forming the so-called conservatives' alliance with conservatives? [Kubo] This is something we must be most wary about. If a conservative coalition government is to come, it will be led by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and this will mean reversing history. [Reporter] Can the SDPJ participate in a government participated in by former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP? [Kubo] That will be difficult. If the ruling parties reject an alliance with the SDPJ, we should look for the possibility of forming a grand alliance between conservatives and reformists. [Reporter] What is your view on a move toward an alliance between the LDP and the SDPJ? [Kubo] I am opposed to the idea of allying with the LDP -- that idea that came in reaction to the thinking that "the SDPJ should not ally with Shinseito." That will only mean that the SDPJ will come to play a complementary role in the LDP administration.
