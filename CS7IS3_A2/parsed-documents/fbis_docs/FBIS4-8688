Following mutual diplomatic recriminations, the two countries have raised the level of alert for their troops along the border and the first group of expelled Albanian refugees has now arrived in their homeland. On 13 April the Greek Defense Ministry ordered the 8th Division, which is deployed along the southern Albanian border, to maintain the highest possible level of alertness. The Albanians have also increased their military alertness on the other side of the border. "We have our men and units there and we will not allow such terrorist acts to be repeated," said Agim Shehu, a high-level Public Order Ministry official in Tirana, at a meeting organized with journalists. Meanwhile, the first mass expulsions of Albanian refugees from Greece after the verification of the terrorist incident have taken place. On 14 April the Greek authorities expelled more than 1,500 Albanian refugees. Most of them passed through the Kakavije border post, only a few km from the point where the innocent victims were killed. The bitter diplomatic war between Tirana and Athens continues. The Albanian Foreign Ministry has decided to cut its staff in Greece and at the same time has demanded reciprocal measures from the Greek side. A note delivered to the Greek ambassador in Tirana has demanded the reduction of the number of diplomatic staff in Tirana to six. The Greek diplomats must leave Albanian territory within 10 days. Robo, first secretary of the Albanian Embassy in Athens, and Iacovou, Greek consul in Gjirokaster, left their posts yesterday. Tirana made this decision on the basis of the lack of a reciprocal agreement on the number of necessary diplomatic staff. Thus, contacts between Albanian and Greece are reduced to the lowest level since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1971. Albanian experts believe that there is no doubt that special Greek forces were the culprits in the massacre at Peshkepi, and that the assassination was planned. Two high-level Public Order Ministry officials, Shehu and Mucmataj, confirmed this conclusion once again, showing journalists material proof that, according to them, demonstrated this. "The commandos' behavior, the precise selection of the target for their attack, the Greek military uniforms, and objects found at the scene of the incident all support our conclusion," Shehu said. Athens continues to deny this. According to its spokesman Evangelos Venizelos, the Greek Government is still awaiting Tirana's response to its proposal for the creation of a joint commission to investigate the incident. Moreover, Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias has proposed to his Albanian counterpart Serreqi a meeting in a neutral country to discuss the possibility of settling the crisis between the two countries. In the meantime, an investigation of the Albanian servicemen accused of negligence of military responsibilities has also begun. According to Mucmataj, three Albanian officers are under investigation. An inspector of the Border Police from Gjirokaster and two servicemen in the unit where the murders took place are to face proceedings, after being released after two days' detention. "It is up to the procurator to make further decisions," Mucmataj said.
