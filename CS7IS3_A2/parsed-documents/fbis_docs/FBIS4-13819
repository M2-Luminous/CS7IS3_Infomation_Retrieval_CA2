The letters, sent by the Labor headquarters, advised them that under the party constitution, they are no longer Labor members. The other Labor members included in Ramon's Histadrut elections list will receive similar letters after the headquarters check the matter with each of them. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 21 April cites the Labor spokesman as saying that "the Ramon list includes 25 Labor members, and they will receive expulsion letters tonight and tomorrow. MK Ramon has said that the list he had submitted to the election committee includes 300 to 400 Labor members."] Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin again attacked the Ramon list which, he said, is liable to harm the peace process. Addressing the United Kibbutzim Movement convention in Ramat Ef'al today, the prime minister again warned: Ramon and his list will harm the government operation. [passage omitted]
