The press reports on President Zhelev's consultations yesterday with the political forces and with two deputy ministers before his departure to Brussels on Monday, where he is expected to sign the Partnership for Peace initiative. According to OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK, there were no differences of opinion on this issue. This is confirmed by statements by participants in the consultations cited by the Socialists' DUMA and DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), which marks its fourth anniversary today. "There is no change in Bulgaria's stand on Bosnia, MP's said after a meeting at the Presidency," STANDART NEWS writes. The daily adds that Deputy Foreign Minister Todor Churov confirmed the stand of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry that "military intervention would be admissible only if it localizes the conflict and does not threaten the peaceful population." "Zhelev Inclined To Support Air Strikes in Bosnia," a headline in 24 CHASA reads. This daily writes that at yesterday's meeting President Zhelev handed out a draft stand of Bulgaria on the Yugo-conflict which sets forth in eight points the principles of Bulgaria's non-involvement: non- involvement in the war, observation of the sanctions, an appeal to the neighbouring and Balkan countries not to get involved in the conflict, and support of international initiatives for a peaceful solution. "Mr. Zhelev is inclined to support air strikes against military targets in Bosnia only as an extreme measure and only if NATO guarantees that these strikes would not affect civilians," 24 CHASA writes, adding that the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, of the former Communists) was categorically against the final point and demanded its revision. Nikolay Slatinski, chief of the Parliamentary National Security Committee, is also against air strikes. According to 24 CHASA, the president promised to hold a meeting of experts to finalize the text of Bulgaria's stand after his visit to Brussels. TRUD writes that yesterday President Zhelev received a negative answer from representatives of the legislative and the executive to his question on whether he should offer Bulgaria's indirect participation in possible NATO operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. STANDART NEWS reports that Prime Minister Berov was also invited to the meeting but did not come. Instead, "he met Russian Ambassador in Sofia Aleksandr Avdeyev, who acquainted him with the stand of the Russian Federation on NATO's proposal for the solution of the Yugo-crisis," STANDART NEWS writes. The press quotes a statement by the president's spokesman that in Brussels Zhelev will reply to the letter of the Turkish president asking him to support military intervention in Bosnia.
