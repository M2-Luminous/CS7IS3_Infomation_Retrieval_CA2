The large gap between the above two amounts is mainly because quite a few projects are divided into initial and succeeding stages or scheduled for first, second, and third phases, so that funds are made available in different lots. There are also some foreign-invested companies which exist in name only but do nothing except have their companies registered and false investment amounts reported. These are virtually "shell companies." Recently, action has been taken in several mainland cities to screen and reorganize these "shell companies." It has been reported that business licenses for 26 false foreign-invested enterprises have been withdrawn in Wuhan recently, and a short time ago, licenses of 55 foreign-invested enterprises with only empty titles were also withdrawn in Guangzhou. In several cities and towns in Guangdong, many foreign-invested commercial housing construction projects have been suspended after starting for a short period owing to the unavailability of funds, or have gone bankrupt after receiving deposits from property buyers. These companies are also being screened now. Some mainland enterprises wanted to set up joint ventures with foreign investors and made unilateral concessions in rights and benefits to them. Taking advantage of their aspirations and the loopholes in management, some foreign businessmen only signed contracts with mainland counterparts and provided some of the equipment as shares on their part, while delaying making funds available for a long time. As a result, abnormal phenomena have emerged in which foreign investors made profits, Chinese partners suffered losses, and enterprises operated in the red. A survey conducted by the Beijing Institute of Planning and Economics pointed out: The increasingly serious problem of losses in foreign-invested enterprises has aroused attention from pertinent departments. It has been learned that the foreign-invested enterprises in Beijing recorded a total deficit of approximately 660 million yuan in 1992, with 50 percent, and more than 60 percent in individual trades, of enterprises suffering losses. Although the accumulated losses showed a slight decline in the first half of last year, the deficit amount still increased by 26 percent as compared with the corresponding period in 1992. The survey also pointed out: Foreign investors have transferred profits through various channels, which has given rise to losses and tax evasion in a number of enterprises. By and large, foreign investors employed the following four methods to transfer profits: 1) They set high prices for the equipment they imported, passed inferior equipment off as superior, took away part of the profits in advance, and earned money by magnifying the ratio of investment and returns. For example, a foreign investor negotiated with several provinces and cities on the mainland to set up joint ventures for the development of five similar projects, for which he imported five sets of equipment at the price of $2.4 million each. In fact, all the equipment was assemblies of worn parts from abroad with a total value of less than $900,000. 2) By controlling import and export channels, they quote high prices for imported materials while reducing prices for exported goods, and then they transfer the profits to companies outside the territory. 3) By employing such means as irrational apportionment of charges, cost calculation, and so on, they transfer profits, increase losses, and evade taxes. 4) They avail themselves of the loopholes in policies to falsely report losses, purposely delaying the fiscal year showing a surplus, and effecting tax evasion. For example, a total of 4,838 foreign- invested enterprises reported losses in Guangdong in 1991, which accounted for 53 percent of enterprises having submitted their final settlement, and the amount of their losses totalled 3.66 billion yuan. However, the so-called losing enterprises are constantly expanding their production scale and increasing their profits year after year, and have become "enterprises which see endless deficits but never tumble." In addition, there are also foreign investors who work hand in glove with the Chinese personnel to swell their personal fortunes while causing losses to enterprises. Others take advantage of the weakness of the Chinese personnel, who lack accounting and legal knowledge, to control operational and management power and play tricks in import and export trade, so that they make profits at the expense of the losses incurred by enterprises. A mainland expert maintains that to put an end once and for all to the loss of national capital in the joint-venture enterprises, apart from plugging the loopholes in the regulations on joint ventures, Chinese personnel in joint ventures must enhance their understanding of cost accounting and law. This should be taken as an essential qualification to work in a joint venture.
