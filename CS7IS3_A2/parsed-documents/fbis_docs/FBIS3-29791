He was speaking at a two-day meeting on the transform of economic structure in the Mekong delta held in Can Tho city, the Mekong River delta province of Hau Giang. The meeting drew the participation of secretaries of the party committees and chairmen of the people's committees of 11 provinces in the region. On the transform of the Mekong delta's economic structure, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said that the construction of socio-economic infrastructural bases is the foremost task aiming at ensuring a firm base for the socio-economic development and improvement of local people's cultural standards. At present, he noted, the Mekong delta's infrastructural base is too low. It was reported that each year this region produces over 11 million tonnes of rice, accounting for nearly half of the country's total rice output. Thus more investments in rice cultivation, particularly special rice-growing areas, are needed. Furthermore, the Mekong delta provinces had great potentials in breeding pigs and ducks, and planting fruit trees and industrial crops. Aquatic products are also a strong point of the region.
