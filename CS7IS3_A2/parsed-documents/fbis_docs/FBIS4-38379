It will strive to get the Russian Government's support to possible U.N. Security Council sanctions against the Korean People's Democratic Republic during the summit negotiations in Moscow," a representative of the presidential chancery, who preferred to remain anonymous, told a briefing for foreign journalists here today. He said that the South Korean-Russian summit, which is to take place during South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Moscow (from June 1 to June 4), would be of great importance for the security of the peninsula. The Seoul leadership is disturbed by North Korea's efforts to develop its own nuclear weapons. It calls for international measures to influence Pyongyang if the latter refused to comply with its commitments under the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty. In this connection, the support given to this stand by Russia and other major powers would be very important for South Korea. The presidential representative noted that the possibility of Security Council sanctions was growing due to the recent replacement of fuel rods in North Korean 5 megawatt nuclear reactors without the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Kim Yong- sam plans to discuss this problem with Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his visit to Moscow and to find out what would be Russia's stand in this connection. Commenting on Moscow's proposal to call a multilateral conference on the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula with the participation of Russia, the United States, Japan, China, the Republic of Korea, the Korean People's Democratic Republic, and leaders of the United Nations and the IAEA, the South Korean president's representatives noted that the Seoul government was "carefully studying" the idea. "However," he said, "it is first necessary to see how the situation on the peninsula develops under the impact of continuing efforts exerted in the same direction by the United Nations and the IAEA." During his talks with Boris Yeltsin, the same source informed, Kim Yong-sam plans to discuss the terms of the treaty of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance, which was concluded between the USSR and the Korean People's Democratic Republic in 1961. The South Korean side is particularly interested to know whether Russia would be inevitably drawn into a military conflict if it broke out in Korea. According to the YONHAP news service, a meeting on problems of security was held in Seoul today. President Kim Yong-sam instructed his government during the meeting to take preparatory steps against any surprises linked with the unpredictability of Pyongyang's nuclear plans. At the same time, south korea reaffirmed during the meeting its intention to continue the efforts to overcome the current crisis by peaceful means.
