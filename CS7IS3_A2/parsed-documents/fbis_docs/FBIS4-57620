A total of 566 delegates and 170 guests were invited. There are 150 international representatives from 80 countries here. [applause] Present here are delegates from Germany, Argentina, Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Chile, Colombia, Korea, Costa Rica, the Republic of Cuba, Spain, the United States, France, the UK, Greece, Guatemala, The Netherlands, our neighboring Republic of Honduras, the Islamic Republic of Iran, our dearest republic of Mexico, representatives of solidarity organizations here in Nicaragua, Norway, Palestine, the now democratic Republic of Panama, Portugal, Puerto Rico -- whose representatives are struggling for their country's independence, our friends in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Sweden, Switzerland, the always fraternal Uruguay, and the Republic of Vietnam. [applause follows the naming of each country; Cuba rfeceives a standing ovation] My dear brothers, in addition to being a special session of the Congress, this is a special congress for political reasons. On very few occasions has a political event in this country raised so much expectation. I wonder what the reason is for so much expectation and interest. Nicaragua -- poor little Nicaragua -- is agonizing in a surrealistic crisis of unemployment, backwardness, poverty, lack of health, and something we never had before: hunger. We are now one of the poorest countries in the world. What this special congress decides can contribute to maintaining this poverty, endlessly, in a circle of hell. What this congress decides can also be the beginning of a national resurrection. All of you who are participating in this congress -- all of us and no one else -- have this tremendous historical responsibility. If the FSLN comes out deteriorated or divided, it will not be easy for us to defeat the enemies of the people. If we end up divided and deteriorated -- despite the earnest calls for unity we have heard here -- it will be impossible [to defeat our enemies]. We, the congress delegates and no one else, have this historical responsibility. Will personal greed prevail among us? Will the useless confrontations, the fireworks of selfishness prevail? Will the temptation of bending our knees before the enemy prevail? Will the arrogance, exclusion, self-idolatry, messianism prevail? Will anyone -- any one of us -- believe he is anointed by the Holy Spirit to destroy the FSLN? Or, on the contrary, will good sense, equity, selflessness, the fraternal embrace, love for our fatherland, identification with our sacred revolutionary roots, loyalty toward the copious rivers of blood of our glorious martyrs prevail? Will we Sandinists love each other more, or will we love our enemies more? Someone once said one cannot love the people without hating their enemies. As of this moment, I urge you not to hate anyone, not even our enemies. If this call can serve any purpose, it should first encourage love among Sandinists. And after the Congress, what? Let us all agree that this is a special congress, that this congress will delimit a border between the past and the future. After this congress, the only acceptable conclusion is an audacious and renewed political line; a political line that will have to reflect wisdom, flexibility, and firmness. We are forced to examine with telescopes and microscopes the possibilities of alliance, the prospects for a definitive national agreement. That flexibility, possible alliances, the search for national consensus which must [words indistinct] with the revolutionary principles. After the congress is over, our agenda will give preeminence to the popular struggle against injustice, economic repression, administrative corruption, banditry, [word indistinct], and rancor. After this congress -- I hope -- we will be richer in national dignity and more severe in resolutely demanding respect for our sovereignty; we will promote international friendship, strengthening the FSLN's relations with all political forces: the Socialist International, the Conference of Latin American Political Parties, the Sao Paolo Group. We will intensity our friendship with our historical friends. I am talking about Cuba, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Brazil, to mention just a few of our dear Latin American friends. I am talking about Europe, Asia, and Africa, now represented here. After this congress we will be more enthusiastic in defending the just causes, not only in this forum, but in all forums. As a matter of principle, we are and will continue to be faithful to the cause of the fraternal and glorious people of Cuba. From this forum we joyfully greet the victory of the South African people and their great leader Nelson Mandela. [applause] From this rostrum, we extend our dignified and friendly hand -- with the pride of being Sandino's heirs and Carlos Fonseca's brothers -- to the U.S. Government, demanding respect, which when evident, will be fully shared. After this congress, we will give our attention to peasants and will give youths a dignified and qualitative position. After this congress we will be even more staunch defenders of the struggles of the Indian peoples for respect of their legitimate rights; we will be more active in defending the struggle for equality between men and women, [applause] we will be more enthusiastic in the struggle for the unity of the Latin American peoples. After this congress, we will vigorously seek a solution or will contribute to finding a solution to the distressing property problem. After this congress, as you shouted at the beginning, we will be more coherent, and will raise very high and seriously, and forever the indestructible unity of the FSLN. [applause] My dear brothers, as the highest authority of the FSLN at this moment, I declare this FSLN Special Congress open. [applause]
