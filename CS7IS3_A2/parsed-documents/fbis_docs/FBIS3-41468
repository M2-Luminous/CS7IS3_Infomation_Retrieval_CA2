On the Creation of a Single State System To Monitor the Republic of Georgia Environment''] [Text] By a decree of the Republic of Georgia Cabinet of Ministers, a single state system to monitor the Republic of Georgia environment has been created; it will observe and assess the state of the environment and make forecasts. The creation of a single state system for ecological monitoring in the Republic of Georgia will make it possible to improve the administration of the ecological situation in Georgia and its operational control. Great importance is attached to its successful implementation from the point of view of the resolution of other problems connected with the national economy. The Ministry for the Protection of the Environment has been entrusted with organizing a single state system to monitor the republic's environment and elaborating a program for implementing it in the republic. The republic's academies of science and agriculture and a number of ministries, departments, and agencies have been entrusted with implementing individual monitoring systems. The Ministry for the Protection of the Environment along with the Academy of Sciences and interested ministries and departments are to present within two months to the Republic of Georgia Cabinet of Ministers proposals for the creation of an interdepartmental council in the Ministry for the Protection of the Environment that will elaborate a program for creating a single state system to monitor the republic's environment. On the basis of the radiation control group in the ``Sakmtavarhidrometi'' republican center for monitoring the environment, the Ministry for the Protection of the Environment should create a service for controlling radiation safety in the republic by the end of January 1994. A single environmental information and research system is to be created within the main department of hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring, which will unite the departmental banks holding statistics on monitoring on the basis of a single methodology and in accordance with international standards.
