Provincial party committee Secretary Xie Shijie delivered a speech in which he called on principal party and government leaders at all levels across the province to correctly handle dialectical relations between population and economy; strengthen a sense of urgency in population control while striving to push economic growth onto a new stage; and further improve family planning work. At a time when a provincial people's congress session and a provincial Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference session were being held, the provincial party committee and government jointly invited principal prefectural, city, and autonomous prefectural leaders, as well as principal leaders in charge of the various provincial departments concerned, to a forum to discuss family planning work. This was indeed an unprecedented move in the province's history. Qin Yuqin, provincial party committee deputy secretary, presided over yesterday's forum at which she delivered a speech, calling for establishing a system whereby family planning forums are held at regular intervals so that leaders can discuss and formulate strategies and push family planning work onto a new stage. Zhang Zhongwei, provincial party committee standing committee member and provincial vice governor, first took the floor to brief the leaders on Sichuan's population situation. Provincial party committee Secretary Xie Shijie and Xiao Yang, provincial party committee deputy secretary and provincial governor, delivered important speeches at the forum. Comrade Xie Shijie pointed out: While building a socialist market economic structure we should correctly handle dialectical relations between population and economy; place population growth under control; and strive to improve population quality, this being our basic national policy with special significance to Sichuan entering the international market and participating in international competition. He stated: Market competition will in no way repel family planning. Rather, it calls for integrating social family planning with household family planning; integrating a social restriction mechanism with an interest orientation mechanism; integrating propaganda and education with the legal system in this regard; integrating administrative management with family planning among the masses; and integrating conception and sterilization with quality childbirth in order that the broad masses of the people are able to consciously implement family planning in production activities, daily life, and family life. Comrade Xie Shijie called on principal party and government leaders at all levels to conscientiously implement to the letter all five family planning requirements laid down by General Secretary Jiang Zemin; take personal charge of and assume overall responsibilities for family planning work; and firmly grasp the following three work aspects: 1. Strengthen grass-roots family planning networks and implement the instruction issued by the provincial party committee and government about stabilizing the family planning contingent, building more family planning offices at the township level, and training family planning contingents at the village level; 2. Conscientiously examine the family planning situation and assume personal responsibility for attaining family planning quotas. 3. Increase the financial input into family planning; provide family planning with sufficient operational funds; take family planning as an important criterion for appraising, commending, rewarding, selecting, and promoting party and government cadres; and step up education on family planning as one of the basic national policies among party members and cadres. The party members and cadres should try to set a fine example and play an exemplary role in this regard. Comrade Xiao Yang said: Being a populous province, Sichuan will find it more difficult to realize comparatively well-off living standards. In view of this situation, principal party and government leaders at all levels should take personal charge of and assume overall responsibility for family planning work. We should strive to build stronger and more efficient family planning organizations and support grass-roots family planning cadres in their work. All cities across the province should step up control of the floating population and provide family planning with sufficient operational funds. Should we fail to provide family planning with sufficient operational funds, we will unavoidably face serious consequences and have to spend more money in this connection. Yang Xizong, provincial people's congress standing committee chairman, also delivered a speech in which he stressed: We are carrying out family planning work here in Sichuan on a solid basis. We have both rich family planning experience and effective family planning measures. Family planning depends on human efforts! We should conscientiously publicize and implement "Sichuan Provincial Family Planning Regulations"; conduct family planning in accordance with the law; further regularize family planning; and place family planning within the orbit of the legal system. Leaders from Chengdu, Chongqing, Neijiang, Nanchong, and some others areas across the province reported on their respective family planning work; exchanged family planning experiences; and studied ways and means of strengthening family planning. Also attending the forum were Song Baorui, Yang Chonghui, Diao Jinxiang, Xi Yifang, Kang Zhenhuang, Liu Changjie, Geng Quanli [provincial military district political commissar], Zhang Shikui, and others.
