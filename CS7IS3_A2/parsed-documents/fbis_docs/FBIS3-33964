An anonymous caller for the so-called Al-Awja Palestinian organisation told Al-Safir that his group was "opposed to the establishment of peace with the Zionist enemy (Israel)." "All traitors, wherever they may be, will meet the same fate as the Jordanian diplomat," 'Umran Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah who was shot dead by a gunman outside his Beirut home on Saturday, the caller with a fake Palestinian accent said. He also "threatened strikes on Norwegian interests in the Middle East if Palestinian-Zionist meetings continue to be held on Norwegian territory," the daily added. For several months Norway hosted secret talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation which led to the signing in Washington on September 13 of a limited autonomy accord. Jordan, which is also engaged in peace talks with Israel along with the PLO, Lebanon and Syria, has blamed opponents of the Middle East peace process for Ma'aytah's killing.
