The severe drubbing of Zhang Tao, which left him with a broken nose and leg, set off alarm bells in Beijing after it was revealed in the Taiwan media in mid-January. Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation called for a full investigation, fearing it could mark a new trend of violence against Taiwanese bosses on the mainland. Chinese officials connected with the case said Zhang's aggressive work on behalf of his Taiwanese clients appeared unrelated to the incident. "This was a civil dispute which had nothing to do with Zhang's supposed work for Taiwan," said Wang Guoyao, head of Hubei's Taiwan Affairs Offce, from Wuhan. "It was stirred up into a lot of nonsense in Taiwan." On January 7, six men, armed with knives and sticks, forced their way into the Taiwan-owned Hansheng Computer Company, where Zhang worked as personnel manager. A scuffle ensued, which left Zhang and two company security guards in hospital. The police did not begin investigating the case until the Wuhan Taiwan Business Association issued a statement that asserted: "There is no way the beating is related solely to Zhang's private affairs." On orders from Beijing, Hubei's Governor, Jia Zhijie, demanded the police catch the six in order to prevent the case becoming a serious cross strait issue, sources said. The suspects were detained shortly before the lunar new year and had been charged, although none had been sentenced yet, Wang said. Questioning of the men revealed they had beaten Zhang because he had agreed to pay only 280 renminbi (HK$246) to cover the hospital expenses of an old woman who herself had been beaten by a female driver of the firm, Wang said. The old woman, a nearby resident, had complained about the noise the driver made with the car horn every time she drove in and out of the factory gate. "The actual hospital expenses were probably many times [the amount offered by Zhang]," Wang said. The old woman's godson had organised the men to "avenge the remaining expenses" from the stingy Zhang, he said. "The driver shouldn't have beaten the old woman and the godson and his friends shouldn't have beaten Zhang." The head of the Wuhan Taiwan Business Association, Chen Fengrong, admitted the beating of Zhang did not concern his work for association members. "We thought this was the case at first, but since the arrests it has become clear this was an internal company matter," he said from Wuhan. "Since the lunar new year break I've been to visit Wang and we've basically agreed to put this matter behind us."
