The diplomat, who was appointed to represent his country in Mexico, told LA REPUBLICA newspaper that "Cuba is willing to consider the issue if the OAS asks for the island's reentry. [no closing quotation marks as published] "Cuba was arbitrarily removed from the OAS and now the decision for its reentry is the organization's problem, not ours," the ambassador stated. He added that the international political situation has changed so much "that many people believe the decision to exclude Cuba is going out of fashion." Curbelo said integration "was an old historic aspiration of the continent," and that the regional and subregional advances in this direction were "interesting." He noted: "For us, the integration process and the international meetings have an effective and practical value because, regarding the Caribbean's participation, they foster rapprochement of all countries." Cuba, he added, does not participate in any regional integration process but has made important steps in this direction through the Caribbean Common Market. Therefore, he said, the experience gathered at the Latin American Integration Association will be important in the future.
