FBIS4-68871 "jpusr056___94052" FBIS-USR-94-056 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 2 April 1994 CAUCASUS ARMENIA Opposition Deputies View State of Economy Opposition Deputies View State of Economy 944K1218B Yerevan AZG in Armenian 2 Apr 94 p 2 944K1218B Yerevan AZG Armenian CSO [Article by Hakob Asatryan: "Forty-Eight Percent of Republic's Electrical Energy is Lost"] [Text] "The government reports false figures in its programs," declared parliamentary deputy Arshak Sadoyan [at a meeting with reporters]. Representing the parliamentary group of the National Democratic Union [NDU], Sadoyan drew the attention of the reporters to the figures in the budget that was recently passed by the Supreme Council and demonstrated that they do not correspond to the truth. According to those figures, the monthly income of the average person in the republic was 254 dram in February 1994, indicating that it had grown by 15.4 times while consumer prices rose by 125.8 times [as published]. In other words, the living standards of the population declined by 8-fold. In addition, according to the same budget, the gross national product of the republic must be 9.285 billion dram in 1994, but the real figure is expected to reach 60.100 billion dram by the end of the year. In other words, the inflation rate is expected to be 6-fold (597 percent). Sadoyan claims, however, that if a more realistic approach is taken, the inflation rate will be 20-fold. He says that the government is distorting the figures so that it can hide the large difference between the 1.7-fold growth in incomes and 20-fold increase in prices. The remarks of Semyon Baghdasaryan, the other member of the NDU parliamentary group, about energy production were even more interesting. It has been determined that the electrical energy output of the republic declined by 2-fold from 11,270 million kilowatt-hours in the first 11 months of 1989 to 5,822 million kilowatt-hours in the corresponding period of 1993. On that basis, the supply of electricity to the population should have declined by 2-fold and not by 12-fold. Thus, where has the electricity generated in the republic gone? In Mr Baghdasaryan's words, 48 percent of the electricity generated was lost in the transmission network alone, and 25 to 30 percent was distributed through illegal or so-called "private supply" means. This assumes that 50 percent of the 305 million kilowatt-hours of electricity generated in November 1993 was delivered to the population and the remaining 50 percent was given to industry. According to Mr Baghdasaryan, because of this situation not only electrical energy but industrial production is lost. Mr Baghdasaryan says: "Officials of the Ministry of the Interior derive personal benefit from the `private services' of supplying electricity." He noted that if this situation continues, the directors of substations may illegally privatize their units and decide on their own who receives electricity and who does not. Parliamentary deputy Seyran Avagyan said that the harsh taxation system does not help the importation of high-priority foodstuffs into the republic. He said that today the minimum monthly expenses (bread, salt, sugar, heating oil and soap) of a family comprised of four members is 2,095 dram. Assuming that two members of the family work, each working person must therefore earn at least 1,047 dram a month at a time when the minimum monthly wage is 110 dram (176 dram beginning in April). The deputies then spoke about Armenia's domestic and foreign policies. In particular, Shavarsh Kocharyan declared that Armenia must look for strength in itself and rely less on outside forces.
