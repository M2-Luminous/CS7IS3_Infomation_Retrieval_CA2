To Mr. Senator Vasile Vacaru, chairman of the Joint Standing Commission of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate for Parliamentary Control Over the Activity of the Romanian Intelligence Service: Regarding certain leaks of information from within the SRI and the accusations against certain persons or groups of persons whose actions might affect the national security, we state the following: Regarding the article "The Alarm Bell -- The Setting Up and Functioning, Under the Guidance of Some Foreign Secret Services, of an Organized Group Placed in Official Positions," published in the weekly ROMANIA MARE No.185/1 Jan 1994, as well as in connection with other such materials, we have the following to say: An examination of the ROMANIA MARE article reveals that it was not based on secret information, which might have come from our institution, but rather on information obtained from a number of real situations, known to the public, such as: -- The persons accused in the article have worked in various former institutions (the Institute of Political Studies, the Center of Military Theory and History, the Institute of World Economy, or the International Law and International Relations Association-ADIRI); -- The official activities carried out by ADIRI and its personnel, which also included links with institutions and individuals abroad, especially from the United States and England; -- Scholarships granted by this institute for specialization courses to two of the accused individuals; -- The statements made by Messrs. Vasile Secares [rector of the Romanian National School of Political and Administrative Studies (SNSPA)] and Ioan Mircea Pascu [secretary of state at the Ministry of National Defense] in their interviews with daily AZI on 6 and 26 February 1990, full passages of which were taken over (with a number of comments and interpretations by the author of that article) by the magazine and actually represent the substance of that article. However, given the allegations about certain named individuals and institutions belonging to some foreign intelligence services, one can assume that the author of the article has used the favors of certain former cadres of the counterespionage of foreign intelligence services, who, by putting together and interpreting certain data, arguments, and suppositions, have managed to confer an aura of professionalism on that article. A possible argument in favor of this supposition is the fact that, in the 1990-1992 period, similar accusations against other political figures of those times -- Silviu Brucan, Dumitru Mazilu [former top leaders of the post-1989 National Salvation Front Council], and so forth -- were published by ROMANIA MARE and the SPIONAJ-CONTRASPIONAJ [ESPIONAGE-COUNTERESPIONAGE] magazine led by former Securitate General Neagu Cozma; the authors of the incriminating articles must have had access to material about individuals with connections abroad, known to have belonged to the Third Directorate of the State Security Department [DSS], who could be found in the files of retired Major General Aurelian Mortoiu and retired Colonel Filip Teodorescu, files that were taken over by Vice Admiral Stefan Dinu, after his appointment to the command of the respective union. The SRI cannot be accused of consciously keeping silent about the matter raised, as claimed by Mr. Senator Eugen Dijmarescu [of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front)] in his letter sent to Romania's Senate, a letter that was presented to us during our appearance before the Joint Standing Control Commission on 9 February 1994. That the SRI did not take an immediate official stand vis-a-vis the respective press materials can be explained by the fact that it had to conduct certain checks, which took time, until final conclusions could be drawn, which rebutted the allegations in the aforementioned article. From the checks done so far, it results that the SRI has not been and is not involved in any way in the mass-media dissemination of the respective materials. The SRI itself is the first one interested in blocking any leaks of information. Regarding the publication by ROMANIA MARE of material about alleged criminal activities by Major General Gheorghe Florica [former general commissioner of the Financial Overseeing Body until 1993], we state the following: An investigation into the activities of an Arab citizen, known to belong to an extremist-terrorist group operating on Romania's territory, has shown that he had criminal links both with the former chief of the Financial Oversight Body and with other Romanian citizens and foreigners. In this respect, all proof collected by our service was forwarded to the relevant state institutions authorized to take appropriate steps in this respect and were used by them in resolving their cases. The study and examination of the material published by ROMANIA MARE reveal that some of the data sent to the legal consumers (various institutions) was at the basis of the articles published by Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor. (As a matter of fact, our institution will continue its investigation to establish the way in which this data, which was not meant for publication, has been disseminated. Regarding the letter sent to you by George Sergiu Rizescu, deputy of the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD] from Arges, who asks that one should clarify his alleged collaboration with the former Securitate and the SRI, we state the following: EVENIMENTUL ZILEI on 11 July 1992 published some material from the archives of the former Arges County Securitate branch regarding certain informer files, which also included the names of certain PNTCD leaders from Arges. The same issue of the newspaper published the transcript of a recording -- registration number 0012806 of 3 March 1992 -- belonging to the Arges County Intelligence Section, which contains references to Mr. Deputy Sergiu George Rizescu, who, on one occasion, allegedly told his entourage about the PNTCD's position vis-a-vis the parliamentary elections due to be held in 1992. The results of the investigation carried out by the SRI to elucidate this case were at the basis of legal suit No. 302576 of 20 July 1992 started by the SRI against EVENIMENTUL ZILEI editors Dan Andronic and Ion Cristoiu for disclosure of state secrets as well as against Lieutenant Colonel Emilian Oprescu, active officer at the Arges County Intelligence Section, for negligence shown in keeping state secrets. The case is being investigated by the military prosecuting magistracies of the General Prosecutor Magistracy of the supreme Court of Justice, under penal file No. 395/P/1992. As shown by the text of transcript of recording No. 0012806 of 3 June 1992 published in daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, Mr. Deputy Rizescu has not been and is no "source of information" for our institution. On the other hand, the checks we have conducted in the archives of the former Securitate -- documents that can be accessed to in accordance with the provisions of Article 45, Paragraph 4 of Law No. 14 -- show that Mr. Deputy Sergiu George Rizescu has not been part of the Securitate's network of informers. Constantly concerned with ensuring the protection of the information it holds (a specialized body in charge of this task is actually operating within our institution) and with drastically and promptly punishing any violations in this respect, the SRI emphasizes the urgent need to elaborate a set of rules in order to protect the data and information not intended for publication. By the same token, the appearance of press material that undoubtedly uses data from the aforementioned category requires investigation at the level of all state institutions where such leaks might occur. The SRI is directly responsible only for its own violations from the rules governing the circulation of data and information that constitute a state secret and are not meant for publication.
