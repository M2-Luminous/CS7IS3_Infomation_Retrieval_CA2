It had tried in vain to place responsibility for the explosion of the situation in 'Imran on whom it referred to as saboteurs and secessionist elements in the Yemeni Socialist Party. The official source declined to answer this statement but the reality has already been made clear by the official source of the Defense Ministry last Wednesday [27 April]. This fact is well-known by those who were burned by the fire of this sedition which was sparked off by the adventurous military command in Sanaa, the people of 'Imran and the members of the military commission who were present then at 'Imran Camp. The statement added that the endeavors by the president and other officials in Sanaa to contain the position was totally not based on reality and that the appeals made by the defense minister to stop the military offensive against the 3d Armored Brigade had not been seriously dealt with. The official source said that the ruling military circle in Sanaa had launched considerable forces equipped with various arms to attack the 3d Brigade without giving regard to the members of this brigade and the peaceful people of 'Imran. It also did not allow the evacuation of the wounded and did not treat them as prisoners of war but tortured them and interrogated them by the security bodies. The source appealed to the public opinion, the military commission, and the fact-finding commission which was formed by the House of Deputies and human rights organizations to interfere in this inhuman conduct which contradicts with the morals of our Yemeni people.
