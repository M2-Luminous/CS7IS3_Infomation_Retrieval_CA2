In the message he said the Pyongyang declaration gave the world's progressive people confidence in victory and courage by showing them that the frustration of socialism and revival of capitalism in the former Soviet Union and East European countries does never mean the "end of socialism". Noting that the world's revolutionary forces should be reorganized with heroic Korea at the centre and that it is their noble duty to defend Korea, the socialist bastion, he said they would fight to discharge their international duty under the Pyongyang declaration according to the idea of independence, equality and anti-imperialism.
