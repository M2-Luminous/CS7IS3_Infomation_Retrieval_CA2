The promotions were established by special resolutions issued and signed by Fujimori and published today in the official gazette EL PERUANO. The 23 colonels to be promoted to brigadier general come from special areas such as infantry, artillery, cavalry, engineering, communications and the judge advocate's office. The Peruvian president also promoted seven generals to division generals, the highest rank in the Army. These soldiers are Tomas Cavero, Jose Picon, Juan Leon, Enrique Torrico, Napoleon Vasquez, Andres Sanchez, and Guido Guevara. Rear Admirals Jose Texeira, Enrique Salomon, and Americo Ibarcena were promoted to vice admiral, the highest rank in the Peruvian Navy. Major Generals Cesar Urday, Ernesto Burga and Luis Moy were promoted to liuetenant general, the highest rank in the Peruvian Air Force. All these promotions were confirmed by presidential resolutions and published in the official gazette. The promotions are consistent with the new Constitution, which went into effect on 31 December 1993. It states that the promotions of high-ranking officers of the Armed Forces are to be confirmed by the president after each branch of the Armed Forces presents its recommendations. The old Constitution stated that promotions were to be confirmed by the legislature upon a recommendation sent by the Executive Branch. The political opposition criticized the constitutional change because they believed this undermined legislative authority and allowed for "politicking" with the military institutions. The opposition magazine CARETAS said in December that the military High Command and General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, the commander in chief of the Army and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had decided on the promotions themselves, adding that the "politicizing and counter-institutionalization in the Army has had devastating effects." Peruvian opposition parties view Hermoza as a negative factor within the Army, and they have requested his removal on several occasions. All of the requests were rejected by Fujimori. Hermoza is considered to be the Peruvian president's closest military ally after he backed Fujimori's self-inflicted coup d'etat on 5 April 1992, when the president dissolved the parliament, closed down the Judicial Branch, and assumed full power.
