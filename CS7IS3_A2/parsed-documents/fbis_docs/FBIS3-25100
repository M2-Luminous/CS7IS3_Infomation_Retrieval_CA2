Mr. President, in general terms, could you describe Pimo and what are its political and philosophical foundations? [Sibindy] Pimo is an emergent political force based on democratic principles. It guarantees an ample participation and its members can freely and critically express their diverse opinions. It is an independent political party because it does not accept influence from any other party, the state, government, any social or professional organization, or any philosophical association. Pimo believes that the pursuance of its goals will allow us to identify the behavior and characteristics of the various social stratum in our country. To that end, our party has a research office whose task it is to to carry out studies, survey, identify problems, carry out inquiries, and listen to people. It is on this basis that Pimo believes the fatherland can be rebuilt from the devastating 16-year war. To that end, our party relies on three watchwords: peace, moral values, and progress. Pimo believes that the process of research, as well as the identification of the behavior and characteristics of each section of society, must not ignore the aforementioned watchwords. On the basis of those findings, Pimo wants to obtain the natural concept of the definition of man, taking into account the diversity factor. This is how Pimo believes it can achieve its desired goal of serving all people. Pimo believes this is the only way to respond to the concerns and needs of all sections of society, on the basis of consensus. Pimo also defends the preservation of the cultural values of the various ethnic and social groups that make up the Mozambican people. It believes that reconciliation and harmony are the solutions to political differences. It seeks general well- being, social justice, and a pluralist democracy. Pimo believes in a legal state where universal human rights principles are respected. [Alberto] It is said that Mozambican citizens of Islamic origin and "well off" people make up the majority of your party's mambership. Is that unintended or planned? [Sibindy] I think it is unintended because, when the party was formed, it was not our intention to make our politics on the basis of religion. It is quite possible that there are muslims or christians within Pimo, but its guidelines include nothing definite concerning the use of religious "slogans" [preceding word in English]. [Alberto] One of the great revelations made during your party's constitutional conference was that you would be a candidate in the presidential elections, when the first multiparty elections are held. Do you think you might win? [Sibindy] I would perhaps like to correct your question before giving you an answer. When the party held its constitutional conference, there was no point on our agenda pertaining to presidential candidacies. We dealt with everything except what you are saying. To answer your question, replacing presidential with legislative elections, I must tell you that Pimo believes it will participate in the legislative elections and that it will do well. [Alberto] Seeing that we are discussing this matter, would you care to advance your predictions concerning the presidential elections? [Sibindy] Pimo's answer is the same, concerning the presidential elections. It is interested in competing in the presidential elections, but it is up to party structures to decide who will be candidate. [Alberto] What is your party doing to achieve that much desired goal? [Sibindy] Being a journalist, you will know that Pimo has not been much in the press and that we have not talked about our moves. On the contrary, the first time we appeared in the press was on MEDIAFAX. Pimo has not wanted to appear in the press for the simple reason that it believes politics is not made by constantly doing so but, rather, by working with the grass roots, directly with the citizens. For instance, Pimo has branches operating in just about all provinces and districts of the country and it now wants to expand into the smaller areas. Pimo prefers to go about its work quietly so it can reap its fruits -- that it, to increase its membership. To give you an example, we work quietly and then we make a public announcement when we feel we have attained the goals we had sought. Our party's constitutional conference was proof of that. I toured northern Mozambique to do work with the grass roots and I found that the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] are dominant. However, when an unarmed opposition party comes along to do political work with the people, it is prevented by Renamo militants in government-administered areas. Just to give you an example, we were surprised when we were stoned by Renamo supporters or sympathizers. How can people say they have fought for democracy when they break democratic norms just as the results of their struggle begin to emerge? Difficulties in gaining access to Renamo or government-controlled areas in Angoche and Nacala confirm that Renamo is hostile. I can even add that we would have been shot at, had we insisted on forcibly entering those areas.... [Alberto] Given the situation the country is in, what would you do were you to win the country's first free and democratic elections? [Sibindy] Pimo believes that it should strengthen the country's pacification process. The government should not be made up of Pimo members alone, just because Pimo won the elections. There is the need to pacify all political forces in this country so that both those who have weapons and those who do not have them feel responsibile for being part of the new government. Pimo has a research office that talks to workers, Mozambican businessmen, religious figures, traditional chiefs, other traditional figures, people of other perceptions, and civilian society at large to obtain their opinions regarding what they would like to see in certain areas. Pimo would like to institute a unitary state where there is decentralization and a separation of powers. Governors and administrators must be appointed locally. Resources must be used, taking into account the development of each area, after consulting with the people. To Pimo, moral values are one of the most important of its watchwords. It is a priority that people recover their moral values. The individual's participation in society has to do with that individual's moral values. That is an indispensable element to add to the qualities a human being should possess. The regime instituted by the ruling party has been the catalyst of the destruction of Mozambican society's moral values, thereby disrupting the social fabric. Many of the irregularities reported today arise from a lack of moral values in all areas. With regard to progress, Pimo believes that the Mozambican man is central to this country's development. Within this framework, Pimo also intends to implement plans concerning work to integrate citizens through the relevant religious and other civilian institutions. So, Pimo's links with religion aim at an effective implementation of its programs. Within an economic context, Pimo intends to open the necessary space for competition to occur, thereby stimulating development. Pimo supports privatization, the creation of joint enterprises, and a fiscal policy that will serve the interests of national businessmen. [Alberto] In addition to what you have just said, does Pimo have other projects and, if so, in what areas? [Sibindy] The Pimo leadership has devised and drawn up many plans. In the area of construction, Pimo plans to erect a 10-story building where its premises are at this stage. That is to store all the party's bureaucratic machinery at the national level. Some of the flats will be used to provide accommodation for members coming from the provinces. In the transportation sector, Pimo defends the creation of collective transportation companies to minimize the shortages we see today.... [Alberto] For instance, do you not have plans for the agricultural sector? After all, the 16-year war did much to devastate that sector and needs urgent rehabilitation because agriculture is the basis for development in a country such as ours, which is not producing enough at this point. [Sibindy] Pimo has a program for the agricultural sector but, as I have said, I do not think it is opportune to talk about that because work is under way to consult with various sections of civilian society so we get an idea about what they would like our agricultural policy to be. [Alberto] What backing does Pimo have to implement those plans? [Sibindy] In addition to contributions by its members and the funds made available to the political parties by the government, Pimo enjoys the support of the Mozambican and international communities to implement those plans. [Alberto] What social and economic system would Pimo envisage for this country? [Sibindy] Pimo defends a free market economy where the state only has the role of controller. The state's intervention must not be negative. It must let people work as they please, on the basis of mutual trust, because for a person to become a businessman he must be worthy of some trust. There must also be a clear fiscal policy that will not contravene existing norms. [Alberto] What is Pimo's ideological line and what type of state does it stand for? [Sibindy] Ideologically, Pimo pursues a social democratic line. It supports a unitary state with decentralized and separate powers. It is important to note here that provinces and districts must be given the right to decide on certain local matters. For instance, if a district has the means to build a health post, it should do so without having to wait for the red tape of provincial or national structures. [Alberto] When you talk about decentralization, are you thinking about possible federalism? [Sibindy] Well, I am not talking about federalism. As I have pointed out earlier, I am talking about a unitary state. I am talking about decentralizing powers. Autonomy is not in territorial terms in previously established areas. In doing so, Pimo wants to avoid bureaucracy and give responsibilities to the people of each given area. They must take the initiative into their own hands, instead of waiting for decisions to be made for them by the central authorities. [Alberto] Is it in Pimo's plans to accept coalition with other political parties? [Sibindy] Pimo will agree to coalition with other parties to safeguard peace and to strengthen reconciliation. Pimo can form a coalition on the basis of equal treatment and will open the possibility of debate to see to what extent the idea can be implemented. [Alberto] What do you think about the process of confining soldiers that began recently? [Sibindy] Pimo believes the people who are being confined are human beings, so the United Nations must do its best to provide them reasonable logistical cond?tions. [Alberto] What do you think about this process. at least up to this stage? [Sibindy] I believe the process is running smoothly. The steps being taken are encouraging, and with some arrangements the expected results could be achieved. [Alberto] What system among parliamentary, semipresidentialist, and presidentialist democracies would you like to see implemented after the elections? [Sibindy] Pimo would prefer a parliamentary democracy. [Alberto] Why? [Sibindy] Because that system confers strong powers on parliament. In that system the government is appointed by parliament, and it is answerable to parliament. There are constitutional and administrative courts, which are independent organs that intervene on any problem that may emerge. [Alberto] What do you think about reports that the Malawian "Young Pioneers" entered Mozambican territory, and what implications may that have for our country? [Sibindy] If it is true that the Malawi youths are among us, it is an issue that the government has undertaken to solve in good faith, and I must say that I encourage the government to continue working on it using all diplomatic and peaceful means until the problem is solved. This problem threatens peace at a time when we are doing away with the war machine. No one wants a foreign armed force violating our border. Pimo believes the government is in a transitional stage and no one is interested in conflicts. It appeals to the Malawian Government to be understanding and to cooperate with the Mozambican Government. [Alberto] What is your comment on the controversy that emerged in the election of the three members who will represent the unarmed opposition in the National Elections Commission? [Sibindy] I believe Dr. Jose Mayopue's case is unique. I should simply congratulate the unarmed opposition for the position it took. If he feels he is still obligated to the Frelimo and wants to serve it, he cannot possibly render services to other parties. If he left Frelimo, then his case may be an exception. In this case he is the one to choose. We of the opposition should ask Dr. Jose Mayopue what he prefers. [Alberto] Imagine that your party wins elections: Do you already have plans for a foreign policy? [Sibindy] Pimo intends to maintain good diplomatic relations with all countries of the world, giving priority to the development of cooperation among peoples, promotion of the defense and territorial integrity of the country, and peaceful coexistence without interference in domestic affairs of other countries, with reciprocal benefits, equality, friendship, solidarity, and cooperation among peoples. Pimo also intends to have foreign relations that result in mutual benefits. Pimo does not agree with relations based on "priorities." In 1977 Frelimo diverted from its aims, surprising its militants with the announcement that it was a Marxist-Leninist oriented party. I believe this decision was made due to reasons of military cooperation, the supply of weapons, and as a reward for favors. Obviously, the model had to be imposed. Pimo hopes that what happened with Frelimo will not happen with the Renamo; otherwise, we shall have to pay in kind in the years to come for the military undertakings. Pimo is independent because it has not made this kind of undertaking, and when it approaches the international community in line with its foreign policy, it will do so freely without influences such as I have just mentioned. That is why Pimo fears for the victory of one the former warring factions and appeals to the opposition to unite as an independent party. [Alberto] You have previously stated that you had served another party. I would like to know what you think about being a politician. [Sibindy] It is difficult to be a politician, if one's movement is formed under pressure or guided by foreign interests or influences. That is difficult. Pimo favors the formation of a force or political movement that does not depend on external political influence. Even if it is an armed movement, the criteria has to be the same. We should not satisfy the interests of outside blocs in the name of national interests. We believe that a nationalist is the one who, of his free will, strives to serve the nation. Politics is easy if one follows that pattern. It is more difficult to be a politician when there is a tendency to serve foreign interests. [Alberto] Is this why you left the party you belonged to join the one that emerged recently? [Sibindy] Yes, that is the reason. Otherwise I would still belong to Frelimo. As soon as I realized that Frelimo was identifying with interests that did not correspond to Mozambique's, I realized that it was no longer a party whose aim was to serve the people. It was then that I began thinking of leaving it.
