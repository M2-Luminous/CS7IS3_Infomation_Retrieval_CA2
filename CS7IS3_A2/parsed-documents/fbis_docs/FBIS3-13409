According to the government's declaration, support for these movements, activity within them, and even solidarity with them, are offenses which entail a prison penalty. This is what Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir said at the end of the meeting: [Begin Ben-Ya'ir recording] [passage omitted] The government has decided that due to the danger involved in the activity of members of these organizations, there is no choice now but to infringe on the basic democratic liberties of people who belong in or are associated with, or identify with, these movements, and to decide on declaring these organizations as terroristic ones. Membership in an organization which has been declared terroristic; playing a role in such an organization; extending verbal, practical, or financial support to such an organization; or expressing solidarity with it, will all be considered an offense which entails an imprisonment penalty. The above is according to Articles 2, 3, and 4 of the Antiterror Act. The property of the organizations can be confiscated by the state, according to Article 5 of this Act. According to Article 6 of this Antiterror Act, Israel Police's inspector general can decide on the closure of places which serve terrorist organizations or their members as a place of storage or as a basis of activity, meeting, or propaganda, be it regularly or on occasion. The government gave due consideration to the significance of its decision from the viewpoint of infringing on or curtailing basic democratic liberties such as the freedom of association, the freedom of movement, and others, but viewed itself compelled to adopt this decision because of the activity of these movements and their members. [end recording] The cabinet ministers adopted Ben-Ya'ir's recommendation unanimously, but stressed nevertheless, that the decision was not easy. The ministers demand that the decision be enforced, and that the radical settlers be disarmed and removed from places of friction in the territories. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports from the Prime Minister's Office: This evening or tomorrow the attorney general will relay clear operational guidelines to the Shin Bet and the police, according to the government's declaration on Kakh and Kahana Hay as terror organizations. Imprisonment is the sentence facing every member of these organizations, as well as any person who supports them verbally, practically, or financially. Justice Minister David Liba'i clarifies that the decision will not enable the members of Kakh and Kahana Hay to play games with the police and act under a different name. [passage omitted] The ministers demand a rapid implementation of the decision now. Minister Yosi Sarid demands that special mechanisms be established in the Shin Bet, the Justice Ministry, and the police, with their sole duty being that of monitoring the implementation of the decision. Ministers Rubinstein and Tzur demand that the radical settlers be disarmed right away, removed from the territories, and banned from military reserves service. This is first and foremost a moral decision, the cabinet ministers said. This is an extreme move which was difficult for me to vote on, said Minister Moshe Shahal, while Minister Shetrit explained that the cabinet's action was one of no choice. [passage omitted] The cabinet meeting ended only about 30 minutes ago, and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will leave tomorrow, carrying a drastic government decision, declaring Kakh and Kahana Hay terrorist organizations. [Later on in the IDF evening newsreel, Police Minister Moshe Shahal says that the Israel Police has information about "several hundred up to a few thousand" people. Still, everything depends on the guidelines the police receive from the attorney general, and a decision on action will be made according to collected evidence; those who committed "concrete offenses" and against whom there is sufficient evidence will be brought to trial.]
