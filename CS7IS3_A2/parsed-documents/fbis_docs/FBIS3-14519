Commenting on this, JANA's international affairs editor says: The Great Jamahiriyah is the one that adopted the initiative and all the measures for the trial of the two suspects, the latest of which was when it called for the trial of the two suspects before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, and the implementation of the Montreal convention. However, the western governments do not want such a trial because the two suspects are Libyans who have no case to answer, they are not accused of anything specific, and there is no evidence against them. If they are tried in accordance with the law, the West will be exposed and the fallacy of their evidence will be confirmed. The editor concludes: All the suggestions put forward by Libya in this respect are specific and practical suggestions.
