The agreement calls for maintaining the current crude oil production ceiling of 24.52 million barrels per day [bpd] until the end of the year. In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, Oil Minister Safa' Hadi Jawad said that Iraq has reiterated its commitment to the 1990 Geneva agreement because it is the only agreement reached by the OPEC under normal circumstances, because it defines the level of production and prices in a legitimate way, and because it is binding on the OPEC member states. The oil minister said that the recent agreement, which was not signed by Iraq, will cause further deterioration in oil prices in the world market because the ceiling is much higher than the expected world demand for OPEC crude oil, particularly during the second and third quarters of this year. World demand for OPEC crude oil is estimated at 23 million bpd, a figure that is less than OPEC's current production ceiling. The minister noted that the convening of this meeting came at a time when oil prices have deteriorated to a level not seen since the beginning of the seventies. OPEC, he said, had to make a choice: Either to reduce the production ceiling to the level of demand indicated by the oil prices or to maintain the current production ceiling and sacrifice the prices. Dr. Jawad indicated that Saudi Arabia rejected the first choice because it requires it to make a significant drop in its output. Saudi Arabia's current output amounts to one-third of the region's output. He added that Saudi Arabia has claimed that this choice would encourage non-OPEC states to increase their output, something that would result in the decline of OPEC output and its share of the oil market. This, according to the Saudi point of view, would further weaken OPEC. The minister stressed that the nine-month period specified by the agreement will eventually result in weakening OPEC and the market because its does not take into consideration seasonal changes in the demand for oil. Concluding his statement to INA, Dr. Safa Hadi Jawad said that, out of its concern for the individual and collective interests of the OPEC member states, Iraq has rejected this agreement and declared its commitment to the Geneva agreement of 1990 for the reasons mentioned above. He urged the oil exporting nations to adopt stands that protect their interests and stop the continued looting of their resources through the continued reduction in oil prices, which have now dropped to levels lower than those of the early seventies.
