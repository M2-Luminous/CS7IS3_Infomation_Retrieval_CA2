Mr. Halasah and his Iraqi counterpart Ahmad Murtada would cochair the annual board meeting of the Iraqi-Jordanian Land Transport Company (IJTLC) and review the company's 1993 operations and draw up plans for the next year. The meeting will also finalise the 1993 report and annual accounts of the company, owned by the Jordanian and Iraqi governments, officials said. No details of the company's financial status were immediately available. However, the officials said, the company's operations have been adversely affected by the continuing international sanctions against Iraq. Before the sanctions were imposed in August 1990, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the company largely depended on transporting Iraq-bound cargo unloaded at al-'Aqabah to Iraq. The company continued to survive after the imposition of the sanctions on Iraqi imports of food and medicine exempt from the sanctions, but the overall volume of such cargo has decreased gradually, with Iraqi government agencies as well as private sector merchants turning to Iranian, Lebanese and Turkish ports for their imports to avert the costly delays incurred while importing through al-'Aqabah. The delays and higher freight charges are caused as a result of what importers describe as overzealous enforcement of the sanctions by inspectors aboard warships patrolling the Red Sea. During his talks in Baghdad, Mr. Halasah, who is accompanied by the Jordanian board members of the IJLTC and senior company officials, is also expected to raise Jordan's concerns over further decline of Iraqi imports through al-'Aqabah following the reopening of Iraq's Gulf port of Umm Qasr in November, the officials said. While on a visit to Amman in late November, a senior Iraqi transport ministry official was reported to have assured Jordan that there was "a political decision" not to let the reopening of Umm Qasr affect Iraq's imports through al-'Aqabah. But a campaign launched in Baghdad to encourage private sector importers to use Umm Qasr through incentives such as free fuel and bunkering, and guidelines given to shippers to use small-size vessels suitable to the Gulf port's capabilities have fuelled Jordanian concrns. In one case, the Australian Wheat Board was requested to use two 25,000-tonne ships to carry 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Iraq instead of one 50,000-tonne vessel. Umm Qasr can only handle vessels up to a 25,000-tonne capacity. Jordanian shipping agents however, expect a minimum level of Iraq-bound cargo to pass through al-'Aqabah. "Umm Qasr is suitable for Iraqi imports from the Far East," said a shipping agent. "But volume of Iraqi purchase from the Far East is not much anyway. The bulk of Iraqi imports is from Europe, and this has to come through al-'Aqabah." Furthermore, said the agent, many shipowners are reluctant to send their vessels to Umm Qasr because most international insurance companies either refuse to extend coverage to the vessel or demand high premiums. Umm Qasr lies in an area where the threat of mines planted during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war as well as the war over Kuwait remains high. The Jordanian Shipping Agents Association (JSAA) has called on the government to cooperate with the shipping sector to devise a package of incentives to attract shipping lines to use al-'Aqabah.
