He believes the military and civilian authorities were able to take the situation under control. He said that the frequent incidents took place in remote areas where it is difficult for authorities of both the Thai and Cambodian Governments to control. However, the foreign minister is confident that the banditry is not supported by the central government in Cambodia. [Begin Prasong recording] I do not think they were supported by the Cambodian Government. No, it's natural that there are bandits in Cambodia; the same as in our own country. Here we also have a lot of criminals and they are not supported by the government. It is the same. This has nothing to do with relations between the Thai and Cambodian Governments. Relations will remain the same or even be strengthened. When we can discuss with each other, it is easy to solve problems. There is no reason to allow the acts of Cambodian bandits to sour our relations. [end recording] The foreign minister welcomed the news that Thai nationals have started moving out of Pailin which is controlled by the Khmer Rouge. He said the people who move out will be safe from the assault on Pailin planned by the Cambodian Government. Commenting on the same issue, Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said he will leave for Cambodia on 23 March. He expects that he will be able to discuss with Cambodian leaders and find solutions to many troubles along the Thai-Cambodian border. He said the central government in Cambodia always cooperates with the Thai Government. He does not think that the present situation will necessitate closing any border passes.
