The ultimatum contains a demand to immediately lay down arms, the Abkhazian military department reported to Interfax. If this is not done by the end of March 25 then, in accordance with the ultimatum, the Georgian grouping will be eliminated. Security will be guaranteed to those who will lay down their arms. According to Abkhazia's Defense Ministry, in over two days of hostilities the Georgian side has lost 50 people killed and wounded. As Sukhumi reports, hostilities between Georgian and Abkhazian formations in the mountains of the Gulripsh region were resumed on Thursday [24 March] after two Georgian battalions supported by armored vehicles tried to break through the tunnels of the Kodorsky canyon. In the morning of March 25 the Abkhazians entered the village of Nizhnyaya Lata where the headquarters of the Georgian grouping had been staying since last autumn and then went to the mountains after the Abkhazi side's defeat. Meanwhile, Tbilisi asserts that the Abkhazian army is waging punitive operations against the civil population living in the mountainous villages.
