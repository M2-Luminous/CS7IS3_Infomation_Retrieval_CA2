He said in particular, that "Yuriy Meshkov is not a president today for the Crimean Tatar people," because his program envisages a revision of the existing borders. The chairman of the Majlis said that "of all the states of the former union, Ukraine is the only country today that renders the most effective assistance to us. We are well aware of how complicated the current economic situation in the country is and therefore we are not putting forward any particular claims." Replying to the question: "Is Russia extending any help to you," Dzhamilev said: "We do not receive any practical assistance from Russia, however, we should not forget that in the years when our people were subject to deportation, Crimea was under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation, and we hope to intensify all-around methods of influencing Moscow, which bears the bulk of responsibility for the genocide of the Crimean Tatars. We will strive to achieve that Moscow finance the process of the repatriation, rehabilitation [of the Crimean Tatars], and compensation for the losses inflicted on our people." Replying to the questions "how does he assess the statement by President Yuriy Meshkov to the effect that Ukraine should pull its troops out of the territory of the peninsula, and does the Black Sea Fleet ensure Crimea's security," Dzhamilev said: "This is an irresponsible and provocative statement... the Black Sea Fleet issue should be solved quicker and the stationing of the foreign state's ships near our shores is one of the elements that destabilizes the political situation in Crimea."
