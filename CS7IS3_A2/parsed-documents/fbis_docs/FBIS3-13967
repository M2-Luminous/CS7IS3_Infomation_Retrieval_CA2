The latest focal point of the Kashmir crisis is the border township of Kupwara where an army operation against militants led to the killing of about 30 persons. This in turn led to the bandh called by the civilian population which described the operation as a "massacre" by the Indian Army. Government offices, business establishments, banks, post offices and shops were closed throughout the valley--one more proof of the alienation of the people from the Indian government. This has come as a severe blow for the Centre. Its isolation in the trouble torn valley has been exposed just when the Pakistan government is likely to raise the issue of human rights violations by India's security forces in Kashmir at the session of the United Nations human rights commission which began yesterday. Now more than at any other time, the record on human rights is certainly negative for India. In the early Sixties, there was a direct diplomatic offensive by the United Kingdom-United States combine leading to the Duncan Sandys mission that bluntly advocated the vivisection of Kashmir. But the crisis that time was not triggered off by any armed secessionist movement within Kashmir. It arose from India's disastrous confrontation with China over the border dispute leading to armed aggression by the Chinese army. Pakistan, in concert with its international patrons at the time, sought to exploit India's isolation on the international plane. In contrast, this time the near total isolation of India within the Kashmir valley itself is being exploited by Pakistan. Unlike the situation in 1962-63, this time the key to any solution of the Kashmir crisis lies with India to a large extent. It is well worth noting the drift that has overtaken the Indian government's Kashmir policy in the last one year. One can question with good reason if the present government has a Kashmir policy at all. Three months ago, New Delhi's stand was that there had to be an Indo-Pakistani dialogue for a real solution of the Kashmir crisis. It was argued that unless the training and arming of the militant secessionists was stopped there could be no solution. Normalcy in the Kashmir depended on an Indo-Pakistani understanding. Against this background, Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao's message of greetings to Ms. Benazir Bhutto on the occasion of her becoming prime minister in October 1993 and the latter's friendly response were thought to be positive signs the Kashmir problem could begin to be tackled. Then came the protracted siege of the Hazratbal shrine by the Indian Army. It showed up an amazing lack of coordination and common understanding among the various arms of the government right at the ground level. This could hardly be papered over by official denials. In fact, the full story of the Hazratbal episode has not yet come to light, particularly the manner of its settlement. Nevertheless the resolution of the Hazratbal issue opened up new possibilities for some initiatives both at home and abroad. In Kashmir itself, the emergence of the Hurriyat outfit aiming to bring about a rapprochement between the government and the militant groups offered a golden opportunity. For the government could find a new approach to solve the problem within Kashmir itself. But the opportunity was not used. Instead, the army was given the go-ahead to launch a military strike against the militants. The Sopore operation destroyed the chances for any dialogue with the militants. The government itself did not seem unified in its assessment of the way to handle the Kashmir crisis. On one side is the hardline lobby that frankly takes the stand of no-truck whatsoever with the militants. This school thinks that the militants can be wiped out and thereafter the people in the valley brought over to the side of the authorities. There is another school within the government, or rather the political establishment, which realises there can be no solution to the Kashmir crisis through mere armed action. It stresses the need for political initiatives. Undoubtedly nowhere in history has an insurgency been quelled by sheer force. The military can only contain militancy, not eliminate it. However, New Delhi seems to be caught in a dilemma of its own making. It is trying to handle the most explosive of all its problems without having worked out a clear policy. It has been trying to respond to events rather than initiate any policy decision. A careful analysis of New Delhi's reactions to events in Kashmir in the last one year makes it clear that the government has largely depended on the US administration to pull up Pakistan and force it to curb its aggressive designs on India. This dependence is based on the premise that since the Cold War is over, New Delhi cannot be accused of relying on Moscow. Since the government has also been making a thorough effort to dismantle the Nehruvian legacy of economic self reliance and openly inviting US corporate giants to invest in this country and capture even the home market, it expected an era of bonhomie between the two countries. The finance minister, Mr. Manmohan Singh, has assiduously pursued a policy of total subservience to the World Bank prescription of free market economics. He naturally expected this to fetch political dividends. This anticipation has dominated the government's entire thinking on international affairs. But the assumption Washington would recognise India's worth as its largest loyal camp follower in south Asia was naive. An illusion was also fostered that the US administration would listen more to New Delhi than to Islamabad on any issue of contention between India and Pakistan. That was why greater labour was spent by Indian diplomats and the government to canvass for India's case on Kashmir in Washington than make any serious attempt to open a worthwhile dialogue with its neighbour. Even when US state department underlings like Mr. John Mallot and Ms. Raphel made offensive remarks about India's position in Kashmir, the Indian government held on to the illusion it would be able to persuade Washington to brand Pakistan as a "terrorist state". Instead came the two missives from the US president, Mr. Bill Clinton, to two non-descripts. This clearly showed his bias for the militants not only in Kashmir but in Punjab as well. What seems to be totally missed by policy making pundits in New Delhi is that the US administration has never claimed to be a Santa Claus distributing goodies to third world destitutes. It has always maintained its realpolitik for mastery over international affairs and economics, more so after the collapse of its rival superpower, the former Soviet Union. It has never made the mistake of announcing the abandonment of its aspirations to world hegemony. In that design, the emergence of a stable, powerful India can only be a nightmare rather than a benign force. An unstable India in constant friction with its neighbours provides the ideal setting for Washington's policy on south Asia. At the tactical level, Indian diplomats should have realised the present prime minister of Pakistan has long maintained the closest relations with the Democrats in the US. This relationship enabled her to work out a businesslike relationship with the powerful military junta in Pakistan which has never snapped its close links with the Pentagon. Given this alignment of forces, any government in New Delhi has to try its hardest to open a dialogue with the militants in Kashmir. They should be offered autonomy short of secession from the Indian Union. To discuss and negotiate there has to be a ceasefire. Dialogues with all groups of Kashmiris have to include representatives of the refugee intelligentsia as well. And once the Indian government plucks up the courage to make such an offer to Kashmiris who are citizens of India whether they are militants or not, it can be in a position to call upon its Pakistani counterpart to make a similar offer to Kashmiris on the Pakistani side of the line of control. This would represent a healthy competition between the two countries to win over the hearts of the inhabitants of paradise on earth. *
