FR940525-0-00024 FR940525-0-00014 40 CFR Part 180 [PP 9F3699, 9F3793 and 9F3799/R2057; FRL&hyph;4771&hyph;1] RIN 2070&hyph;AB78 Pesticide Tolerances for Clofentezine AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule establishes tolerances for residues of the insecticide clofentezine in or on the following raw agricultural commodities: peaches, nectarines, almonds, walnuts, apricots and cherries and for clofentezine and its metabolite 3-(2-cloro-4-hydroxphenyl)-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine in or on meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep and milk. Nor-Am Chemical Co. requested this regulation to establish maximum permissible levels for residues of the insecticide. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation became effective May 13, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued rules, published in the Federal Registers of June 28, 1990 (55 FR 26438), May 15, 1991 (56 FR 22333), and June 12, 1991 (56 FR 26911), which announced that Nor-Am Chemical Co. had submitted pesticide petitions (PP 9F3699, 9F3793, and 9F3799) to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), establish tolerances for clofentezine in or on peaches at 1.0 part per million (ppm) and nectarines at 1.0 ppm (PP 9F3699); almond hulls at 5.00 ppm, almond nutmeat at 0.5 ppm, walnuts at 0.02 ppm (PP 9F3793); apricots at 1.0 ppm and cherries at 1.0 ppm (PP 9F3799). The Agency established these tolerances with an expiration date of September 30, 1994, to cover residues expected to be present from use during the period of conditional registration for these uses. The conditional registrations were to expire September 30, 1993. The Agency recently extended the conditional registration expiration date to December 31, 1994. The conditional registration required the following information to be submitted. These studies were required because the chronic risk of clofentezine to avian and aquatic species could not be fully evaluated. 1. Avian reproduction studies (bobwhite quail and mallard duck) were required to be repeated. 2. Two aquatic studies, an aquatic invertebrate life-cycle study and a fish life-cycle study, were required. Studies have been submitted and are currently in review, but a final review is not expected to be completed for some time. However, the Agency has conducted a preliminary review of these studies and determined that they are scientifically sound. Therefore, on the basis of Nor-Am's compliance with the requirements of the conditional registration, the Agency is removing the expiration date for the tolerances of the commodities listed above. In the interim, until the Agency is able to complete its final review and risk assessment a conditional registration will remain in effect for the commodities listed above. In the Federal Register of February 9, 1994 (58 FR 42728), the Agency announced receipt of a petition from Nor-Am Chemical Co. requesting to make the tolerances permanent for residues on peaches, nectarines, almonds, walnuts, apricots, and cherries and in or on meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep. No comments were received in response to this notice of filing. As described above, the Agency has decided to remove the expiration date for these tolerances based on Nor-Am's submittal of the studies requested in the conditional registration. Based on the 1-year dog-feeding study with a NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day and using a safety factory of 100, the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for humans is 0.013 mg/kg of body weight/day. The current action will contribute .0000519 mg/kg/day of residue to the human diet utilizing an additional 4.0 percent the ADI. This results in a total utilization of 4.5 percent of the ADI. The scientific data submitted in the petitions and other relevant material have been reviewed. The toxicological data considered in support of these tolerances are discussed in detail in previous final rules establishing tolerances for clofentezine referenced earlier in this document, i.e., the Federal Registers of June 28, 1990 (55 FR 26438), May 15, 1991 (56 FR 22333), and June 12, 1991 (56 FR 26911). The nature of residue is understood. An adequate analytical method, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), is available for enforcement. There are presently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical. This pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objection and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the feed prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor or the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary: and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 17.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that the rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
