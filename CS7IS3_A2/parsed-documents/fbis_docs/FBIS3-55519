"Although the decree was signed almost a month ago, it has not been implemented", Aushev stressed. He also drew attention to the fact that his administration had repeatedly voiced readiness to sit down at the negotiating table with North Ossetian leaders to work out mutually acceptable mechanisms of fulfilling the presidential decree to guarantee the full safety of the two republics citizens. "Regrettably, our appeals to the North Ossetian leadership have evoked a negative response", Aushev said. All of this, in his words, has been least conducive for stability and has been discrediting the federal authorities and the newly adopted constitution. "I believe that responsibility for possible consequences rests with those who obstructs the presidential decree", the statement says. In cables to Russia's Prosecutor General Aleksey Kazannik and to the Central Electoral Commission's Chairman Nikolay Ryabov, Aushev stressed that more than 60,000 deported Ingushes - citizens of North Ossetia - cannot return to their homes and are deprived of the constitutional right to take part in presidential elections scheduled for January 16 in North Ossetia. "If voting takes place without them, election results cannot be recognized as valid", the messages say. A request is made to send legal experts to North Ossetia to monitor the election campaign and the course of presidential elections in line with Russia's constitution.
