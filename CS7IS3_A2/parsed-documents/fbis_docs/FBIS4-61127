"The European Union expresses concern to the Estonian Government regarding the implementation by Estonian authorities of some aspects of the aliens law which came into force on 12 July 1993," the demarche says. "The European Union considers that all state organs, including the parliament, have a particular role in stabilizing the situation of the non-citizens and in contributing towards their future integration into Estonian society," it continues. Estonian Foreign Ministry press service told ETA that at the meeting with Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik, the "European Union stressed that it accepts Estonian aliens law and its juridical logic." Spokeswoman of the Ministry Mari-Ann Rikken told ETA that the demarche had no connection whatsoever with the Russian troop withdrawal issue from Estonia and European Union still demanded Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia by 31 August 1994, connecting it to no other issues. Rikken said that the demarche was caused by discontent of the EU in the slow application of the law, which has caused "tension and dissatisfaction" among non-citizens. Last week, the ruling coalition decided at its two-day meeting in Lohusalu near Tallinn, that the implementation of the aliens law had to be prolonged and most probably the application deadline for residence and working permits for the aliens will be prolonged for one year from the present 12 July 1994 deadline. Deputy head of the ruling Fatherland Party Kalle Jurgenson told the POSTIMEES daily that in the nearest future a respectable bill on amending the aliens law will be handed in to Riigikogu [parliament] proceedings.
