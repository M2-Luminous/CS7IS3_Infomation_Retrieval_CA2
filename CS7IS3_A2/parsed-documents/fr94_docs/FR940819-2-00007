FR940819-2-00007 FR940819-2-00001 (7) All FP loans will be current after the scheduled installments are set-aside. §§1951.954&hyph;1951.956 [Reserved] §1951.957 Eligibility determination and processing. (a) Eligibility determination. Upon receipt of a DSA request, the County Supervisor will determine whether the borrower meets the eligibility requirements set forth in §1951.953(c) of this subpart and notify the borrower of the results within 30 days from the date of the DSA request. The file shall contain documentation to reflect the date of request and the date the borrower was notified and the addendum signed. (1) The borrower shall be provided up to 30 days to sign Exhibit A, ``Addendum to the Promissory Note/Assumption Agreement for the Disaster Set-aside Program.'' If the addendum is not signed within 30 days and/or prior to the borrower becoming more than 1 installment behind, the DSA request will be withdrawn and the borrower notified of their appeal rights under subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. (2) Pending requests for primary loan servicing will continue to be considered as set forth in subpart S of this part. However, borrowers cannot accept servicing under both programs. (i) Borrowers determined eligible for the DSA and 1951&hyph;S servicing will be required to choose between the two program requests. The choice will be noted in the borrower case file and initialed by the borrower. (ii) Borrowers may choose to proceed with the DSA prior to a decision being made for primary loan servicing such as in cases where a decision will not be available on the primary loan servicing application prior to the borrower becoming more than 1 installment behind. (iii) The application for the program not chosen will automatically be withdrawn at the time the installment(s) are set-aside or the loan(s) restructured, whichever is applicable. This voluntary withdrawal is not appealable. (iv) By signing Exhibit A of this subpart, the borrower agrees to the withdrawal of any pending request for primary loan servicing. The borrower may resubmit a request at any time according to subpart S of this part. (b) Processing. Installments will be set-aside as set forth in this paragraph. (1) All borrowers liable for the debt will sign Exhibit A of this subpart for each loan installment set-aside. Exhibit A may be modified with the assistance of the Office of the General Counsel to comply with individual State laws. (2) Only one unpaid installment for each FP loan may be set-aside. (i) The installment set-aside will be the first scheduled annual installment due immediately after the disaster occurred, or if that installment is paid current, the next scheduled annual installment. Set-aside will not be granted on the loan if both of these installments are paid current. (ii) The amount set-aside will not exceed the annual scheduled installment being set-aside minus any portion of that installment paid prior to Exhibit A being signed by the borrower. This amount will include the unpaid interest and any principal that would be credited to the account as if the installment were paid on the due date. (iii) Recoverable cost items charged to FO, SW, and RHF loans may be set-aside with the annual installment. Cost items identified with a loan number different from the parent loan cannot be set-aside. (3) Interest will accrue on any principal amount set-aside at the same rate charged the non-set-aside portion. Interest will not accrue on the interest portion set-aside. (4) The amount set-aside, including interest accrual on any principal set-aside, will be due on or before the final due date of the loan. (5) There are no security requirements attached to the DSA program. All existing security instruments will remain in effect.
