Major points of the policy are that 1) with regard to the number of car dealers selling foreign-built automobiles in Japan, the U.S. Government will seek an objective criteria in the form of a figure, but it will unequivocally indicate in writing that the objective criteria does not mean any numerical targets, and 2) the U.S. Government sees it as important to achieve certain results in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks prior to the Japan-U.S. summit talks, but it will not necessary seek the conclusion of a set of trade agreements on all sectors prior to the summit talks. The Japanese Government still takes the view that "setting any goals will become numerical targets in the end." The U.S. Government's policy is taken as a strategy designed to wring a "political decision" from the Japanese Government by indicating that the objective criteria does not mean a numerical target. In his lecture given right after the Japan-U.S. framework talks resumed, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor stated that "the Japanese Government should promise to increase the number of car dealers selling foreign automobiles by a certain period." He made the request as an example of the objective criteria to measure the future openness of the Japanese vehicle market. The Japanese Government reacted strongly against his request, claiming: "What he requested means a strict numerical target. The government cannot tell car dealers what to do." Another U.S. Government official has said: "What the Japanese Government needs to promise is not an increase in the number of car dealers, but the `implementation of measures' to open the Japanese market through the relaxation of regulations and transparency of transactions. I think it is better to use the expression `desirable,' or `anticipated' instead of `promise.'" In this way, the U.S. Government official has suggested that the U.S. Government is willing to compromise with the Japanese Government on the question of objective criteria. The U.S. Government wants to avoid being criticized by Japan, the American news media, the European Union (EU), and Asian nations for "seeking a numerical target." Mindful of the criticism, a high-ranking White House official has made it clear that "The U.S. Government will not care about indicating that the 'objective criteria does not mean any numerical target in a final agreement document.'" Looking at the dispute over car dealers in Japan, there is no change in the fact, however, that "individual objective criteria sought by the U.S. Government is very similar to numerical targets," (says a Japanese Government official). The Clinton administration, which has made "results-oriented trade" the basis for its trade policy toward Japan, wants to set the numerical targets one way or another in the future. How to express that objective criteria does not mean numerical targets in the final agreement document will be a task for the U.S. Government. Meanwhile, a Japanese negotiator has said: "The Japanese Government has promised to expand market access and sales for competitive foreign goods. When the U.S. Government criticizes Japan for not opening its market widely, the term `competitiveness' can be used by the Japanese Government as a trump card to refute the criticism. The Japanese Government will be able to argue with the U.S. Government about whether foreign goods have been competitive or not on the Japanese market." In this way, the official pointed to the importance of wording in the final agreement document.
