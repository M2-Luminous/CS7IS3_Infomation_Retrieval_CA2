While reporting to the prime minister on details of the conference, Kobayashi and other business leaders indicated their views that with the upturn in the U.S. economy, the repulsion for Japan that had existed in American industrial circles was gradually weakening. After the meeting, Kobayashi and other businessmen stressed: "In the United States, the atmosphere is entirely different at the governmental and private-sector levels. It is not so intensified at the private-sector level." They disclosed that in their report to the prime minister on the details of the CJAB, they had stressed this belief.
