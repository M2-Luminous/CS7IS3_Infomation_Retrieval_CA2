Twelve of them were granted bail after paying a mandatory fine of 10,000 naira (455 dollars) imposed on them by the Yaba magistrates (lower) court, said the source. Meanwhile, a 17-year-old pro-democracy activist, Sunday Saji also arrested on Monday is still being detained, a statement by the Campaign for Democracy (CD) said. The CD, which is the umbrella group for about 40 human rights and pro-democracy associations in Nigeria, called for the immediate release of the teenager. Pro-democracy groups called for a boycott of the elections held at ward level on Monday for the constitutional conference. Instead they want the military to step down and a sovereign national conference to be convened to debate the country's future.
