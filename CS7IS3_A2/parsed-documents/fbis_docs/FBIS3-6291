Kantor made the remarks in testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee on 15 March. [passage omitted] Concerning the remarks of U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, the government said that in the automobile sector, the amounts to be imported are decided entirely by the thinking of consumers and automakers, and that the government's making a guarantee would lead to the government's meddling in private sector activities. A government source stated that the recent remarks of U.S. Trade Representative Kantor are aimed at securing some kind of guarantee from the Japanese Government with respect to Japanese automakers' plans to procure auto parts in a way similar to that found in agreements concluded between private companies of Japan and the United States and also between the governments of the two countries last week regarding the facilitation of plant and equipment investment to benefit a U.S. cellular phone company.
