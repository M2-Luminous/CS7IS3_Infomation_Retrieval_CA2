[passage omitted] He added that the council heard a report from the minister of state for foreign affairs on his participation in the Arab League foreign ministers meetings. He said Jordan is very eager that Arab meetings reflect the Arab desire and tendency to hold a unified position. He said Jordan believes that there are problems facing the process of clearing Arab atmosphere and returning Arab relations to their previous situation, saying Jordan has an open heart to all Arab brothers who want to have relations with Jordan on the basis of fraternity and sincerity. Dr. al-'Anani said the Arab League Council delayed discussing the subject of the Arab League Charter, on which there were several ideas presented for discussion. He said His Majesty King Husayn was the first to demand the reconsideration of the charter so that it can cope with new circumstances. As for bilateral relations with Egypt, Dr. al-'Anani said the minister of state for foreign affairs met at the sidelines of the Arab foreign ministers meetings with Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, and an agreement was reached to hold meetings of the Jordanian-Egyptian higher joint committee in the second half of April. The meetings had previously been delayed. [passage omitted] Answering a question on the U.S. proposal that a barge carry out inspection at the port of al-'Aqabah, Dr. al-'Anani said the presence of a barge in the port would conflict with Jordanian sovereignty and that Jordan could not accept this. He said that there has been no such proposal at all. He said what was demanded was that a neutral international quarter assigned by the United Nations carry out inspection of vessels that unload their cargoes in the port of al-'Aqabah. He said that Jordan rejects the presence of any military forces from any party because Jordan maintains its sovereignty. Had Jordan been willing to relinquish this sovereignty, it would have allowed the ships that inspect al-'Aqabah-bound vessels to cross into Jordanian territorial waters to reach the port and carry out inspections. This was the original problem that delayed the vessels in the past, because the government totally rejects this. He said we accept the presence of civilian technical observers from a specialized neutral quarter who give certificates that the inspected cargoes do not contain anything that violates the economic sanctions.
