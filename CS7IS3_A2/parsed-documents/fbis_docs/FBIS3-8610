Tomorrow, he is to meet with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who will decide after this talk whether he will entrust Professor Rossati with the vacant posts in the government. [Begin recording] [Rossati] The point, above all, is to avoid misunderstandings later. So, I judge that it is good to clarify all of the matters that might become subjects of dispute before the decision is made on the subject of a possible nomination. So... [Unidentified correspondent interrupting] What matters might these be, in your view? [Rossati] Well, I judge that it is necessary to very clearly specify the prerogatives of the deputy prime minister for economic affairs because, probably, the past has shown that, well, if there is a lack of this, that is a precise specification of prerogatives, and certain misunderstandings might ensue on certain matters. And another matter is the assurance of some sort of good day-to-day cooperation with both the prime minister and the remaining members of the government. Well, for this it is necessary to set some sort of procedure for contacts, meetings. I think that these are not matters that cannot be determined. [Correspondent] The case of the Foreign Indebtedness Servicing Fund [FOZZ]? [Rossati] I judge that this is obvious. If one carries on investigative proceedings in such a case as that of the FOZZ, it is necessary to seek the views of, or to interview, all the people who can bring something into the case, who know something about the case. It is just that I am surprised that this is being spoken of only two and half years after the investigation was begun. So, in my view, the choice of this moment is, well, not a coincidence.
