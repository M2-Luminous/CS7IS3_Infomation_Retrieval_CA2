Such result was a surprise for 78 MP's who abstained (27 members of Rukh faction, 27 MP's from the group "Reforms", 26 members of faction "Statehood"). One day before the voting, those MP's were quite optimistic since the faction "Unity" (26 MP's) and faction "Center" were against elections of the premier. Les Tanyuk, MP representing Rukh, predicted that only 140 MP's, representing communists, socialists and agrarians, would vote for Masol. Leader of the democratic party V. Yavorivskyy stated that at least half of the faction "Center" would be against the candidature of Mr. Masol. Quite unexpectedly, there was a split among the left-wingers -- parliamentarians from Donetsk region tended to back the candidature of Lazarenko. However, Speaker Moroz proposed to postpone the election till next day. It is hard to say what kind of changes occurred within one night but, be that as it may, the left-wingers formed common opinion and pursued quite a few MP's from factions "Unity" and "Center" to vote for Masol. Thus, V. Masol, former head of the state planning committee and the premier of Ukraine in 1987-1990 again was elected to this high post. Almost 4 years ago, the students went on hunger strike and made him resign on the 17th day of that strike. In October of 1990, this man was a symbol of a rotten communist system. However, the authorities did not fulfill other demands of students. Rumors have it that in the last 4 years Mr. Masol headed a company having a lot of offices abroad. His son is manager of "Rostok" company producing kitchen equipment. The company is profitable and popular among consumers. Ex-Premier Y. Zvyagilskyy said that he had voted for Masol because the latter is good specialist and businessman who would stick to the policy of economic stabilization. Speaker Moroz told our correspondent that the Cabinet would undergo considerable changes. Says Mr. Moroz: "Nobody should complain that Mr. Masol is procommunist. First and foremost, he is a professional". According to leader of communists V.Symonenko, Masol meets the interests of not only the party of communists but the people of Ukraine as a whole. One communist parliamentarian told that there had been heated debates among communists concerning Masol's candidature. He says that the fact that communists backed him was the compromise with centrists. Many communists did not like his address to the parliament in which he underscored his adherence to market reforms. Says famous economist V. Pylypchuk, member of faction "Reforms": Having heard his program, I understood that Mr. Masol had changed much. His program is 90 percent similar to mine. The main thing is that he should keep his promises". Mr. Pylypchuk stressed the difference between economic programs of Masol and Speaker Moroz. The latter, however, stated prior to elections that the parliament and government would act in unison if Masol was elected the premier of Ukraine. According to Mr. Pylypchuk, it is good that left-wingers supported Masol since now they have no arguments in accusing the democrats of opposition. His opinion is shared by his colleagues from Rukh and "Reforms" factions. None of them is going to work in the Cabinet. O. Yemets, the minister for the matters of nationalities in Zvyagilskyy's Cabinet, resigned on the next day after Masol was elected the premier. He believes that the government will be procommunist one and rejects any idea of formation of coalition cabinet. It seems that new premier likes such state of affairs. In particular, he states that his Cabinet would consist of professionals having no political sentiments. It was President Kravchuk who nominated Masol to the premier's post. This was done after parliamentary commissions considered the list of candidates including Y.Zvyagilskyy, leader of liberals I. Merkulov, former Vice Premier V.Symonenko, representative of Dnipropetrovsk nomenklatura V.Lazarenko, plant director V. Melnyk and V. Masol. O. Zayets, secretary of Rukh faction, thinks that Masol's candidature was the best of them all but believes that the Premier had to be elected from "new people". Thus the victory of left-wingers at parliamentary elections was supported by appointing of the most odious person (for their opponents) to the premier's post. It seems improbable that the coalition government will be formed since democrats reject any idea to work in the cabinet. Still, Mr. Masol may cooperate with Pynzenyk and Lanovyy to partially implement their programs. It is worth underscoring that the victory of left-wingers can neutralize separatist sentiments in southern and eastern regions of Ukraine.
