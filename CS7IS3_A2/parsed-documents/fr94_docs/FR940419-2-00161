FR940419-2-00161 FR940419-2-00086 (g) Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319 of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the HUD implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal contracts, grants or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. IHAs established by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from the statute's coverage. If the amount applied for is greater than $100,000, the certification is required at the time application for funds is made that federally appropriated funds are not being or have been used in violation of the Byrd Amendment. If the amount applied for is greater than $100,000 and the HA has made or has agreed to make any payment using nonappropriated funds for lobbying activity, as described in 24 CFR Part 87 (Byrd Amendment), the submission also must include the SF&hyph;LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities. The HA determines if the submission of the SF&hyph;LLL is applicable.
