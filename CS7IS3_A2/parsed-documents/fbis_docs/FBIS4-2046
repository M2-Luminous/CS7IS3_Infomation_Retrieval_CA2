The provincial party committee and government held a mobilization rally on the morning of 4 March on the organizational reform of the organs directly under the province to implement the plan for the party and government organizational reform of Jilin Province approved by the party Central Committee and the State Council and to mobilize and arrange the party and government organizational reform of the organs directly under the province. He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, chaired the rally. Liu Yazhi, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and director of its organization department, read the circular of the party Central Committee and the State Council on the plan for the party and government organizational reform of Jilin Province and the plan for the setup of Jilin's provincial-level party and government organizations. On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, Gao Yan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of Jilin, spoke to mobilize and arrange the provincial-level party and government organizational reform and put forward clear requirements. Gao Yan pointed out: The provincial party committee decided that Jilin's party and government organizational reform should be conducted in such a way that the province as well as counties and cities will start first and that the province will lead the reform of cities [shi] and the autonomous prefecture, and counties and cities will lead the reform of towns and townships. The organizational reform at the provincial level and the county level should be by and large completed in the first half of this year, and efforts should be made to complete the organizational reform at the city or autonomous prefectural level and the town or township level in the second half of this year. According to the province's party and government organizational reform plan approved by the party Central Committee and the State Council, Jilin's provincial-level party and government organizations will total 54 after the organizational reform. After the reform, the provincial party committee will have nine organizations directly under it. The provincial discipline inspection commission; the general office, organization department, propaganda department, united front work department, commission for politics and law, research office, and rural work office of the provincial party committee; and the work committee of the organs directly under the Jilin Provincial CPC Committee are the agents of the provincial party committee. In addition, the provincial party committee's veteran cadre bureau, medical bureau, office of the secrets commission, office of the overseas propaganda group, and office of the leading group for the work toward Taiwan will be put under the administration of the departments of the provincial party committee. In line with the above-mentioned reform plan, the organizations directly under the provincial party committee will be reduced by four, or 30.8 percent, from the original 13 before the reform. After the organizational reform, the provincial government will have 46 departments. They are general office, planning commission, economic and trade commission, economic structural reform commission, education commission, science and technology commission, the foreign affairs office of the provincial government, public security department, state security department, supervision department, civil affairs department, justice department, finance department, personnel department, labor department, geological and mineral resources department, construction department, machinery industry department, metallurgical industry department, petrochemical industry department, light industry department, communications department, water resources department, agriculture department, forestry department, trade department, grain department, foreign trade department, foreign economic cooperation department, culture department, radio and television department, public health department, physical culture and sports commission, family planning commission, auditing department, statistical bureau, industrial and commercial administration, press and publication bureau, township enterprise management bureau, tax bureau, environmental protection bureau, land management bureau, the legal system bureau of the provincial government, construction industry bureau, and coal industry bureau. In addition, following the state's method, nine organizations under the administration of the commissions and departments will be established: state property management bureau, technological supervision bureau, building material industry bureau, medical administration, food industry bureau, labor reform work administration, the letters-visits office of the provincial party committee and government, the investigation and study office of the provincial government, and the reception office of the provincial government. These organizations under the administration of commissions and departments will be at the deputy-departmental level. In line with the above-mentioned plan, the organizations of the provincial government will be reduced by 23, or 33.3 percent, after the reform. Gao Yan pointed out: The organizational reform of the provincial-level people's congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference organs, court, and procuratorate will be conducted simultaneously with the party and government organizational reform, and so will be the reform of mass organizations, such as the provincial trade union council, Communist Youth League committee, and women's federation. Speaking on the reform of the institutions directly under the province, Gao Yan pointed out: The orientation is the separation of government functions from the functions of the institutions and socialization of the institutions. After the reform, the personnel of the institutions directly under the province who are supported by financial allocation will be reduced by over 20 percent. Speaking on the organizational reform of cities, autonomous prefecture, counties, cities [shi], towns, and townships, Gao Yan urged that they should step up implementation of the plan for the provincial party and government organizational reform after it is transmitted to lower levels, study and work out the specific plans for the organizational reform at their own levels, and apply for approval according to the stipulated procedures to their implementation. Gao Yan also pointed out: In coordination with the provincial party and government organizational reform, we should popularize or try out the state public servant system in a timely manner. All departments of the provincial organs should institute the system in a timely manner after their organizational reform plans are approved. The system should be popularized or tried out mainly in party and government organs. When popularizing or trying out the public servant system, the organs directly under the province should adhere to the following basic principles. First, the organizational reform and the popularization or experimentation of the public servant system should be conducted under unified plans and in a coordinated manner, and they should support each other. Second, key areas should be emphasized and consideration should also be given to other areas. Third, standards should be unified, different guidance given, and overall operation conducted. Fourth, the organizations should be improved, their quality raised, and their personnel optimized. Comrade He Zhukang gave an important speech at the mobilization rally. He emphasized: The following work should be made successful if we are to achieve success in the present organizational reform. First, we should make conscientious efforts to unify thinking. Pertinent comrades of all units should first take the lead in studying documents and unifying their thinking in line with the plan for the reform and the decision of the provincial party committee and government to ensure smooth implementation of the present organizational reform. Second, we should give attention to focus in doing work. We should devote more efforts to raising work efficiency. All organizations and personnel should strive to raise work efficiency in line with the requirements of the new functions and the qualifications of public servants. Third, we should correctly handle the relationship between organizational reform and day-to-day work. Fourth, we should strengthen leadership. To make the present organizational reform successful, we should strengthen the party's unified leadership, adhere to the principle of democratic centralism, and strictly enforce discipline. Matters related to the organizational reform should be decided after collective discussions, and the practice of letting only one person or a few persons have the final say should not be permitted. This system should be strictly implemented particularly in the transfer of personnel. Taking advantage of the reform to promote cadres quickly, grant titles, divide up money and materials, and transfer public property must never be allowed. Pertinent departments should strengthen supervision and examination and strictly deal with the law and discipline breaches discovered in the process of reform.
