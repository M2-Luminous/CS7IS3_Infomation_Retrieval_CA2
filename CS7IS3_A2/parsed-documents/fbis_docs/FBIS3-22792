They were commenting on a disclosure by a U.S. State Department official in Washington that "difficulties" were being experienced by agency inspectors who went to North Korea a week ago to vet seven declared facilities. They are trying to determine whether North Korea has diverted plutonium from its Yongbyon reactor since the IAEA's last full inspection in February last year. Agency spokesman David Kyd refused however to go into detail about the reported difficulties. The inspection was continuing, with some tasks accomplished and others still to be carried out, he said. The team hoped to wind up the mission as scheduled by next Tuesday, and there was no plan to recall the inspectors any earlier. "It is half-time now and there is no use in speculating how the game will end," Kyd remarked.
