Even though the Albanian authorities have recently greatly intensified their response, fuel still makes its way toward the most bloody war zone in Europe. However, in the most recent incidents involving this illegal traffic, not only smugglers and various oil distribution firms but employees and even officers of the Shkoder Border Police have been proved to have been involved. In the meantime, firms suspected of being directly involved in shipping fuel to Montenegro are the focus of investigations by the general Directorate of the Albanian Financial Police. In recent days, the financial authorities have requested the suspension of the contract of the Italian-Albanian AIP firm, because, they claim, "80-90 percent of its fuel heads for Shkoder." Immediately after the discovery of six tanker trucks returning empty from the Yugoslav border, Fejzi Tahiri, officer at the Murgian border post, was detained on suspicion of having allowed these vehicles to cross illegally into Montenegro. The drivers of the six oil-smuggling tankers were also sent to prison. Official sources in Shkoder state that the detained persons come from the towns of Elbasan, Vlore, and Patos. A few days ago, when two other tanker trucks were observed to cross, five soldiers and one officer of the border police post at Pulaj were detained, all accused of "allowing vehicles involved in oil smuggling to cross in collaboration with Albanian citizens." Meanwhile, according to investigations by the general Directorate of the Financial Police, it is suspected that the six tankers sequestrated after returning from Yugoslav territory were loaded in Durres by the Italian-Albanian firm AIP. Following evidence from other incidents, the General Directorate of the financial Police has asked for the joint contract to be suspended, arguing that "a good part of AIP's activity, in other words about 80-90 percent of its oil, is directed toward Shkoder, with an ultimate destination beyond the Albanian state border."
