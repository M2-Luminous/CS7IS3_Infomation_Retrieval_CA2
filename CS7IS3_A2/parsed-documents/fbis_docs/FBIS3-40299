The trial against the defendants will begin within a month in the military court in Sarajevo. Most of the accused soldiers, who belonged to the deactivated 9th and 10th Sarajevo brigades, have been detained; a detention order was issued for the remainder. The soldiers are charged with an act of rebellion to return their former commanders, Musan Topalovic-Caco, a former 10th Mountain Brigade commander, and Ramiz Delalic-Celo, a former 9th Motorized Brigade commander, to their positions. Caco, Celo, and three other commanders used their units to blockade Sarajevo. They placed a cannon on the Bistrika mountaintop and aimed it at the 1st Corps building housing the security services and the city jail. According to the bill of indictment published by OSLOBODJENJE, the defendants are accused of planning an attack on the Bosnian Presidency Headquarters and several police stations in Sarajevo on 2 July and 2 October. The rebellion was mercilessly suppressed during the night of 26-27 October. Three police, six military police personnel, and eight civilians were killed in the operation against Celo and Caco. According to the Bosnian Government's statement, Caco was shot while trying to escape arrest.
