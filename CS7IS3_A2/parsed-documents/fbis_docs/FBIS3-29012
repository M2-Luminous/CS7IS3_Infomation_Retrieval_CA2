After the U.S. Senate approved a bill to lift trade sanctions against Vietnam, Bill Clinton officially announced the lifting of sanctions yesterday and thus the way was cleared for investment by U.S. companies and establishments in Vietnam. According to agency reports, with the lifting of the sanctions at least 25 American firms that had offices in Vietnam, which up until now were prevented from extensive activity for political reasons, have started their work. The lifting of trade sanctions against Vietnam has taken place at the same time as the publication of reports in which its supporters in Washington spoke of the adverse effects of the continuation of those sanctions on the unhealthy U.S. economy. Moreover, that group supporters of the lifting of sanctions in Washington believe that by lifting the sanctions against Vietnam, Washington will be in a better position to access that country's market in international competition. Before the lifting of the sanctions against Vietnam, Washington had set two preconditions for improving its relations with them. First was a clarification of the status of 1,500 American soldiers who disappeared during the Vietnam war. The other was the speeding up of the trend of reforms that had started in 1985. But the new political and economic realities in Vietnam are such that America cannot give up a country that possesses rich oil and mineral resources, as well as the potential to absorb foreign investment and pull back from international competition, especially when Japan, France, and China, as well as other powerful European industrial states and East Asian regions, started their efforts some time ago to establish a serious presence in the reconstruction of that country and offering financial aid to Hanoi. It is clear that the main obstacle in America's extensive presence in Vietnam is China's policy regarding Hanoi, something that has created concern in Washington. Those concerns stem from the fact that if China succeeds in gathering the small South Asian states -- that earlier were allied to the former Soviet Union -- around its own axis and prevent their strong leaning toward Western capitalism, that country's political success will be further strengthened in South Asia. Therefore, if the issue of lifting the trade sanctions against Vietnam is viewed from the angle of the formation of economic and commercial competition in South Asia, as well as China's policy regarding Hanoi, the trend of normalizing relations between Vietnam and America will be justifiable in the eyes of Washington's statesmen. Thus, it seems that Vietnam's future, from a political and economic point of view, will take the form of a competition framework between China and America.
