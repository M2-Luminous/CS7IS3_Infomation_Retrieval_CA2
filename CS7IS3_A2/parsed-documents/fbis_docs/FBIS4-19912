The ministers of the Twelve, meeting in Council session, adopted a whole series of measures intended to offer support to the new government that will emerge from the elections on 26 and 28 April 1994. The promise of aid to South Africa is a Community action falling under the heading of European foreign policy. From the outset, however, the EU specified that respect for human rights and democracy were an essential element of relations between the EU and South Africa. First of all, the Twelve promise to work toward canceling UN sanctions against Pretoria, which are still being imposed. The current support program for the peaceful transition to democracy in South Africa is continuing provisionally, and the Union must continue to earmark the funds required for this action, maintained the ministers. They recalled that they intend to contribute mainly toward improving the standard of living of the poorest sectors of the population. As for long-term relations, the Twelve emphasized that they do not consider South Africa as a developing country, but that they are inclined to allow it to benefit from the same commercial advantages as such countries. They also promised to contribute toward the establishment and development of regional cooperation between southeast African and Indian Ocean countries. The EU is calling for mutual investments, encouraged and guaranteed by various agreements. To this end, it will ask the EIB (European Investment Bank) to extend its activities to South Africa. The Twelve said they were ready to collaborate in a large number of areas, such as education and training, industry, trade, telecommunications, research, and technology. As soon as the new government takes office, the EU intends to support the establishment of political dialogue and encourage the South African cabinet to work toward social justice and to eliminate all forms of racial, political, religious, and cultural discrimination. The Twelve also confirmed that they wanted to hold an international conference on 6 and 7 September 1994 in Berlin, gathering together all the countries of southern Africa.
