Pope John Paul II has already criticized this conference. Sernam [National Women's Secretariat] Director Josefina Bilbao explained Chile's position on this conference which will be held in Cairo. She explained that, during the conference, Chile will express its opposition to abortion, an issue that will be discussed and which has been harshly criticized by Pope John Paul II. But the Chilean position differs from that of the Vatican in that it upholds that there is more than one type of family. Bilbao said that the National Family Council believes this concept also encompasses common-law marriages and single-parent families. She added that Chile supports birth control, which has been practiced in our country for the past 30 years.
