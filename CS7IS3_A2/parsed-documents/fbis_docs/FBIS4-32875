You seem to be concerned about what they say. [Wasmosy] Today a social communicator has much more power than a minister. So much so that if a bad communicator says something silly, people tend to believe what he said, even when you prove it is nonsense and untrue. Today the so-called fourth power plays an essential role in the process to consolidate democracy. Of course, it is a process to form a conscience and mature. We must all learn, including those who own those key means of communications. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] It is surprising to see how much the media has changed since Alfredo Stroessner's times. [Wasmosy] Just think that in the past we used to read the newspaper from back to front. Influential journalists, in fact the only ones around, were those who specialized in soccer or other sports. Now everything has changed, although in some aspects everything is being exaggerated. Every front page is full of reports on scandals, corruption; nothing constructive. We have the impression that we live in chaos. But you have seen that is not the case. Nothing happens in the streets. There is no violence. People work in cities and rural areas. We have problems, of course, but not to the degree stressed by the press. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Do you think there are special reasons or interests behind that exaggeration? [Wasmosy] In general terms, I can say that the campaign has intensified since the Sao Paulo Forum meeting (international leftist leaders meeting). Many people will be in trouble if democracy consolidates, as the country will grow and they will no longer be able to live as if the country were a ranch. The same thing will happen with other nations that think it convenient to keep us as suppliers of raw materials. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] I see that you maintain a nationalist spirit, something traditional in Paraguay. [Wasmosy] Look, this is personal, a very personal opinion. There are two strong institutions in this country turning nationalism into something very strong: the Church and the Army. This is why they are so often attacked. On one hand we have all these tents and protest movements that are separating the Church from its evangelical and pastoral mission, and pressuring it to enter the political arena in the name of a liberation theory. Many people are involved in this campaign. We must be careful because it does not affect only us. But I do not want to speak about other countries, as a matter of respect. In other places these forces have also tried to divide the Army, but they failed despite all their efforts. The Armed Forces are being reorganized, without losing respect for the chain of command or discipline. We are giving it the human dimension required. The Armed Forces not only respect me, they even like me. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] They will surely love you if you maintain or increase their budget. [Wasmosy] Look, I will contradict you. The number of generals was reduced from 62 to 38, and Congress stripped them of even their food coupons and reduced everything they had. They have adapted. I must be honest and say this because no one else admits it in this country. We face other risks. Those crying out on behalf of the ecology are people coming from industrialized countries, people who have destroyed everything. They try to use our Indians--we have 17 ethnic groups in Paraguay--as a mechanism to divide us and destroy the country's unity. They do everything to us. They overwhelm us. They seem to forget that democracy cannot exist without bread, and that it is very expensive. Just look at the issue of drugs. We are being pressured because it is said that our country is being used for the transit of drugs. I say: Send helicopters, radars, and even personnel to control the traffic, but if consumption is not curtailed production, will never drop. We must be honest and accept that the principle of supply and demand does not exist for certain items alone. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] The economy is becoming global. Do you not think that violence might also become global? And I cite the case of Chiapas, in Mexico, as an example. [Wasmosy] Chiapas, Santiago del Estero [Argentina], San Pedro in Paraguay, etc. Everything is part of a single plan. Proof of that is that part of the labor movement believes in violence and asks for things they know cannot be granted: a 40 percent salary increase, withdrawal from Mercosur [Common Market of the South], an urgent employment policy, etc. It is very easy to ask. I would like to ask an entrepreneur who tried to become president and who supported the strike [referring to National Encounter's Guillermo Caballero Vargas]: If he agrees with the strike's motives, why does he not grant a 40 percent salary increase to his own employees? Because you must be consistent and do what you say should be done. About the demand to withdraw from Mercosur, I say as president, because I have also been integration minister, that I will not integrate the country if integration will not benefit our country. But I am convinced there is no other path than integration, unless someone shows me something better. That does not mean I will jump into an empty swimming pool and kill my country with me. There are different ways to integrate. How can you ask for a 40 percent increase if that means 40 percent inflation? In Mercosur we are calling for coordination of macroeconomic policies. Then, gentlemen, we must find a way to understand the problem facing Brazilians without ruining Argentine industrialists. I do not have the instruments to implement our government programs, but what can I do? We have an obsolete Penal Code and Code of Proceedings while banks raise interest rates. We cannot retool our industries with 36 percent or 42 percent interest rates. But what is the problem? The problem is that I cannot tighten the screws because of the Central Bank Law and the Banks Law approved in 1952. We must update all those mechanisms. We have a new Constitution, and we must adapt those laws to the new Constitution and update them. We are developing an economy that is not directed or controlled by the state. Do you realize that? This is why I say that democracy is nice, expensive, and demands a lot of maturity. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Your reflections stress items that have affected many transition governments on their path from a dictatorial to a democratic system. [Wasmosy] I would not blame the system that much. It is very difficult for an obedient society to become an intelligent society. Our people are used to being directed. They are used to asking the boss what he thinks, and then just following him. We must force each individual to think on his own, to have his own opinion. But that will require time and maturity. Here is where I think we must be firm in staying on course and maintaining our objectives. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Is everything against you, then? [Wasmosy] Obviously. Media sources have not trained their people. Who exactly are most journalists? [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Perhaps you are confused about that. [Wasmosy] Very well. It is possible. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Do you know what I notice? It seems that you cannot govern, as was the case with Fujimori at one time. [Wasmosy] I tell you that I will do everything in my power to avoid dissolving Congress; I have confidence in people.... I am confident that they will mature. What happened to the Senate Investigative Commission on Illegal Activities? They put their foot in it so many times that they have lost all credibility. As for unions, their strikes have failed. Who else will believe in them? They have to justify the money they receive from abroad. We.... No other president has done what I did: sponsor a round table, a Social Development Council where everyone is heard. But they withdrew. Why? The peasants came and raised their problems: They were given a solution, which was welcomed "with applause." And they are satisfied. Transport workers called for a strike. We told them: Gentlemen, if you disagree, please bring another proposal to resolve the problem between transport enterprises and their employees. But they failed to show up at three consecutive sessions of the Council. Why? They wanted the strike. We arranged an agreement between employees and employers through the justice and labor ministry, but they once again reacted. Because what they wanted was to promote destabilization. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Going back to the subject of foreign models, you have already said that you would not like your government to look like "the Fujimori experience." [Wasmosy] Yet it should be noted that I respect his experience, because what Fujimori did was to strengthen democracy. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] If we consider other less traumatic models, if you consider the Argentine transition with Raul Alfonsin, and the Uruguayan transition with Julio Maria Sanguinetti, which one do you think was better? [Wasmosy] Sanguinetti, Sanguinetti! [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Can you explain your reasons? [Wasmosy] I want to tell you that in the case of Dr. Alfonsin, for example, there was a reaction against the Army. I wonder, had the Army failed to do what it did--and I am not supporting abuses, because I am neither a terrorist nor a dictator, no, no. I tell you, I have always seen the press reporting, for example: The Army has committed such and such an abuse. And the people who killed the police chief's daughters, who have blown up cars, who have killed people, are they all good-natured people? Somebody therefore had to come out the winner, and with civic courage the Argentine Army brought peace. Dr. Alfonsin then completed the other institutions. But if the military had not done what they did, Alfonsin would not have been able to do what he did, and Menem would not have been able to consolidate the economy as he did. They could do it because other people resolved the problems of the other areas of government. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Getting away from politics, the point is how to incorporate the informal economy into the transition system. [Wasmosy] The informal sector will be legalized only when inflation in Paraguay and in neighboring countries reaches more or less the same level, or similar levels. And when taxes on domestic consumption are also put more or less at the same level. What happens with cigarettes? Brazil produces cigarettes, imposing a 386 percent tax on them. But if Brazil exports them, I believe the tax is 0 percent. What is the result of this? When they export cigarettes to Paraguay, they send only the documents. Just imagine, in Paraguay we have a tax of only 26 percent. Cigarette exporters therefore put the Brazilian product in Ciudad del Este, Capitan Bado, Pedro Juan Caballero, everywhere. The Brazilians who come to see the Iguazu waterfalls pay 500 guaranies for cigarettes that cost 1,500 guaranies in Brazil. Do you know how many people enter Ciudad del Este per day? From Iguazu (Argentina) and Foz do Iguacu (Brazil), 200,000 people. If each one of them buys 10 packages.... I leave the calculations up to you.
