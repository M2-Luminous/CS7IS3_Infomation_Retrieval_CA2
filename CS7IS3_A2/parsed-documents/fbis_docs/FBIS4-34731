The two countries will begin studies for the construction of an energy-producing plant to supply a city of 3 million residents. The agreement is one of the key factors in President Carlos Menem's trip, and it includes the possible construction of a 400-megawatt Candu-type unit, which is larger than that of Atucha. The studies could be concluded by year's end, and the unit will be installed in the neighborhood of the Embalse Nuclear Center, in Cordoba Province, if an agreement is reached. The Canadians have guaranteed that they are in a position to build it in 42 months. There also will be innovations such as the use of partially enriched uranium to reduce contamination and increase the fuel's yield.
