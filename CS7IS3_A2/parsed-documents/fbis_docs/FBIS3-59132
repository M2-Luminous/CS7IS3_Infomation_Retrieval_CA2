"Today is a historic day because a grand project is taking shape," Segni claimed at a press conference. All potential candidates from various parties are welcome to run under a Pact ticket in coming elections, he said, as long as they accept the party's programs, which will be "along alternative lines to those of the left-wing caucus, and will indicate Mario Segni as candidate for prime minister." The Pact, Segni went on, is a "great alliance between secularists and Catholics, a liberal-democratic and reformist alliance that is a credible alternative to the caucus of the left," referring to potential alliances between the Left Democrat, Green, Network, Republican, Socialist and Communist Refoundation parties. He said candidates will be chosen by local committees among those who obtain at least 300 signatures in their favor. Segni claimed that the Christian Democrat Party, which will not use its name or symbol in first-past-the-post majority elections, will also join the Pact for Italy at the next elections. Some Christian Democrat members of parliament, along with some Liberal and Republican Party officials, flanked Segni at his press conference. Segni said the party's program will be announced on January 15, and the first national assembly will take place February 5. Among his various political comments, Segni reiterated his request that Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi make it clear once and for all that "he is not a candidate of the left." Segni again urged media mogul Silvio Berlusconi, who has announced plans to create his own conservative party, not to enter politics, because "his candidates would split up the liberal-democratic front." Christian Democrat Party Secretary Mino Martinazzoli reacted to Segni's claim that many Christian Democrats would join the Pact by saying that the so-called neo-centrists, who make up one of the minority wings, "seem to have taken their leave" of the party. Martinazzoli said: "When they behave like a party, with a program, an executive and their own strategy, holding talks with other political bodies, I acknowledge all this."
