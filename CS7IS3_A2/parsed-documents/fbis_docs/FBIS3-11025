The interview is conducted by Dorita de Reyna at the Telemetro Television studios in Panama City; the date is not given. Reyna begins by asking Carles what changes are endorsed by Change '94. In turn, Carles asks Quijano to answer, and Quijano replies: "Change '94 is a presidential ticket of men who are capable, dynamic, honest, and who have decided to give all of their administrative ability to creating employment and eradicating administrative corruption in Panama. This is what Change '94 stands for." Reyna then asks Carles why, if he was indeed a man of influence in President Guillermo Endara's administration, he failed to do more over the past four years to help achieve these goals. Carles replies that he was merely the comptroller general and, as such, he could only give his opinion, because he had no true decisionmaking power. He says: "I was only the comptroller. I was not a minister or a president. But now, when you make me president, then I can be held accountable." Reyna then asks Carles how he would rule without a majority in the Legislative Assembly. Carles replies: "The draft bills we intend to present will be so necessary and desirable that they will be approved, and my administration will be so exemplary that it will enjoy the cooperation of all legislators, because everyone will feel compelled to participate in such a good administration." When Reyna notes that Carles is known for his unyielding positions and poor negotiating ability, Quijano intercedes and says he believes the new administration will create an atmosphere of teamwork, adding that the vice presidents will play an important role on the team. Reyna asks Herrera what tasks appeal to him considering that vice presidents do not have specific roles. Herrera replies: "Allow me to say that the vice presidents will assist the president," adding that the vice presidents "will do whatever the president entrusts us to do." Reyna asks Herrera how poverty can be reduced in a country where 50 percent of the population is considered poor and which still has an enormous foreign debt. Herrera replies: "For the time being I am not concerned... [pauses] It is not that the foreign debt does not concern me. It is true that this problem will affect several generations. The foreign debt cannot be repaid during one government term; this would be impossible. I must say that to resolve the unemployment problem we need to protect current job sources, both in the city and in the countryside, mainly to avoid a migration from the countryside into the cities." Reyna asks about the ticket's plans to create jobs, to which Quijano replies that there are several programs and not enough time in the program to explain them. Nevertheless, he says one of the programs involves housing, adding that this program includes plans for the construction of 115,000 homes -- homes he dubs "housing solutions" -- which will in turn create 25,000 new jobs over a five-year period. Quijano is interrupted by Reyna after he starts to explain plans for a reforestation program. Reyna asks whether the housing to be constructed by Change '94 will be for the poor, and Quijano replies: "The housing will be only and exclusively for the general population," and he adds that even the unemployed can participate through the "New Life" program, which makes "every family member jointly responsible for the debt." He adds: "Even people who have no regular income can either receive a home improvement loan or a small house to start a new life with hope and optimism for the future. This is our philosophical concept." Herrera adds: "Of course, there are other programs, such as incentives for private investment programs. Jobs can only be created through private investment incentives." Reyna then broaches the problem of law and order, and she asks how Panama can be attractive to investors if the country has so many security problems. Herrera replies: "You are referring to a public service issue. Let me tell you that all public services have to be improved. If public services do not work -- and this includes electricity, water, security, transportation, streets, and so on -- the country cannot be attractive to investors. The idea is to make public administration efficient, and when we speak of making it efficient, we are also speaking of efficient public services that will enable businesses to rest assured that they will have dependable and inexpensive public services. All of this is part of an environment that attracts private entrepreneurs. In addition, we will have an honest government, and there will be complete honesty in administering public funds. Those investors who come to the country to invest will know that no one will demand a bribe or a hidden commission, because there is a presidential commitment to avoid such things." Reyna quizzes Carles on alleged cases of looking the other way when other people in the government have not been entirely honest. Carles says that in all cases that come to his attention, the people involved were dismissed and that many of these cases are still pending in the Attorney General's Office. Reyna then switches to the topic of U.S. bases and asks Carles about his public stand on the appropriateness of renegotiating the status of U.S. bases in Panama and whether it would not be more profitable for Panama to properly use these reverted areas. Carles replies: "Well, this is a matter of priorities. We have already had a great number of properties returned and to the present we have not used them. In a few years, we will be receiving a great deal more. We cannot receive them all, simultaneously, without using them. We need to establish with some sort of priority what areas we should dedicate to certain uses and what areas we can allow to continue to be used as they are being used now while we have other options. It is a question of prioritizing time." Reyna then asks Quijano to explain how their government plan deals with this question. Quijano replies: "Our priority is jobs. Right now, we cannot let 14,000 or 15,000 families lose their jobs with the closure of U.S. bases in Panama. We have enough reverted areas to start modernizing the economy through a maritime center in these reverted areas. The question of modifying the U.S. bases lease can then be dealt with slowly but surely by future administrations. Right now, however, we need to protect the thousands of Panamanians who today earn their living honestly in the bases in Panama." Reyna switches the subject to privatization. She asks Carles if privatization is part of the Change '94 plans and he replies that not everything should be privatized. When she asks what should, Carles replied: "We must privatize the railroad, and I will tell you something else. Panama still does not have cellular telephones. This is something that needs to be privatized." Reyna interjects and asks whether this means privatizing INTEL, National Institute of Telecommunications, or the cellular telephone service. Carles replies: "The cellular telephone service." Reyna reminds Carles that all along he has favored privatizing INTEL. Carles replies: "There are other INTEL services that could be privatized. We should not be afraid to privatize; we must look for good areas that can be privatized. Before I forget, I want to quickly tell you about the debt. As Comptroller General, I never had anything to do with the handling of the public debt. This was the responsibility of others. Regarding the commercial bank debt, I have never favored the Panamanian Government hastily beginning negotiations with commercial banks. I have always said it. It is very clear in the minutes I took, where I say that we need to negotiate the best option among the various alternatives that do not interfere with the work of the state and do not affect public services, especially those of a social nature. We must grow first and pay the debt after. Let it be very clear, there are others who are in a hurry to pay the debt. I have said this must go to the end of the line." Herrera stresses the need to remember who created the debt in the first place and proceeds to quote figures of what it was in 1968, when the military coup took place, and of the situation on 20 December 1989, the date of the invasion and end of the dictatorship. Quijano stresses Molirena's support for Carles and denies a suggestive question by Reyna that a certain amount of coercion was needed before Molirena agreed to support Carles instead of Guillermo Ford. Reyna asks Carles whether he would be willing to govern by consensus, including parties that may have opposed him. Carles replies: "I have not made any pacts with anyone and I have not assigned political opportunities to anyone. I am going to choose the people who can best serve the country."
