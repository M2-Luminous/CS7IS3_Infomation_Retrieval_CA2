The centrally managed industry recorded an increase of nearly 13 percent, and the local industry nearly 10 percent. The main reason for the sizeable increase in industrial output in the last few months is that more and more business establishments of all economic sectors now are adjusting themselves better to the new economic management structure, thus helping their production activities to settle and develop quickly. The sectors that achieved a healthy development rate are: the electricity sector with an increase rate of 9 percent, coal production with an increase rate of 7 percent, crude oil with 17 percent, and cement with 12 percent.
