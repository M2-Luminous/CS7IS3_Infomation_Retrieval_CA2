The Stuttgart telecommunications equipment manufacturer Alcatel SEL, a subsidiary of Alcatel, recorded a drop in turnover of 11 percent, from 6.3 billion German marks [DM] to DM5.6 billion, in fiscal year 1993. In addition to the general weakness of the economy, the company sees the continuous drop in prices as one of the reasons for the loss. The people in Stuttgart want to form two new companies and close down a production unit to lower costs and increase efficiency. In the words of chairman of the board, Gerhard Zeidler, the overall economic situation is also reflected in the number of Alcatel SEL of order entries. In comparison with the previous year, with a volume of DM5 billion, the people in Stuttgart received 20 percent fewer orders and had an order volume of DM4.8 billion at the end of 1993. The German part of the company managed to earn a surplus of DM107.2 million in 1993, while only the year before it made a profit of DM160.1 million. According to Zeidler, this deficit is essentially attributable to the negative effects of volume and prices. Despite the general drop in turnover of 10 percent among suppliers of communications hardware, at Alcatel they do not want to get into the booming operator market, since a confrontational course with current customers is to be avoided. However, Alcatel will also further participate in the operation of the networks, as in Kazakhstan, if the carriers so desire. To be sure, Zeidler does not expect his company to grow again in 1994, but he does hope to keep it at its 1993 level. As for the future, the chairman of the board wants to develop new lines of business, such as interactive television, corporate networks, and traffic management. To lower costs and increase efficiency, Zeidler plans to concentrate telephone exchange and broadcasting technology at the plants in Gunzenhausen, Arnstadt, and Rochlitz and to close down the production unit in Stuttgart. The state capital, the chairman of the board said, "will continue to be the biggest plant, but with a new commercial focus." In Zeidler's words, "software and services should have a future" in the Swabian metropolis. Furthermore, the company management plans to set up two companies. The mobile communications product department is supposed to be converted into a company by as early as 1 July 1994. The detachment of the company's office communications department is scheduled for 1 January 1995. Zeidler has high hopes that these measures will concentrate authorizations to make decisions and produce better cooperation in the international Alcatel combine. As a consequence of the reorganization and the concentration of production, the company wants to eliminate another 1,500 jobs by the end of 1995. About 600 jobs will be affected by the cuts at the Stuttgart plant, which at present provides about 900 jobs.
