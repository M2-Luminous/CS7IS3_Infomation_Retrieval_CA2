The remarks were made after the REUTER correspondent in Beirut quoted a senior pro-Iranian source as saying that there are secret talks over Ron Arad and that a breakthrough is expected soon. The source added: We will receive something in return. He refused to say who is involved in the negotiations and where they are taking place, but other sources told REUTER that it can be assumed that Hizballah, Iran, Syria, and perhaps also the United States, are participating in the talks.
