That was the message released by the government yesterday. The CVP [Flemish Christian People's Party], which is again going to request the prime ministership, wants clear agreements to be reached in advance on the government duties for the next period. They also want to know more about the demands of [PS] Jose Happart. Although still at the stage of very informal discussions, politicians in Brussels have already formed a clear idea of the likely scenario surrounding the appointment of Jean-Luc Dehaene as EC president, assuming that this goes ahead of course. After next Wednesday's [22 June] summit of the EPP [European People's Party], the organization of European Christian Democratic parties, where German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will announce to the Benelux countries who he would like to see take over from Jacques Delors, EPP president Wilfried Martens would probably state that a consensus has been reached and Jean-Luc Dehaene would for the first time announce that he is indeed a candidate. The European summit on the Greek island of Corfu, on 24 and 25 June, would then appoint the candidate of the European Christian Democrats. The ideal scenario would then be for Dehaene to remain prime minister until 1 August or 1 September, to pave the way for his successor. He will probably have to reshuffle his government even earlier, as Pensions Minister Freddy Willockx is to be sworn in as a member of the European Parliament (EP) on 19 July and should therefore be replaced by Friday 15 July. In addition to the replacement of Willockx and Dehaene, a third element is also involved, namely a political compensation for the SP [Flemish Socialist Party] for the loss of European Commissioner Karel Van Miert, it is only logical to reshuffle the cabinet in one single operation. CVP Van Rompuy In the meantime the CVP [Flemish Liberal Democrat] is demanding in increasingly clear terms the right to appoint the Dehaene's successor. According to Johan Van Hecke, "it must be a Christian Democrat," which must be understood as: Melchior Wathelet (French-speaking Social Christian Party) can only become prime minister if the CVP does not itself find a solution. Anything else would be unacceptable to the CVP, now that since Sunday the party is once again easily the largest in the country. The candidate who immediately comes to mind is deputy Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy, who has supported Dehaene through thick and thin in the past five years. But Van Rompuy would not want to jeopardize his chances of leading the next, possibly Christian-Democrat-Liberal coalition, by going for an uncertain prime ministership now. He would only agree to take over from Dehaene if the government could set a clear course for the rest of its term and if the coalition partners are prepared to continue until the end of 1995. Arguments to this effect have been heard in recent days by CVP president Van Hecke and Minister Leo Delcroix. They want to see a reassessment of the government program. Then there are the dangers posed by Jose Happart and a series of matters on the government's agenda for the coming weeks that are likely to cause problems with the socialist coalition partner: the reform of pension laws, financial responsibility for the health service, and the 1995 budget. Government To Resign? In short, prior to the government reshuffle, the CVP wants to talk with the PS on its future plans for the government. One message can already be heard: The CVP will not give in to PS claims. It is unlikely that any of this can be discussed before the end of next week, and thus the Corfu summit. The question after that is whether Dehaene, when appointed EC president, will still have the authority to guide the government through the awaiting pitfalls. And whether he still has to take such risks. This is why it is not totally out of the question that the prime minister might announce shortly after Corfu that his government is resigning, leaving the King to do his constitutional work and to charge an official with assessing the possibilities of forming a Christian-Democrat-Socialist government. At the moment this seems a more likely scenario than the ideal one of the retiring prime minister who, before leaving office, carefully prepares the ground for his successor. The chances of Dehaene being prime minister when the Belgian "Red Devils" football team takes the field in the World Cup after 1 July are thus very slim.
