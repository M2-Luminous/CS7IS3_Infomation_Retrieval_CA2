There is a lot of distortion and sometimes open politicking in it. Therefore, we asked for a commentary on this topic by a suitable and competent person--Volodymyr Shcherbyna, chief of Object Shelter's radiation security department. [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Volodymyr Grigorovych, passions around Chernobyl do not subside. It is important, however, to discuss without emotion the greatest technological catastrophe in the history of humanity. Therefore, a question arises: Which criteria for appraising Chernobyl's grave problems do you consider most objective? [Shcherbyna] In my opinion, it is protection from radiation--the science that provides the ability to optimally calculate the scientific-technical, techno-economical, medical-biological, and sociopsychological aspects of current and future Chernobyl problems. Note this: In the decree "On Some Measures for Providing the Economy With Electric Power" the previous parliament apparently is not revoking its decision, just agreeing with the Cabinet of Ministers proposal to continue ChAES exploitation, but only under the supervision of the Derzhatomnaglyad [State Oversight Committee for Nuclear and Radiation Safety], Minpriroda [Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources], and the Academy of Sciences. In my opinion, this is a way to shirk personal responsibility, as old as the world--when there are so many oversight organizations, you never find who is directly responsible. The decision to continue the station's exploitation does not remove in any way from the agenda the grave questions that were pertinent at the time it was taken off line. I will enumerate only some of them. First, the level of ChAES safety is substantially lower than what is required by international and national standards, or the radiation environment requirements that have developed in Ukraine as a result of the Chernobyl catastrophe, and because of both the design and the technological capabilities of the power generators, and because an almost complete absence of nuclear power generation infrastructure in Ukraine cannot be improved in any substantial way. Second, the radiation-ecological and psychological blows Ukraine sustained from both the Chernobyl catastrophe and its consequences have caused a strong nonacceptance of continuation of ChAES exploitation among a great majority of the Ukrainian population. Third, the international public opinion of many countries, especially those that have been seriously affected by the Chernobyl catastrophe, cannot understand why they have to put up with continuing exploitation of ChAES, which already has inflicted such damage on the humanity and ecology of Earth. And fourth, the state of Ukrainian economy at the time of adopting this decision include sources of energy that make it possible, essentially without significant expenditures, to take out of exploitation ChAES power generators. The decision to activate ChAES has not changed an iota any of these points. [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] As far as we remember, the writer, who was the head of the parliamentary commission on the questions of Chernobyl catastrophe at the time of the hearings asked directly: What about competent guarantees of AES' safe exploitation? [Shcherbyna] I remember--and think about what he was told: Since, according to Derzhatomnaglyad, all Ukrainian nuclear power stations meet neither international nor national safety standards, discussing this issue with respect to ChAES is meaningless. And we should mention that from the standpoint of departmental sense the answer is irreproachable. Except that the person who brought up this question was interested not in the problem of how logical this information looked to Derzhatomnaglyad, but the problem of the future of the Ukrainian people and environment. [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] So what is actually the real level of ChAES safety? [Shcherbyna] First, remember for starters that it is different from other stations equipped with RBMK's [high-power pressurized tube reactors]. The ChAES is an indissoluble "No. 3 generator" complex--the nuclear-unsafe and radiation-unsafe Object Shelter, which technically is in a condemned condition. That is, what is called the Chernobyl Nuclear-Unsafe Complex (ChYaNK). Next: the equipment and engineering structures, which as a consequence of the 1986 tragedy have suffered to a greater or lesser extent from the overload not foreseen by the design. The station represents "harder" conditions for the work of all enterprise services, as well as the staff as a whole. And one more special feature: arranging the main location of service personnel at a considerable distance (50 km) from the station, beyond the boundary of ChAES radiation effect. According to the main normative document currently in effect--OPB-88, the nuclear station's safety is ensured by implementing the principle of depth-distributed protection. This principle consists of 13 components. With respect to ChAES, of these 13 components only one-quarter have been carried out, while three-quarters have not been put in place either at all or in part. This normative document also establishes an integrated indicator of nuclear station safety. It is expressed by the value of the maximum emergency discharges of radioactive material surrounding the core. This value is set at the level of one event per year per 10 million operating power generating units of AES. For the ChAES this indicator is 10,000 times higher. [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] However, the top officials of Derzhkomatom [State Committee on Atomic Energy] and the ChAES maintain that the target level of safety has been achieved. [Shcherbyna] This is not quite correct. Let us look at the significance and substantiation of these arguments. The main technical measures that are being taken in order to avoid the repetition of the 1986 accident were predicated on precluding the introduction of positive reactivity. At the same time, the chief designer organization of the RBMK-1000 in its "Generalized Analysis of the Accident at the ChAES No. 4 Generator. Report 13.168" produced this conclusion: "Having considered the formulated requirements for modeling all known information received in the NDKIET [expansion not identified], IAE [Atomic Energy Institute], VNDIAES [All-Ukraine Institute for Nuclear Power Stations Research], and the IYaD AN URSR [Nuclear Research Institute of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences] from the results of various three-dimensional programs, one may ascertain that for the simulated re-creation of the accidental reactor runaway the surge of positive reactivity alone in the A3-5 combination is not sufficient and requires development of different hypotheses." Most foreign specialists support this viewpoint. Although since the initial facts of the 1986 accident have not been determined, we cannot maintain with certainty that the 1986 accident will not be repeated. And even less so can we maintain this about accidents of a different kind that have similar or greater radiation consequences. This conclusion is convincingly supported by many specialists both in our country and abroad, including in numerous papers presented at the symposium on the problems of ChAES held in Kiev in May 1993. One of the most interesting presentations at that symposium (delivered by a representative of the Austrian green movement) showed, in more technical depth and with more argumentation than in the presentations of the top officials of Derzhkomatom and ChAES, that the level of safety of the ChAES does not correspond to any measurements of the international community. I want to repeat: From the standpoint of ensuring safety, the parliament decision to continue exploitation of ChAES legitimized the transformation of ChAES into the Chernobyl Nuclear-Unsafe Station (ChYaNS), the central link of which is the Chernobyl nuclear-unsafe complex Object Shelter--No. 3 generator. Behind this move of ChAES into a ChYaNS category is not just the change of initials; behind it is the demonstration of the Derzhkomatom's will and its stubborn conviction that there are things that are more important than a repetition of an accident of Chernobyl proportions in Ukraine. [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Thus, are you against development of nuclear power generation? [Shcherbyna] Not at all. I believe that humanity can go ahead with the development of nuclear power generation but only to the extent to which it is possible to ensure that its benefits outweigh the harm. And that the relationship "benefit--harm" in the nuclear power generation should be seen not only from the viewpoint of... interests, but after evaluation of short-term and long-terms prospects. These problems face both humanity as a whole and each country separately. Unfortunately, methodological tools developed by world science for calculation of "benefit--harm" ratio in nuclear power generation cannot yet provide answers to all questions arising in this sphere. Much in this we still have to work out by the method of trial and error, including the road of "public choice" with respect to the level of risk in nuclear power generation. It so happens that in Ukraine many nuclear professionals are convinced that because of the complexity and, most importantly, uncertainty of the methods of evaluation of "benefit--harm" ratio in nuclear power generation, it is not advisable to bring into this issue the general public and even less so to provide it with that part of information with respect to which they themselves have great doubts. And if circumstances force us to speak on this topic, we should do it in such a way that society would "understand us correctly." The Chernobyl catastrophe has graphically demonstrated all the harm of "measured truth" on ChAES safety. It is good that some of us are opening our eyes. And there are more people like this day by day... [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Your eyes have opened; however, you are a specialist... What do we do about many of our public movements, which reject from the outset nuclear power generation, equating all of it with Chernobyl? [Shcherbyna] We need to tell the truth. And the most acute issues are these: 1. What is the total damage the Chernobyl catastrophe has produced and continues to produce? 2. With the help of what measures and at what cost can the damage caused by the Chernobyl catastrophe for Ukraine be liquidated or at least neutralized to an "acceptable level?" 3. What is the probability of an accident on the scale of Chernobyl-1986 repeating itself at the ChAES and where will it put Ukraine this time? And nobody should have any doubt that until the public gets the answer to these questions, it will "by all means available to it" resist continuation of exploitation of the ChAES. Until then, the ChAES is practically the only nuclear station in the world that has realized in practice even those negative sides of nuclear power generations that remain a "possibility" for the rest of AES. Let us look for example in what minimum acceptable form an answer may be provided to the first question. We need to first of all evaluate these factors: What is the degree of harm the Chernobyl catastrophe has produced for the health of the future generations of Ukrainian citizens; what part of the radio-ecological tolerance of the Ukrainian environment has been used up by the Chernobyl catastrophe; and what damage has the Chernobyl catastrophe of 1986 done to the health of the current generation? And the more we delay obtaining scientifically substantiated answers to these questions, the more conservative our society becomes in the appraisal of the consequences of Chernobyl catastrophe and nuclear power generation as a whole. In these conditions any consideration of the problem of continuing exploitation of ChAES without at the same time discussing these questions produces an outcry about "disrespect for public opinion." Whether we discuss the problem openly or sweep it under the rug, people see with their own eyes the increase in the number of children who got sick as a result of the Chernobyl catastrophe, the increase in the number of sick and disabled as a result of the work on the liquidation of the consequences of the Chernobyl accident and the work on continuing exploitation of ChAES. They see the devastation and destruction of a part of their land, the international isolation of Ukraine as a result of its insistent refusal to hold back exploitation of ChAES, and many other things. Moreover, the "service record of ChAES accident-proneness" is such that it forces one to re-doubt suspicions regarding everything that is connected one way or the other with the Chernobyl nuclear power station. Really, let us read and think about it: 1983--radiation accident. 1986--radiation catastrophe. 1988--"disintegration" of the power generation system. 1990--critical accident at the Object Shelter. 1991--fire at No. 3 generator. 1993--fire at the Object Shelter. 1993--disappearance of nuclear fuel... [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] But we were told all the time that we would freeze without ChAES. [Shcherbyna] All right, let us talk about power generation with figures in hand. Compare at least two of them. ChAES accounts for 4 to 6 percent of total electric power output in Ukraine. According to the Ministry of Energy's own data, there is no demand for 33 percent of all power generation capability in Ukraine today. Add to this the 30-percent reserve of power generation capability. If we put on line only half of them, buying organic fuel for this purpose for an amount equivalent to $600 million worth a year, we will produce $1.5 billion worth of electric power by "Derzhkomatom estimates." By that we not only compensate for the cost associated with taking ChAES off line, but even make a substantial profit in the dollar equivalent. [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Still, let us say that the Cabinet of Ministers had serious reasons for believing that without ChAES it will not fulfill its obligation to the country. And for this reason it asked parliament to permit continuing exploitation of the station. But what does it mean: "to continue exploitation of ChAES for the period warranted by its technical condition"? [Shcherbyna] Formally it means that we cannot "adhere to the rated capacity" of nuclear power stations whose technical conditions do not meet normative requirements. However, as the Derzhatomnaglyad reported, ChAES did not meet established norms before, or ever for that matter. This inconsistency may be resolved in only one way--by assuming that parliament's decision applies not to the entire technical condition of the station but only such, one would assume, "most critical parameters." In this case the decision should have said who is to set these "most critical parameters" for ChAES. The station itself, as a self-operating organization, or a higher body, and as Derzhkomatom, Derzhatomnaglyad, or some other? It would be most logical to admit that this can be done by the Cabinet of Minister, since it was this body that asked parliament to continue work on capacity of ChAES. Next. What does this mean: "ChAES exploitation is conducted under the oversight of Derzhatomnaglyad, Minpriroda, and the Academy of Sciences." A new institute is being set up--the institute for watching over ChAES exploitation. But what does it mean? What is its status? What are its responsibilities? But the main point is still something else. The main point is: Why do we need to make this an observer institute? Both Derzhatomnaglyad and Minpriroda have extensive oversight functions with respect to ChAES, as well as any other AES in Ukraine. Moving these organizations from the category of oversight bodies into the category of observers at first glance does not make any sense for the Cabinet of Ministers, because it considerably cuts their rights regarding ChAES, as well as their responsibility for ChAES safety. Really, what does this decree make Derzhatomnaglyad with respect to ChAES? Essentially, into a "State Committee for Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety of ChAES." The same applies to Minpriroda. Perhaps, it stems from our long-standing habit that collective responsibility (the synonym for the lack of individual responsibility) begins where there are no less than three participants, which explains adding the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. The Ukrainian Academy of Sciences is not set either by its substance or its structure to carry out the tasks of departmental science. Hence, its inclusion in the ChAES problem in the role of "observer" over the safe exploitation of the stations means only one thing: The Academy of Sciences' task is to warn in good time all other organizations interested in this problem that from such and such point in time the technical base of ChAES precludes the ability to be safely exploited and therefore the station needs to be closed. Perhaps for the first time in the history of all science organizations and institutions in the world the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences is tasked with overseeing the safety of an individual enterprise with about 7,000 employees. This is an unprecedented instance in the history of world science. [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Perhaps the authority of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences simply will deflect harsh criticism currently aimed at Derzhkomatom? [Shcherbyna] Well, the Derzhkomatom needs not only help, but complete and unconditional help in this issue, which is, generally speaking, secondary for the Ukrainian nuclear power generation as a whole. This is something to think about for everyone: parliament members, voters, and officials in the executive power structures. Our country's nuclear power generation sector is at the earliest stage of its independent development. And therefore all serious decisions set a precedent. Also, as we know from history, it is easier to make a precedent a practice than to root it out of practice. Hence, essentially this decision is equivalent to an admission that in Ukraine there are matters more important than the ensuring nonrepetition of the Chernobyl catastrophe... [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Will not, perhaps, our descendants find such "conclusions" criminal? [Shcherbyna] I hope we ourselves will not come to the point seeing it that way.
