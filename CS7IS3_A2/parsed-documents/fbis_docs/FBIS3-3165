This was recently announced by Lin Kun, a department director of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, who is responsible for foreign investment in China. Reportedly in order to more rapidly boost the construction of transport facilities in all fields, China will adopt various forms to encourage and attract foreign investment. China will open its aviation market to foreign investors, and this is one of the major actions to be taken. In fact, China's transport industry, especially the air transport industry, is far from being able to meet the needs of its economic development. Such problems as insufficient transport capacity, backward technology, poor management, a lack of competent personnel, and the low safety coefficient have become increasingly serious and have caused serious concern among people at home and abroad. People in this industry pointed out that if China's air transport industry is opened up to the world and introduces advanced world equipment, management methods, and technology, this will play a certain role in resolving the above-mentioned problems and will help change the current backward condition of the air transport industry and promote its healthy development. Foreign investors have strong interest in the Chinese mainland's huge air transport market, which has great development potential. Aircraft maintenance and repair is a major field of such investment. At present, China Southern Airline, Rockefeller International Airplane Service Corporation of the United States, and Hutchison Whampoa (China) of Hong Kong have set up a joint venture in Guangzhou to offer aircraft repair services. In addition, Hong Kong Air Terminal Service Ltd. and Xiaman International Economic and Technological Cooperation Corporation have also signed an agreement to set up an aircraft maintenance joint venture in Xiamen. Other Hong Kong companies participating in the joint venture include the New World Group, Kumagai (Hong Kong) Ltd., the Fok family, and Macao's Hainan Tongao Economic Development and Investment Ltd. Regulations on the operation of travel agents for border-crossing air tickets were formulated before Director Lin Kun announced the opening of China's aviation market. Travel agents allowed to sell air tickets into China should have at least 500,000 yuan of registered capital; and those being allowed to sell air tickets out of China should have at least 1.5 million yuan of capital. They must have registered offices inside China, and their personnel should have work experience in the field of air transportation. After their applications are approved, their business licenses will be valid for three years.
