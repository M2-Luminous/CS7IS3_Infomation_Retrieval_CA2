Apparently, these are incidents between part of the population and gangs of attackers. The situation is not alarming, according to the UN representative in Bujumbura. This is also confirmed by the interim head of state, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya. [Begin recording] [Ntibantunganya] There is absolutely no reason why we should make this situation out to be more tragic than it is. In any case, all those here in Bujumbura can testify to this situation. It is a situation we are trying to bring under control for good. In that respect, I have announced some measures which we will take to bring under control [words indistinct] of violence which can still be found in Bujumbura. [Correspondent Assane Diop] What are these measures, Mr. President? [Ntibantunganya] First of all, we intend to establish a functional and efficient administration, a bold administration which agrees to collaborate -- and has the means to do so -- with all the forces on the ground, police forces, the judiciary, and the political parties. We are doing all this in order to involve everyone in solving all the problems that could prevent the total restoration of peace and security in the country. [end recording]
