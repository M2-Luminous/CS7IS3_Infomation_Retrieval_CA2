The government plans to send 16 grade-five, working-level officials to a three-week group training course for public servants offered by the Chinese personnel ministry from June 28 to July 19. The exchange is based on an agreement to expand personnel cooperation signed by Seoul and Beijing last March. China will also send about 15 public servants to South Korea in early September to attend the central officials training institute here, a Ministry official said. The exchange of public officials is designed to promote friendly and cooperative relations between the two nations' civil servants by widening their knowledge of the other country's reform policy.
