Bechelov, by I. Mezova: "Ilyas Bechelov: I See in Today's Parliament Elements of Reforming the Representative Authority"] [Text] Ilyas Bechelov is a colonel in the internal service, former chief of the Corrective Affairs and Social Rehabilitation Service, and chairman of the Legislative Commission of the former KBR [Kabardino-Balkaria Republic] VS [Supreme Soviet]. He is a graduate of the School of Physics and Mathematics, KBGU [Kabardino-Balkaria State University] and the USSR MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Academy. At the December election he once again became a deputy to the Council of the Republic of the KBR Parliament and once again headed the same commission -- the Commission on Legislation, Law and Order, Security, and Human Rights. He is married, and has a son and two daughters. [Mezova] Ilyas Borisovich, why, after serving twenty years in the MVD system, did you decide to run for election, first to the Supreme Soviet, and then to the KBR Parliament? [Bechelov] For me it was a complete surprise when, in 1991, people from my home town in Kamenka came to me and suggested that they nominate me as a candidate for election to the Supreme Soviet. I must confess that many people advised me not to run, saying that an MVD worker would not be elected, especially since there were more popular candidates, including farm managers. Nevertheless I agreed and, to my surprise, I won. It may be that something that played a role was the fact that I had grown up in Kamenka and had gone to school there. I have a lot of friends in the district: Balkarians, Karbadinians, Russians... [Mezova] In December of last year you decided to run for election again. Does that mean that you didn't really like the work of making laws? [Bechelov] At first I did not want to run again, and I even took a job at the Tsentrizbirkom [Central Electoral Commission]. In general, I was planning to return to the MVD. After all, it is specific work that I was accustomed to. Once again the voters began arriving. My current electoral district is big, and is absorbing a large number of populated places: Bulungu, Khushto-Syrt, Nizhniy Chegem, Yanikoy, Lechinka, Kamenka... I was nominated by the collective at the Sovkhoz imeni Baysultanov, and the voters -- and I am tremendously grateful to them for this --supported me again. [Mezova] But certainly it must not have been such a simple thing, after the MVD, to engage -- and successfully -- in the work of creating legislation. [Bechelov] Definitely... There is a big difference in the nature of the work. At first I was greatly tormented by all that paperwork. I was not accustomed to that kind of monotonous, painstaking work. However, I adjusted to it gradually and have even learned to enjoy it. [Mezova] But how do you sense the difference in the activities of the former Supreme Soviet and the present Council of the Republic, which is operating on a professional basis? [Bechelov] Here too there is a substantial difference. The work at the Council of the Republic is proceeding, in my opinion, in a time-responsive and efficient manner. We literally "chewed up" our Provisional Rules, for example, since we worked so carefully on them. We passed them in two readings. Of course, the working commission responsible for developing and modifying that vast document also worked scrupulously. The document is ready for publication. On the insistence of Yuriy Mairov, Chairman of the KBR Constitutional Court, we thoroughly wrote out the procedure for reviewing the budget and included it in the Rules. [Mezova] Was the budget under joint jurisdiction from the very beginning? [Bechelov] Yes. Its initial review was our responsibility. [Mezova] Is there a difference between the initial and secondary discussions? [Bechelov] The difference is contained in the names themselves. We are the first to review the document. The Representatives' Council accepts our recommendations and comments and, after discussion, submits the document for joint review. [Mezova] Are you satisfied with the powers that have been assigned to the Council of the Republic? [Bechelov] The question of powers was resolved in a constitutional and, in my opinion, completely satisfactory manner. We shared with the Representatives' Council the question of confidence or lack of confidence in the government, and the Representatives' Council, in its turn, shared with us the question of reviewing the budget. It is completely logical that such important questions have to be reviewed jointly. I also consider it to be correct that a large number of other questions are also under joint jurisdiction. In that way they will be developed more efficiently. It would scarcely seem to be desirable to transfer just to the Council of the Republic all the questions that the Supreme Soviet used to engage in. [Mezova] What other differences do you think exist between the present Parliament and the former KBR VS? [Bechelov] Primarily there has been a change in the functions and the structure. There is no Presidium, that narrow group of people that used to decide many very important questions, including those dealing with personnel. In order to resolve specifically the joint questions and to define the agenda of the joint sessions, the Coordination Council was created. In today's Parliament I see, to a certain extent, elements of reforming the representative authority. [Mezova] Could we dwell more concretely on those elements? [Bechelov] First of all, there is the two-house system, the beginning of the formation of a professional parliament, albeit by way of one house. Today the Parliament will resolve questions of an interethnic nature through a committee that was specially created for that purpose; the procedure for reviewing and making decisions dealing with those questions has already been firmly established in the Constitution. [Mezova] What can you say about the makeup of the Council of the Republic? [Bechelov] It seems to me that, on the whole, the deputies to that house are rather competent and are capable resolving any questions. They have a sufficient amount both of professional and everyday experience, and the necessary logic for thinking things out. I do not see in our house any people who are extremist in their views, but all of them are rather independent. There are many young people, and I like to work with them: they are restrained and knowledgeable people. The makeup of the house is rather varied. Many people have left their jobs and have taken up the professional work of creating legislation. I am convinced that, in a year, the Council of the Republic will be asserting itself in a loud voice. [Mezova] Do you foresee the formation of factions and blocs in the Council of the Republic? [Bechelov] Most of the deputies, it seems to me, adhere to centrist views. Possible blocs based on nationality are absorbed by the Committee on Interethnic Relations. [Mezova] What will your commission, which is one of the leading ones in the house, engage in? [Bechelov] There is no need to offend the other commissions, each of which is the base commission in its field for the creation of legislation. Naturally, we shall create laws, conduct parliamentary hearings and audits, take active part in developing RF [Russian Federation] legislative acts, and give our findings on drafts that are prepared by other commissions. [Mezova] Am I correct in thinking that your commission needs professionals more than any other one does? [Bechelov] The makeup of the commission is rather good, and professionally trained. In addition to me there are Khazan Shorov, a jurist and militia lieutenant-colonel; Zamir Shibzukhov, investigator from the Urvanskiy procurator's office; Khazanbi Shogenov, criminal-affairs procurator from the KBR procurator's office; Vitaliy Protasov, retired colonel; and Robert Zhurtov, economist, correspondence-course student at the KBGU Law School. [Mezova] At the beginning of our conversation you mentioned in passing what a few people have been asserting: that an MVD worker would not be elected. But in the present Parliament MVD workers have occupied what I think is a rather solid position. Do you think that this attests to the fact that the population's attitude toward your associates is changing? [Bechelov] Yes, there are six of us in the makeup of the present Parliament. I must say that Khusey Eneyev, Yuriy Kokov, Khasan Shorov, Boris Kerefov, and Adalbi Shkhagoshev are not only real professionals, but are also people whose reputations are completely unsullied. Yes, I am convinced that people's idea of the MVD is changing. Also, it is obvious that the crime problem that is engulfing us must be resolved. And, finally, this fact attests to people's confidence and high evaluation, and this must be perceived as an advance. [Mezova] Are you satisfied with the house's Provisional Rules? [Bechelov] In my opinion, there have been definite achievements. The most important questions will be decided by secret voting. The house's work is carried out in three state languages. A question that has caused long disputes is the question of keeping an account of the work performed by the deputy. A new section on parliamentary hearings provides considerable rights to the commissions for reviewing various important questions. For the first time the Provisional Rules deal with the procedure for holding sessions, and define the spring and autumn sessions and the summer and winter parliamentary vacations. [Mezova] Almost two vacations? Isn't that too lavish? [Bechelov] That is how it is done throughout the civilized world. And the same thing is stated in the Russian rules. The work days have been defined: Monday and Tuesday in the permanent commissions; Wednesday and Thursday, house sessions; and on Friday the deputies work in the districts. We have also planned that on Thursdays, for one hour,nd that the members of the government will reply to the deputies' oral or written questions. [Mezova] Do you think that, in the new Parliament, the status of deputy has risen, or has fallen? [Bechelov] I think that it has risen. First of all, a professional house has appeared. That is on the whole. This is attested to by the procedure for reviewing questions at the sessions, and by the parliamentary hearings... [Mezova] What are the tasks that are confronting the house in the near future? [Bechelov] Our commission has defined a working group to develop drafts about local self-government. Other groups have been created: a group to prepare the publication of the KBR Constitution (Basic Law) with a consideration of the amendments and additions that have been made; and a group to develop the Rules for the joint sessions of the two houses. Things are also proceeding in the same way in the other commissions. In general, the ice has been broken, and our speaker was right when he said in an interview that the house has taken the direct line in creating legislation. [Mezova] Is there anything that you would like to convey to your constituents and the readers of our newspaper? [Bechelov] Almost all the deputies, in their pre-election statements, mentioned the need to preserve peace and stability in the republic. I would hope that everyone will remember that and will apply all his efforts to assure that our nation lives in tranquility.
