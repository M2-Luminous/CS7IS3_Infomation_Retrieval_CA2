Riquelme? [Wasmosy] Well, it is a political problem. It was resolved by the Colorado Party Executive Board. I think the problem was resolved at that level. [Valdes] Do you feel strengthened now? [Wasmosy] I have always felt strong. I have never felt weak. But I have not always had the support of the Colorado Party Executive Board. Well, but you know very well that I was elected president of the Republic even without his support. [Valdes] Will there be changes in your cabinet? [Wasmosy] Negative. [Valdes] Will Eugenio Sanabria Cantero remain as head of the National Navigation and Ports Administration? [Wasmosy] Yes, of course, provided that his current functions do not prevent him from acting as head of the Colorado Party Executive Board, which is what I think our country needs. [Valdes] Will there be a change at the Interior Ministry? [Wasmosy] No. Absolutely not. [Valdes] If Sanabria Cantero's political activities prevent him from performing his role normally, will he be changed? [Wasmosy] You are speculating. I am not saying that. [Valdes] But according to your remarks... [Wasmosy] No. I said that I think that he will be able to remain in his post and at the same time be the chairman of the party board. Why not? [Valdes] Are you satisfied with his being chairman of the party board? [Wasmosy] I respect the party statutes. When the president resigns, the vice president takes over. [Valdes] There are speculations that you will reportedly hold a meeting with Argana in Punta del Este. [Wasmosy] They are speculations. [Valdes] Is there anything to them? [Wasmosy] Absolutely not. Is he here? I have never met him. [Valdes] It is said that you did see him at the Centenario Club, and that you turned around so as not to greet him on the day of voting at the club. [Wasmosy] I swear that I did not see him. [Valdes] It is said that the party problem was just a smokescreen to conceal the utility rates increase. [Wasmosy] That is absolutely false. [Valdes] It is appropriate to mention that the Paraguayan president arrived yesterday in Punta del Este, where he will stay until tomorrow. In the afternoon he held a meeting with his counterparts Luis Alberto Lacalle (of Uruguay) and Carlos Saul Menem (of Argentina) at the farm of businessman Samuel Lieberman in Maldonado.
