In it, the head of the city laconically announces the suspension of real estate privatization in Moscow until the president issues a decree establishing special rules for such privatization for the capital city--and until the Moscow privatization program is approved. That the mayor exceeded his authority, which is obvious from this action, is no sensation. Neither is the intensification of the confrontation between the mayor and the GKI [State Committee for the Administration of State Property] surprising--this should have been expected ever since the approval of a new state program of privatization undermined the mayor's positions in this struggle so greatly that he had no choice but to respond with a counterstrike. The mayor's escapade, however, brings back into focus the question: What is the whole brouhaha actually about? For the sake of what does Yuriy Mikhaylovich so stubbornly berate Mr. Chubays and try so hard to root out his influence on capital city affairs? To solve this puzzle, KOMMERSANT experts attempted to analyze one of the Moscow Government's latest steps in the area of privatization. This step was marked by a special statement issued by the mayoralty's press center at the end of February. Through the mouthpiece of its press center, the mayoralty stated that the GKI "continues to dispose of real estate on the territory of Moscow" without the consent of the city administration. As an example of the glaring arbitrariness of Chubays' agency, the statement cited the incident with the EKSIKOM joint-stock company and facilities transferred to it for the "laughable amount" of 56 million rubles [R]. On 23 February MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA and VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA each published an angry item on the basis of this statement, joined the next day by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS needed an extra day in order to work out an original way of presenting the material: "There is only one reason why Aleksandr Alyoshin (deputy prefect of Moscow's Eastern District--KOMMERSANT) was killed--a GKI order signed by Chubays' deputy V. Sychkin. The substance of the order: to form on the basis of the former state association KHOZUS of the Russian Federation [RF] Ministry of Industry AO [joint-stock company] EKSIKOM. Yes, this is exactly what the item said. Had it been 1937, Valentin Sychkin would have had it after such an accusation. (Although, on the other hand, had it been England, the other side would have had it....) KOMMERSANT experts felt that it was their duty to have a closer look at such a wily joint-stock company, especially considering that the incident in question is not over yet: Just a few days ago the RF Supreme Arbitration Court considered the appeals of the GKI and AO EKSIKOM regarding its previous ruling and did not find any grounds to overturn it. This is what we have found out. How the Owners Multiplied The EKSIKOM AO was set up in December 1992 on the basis of the KHOZUS state association of the RF Ministry of Industry, which in turn was the legal successor of the economic administration (KHOZU) of the RF Minoboronprom [Ministry of Defense Industry]. The founder was the RF GKI. Charter capital: R56.4 million. The AO's charter mission--to operate residential and nonresidential facilities of Russia's former defense agencies, as well as commercial activities, and construction. The facilities coming under EKSIKOM's supervision were mainly residential buildings built in the 1950's-1970's in the area around Sokolnicheskaya and Samotechnaya Squares, Malaya Bronnaya and 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Streets, and other prestigious places in the capital--a total of 16 buildings. In order to ensure loss-free maintenance and operation of this housing, the GKI included in the EKSIKOM AO's charter capital so-called "built-in and adjacent space" in these buildings (six or seven facilities housing stores, cafes, and a fashion house), which is reflected in the society's charter documents. As Rafael Sukhorukov, EKSIKOM AO first deputy general director, told a KOMMERSANT correspondent, at the stage of developing the privatization plan everything had been coordinated with the Moscow authorities--in particular, the Moscow City Council commissions on privatization and the consumer market and the Moscow Property Fund. A second option of preferences was selected, which gave the labor collective (plumbing services, maintenance personnel, guards, and groundskeepers) 51 percent of the stock, and in November 1993 the EKSIKOM AO received certificate No. 304, signed by V. Bushev, head of the Moscow Property Fund, giving it the ownership of 51 percent of the charter capital--the total charter capital, which means, including the now-disputed facilities. It appears that at the time Moscow authorities did not see anything wrong in the EKSIKOM AO's charter document. Neither did they see anything later, in January, when the Moscow Property Fund held a voucher auction and sold 10 percent more of EKSIKOM AO stock. Everything seemed to be going well; there were plans to sell at voucher auctions the remaining 39 percent of the stock--and then it suddenly turned out that the buildings and facilities in question had too many owners... It suddenly turned out that at that very time when the EKSIKOM AO was being set up, and the GKI included in its charter capital the built-in and adjacent space on Sokolnicheskaya Square (which housed the Zenit store, the Stromynka cafe and the Lena Makashova Fashion House), the city of Moscow's privatization commission was disposing of these facilities differently. It approved privatization plans which envisaged the lessees' rights to buy out the facilities a year after the lease agreements--signed in the past with the USSR Minoboronprom's KHOZU--expired. And in the summer of last year the Eastern Territorial Agency of the Moscow Property Committee [MPC] approved renegotiation of the lease contracts for this space and the property therein, declaring itself the lessor of the federal property. On top of that, so as not to make things easy at all, a contract between Minoboronprom's store Zenit and also Minoboronprom's advertising-commercial company Rassvet--of the existence of which neither the EKSIKOM AO nor the GKI had been aware--was produced, according to which the former leased from the latter fixed assets for a period of five years. The contract, along with carts and other equipment, also covers ("at the store director's request," it was ingeniously explained to a KOMMERSANT correspondent) the built-in and adjacent space itself, which therefore now had three owners... (Fortunately, Rassvet later had second thoughts and filed a claim with the Moscow Arbitration Court to invalidate this point.) The funniest part of the situation is that the store, the cafe, and the fashion salon to this day dutifully pay rent to EKSIKOM: According to Mr. Sukhorukov, last week they deposited the current payment into the account of the not-quite-born AO. Even a child knows that whoever the lessees pay is indeed the lessor. For some reason, however, the Moscow authorities do not wish to understand this--first they provoked the collectives of the aforementioned enterprises into a conflict with EKSIKOM, and then, upon insistent "recommendations," literally dragged the latter to the arbitration court with the aim of having the court hand them the federal property once and for all. `How Should I Judge You--By Law or By Conscience, as the Lord Will Tell Me?' (A.N. Ostrovskiy) So, the Stromynka cafe, the Zenit store, and the Lena Makashova Fashion House filed claims with the Moscow Arbitration Court asking that GKI Order No. 893-r dated 25 November 1992 be invalidated in the part regarding the inclusion in EKSIKOM's charter capital of the corresponding built-in and adjacent facilities. The Moscow Arbitration Court threw out the claim "on grounds of lack of subject of the action"--it reasoned that there is nothing to arbitrate, since the documents clearly stated: federal property. The Supreme Arbitration Court, however, did admit the claims. Moreover, it ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. The appeal filed by EKSIKOM was overruled a few days ago. The arbitration court was not impressed with the full set of documents proving both the authority of the creation of EKSIKOM and the legality of including former federal property in its charter capital. "We no longer know what to think," Nikolay Shmelev, EKSIKOM's chairman of the board and general director, told a KOMMERSANT correspondent. "One thing is probably clear: Too many interests are intertwined in this matter. There is no other explanation for what happened in the arbitration court a few days ago when our appeal was heard on the subject of the Stromynka cafe and the Lena Makashova Fashion House. It would seem that we presented all the arguments that prove us to be within our rights and that the GKI orders were justified. Frankly, we left the courtroom fully confident that now that we had brought and presented absolutely all the necessary papers, the old ruling would be overturned and the Supreme Arbitration Court would find the GKI orders to include into the charter capital of the state association KHOZUS (EKSIKOM's predecessor) the objects of federal property to be absolutely legitimate. But no! Again, the ruling was not in our favor. Did we not bring enough papers? We even brought a document in which the GKI (with Chubays' signature) instructs the ministries of the former ninth [directorate] to set up services such as ours to operate buildings and structures that had been on the books of these ministries. There is also a contract between the GKI and KHOZUS, which says clearly that these entities are transferred to our complete economic management for five years. But the court simply ignored all this and made a ruling which boils down to a contention that neither the GKI nor we ourselves were able to prove that these built-in and adjacent facilities are federal property. So I ask--what do they mean by "not able" when we brought all the documents, from a presidential decree to orders issued by Chubays and his deputies? What other documents could be needed? On top of that we brought the most recent GKI interpretation, written specifically for such disputes, dated 29 March and signed by First Deputy Chairman A. Ivanenko, which clearly interprets the application of point 11 of Edict No. 1230, which stipulates that leased enterprises have a first-option right to buy out space. The explanation says clearly that this right "does not extend to enterprises to which buildings, structures, and nonresidential space were given with right of full economic management, since right of full economic management is governed by property right rules." This is precisely about us! We brought this document to the arbitration court as well. Again, no reaction! It is literally a jinx--find something, we cannot tell you what it is, and bring it as proof of the legitimacy of your actions!.." The EKSIKOM people intend to fight to the last. They have two more options open to them: sending an oversight complaint to the first deputy chairman of the Supreme Arbitration Court, or filing a complaint with Russia's Office of the General Procurator. They decided to pursue the former option. (There is no set time frame for consideration of appeals by the court's first deputy chairman, however, and "while the court is deliberating," GKI opponents can achieve a great deal.) After that, the very last resort: an arbitration court plenum. In short, there will be no time to work--they will be too busy litigating. Do you remember the pilot Sevryugov from Voronya Slobodka? What saved him was worldwide publicity; otherwise he "would have been sucked into the centrifugal force of litigation and for the rest of his life would have called himself 'an injured party' instead of 'the pilot Sevryugov' and derived particular pleasure from uttering the words 'slap with a lawsuit.'" Unfortunately, EKSIKOM has not gained worldwide publicity, and therefore is in quite serious danger of this sad fate befalling it. KOMMERSANT experts do not intend to get bogged down in legal controversies and try to forecast the outcome of this arbitration epic (although the arguments of GKI and EKSIKOM appear much more substantiated to us than the reasoning of their opponents). In our opinion, it is important to understand why this epic began in the first place--and what precedent it is intended to set, in the Moscow authorities' design, in the event it succeeds. A Trend, However... That the mayoralty hates giving up "built-in and adjacent" areas in prestigious high-traffic places is quite understandable. They are very attractive, after all. It is quite possible, for instance, that precisely this space had been promised to someone. And then they remembered that they do not own it anymore and attempted to get it back. I. Kuraksina, director of the MPC's Eastern Territorial Agency, sent a claim to the EKSIKOM AO at the beginning of this year in which she simply demanded "transfer of said object voluntarily (!) to the MPC within a month." Quite logically, she was advised to take up this issue with the GKI. When it became clear that the impudence had not succeeded, a full-scale siege began. The city talked the lessees into filing a court suit (although they did not want to quarrel with the AO, which charges them surprisingly reasonable rent)--and the campaign was launched. KOMMERSANT experts are inclined to associate this massive attack on the part of the mayoralty on the property, which it was fully aware did not belong to it (that is, property that belonged to 700 Muscovites--EKSIKOM stockholders--not the mayoralty, and not even "the city of Moscow"), with two recent events that put in great doubt the Moscow Government's chances to keep--if not for good then at least for a long time--all Moscow real estate under its complete control. The first such event is of course the presidential edict approving a new state privatization program. It expands somewhat the regions' privatization rights, but also establishes quite unequivocally the primacy of the federal program over regional ones. The state program per se would not have scared the Moscow authorities too much--after all, they have successfully ignored the previous one in many respects, so the new one would not have particularly harmed them. But then the second event came about. We mean GKI Decree No. 353-r dated 15 February 1994 on privatization of nonresidential space. When we published this decree (see KOMMERSANT No. 10), we pointed out that this document makes it possible to privatize in a matter of a few days at reasonable prices leased buildings, structures, and land lots, and generally speaking a lessee cannot be refused the right to privatize. Thus, a principal opportunity emerged to pull a great deal of this nonresidential space out of bureaucrats' grip and thereby make it an object of buying and selling, a foundation on which to develop a truly functional real estate market. It is this document--of a most direct action--that could quite easily put an end to the Moscow mayoralty's omnipotence. Sensing the threat, the Moscow authorities decided to immediately produce a counteroffensive, and an exemplary--and therefore precedent-setting--one at that: prove that the capital city nonresidential stock is theirs to such an extent that they can not only refuse to give it up, but can actually take it back after whatever Chubays-authorized privatization. The incident we have described is indeed exemplary of sorts--at least in highlighting the reasons why the mayoralty is waging such an irreconcilable war on the GKI. The mayoralty accuses privatization a la Chubays of unfailingly leading to a change in enterprises' specialization to something that does not meet Muscovites' needs. We cannot go into a theoretical discussion on this subject here, but we believe it would be proper to emphasize that neither the Zenit store nor the Stromynka cafe nor the Lena Makashova Fashion House have in mind any future other than remaining a store, a cafe, and a fashion house. The mayoralty accuses privatization a la Chubays of handing out state property at bargain-basement prices, thus shortchanging the city treasury. If you recall, the GKI was faulted for a "laughable appraisal" of EKSIKOM's property. It is true that the appraisal is not all that high. But, as Mr. Sukhorukov told our KOMMERSANT correspondent, the MPC intends to transfer the disputed facilities--albeit into different hands--at exactly the same price. Which means that the entire incident described above--as well as the mayoralty's entire war on the GKI--is needed for one single purpose: to show this Chubays who is the master of the house. Who can suspend any attempt to transfer anything whatsoever in Moscow into private hands (truly transfer, not like in the draft of the Moscow privatization program, that is, without buildings and land--see KOMMERSANT Nos. 6 and 10). The Moscow Government's Bonapartism is getting stronger by the day. Let us recall the recent "mayor's pro mille": The mayoralty decided to deduct for the city budget 0.1 percent of the value of every foreign currency operation conducted on the capital city territory--and will be taking this money despite the illegality of such deductions (see KOMMERSANT Nos. 5 and 7). Now the mayoralty does not want to let go of nonresidential space--so it announces the suspension of real estate privatization. It is frightening even to think what else may be suspended or introduced tomorrow--"until a decree is issued setting special rules for the capital city." In light of such events one can only sincerely wonder how so much attention can be devoted for many days to some "version" of a state coup. For goodness sake, what coups? And most importantly, who needs them? Who would want to overthrow the state system under which anyone can become a local Bonaparte, that is, to put it plainly, tell the federal authorities where they can stick it and carry out their laws and edicts only to the extent it suits? Going back to the ill-fated EKSIKOM, let us emphasize that it is willing to cooperate on a mutually profitable basis with all interested parties. Mr. Sukhorukov told a KOMMERSANT correspondent that the AO would gladly agree to create in Sokolniki a holding company that would include EKSIKOM (with its legitimately obtained space), its current lessee enterprises (with their equipment, know-how, and trade ties), and the Eastern District prefecture (with the set of rights associated with the use of infrastructure needed to resolve social and cultural household issues). And everyone would be happy. By the way, according to Mr. Sukhorukov, the late Aleksandr Alyoshin already was leaning toward such a solution: He wanted to create something like a business center on the basis of these facilities...
