Commission Chairman V. Lemish and its members--People's Deputies of Ukraine--exchanged ideas and summarized its legislative work over the last three years. The commission, created by the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine in April of 1991, was able to work out a sound legal foundation for the creation of mechanisms for the practical resolution of questions in the military sphere, the building of Ukraine's own armed forces and other military formations, and to provide for state security. The commission brought into development some 23 laws of Ukraine and 47 decrees of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine on fundamental issues in the military sphere and state security, as well as 11 decrees and eight edicts of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine and nine directives of the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine. The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine on 11 October 1991 approved the conceptual framework for defense and the organizational development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that was submitted by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the Commission of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine on Issues of Defense and State Security, as well as the decree "The Creation of the Defense Council of Ukraine." The laws of Ukraine "The Defense of Ukraine," "The Armed Forces of Ukraine," "The National Guard of Ukraine," "The State Border of Ukraine," "The Border Troops of Ukraine," "Universal Military Obligation and Military Service," "Mobilization Training and Mobilization," "Social and Legal Protections for Servicemen and the Members of Their Families" and "Pension Support for Servicemen and Individuals and Supervisory and Regular Personnel of Bodies of Internal Affairs," as well as the decrees of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine on the procedure for the entry into force of those laws, were developed, prepared and adopted by the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine proceeding from the conceptual framework for defense and the organizational development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine also adopted the law "The Civil Defense of Ukraine." The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine has approved the text of the Military Oath, the Statute on the Duties and Rights of Personnel in the National Guard of Ukraine, the size of the Border Troops, and the Statute on the Procedure for Manpower Acquisition for the military, logistical and financial support of the National Guard of Ukraine and the Border Troops of Ukraine. The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine approved in October 1993 the Military Doctrine of Ukraine and defined its principal aspects, as well as approving the overall structure, size, weaponry and logistical support for the armed forces. The participants in the parting session of the commission thus pass along to their successors--the newly elected People's Deputies of Ukraine--a full-fledged package of legislation on issues in the military sphere and state security, with a sense of duties fulfilled and wishes for success in the continuation of this work with regard to its improvement.
