The task force was inaugurated today at the end of a joint meeting between the administrator, NNPC [Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation] officials, and oil dealers and marketers in Kaduna. Members of the task force include all state commissioners, directors general, NNPC officials, and representatives of oil dealers and marketers. Under the new guidelines, no loaded tanker would leave the NNPC depot without the presence of the administrator. In addition, a loaded tanker must be accompanied by a commissioner or a director general from the depot to the discharging points. All escorting officers are duty bound to inspect all the compartments of a tanker to ensure that all its contents were off-loaded at the destinations. Col. Isa directed all filling stations to henceforth commence operations from 7 o'clock each morning and close down at 7 o'clock in the night. They are also required to sell only 100 naira worth of petrol to each vehicle at a time. He warned that the offending dealers would have their licenses seized, while their filling stations would be converted to government filling stations.
