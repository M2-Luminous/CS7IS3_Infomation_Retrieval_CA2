They include the theses "The CPRF on the Path to Accord for Russia's Sake." They say: Formulating a tactical task, the CPRF proceeds from the premise that it is insufficient to put forward general program aims, whose full implementation is only possible when the people of labor come to power -- there must be a plan for specific actions. The CPRF believes that preserving civil peace and strengthening it on the basis of switching to a socialist method of development are vital conditions for averting a national-state disaster. To this end, the CPRF proposes: -- to form a broad coalition of left-wing, centrist, patriotic, and popular-democratic forces capable of neutralizing, and then politically, economically, and morally isolating, the "party of civil war"; -- to bring the coalition to power as the result of victory at elections or another peaceful, non-violent method. The CPRF realizes that achieving civil peace is not a one-shot act of signing some kind of solemn statement, it is not a declaration, but a package of steps which are perceptible in a practical sense and are primarily aimed at eliminating specific sources of civil confrontation. Today these sources, "risk factors" of a kind, include the sharp property stratification against the backdrop of an unrestrainable fall in production and inflationary processes, and the violation of the workers' socioeconomic rights. The Communists are prepared to propose a package of measures to reestablish legality in the country. The Communists see a change in the socioeconomic course as another very important precondition for reestablishing civil peace. A full program for the economic improvement of the situation in the country and a way out of the crisis may be agreed only through the joint efforts of all interested parties. But a number of measures will brook no delay. These include: -- putting a stop to the plundering privatization, checking the legality and economic expediency of all deals which have already been concluded, and clarifying the origins of the capital invested in privatization; -- making legislative provision for the most important rights of working collectives to own and use national property and to choose specific forms of destatization where this is economically justified, and banning interference in the economic life of enterprises in collective-group forms of ownership, particularly in the agro-industrial complex; -- recompensing the losses borne by citizens and economic organizations as a result of the "shock therapy," and finding ways of settling the nonpayments crisis, eliminating debts in wages, and indexing savings deposits, and indeed not by means of an extra emission but by freezing illegally accumulated capitals.
