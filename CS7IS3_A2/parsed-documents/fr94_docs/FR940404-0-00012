FR940404-0-00012 FR940404-0-00005 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;AGL&hyph;9] Establishment of VOR Federal Airway V&hyph;561 AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule establishes Federal Airway V&hyph;561 located in North Dakota and South Dakota. This action provides controlled airspace and improves operations between Grand Forks, ND, and Pierre, SD. This action improves navigation and saves fuel. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia P. Crawford, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace_Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9255. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On September 7, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish V&hyph;561 located in North Dakota and South Dakota (58 FR 47087). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Domestic VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The airway listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes V&hyph;561 located in North Dakota and South Dakota. Establishing a direct route between these points will provide controlled airspace and allow aircraft to operate efficiently and expeditiously along this route. This action is necessary to improve navigation and save on fuel consumption. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
