However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are at 50 CFR 17.22. The Applicant plans to build a residential subdivision in northwest Austin, Travis County, Texas. An EA/HCP has been developed as mitigation of the incidental taking of the golden-cheeked warbler. The Applicant proposes to mitigate the incidental take via dedicating approximately 440 acres of occupied golden-cheeked warbler habitat as a permanent preserve, providing funding for the operation and management of the preserve lands, performing golden-cheeked warbler studies on the project lands, and avoiding construction activities within warbler territories during the breeding season. Details of the mitigation are provided in the EA/HCP for the Great Hills Reserve. The Applicant considered five alternatives but rejected four because they were not economically viable. James A. Young, Acting Regional Director, Region 2, Albuquerque, New Mexico. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31060 Filed 12&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;M
