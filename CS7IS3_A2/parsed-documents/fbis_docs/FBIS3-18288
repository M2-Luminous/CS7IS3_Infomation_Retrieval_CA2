Approval will bring almost nothing but advantages. That unambiguous picture is presented in the study entitled "Historic Choice," which was submitted to Minister of Foreign Affairs Margaretha af Ugglas on Thursday [28 January]. The study is supposed to show the effect on foreign and security policy of a decision to join or stay out of the EU. The study's authors are Sverker Astrom and Leif Leifland (cabinet secretaries in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1972 to 1977 and from 1977 to 1982 respectively). "We have tried to write as objectively as possible," said Leifland at the news conference. When questioned about the unambiguous picture presented in the report, he answered that "being unambiguous does not rule out objectivity." Fateful Choice Ahead According to the study's authors, Sweden's 5 million eligible voters are facing a fateful choice. Looming up before the reader are two choices: a secure Union offering opportunities or an uncertain separateness offering difficulties. The referendum will take place in an international environment that has moved quickly from stable security-policy tension to "unstable detente." Developments in and around Russia are said to be the most important and most difficult-to-assess factor affecting Sweden's situation. "Sweden's entry into the EU and its participation in the common foreign and security policy represents a historic choice that will affect Sweden's position in Europe and the world beyond the foreseeable future." At the same time, it is emphasized that this does not mean that Sweden will be relinquishing control of its own policies. Astrom and Leifland said that the EU's foreign policy rides "the same old hobbyhorses" as Sweden, making it both natural and urgent to join. Membership in the EU will give Sweden more opportunities for directly influencing matters in its immediate vicinity, including relations with Russia. "If the Nordic states express their opinion on the Baltic states and the Baltic Sea, that will have a powerful effect within the EU," Astrom pointed out. Changed World He and Leifland said that the EU's plans for a future common defense policy did not conflict with Sweden's current policy of freedom from military alliances. The EU's cooperation on defense policy is expected to cover the form and policy of the military forces, defense doctrines, intelligence services, communications, and equipment. Sweden has spent billions of kronor in several of those defense policy areas to produce a "Swedish profile," but now international cooperation is consistent with freedom from military alliances. "The world around us has changed," Leifland explained. On the other hand, the EU's ambition to establish a future common defense force through which the countries will guarantee each other's security within the Western European Union (WEU) -- and NATO -- is not consistent with today's freedom from alliances. But Sweden can join the WEU as an observer. But the Maastricht treaty does not prevent a state from remaining free of military alliances (Ireland is an example), although Sweden can also decide "freely and independently" at a later stage whether it wants to join a common defense force. According to the Maastricht treaty, states shall "actively and unconditionally" support the common foreign and security policy "in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity." But Astrom and Leifland see no problems here in practice. Unanimous decisions are required, and if there are to be joint operations, the decisionmaking process guarantees the countries a double veto. Less Distinct Profile in United Nations "This means, then, that no member country can be forced against its will to participate in a regional operation, militarily or otherwise, in a foreign country. Obviously, it is also true that no country can be forced to accept foreign troops on its territory." If Sweden is a member of the EU, its profile in the United Nations will become less distinct. But Denmark's experience was said to show that a medium-sized country that joins the EU does not lose its old relations but gains a considerably larger international hearing. And most important of all: in times of unrest, Sweden can be confident that its peacetime cooperation has established a network of solidarity within the EU -- a kind of insurance premium. This may mean that we will have to take a stand on "risky situations," but the advantages outweigh the disadvantages: It is a question of uniting states with common interests and values. "Even without formal defense obligations, membership in the EU will be a net advantage for us -- a plus from the standpoint of security policy." On the other hand, rejection of the EU by the Swedish people is seen as resulting in existence under the opposite sign: "As an actor on the international stage, Sweden will be less interesting and less important. Sweden's marginalization or isolation will be almost unavoidable," said Astrom. Outside the EU, Sweden will be unable to influence West Europe's decisions affecting our own immediate vicinity and will miss out on the "security policy plus" represented by membership in the EU. Remaining outside the EU will also make our economy weaker -- and at the same time we will have to maintain our defense capability. The authors of the study discussed the question of how Sweden's position outside the EU would be affected if Finland joined the EU and the WEU and NATO as well. All other alternatives to the EU (United Nations, CSCE, WEU, NATO and its new cooperative organizations, the Council of Europe, or Nordic cooperation) either provide no true security or are politically impossible. The Riksdag's objective -- a "new European security order" -- is nothing more than a dream for the future. Arguing in a Circle Nor is it possible to go back to our all-embracing neutrality policy, because the world has changed. Astrom, once the foremost advocate of the neutrality policy, said that it "has a touch of unreality." In what was almost a circular argument, it was noted that the Riksdag and the government have been committed to EU membership since 1991. If the people now say no, the result will be "a degree of uncertainty regarding Sweden's position," since other solutions have not been considered, and there is no agreement on alternatives. Lastly, a no vote will mean losing this historic chance to get a reserved seat on the EU train. Meanwhile, the EU's foreign and security policy will be further developed without Swedish influence. If we change our minds later, the adjustment will be harder, because then we will be fighting for space and influence with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. "It would be a little ironic if Sweden were to join the EU under Albania's chairmanship," Astrom joked. Picture in Black and White This study of the effects that joining or staying out of the EU would have on foreign and security policy is one of six such studies in preparation for the referendum. The pluses if Sweden joins the EU: 1. Greater international influence. 2. Benefits from the standpoint of security policy. 3. We would retain control over our own foreign policy. 4. More opportunities to influence relations with the East. The negatives if Sweden stays out of the EU: 1. Reduced international influence. 2. Security policy will have to be redefined: Freedom from alliances will no longer suffice. 3. Less possibility of being active in the Baltic Sea area. 4. Increased defense burdens.
