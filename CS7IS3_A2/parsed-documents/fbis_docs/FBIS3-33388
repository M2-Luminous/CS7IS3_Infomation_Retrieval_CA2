The Mexican Democratic Party (PDM), Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), Mexican Green Ecologist Party (PVEM), and Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party (PFCRN) sent delegates to San Cristobal, PDM leader Marcelo Gaxiola stated. The dialogue between Manuel Camacho Solis, peace commissioner for peace, and the armed group that appeared in Chiapas on 1 January began Monday morning at the Cathedral of San Cristobal, 1,200 km southeast of Mexico City. In San Cristobal, Gaxiola announced a possible "private" meeting between representatives of the four parties and the 19 delegates of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) attending the negotiations to learn about the armed group's demands. That meeting, Gaxiola added, would be attended only by one representative of the four parties, under the promise of respecting security instructions established for the meeting. The four represented parties accepted an invitation made last week by the armed group to eight of the nine registered political parties to send delegates to follow the development of the peace talks. The PDM, excluded in the original invitation made in one of the communiques sent by the armed group to the press, was included in a later message, in which the EZLN presented an apology for the "omission." On 27 January, delegates from the four parties signed, together with four other parties, a document entitled "Commitment for Democracy, Peace, and Justice" to promote democratic advancement and the reincorporation of the armed group into the country's politics. The progovernment Institutional Revolutionary Party reported it expects to learn further details of the peace talks to issue a statement about the invitation, which was turned down by five political parties. The Popular Socialist Party, which did not sign the commitment, the National Action Party, and the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution declined the invitation because they think their struggle is political and unrelated to the armed alternative. The Labor Party initially expressed its support for the invitation, but it has abstained from sending delegates to San Cristobal, where the dialogue is being held, 51 days after the start of the conflict began with the takeover of towns by the armed group.
