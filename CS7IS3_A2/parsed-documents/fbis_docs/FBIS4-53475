FBIS4-53475 "dreas097_d_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 South Korea DPRK Not To Participate in Hiroshima Asian Games DPRK Not To Participate in Hiroshima Asian Games SK1905031094 Seoul YONHAP in English 0237 GMT 19 May 94 SK1905031094 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [By Kim Tae-yong] [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- The Asian sports world is in a state of shock after North Korea decided not to participate in team events at the Hiroshima Asian Games this October. North Korea had been expected to take part in the Asian sports festival to try to promote sports exchanges with other countries and solidify its relations with Chochongnyon, a pro-Pyongyang organization of Korean residents in Japan. The Hiroshima Asian Games Organizing Committee (HAGOC) announced Wednesday that North Korea sent a message earlier in the day conveying its decision not to participate in the team events of the Asian Games. The deadline for the team events was May 5, while that for individual events is July 4. "It must have been a difficult decision," a government official here said, "because if Pyongyang does not attend the Asian Games, it will be further isolated from the rest of the world." North Korea is already isolated politically because of its suspected nuclear ambition and economically because of its state- controlled socialist system, which has held it from joining such bodies as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) or world Trade Organization (WTO). Compounding the problem, the reclusive state has skipped several international sports competitions. North Korea has failed to participate in a recent series of major international events including last year's summer universiad in Buffalo, New York, and the winter olympic games held in Lillehammer, Norway, in February. If Pyongyang chooses not to attend the Asian Games being held in a neighboring country, Japan, then it may be because of political or economic reasons -- not issues related to sports, according to the official. Pyongyang did not specify its reasons in notifying HAGOC in the name of North Korean Olympic Committee President Pak Myong-chol, nor did it comment on whether it would participate in individual events, according to HAGOC. North Korea did not take part in several international sports events in the past for political reasons. For example, it refused to attend the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics following the line of Moscow, and it did not compete in the 1986 Seoul Asian Games and the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Although Pyongyang sent teams to the 1990 Beijing Asian Games, the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics and the 1993 Winter Universiad in Zakopane, Poland, it avoided international sports competitions again from the 1993 Summer Universiad in Buffalo. Meanwhile, Pyongyang's likely absence from the Asian Games is frustrating Seoul's plans to revive inter-Korean sports exchanges and thus promote overall North-South relations, according to officials. South Korean sports officials originally planned to contact their North Korean counterparts to revive inter-Korean soccer and table tennis matches and discuss promoting overall inter-Korean sports exchanges. Moreover Seoul, trying to win the right to host the 2002 world cup soccer finals, hoped to meet with senior sports officials from Pyongyang at the Hiroshima Asian Games to discuss co-hosting of the world event. Now, Seoul cannot expect such contacts.
