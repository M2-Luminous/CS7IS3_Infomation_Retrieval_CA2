This is a forced measure, a number of economists believe, and has been brought about by the fact that more than 90 percent of the republic's enterprises engaged in foreign trade transactions are endeavoring to keep the monetary resources they have earned outside of Azerbaijan. Last year Azerbaijan exported $750 million of commodities overseas. Of this sum, more than $600 million have not as yet entered the republic. A similar trend is being observed in commercial transactions with the republics of the "near abroad," Russia included. For example, according to figures of the State Committee for Statistics, in nine months of the current year R116 billion of commodities were exported to Russia and just R62 billion of goods were imported. The arrears of more distant foreign countries are substantial. Such states as Iran, Turkey, and Greece owe Azerbaijan over $60 billion.
