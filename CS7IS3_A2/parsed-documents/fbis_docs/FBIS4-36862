"We will need a minimum of 1,200 policemen and civilians in Jericho and three times as many in Gaza to protect Yasir 'Arafat and look after the logistics," one of Palestinian protocol officers told AFP. "We are expecting that a quarter of a million Palestinians will come to Jericho to celebrate the return home of the president of Palestine," he said. "So many people will be a real headache for us." Such an influx into the small Jordan valley town, with only one road in and out, will make it virtually impossible for 'Arafat to move around. Jericho, where summer temperatures hover around 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), has two main streets and a little square. "We are faced with a dilemma: if we restrict entry we will spoil the day, if we let everyone in there will be a terrible crush," said the official, who asked not to be named. The risk of an attempt on 'Arafat's life cannot be neglected either. "An Israeli settler or even a Palestinian opposed to the peace process could take advantage of the confusion to try to kill him," he said, recalling threats from Jewish extremists. The pro-Syrian Palestinian leader Ahmad Jibril has also called for 'Arafat to be killed following his signing of the autonomy agreement last September. The official said 'Arafat should arrive in Jericho by helicopter, thereby avoiding the Israeli checkpoint on the Allenby Bridge from Jordan. He would also fly to the Gaza Strip because a land journey would mean an Israeli army escort. Questions of protocol are greatly exercising the organizers who plan to invite the nine consul generals and the Vatican's apostolic delegate in Jerusalem as well as a certain number of ambassadors based in Tel Aviv. "All this is new to us," the official admitted. "How do we bring them to Jericho? How do we seat them? How do we greet them.?" None of the countries they represent have recognized 'Arafat as the head of the State of Palestine. 'Arafat has given a written commitment to Israel not to use the title of president following the signing of the May 4 accord which launched self-rule in Jericho and Gaza. "That does not change anything for the Palestinians," said Ma'in 'Urayqat, spokesman for Orient House, the Palestinian headquarters in Jerusalem. "We will roll out the red carpet for Yasir 'Arafat and receive him as head of State." "The arrival of the PLO leader will give a strong boost to the peace process," 'Urayqat said. "It is in the interest of all the concerned parties that it goes off well. That means the Israelis must avoid any provocation by settlers or soldiers which would harm the political climate." For the last four weeks, the head of 'Arafat's bureau, Ramzi Khuri, has been here working out the details of the visit. He has chosen a luxury home and offices for the PLO chairman in lush green compound on the edge of Jericho. The Palestinian cabinet of "ministers" will be housed in a new building which was to have been an old people's home and individual ministers have been alloted houses throughout Jericho. In Gaza, the former Egyptian governor's palace, which Israel used as a border police headquarters, is being restored for 'Arafat. He will also have a private residence at his disposition in the wealthy Rimal neighbourhood overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. "He is not coming as a tourist but to start up the mechanism of autonomy," a Palestinian official said. The arrival is scheduled for the end of June or early July.
