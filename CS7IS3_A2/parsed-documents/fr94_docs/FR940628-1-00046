FR940628-1-00046 FR940628-1-00010 I. Applicability a. Types of Research The proposed regulations implement section 493A of the PHS Act, added by Public Law 103&hyph;43, which mandates the issuance of regulations defining, and setting standards for, the management of financial interests that will, or may be reasonably expected to, bias a clinical research project whose purpose is to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or treatment. In addition, the proposed regulations implement section 924 of the PHS Act, as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;410, which requires the Administrator of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) to issue regulations defining the financial interests that will, or may be reasonably expected to, create a bias in the health care services research projects funded by the AHCPR. The proposed regulations are not limited to the implementation of these statutory authorities, however. Pursuant to the Secretary's authority to issue regulations governing those who seek or receive PHS funding, they apply broadly to all research funded by the PHS, whether under the authority of the PHS Act or other statutes, except Phase I projects under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program. Very limited amounts of funding are provided under Phase I of the SIBR Program to plan and determine the feasibility of the research project for further funding under Phase II. Because potentially biasing financial interests will be assessed at the time of the Phase II application, it would be burdensome and unproductive to require such a review for Phase I applications. With this exception, it is believed that financial interests can create a bias in all types of research, although the likelihood of such a bias may diminish if the outcome of the research would have little effect on the commercial potential of any product, device, or other property in which the Investigator may have a financial interest. However, this distinction can not be so clearly drawn that the need to protect the integrity of all PHS-funded research uniformly is alleviated. b. Individual vs. Institutional Financial Interests The proposed regulations provide for the disclosure and consideration of the financial interests of individuals involved in the design, conduct, and reporting of the research. Section 493A of the PHS Act, added by Public Law 103&hyph;43, refers to financial interests of entities (e.g., institutions), as well as individuals, in clinical research projects. We are considering the following alternatives with respect to the coverage of institutions that apply for clinical research funding under the PHS Act: (1) Exempting Institutional Financial Interests That Would Not Bias the Project Under the statute, adoption of this alternative would be based on a determination that the exempted institutional financial interests would not be reasonably expected to bias the design, conduct, or reporting of PHS-funded research. This conclusion might be based on a finding that the limited size of the interest would preclude any biasing effect, or a finding that the institutional financial interest would have only an indirect and unpredictable effect on the project, in the absence of a personal financial interest on the part of those responsible for the design, conduct or reporting of the research. There would, of course, have to be a reasonable factual basis for such findings. (2) Requiring Institutional Applicants To Certify Whether They Have Significant Financial Interests Adoption of this alternative would involve establishing a procedure for institutions similar to the procedure in the proposed regulation for individuals. This option would be based on the same rationale as the preceding option, i.e. that there is no need to regulate institutional financial interests that aren't reasonably expected to bias the conduct of the research. Significant Financial Interest might be defined for institutions as limited only to direct financial interests (such as a patent application on, or a financial arrangement with a company regarding, the product of the research). (3) Requiring Full Disclosure to the PHS of the Financial Interests of Institutions This alternative would impose a reporting burden upon the institutions, but would ensure a complete PHS review of any potential conflict of interest prior to a funding decision. (4) Other Alternatives We will also consider combinations of these three alternatives and other alternatives that may be suggested in the public comments. We will choose an alternative based on the requirements of the statute, and, to the extent consistent with the statute, based upon our weighing of the burdens on the institutions, the potential that institutional financial interests will bias PHS-funded research, and the potential adverse effect of the alternative upon technology transfer. c. Types of Interests The proposed regulations require disclosure of ``significant financial interests'' of the Investigator that would reasonably appear to be directly and significantly affected by the research funded by PHS or proposed for funding or of the investigator in an entity whose financial interest would reasonably appear to be directly and significantly affected by the PHS research. The following are examples of the types of significant financial interests that would fall within the categories in ยง50.605: ownership of stock, stock options, or any equity, debt, security, capital holding, salary or other remuneration, or financial consideration, or thing of value for services as an employee, consultant, officer, or board member in (1) any business enterprise, including the applicant for PHS funds (except SBIR applicants are not included), that owns or has applied for the patent, manufacturing or marketing rights to a drug, vaccine, device, procedure or any other product involved in or that will predictably result from the research described in the application or (2) a business enterprise that is known by the investigator to own or have applied for such rights in any product that can reasonably be expected to compete with the product or procedure that will predictably result from the research described in the application. We request comments on a range of disclosures that would on the one hand, include interests that may threaten objectivity; and, on the other exclude those interests that cannot reasonably be regulated or that are so obvious as not to warrant regulations. We also request comments on whether specific examples of biasing significant financial interests, such as those set forth above, should be included in the regulations. In particular, we request comments on whether interests in a business enterprise that is known by the investigator to have an interest in a product that competes with the product involved in the application should fall within the categories of significant financial interests described in ยง50.605. There may not be any reasonable way for an investigator either to identify all competing products or to determine what companies own them. For example, for most medical devices there may be dozens of competing products, many made by subsidiaries of ``Fortune 500'' conglomerates. How would an investigator determine just what products were ``competing''? Should we be concerned if an investigator owns $5,000 of stock in a company in which only a small fraction of revenues and profits derive from the competing product? We request comments on whether, and how best, to cover interests in competing products.
