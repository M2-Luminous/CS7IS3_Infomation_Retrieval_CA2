Argentina has asked Brazil for "compensation" to its growers to counterbalance the "unfair competition" from the Canadians. The Itamar Franco government has, however, already made its decision: "The state does not intervene in the grain market, which is absolutely free." In a conversation with CLARIN, Foreign Trade Secretary Renato Marques said: "As of 1991, wheat purchases are no longer handled by the state. Today private parties freely import wheat. Brazil no longer exercises foreign trade control." [CLARIN] There was the situation when Brazil granted Argentina compensation after confirming that U.S. wheat sold to Brazil was subsidized... [Marques] That was an entirely different case. The United States was exporting wheat under the Export Enhancement Program, and this involved oficial recognition that wheat was being subsidized.
