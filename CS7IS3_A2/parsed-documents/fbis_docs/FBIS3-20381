Melih Gokcek, the RP candidate won by a narrow margin over Social Democrat Populist Party (SHP) candidate Korel Goymen. The RP made sweeping gains across the country to take third place overall behind Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's center-right True Path Party (DYP) and the main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP). The RP doubled its share of the vote since the last nationwide municipal elections in 1989. Campaigning for a "just order" and adherence to conservative Islamic values, the RP has found support among the rural migrants who flocked to the major cities in search of jobs. The party has never made a serious impact in Ankara, a city of 3 million and cradle of the secular Turkish Republic founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923.
