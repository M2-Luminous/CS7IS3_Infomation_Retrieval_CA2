FBIS4-27111 "dreas104_c_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 30 May 1994 North Korea `Hysterics' of `Warmonger' Noted `Hysterics' of `Warmonger' Noted SK3105090494 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 30 May 94 SK3105090494 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 30 May 94 Korean BFN [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Hysterics of the Warmonger"] [Text] According to reports, on 28 May, the traitor Kim Yong- sam instigated a war mood while visiting a puppet combat air corps, an Army unit in the eastern front line, and a Navy fleet headquarters in succession. Saying that it is possible to maintain peace on the Korean peninsula only when they [South Koreans] are strong, he ordered soldiers to be put on air-tight alertness, to make every preparation for anti-aircraft alertness, and so on. This is a deliberate maneuver to further aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula made tense by them, and plainly shows their frenzy for a war of northward invasion. The puppet traitor blared as if we were about to make a sudden raid on the South, saying that this is a very dangerous time. This is a shameless preposterous sophistry, like an act of a thief raising a hue and cry. Who is in fact making the situation tense and increasing the danger of war on the Korean peninsula? It is needless to say that it is the U.S. imperialists and the U.S. stooge, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique itself. As was reported, the U.S. imperialists have brought Patriot missiles and Apache attack helicopters into South Korea under the pretext of our so-called nuclear issue and has now put the aircraft carrier Independence in a location at sea from which it may take one week or less for the aircraft carrier to arrive to the Korean peninsula. In the meantime, the U.S. ruling classes are making the belligerent outburst that they should make an air raid on our nuclear facilities for peaceful purposes or attack them with cruise missiles. Following their U.S. master's war maneuver, the puppets put the puppet armed forces on a state of alert and are watching for a chance to invade the North. What the puppets mean by peace is that they would provoke a war of northward invasion, and what they mean by strength to be increased is that they would further strengthen preparations for a war of northward invasion. These facts clearly prove that only northward threats, not southward ones, exist on the Korean peninsula and that it is none other than the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique who try to provoke a war. Traitor Kim Yong-sam, however, talked about being alert against us. This shameless trick [paryomchihan sujak], like an act of a thief raising a hue and cry, has revealed his vicious intention to push the puppet armed forces out to a war of northward invasion by aggravating the situation. Traitor Kim Yong-sam, with a civilian mask, is indeed a more vicious warmonger than military gangsters although he is wearing civilian clothes. He takes no regard for peace or for the country's reunification. Puppet Kim Yong-sam's instigation of a war mood is nothing but hysterics of one who has lost reason. As everyone knows, the puppets have been frenzied in carrying out war preparations while stirring up a commotion over our nuclear issue. Our nuclear policy, however, has proved more clearly to be innocent as days go by, while the slanderous nature of the puppets' nuclear commotion has been exposed to the light of day. The South Korean people are vigorously waging the anti-U.S., antiwar, and antinuclear struggle, and their willpower for independent reunification is rapidly growing. Embarrassed by this, the puppets are trying to turn the growing struggling spirit of the people to the South-North confrontation by any means so that they can realize their scheme for a war. One can guess how much he was embarrassed from the fact that traitor Kim Yong-sam busied himself visiting puppet units after giving up keeping appearances. It is natural that those who have been driven into a corner make all frenzied attempts. Such maneuvers, however, will only expose the true nature of warmongers, splittists, and will only result in hastening their own ruin. Nothing can block the nation's grand march toward peace and reunification. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should look straight at the trend of the time and behave discreetly.
