Mandela, speaking to journalists at the end of a two-day visit to the Netherlands, said the threats of violence from black and white parties in the Alliance were greatly exaggerated, and it was not in a position to go to war. The African National Congress leader said: "We must not exaggerate the importance of the organisations in the Freedom Alliance. We don't even think that they have the capacity to conduct a civil war." He did not believe the boycott threat was final, but even if it was carried out it would not stop the election process. A series of meetings were held Friday in Johannesburg by both the ANC and the government to try to convince the Freedom Alliance to accept a last-minute compromise package and join the April 26 to 28 election. The package is set to be approved by a recalled multi-party forum on Monday, before going to a special sitting of parliament, probably in early March, to be passed into law.
