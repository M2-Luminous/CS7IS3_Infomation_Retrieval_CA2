The statement of Hamas considered the meeting as a preparation for future practical meetings. It also said that the meeting was characterized with frankness. The statement added that the delegation reached an agreement that the aim of the transitional period was to return to the election stage, and that the dialogue would continue and would include the leadership of the dissolved FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] within the framework of respecting the constitution and renouncing violence. This was the statement of Hamas. However, sources close to the presidency pointed out that the text of the statement in the part related to the participation of the dissolved FIS in the current national dialogue was nothing more than an interpretation -- used for political aims -- of the message conveyed by Lamine Zeroual to the various personalities he received until now. As far as the dialogue was concerned, the source close to the presidency recalled, it would take place within the framework of the statement issued on 18 March.
