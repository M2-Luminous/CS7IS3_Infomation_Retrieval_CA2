Aichi, director general of the agency, made the remark to reporters after a cabinet meeting on the issue. "I will consult with Prime Minister Hosokawa on arranging the reviews. We must go ahead with the work within the understanding of one another on the issue," he said. He admitted that relations between the prime minister and the agency on the issue were insufficient. The prime minister has voiced his intention to set up his advisory panel to review the defense program outline and to reach a conclusion by around summer. But some Defense Agency officials have opposed Hosokawa's proposal. Aichi hinted at a meeting with Hosokawa in February after political reform bills are enacted. The bills are expected to pass through the Diet by the end of the current Diet session on January 29. The cabinet of Former Prime Minister Takeo Miki drafted the defense plan in 1976, which outlines the need to arrange armed forces through numerical targets. Since then the agency has drafted midterm, five-year defense buildup programs based on the outline. Japan has considered reviewing the defense outline since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
