The demonstration was originally announced as a sit-in by the Independent Union of Radio Broadcasters (IURB), but the protesters could not sit down because the square was watered earlier by unidentified persons. IURB president Laszlo Gyori said the demonstration was to show solidarity for the 129 radio employees summarily laid off on March 4. "This was a deliberate move by Hungarian Radio leaders against 129 employees and press freedom," he said Miklos Gyorffy, a well-known radio journalist, said that the dismissed have the sympathy of many colleagues still in place. He stated the radio has been undergoing a political cleansing. "It is not democracy when all this can be done without any objections," he added. Several speakers called for the resignation of Laszlo Csucs, the radio vice-president invested with full presidential powers. Editor-reporter Jozsef Barath announced that the presidium of the National Association of Hungarian Journalists (NAHJ) on Wednesday decided to lodge a complaint against Csucs for paying public money to workers whom he does not allow to work. (The dismissed were given notices effective in 30 days, but they were suspended from their duties immediately.) In addition, the NAHJ will initiate an ethical examination against those of its members who played a part in the cleansing. Simultaneous with the nearly 90-minute-long protest, an organization calling itself the "Patriotic Committee for National Radio and Television" organized a counter-demonstration (a so-called "standing strike" in Pollack Mihaly Square for those "who want a national radio". One of the counter-demonstrators (most of whom who were standing in small groups amid the crowd of protesters) argued that nobody demonstrated for the hundreds of thousands of people who have been laid off, nor did anybody speak out in parliament in their defence. The middle-aged man, who stood on the edge of the officially announced protest (which had previously been granted a permit) was shouting through a loudspeaker and disturbing the other demonstrators. Police drove him away from the square.
