That assassination provoked the current violence in that country. Today the Belgian Government, through Prime Minister Dehaene, most firmly denies those allegations. [Dehaene] Apparently, this anti-Belgian propaganda has not stopped and it is clear that it is unfounded. It is the policy of some Rwandan clan which obviously has decided to place the responsibility on the Belgians. [Quevrain] Are you not afraid that these allegations will tarnish the image of Belgium? [Dehaene] I do not believe that they will be seen as very credible abroad. I believe that it clearly must be stated that they are unfounded and that the Belgian troops were in Rwanda to implement the peace and cooperation agreements and had no role in domestic affairs.
