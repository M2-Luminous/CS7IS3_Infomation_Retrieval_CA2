The NPA decided to comply with a Mexican Government request to dispatch nine experts on measures to counter the threats from terrorists, drug traffickers and gangsters to society, NPA officials said. The Mexican request was conveyed to the Japanese police by Mexican Deputy Security Minister Socorro Diaz Palacios, who paid an official visit to Tokyo last November, the officials said. Palacios voiced interest in acquiring Japanese police techniques credited with maintaining the security standards of the Japanese society renowned for its low ratio of the breakout of violent crimes, they said. The Mexican Government will shoulder the budgetary outlays to fund the travel costs of all nine Japanese experts unlike the previous similar cases of international cooperation, in which Japanese police sent its experts to other developing countries.
