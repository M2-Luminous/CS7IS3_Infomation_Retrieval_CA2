When dealing with the question of China-funded enterprises in Hong Kong, he pointed out: China-funded enterprises should play their due role in Hong Kong while refraining from involvement in some activities. They should not do everything they wish to. They should make contributions to the maintenance of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. When discussing the question of constituencies in the first legislature of the special administrative region government, Lu Ping said: When the Preliminary Work Committee discussed this question, participants suggested in a relatively powerful way that China- funded enterprises should be counted as a constituency, because they play a certain role in Hong Kong's economy. He said: China-funded enterprises should undertake a mission of maintaining Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. Meanwhile, Lu Ping emphatically pointed out: China-funded enterprises should play their due role in Hong Kong while refraining from involvement in some activities. They should not do everything they wish to. He said: Some people say that as Hong Kong is a free economic society, why should China-funded enterprises not do things that others can do? He pointed out: China-funded enterprises should not get involved in certain activities, because they have their own mission. They should not just make economic contributions to the state. More importantly, they should maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. Lu Ping stated: By playing their due role, we mean that China- funded enterprises should do things which are conducive to Hong Kong's prosperity and should refrain from doing things detrimental to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Illustrating this with examples, he said: They should not engage in real estate trading, and we do not allow them to do so. He pointed out: I hear some China-funded enterprises are also involved in trading real estate at a profit. This brings no good to Hong Kong. The price of real estate in Hong Kong has been pushed up too high. He said: When they lose money in real estate transactions, there is no need for some China-funded institutions to pay for the losses. This means they compete with other enterprises on an unequal footing. At the same time, as there is no need for them to take responsibility for their losses, they can push up real estate prices very high. He said: This way of doing things must be opposed. He maintained: If China-funded enterprises participate in the legislature as a constituency, they will pay a positive role in various aspects of endeavor, because they shoulder the glorious historical mission of developing Hong Kong's economy and stabilizing Hong Kong society.
