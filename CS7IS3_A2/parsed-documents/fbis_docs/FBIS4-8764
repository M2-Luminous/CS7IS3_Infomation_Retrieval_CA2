FBIS4-8764 "dreeu074_i_94037" FBIS-EEU-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Events in Gorazde -- 18 April Events in Gorazde -- 18 April `Chaos' as Serb Circle Tightens AU1804091494 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian 0800 GMT 18 Apr 94 AU1804091494 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Report by Enes Musovic] [Text] The residents of Gorazde spent the worst night of their lives last night, most of them in the streets as there is not enough accommodation for all those who barely managed to save their lives from the chetnik attack on the town's suburbs and the town itself yesterday. The town hospital also lacks accommodation. There is an increasing number of wounded. In this chaos no one knows their exact number, nor the number of those killed. It is only known that there are very many. Owing to the close proximity of the chetniks to the city center, those (?killed) cannot be evacuated nor buried, nor is it possible to take the wounded to hospital. So, Gorazde is dying by itself in the worst possible pain before the very eyes of the entire international public. [Words indistinct] is a lie that the UN yesterday sent 336 troops, who have allegedly stopped the chetniks in their bloody advance toward the center of the town. The purpose of that information was only to enable the chetniks to gain time to kill, conquer, destroy, and torch in peace. Which they did and are still doing in the most brutal way. They are hunting down the (?confused) people with snipers from the (?nearby) hills. In the general chaos that reigns in [word indistinct] streets, the people do not know what to do nor (?where to go). The chetniks have been killing these people with bombs, snipers, and antiaircraft weapons. They are killing them this morning, too. The chetniks are receiving tacit support from the UN for these crimes. Because of these crimes, Mr. Akashi is daily going to the criminals in Pale to congratulate them on killing children, women, and the elderly. At the same time he is saying that the conditions were not ripe for air strikes against the murders of these civilians. The situation this morning is the same as yesterday, a shade worse, because the town is full, brimming with new refugees who have come from the town's closest suburbs. The chetniks are continuing to strangle Gorazde. Gorazde's streets are being fired on by snipers, and with [M-]84's, anti-aircraft machine guns, tanks, and even mortars. The encirclement of the city center is becoming tighter and tighter. NATO aircraft are still overflying the bloody Gorazde skies, not to help the people of Gorazde, but to film the last moments of the life of these people.
