Guards shot and wounded several protesters who smashed and set fire to public buildings on March 17 in Bani Walid, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Tripoli, Muhammad Fayiz Jibril told AFP. Protests erupted after Libyan television broadcast "false confessions extracted under torture from army officers" implicated in last October's rebellion in Bani Walid, said Jibril, Cairo representative for the Libyan National Salvation Front. "Members of the Libyan regime called for the execution of these officers, who admitted under torture to being agents of the United States. Bani Walid residents were outraged over the call for executions and the use of torture," he said. "The residents then smashed and set fire to the offices of the revolutionary and information committees" set up by al-Qadhdhafi, he said. "Agents of the revolutionary committees holed up in the offices opened fire on the demonstrators, wounding several of them," he added. Jibril asked Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid and Arab foreign ministers meeting in the Egyptian capital to intervene to prevent al-Qadhdhafi from "executing the 55 officers."
