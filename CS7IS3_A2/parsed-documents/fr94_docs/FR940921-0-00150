FR940921-0-00150 FR940921-0-00016 113. A new section 86.1342&hyph;94 is added to subpart N to read as follows: §86.1342&hyph;94 Calculations; exhaust emissions. Section 86.1342&hyph;94 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §86.1342&hyph;90. Where a paragraph in §86.1342&hyph;90 is identical and applicable to §86.1342&hyph;94, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.1342&hyph;90.'' (a) introductory text [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.1342&hyph;90. (a)(1) A WM = Weighted mass emission level (HC, CO, CO 2 or NO X ) in grams per brake horsepower-hour and, if appropriate, the weighted mass organic material hydrocarbon equivalent or non-methane hydrocarbon, in grams per brake horsepower-hour. (a)(2) through (b)(7) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.1342&hyph;90. (b)(8) Non-methane hydrocarbon mass: NMHC mass = V mix × Density NMHC × (NMHC conc /1,000,000) (c) through (d)(1)(i) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.1342&hyph;90. (d)(1)(ii) Density HC = Density of hydrocarbons. (A) For gasoline and the gasoline fraction of methanol-fuel, and may be used for petroleum and the petroleum fraction of methanol diesel fuel if desired; 16.33 g/ft3-carbon atom (0.5768 kg/m3-carbon atom). (B) For # 1 petroleum diesel fuel; 16.42 g/ft3-carbon atom (0.5800 kg/m3-carbon atom). (C) For # 2 diesel 16.27 g/ft3-carbon atom (0.5746 kg/m3-carbon atom). Average carbon to hydrogen ratios of 1:1.85 for gasoline, 1:1.93 for # 1 petroleum diesel fuel and 1:1.80 for # 2 petroleum diesel fuel are assumed at 68 ○F (20 ○C) and 760 mm Hg (101.3 kPa) pressure. (D) For natural gas and liquified petroleum gas-fuel; 1.1771 (12.011+H/C (1.008)) g/ft3-carbon atom (0.04157 (12.011+H/C (1.008)) kg/m3-carbon atom) where H/C is hydrogen to carbon ratio of the hydrocarbon components of the test fuel, at 68 ○F (20 ○C) and 760 mm Hg (101.3 kPa) pressure. (d)(1)(iii) through (d)(1)(iv)(A) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.1342&hyph;90. (d)(1)(iv)(B) For petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquified petroleum gas-fueled engines, HC e is the FID measurement. (d)(1)(iv)(C) through (d)(3)(v)(A) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.1342&hyph;90. (d)(3)(v)(B) CO e = [1 ^ (0.01 + 0.005HCR) CO 2e ^ 0.000323R] CO em for methanol-fuel, natural gas-fuel and liquified petroleum gas-fuel where HCR is hydrogen to carbon ratio as measured for the fuel used. Where: (d)(3)(vi) through (d)(7)(ii) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.1342&hyph;90. For natural gas-fueled or liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles where fuel composition is C x H y as measured for the fuel used. (d)(8)(i) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.1342&hyph;90. (d)(8)(ii) Otto-cycle engines: K H = 1/[1&hyph;0.0047 (H&hyph;75)] (or for SI units, K H = 1/[1&hyph;0.0329(H&hyph;10.71)]). E:GRAPHICSER21SE94.005 ␣
