FBIS4-67168 "jptdd021__l94021" JPRS-TDD-94-021-L JPRS Narcotics 19 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA MEXICO Report `Confirms' Baja California State Police Protecting Report `Confirms' Baja California State Police Protecting Traffickers 94WB0036A Mexico City EXCELSIOR in Spanish 19 Apr 94 STATES Section pp 1, 4 94WB0036A Mexico City EXCELSIOR Spanish CSO [Article by Rocio Galvan] [Text] Tijuana, Baja California [BC], 18 April--The PAN's [National Action Party] local congressional faction submitted a report to the state's governor, Ernesto Ruffo Appel, regarding the shooting that occurred in this town on 3 March. It declares that the State Judicial Police (PJE) have been implicated in the drug traffic "ever since Francisco Franco Rios was named head of the State Attorney General's Office." This claim was made today by Congressman Armando Ayon, a member of the legislative body's Justice Commission. Armando Ayon added that the document confirms certain statements made by Mexico's ambassador in France and by the ex-attorney general of the republic, Ignacio Morales Lechuga, to the effect that "Baja California judicial agents are giving protection to the drug traffic." The document sent to Ruffo Appel was ratified by the eight PAN congressmen in the present legislature, who explain: "Not all the Judicial Branch officials and agents are in collusion with the drug traffic." The investigation was conducted after the shooting that occurred on 3 March at the La Mesa local branch office, where five persons were killed: an incident that has not yet been totally explained. According to the aforementioned report, PJE agents gave protection to at least one of the drug traffickers involved in the shooting on this town's Diaz Ordaz Boulevard. For this reason, the congressmen requested that Ruffo Appel call for the resignation of Francisco Franco Rios, since the police collusion with the drug traffic has been proven. The PJE commander detailed here, Jorge Alvarez Barriere, for his part, announced that 13 agents from the force had been dismissed within the past two weeks: five for showing positive results in the drug testing, and the other eight for "loss of confidence" in them.
