Delegates from 16 countries took part. Seven NATO representatives, headed by Brigadier General Tom Lennon, deputy chief of the joint program of miltary contacts under the U.S. Armed Forces Headquarters, Europe, were at the conference. Also invited were the ambassadors to Estonia of the FRG, Finland, and Norway. They "forgot" to invite the Russian ambassador. The two days at the conference were spent talking about Zhirinovskiy's victory -- this was how one participant, in conversation with myself, aptly described what happened in Tallinn. The discussion of the problems of cooperation in the Baltic region was exploited by the representatives of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania for one purpose -- to describe the current situation in Russia in the gloomiest tones and to try (yet again) to get accepted as members of this bloc as quickly as possible by putting pressure on representatives of the North Atlantic bloc. In my view, a conference on a very important issue was transformed through the efforts of its organizers into a purely propaganda event, and only the speech of Vice Admiral Viktor Kravchenko, first deputy commander of the Baltic Fleet, infused a fresh spirit into it, since his speech contained specific proposals on the organization of cooperation in the Baltic Sea. Unfortunately, the proposals of the Russian military were supported only in the lobbies. From the rostrum Estonian Defense Minister Juri Luik expressed support for the creation of a unified concept of security of the Baltic countries, at the same time suggesting Russia as the adversary. He called for the creation of a military-political alliance of the Baltic states without Russia's participation, but incorporating Ukraine as "the main guarantor of opposition to Moscow's imperial policy." Judging by the speeches of the Estonian defense minster and other representatives of the Baltic countries, the leaders of these states are trying to create an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust around Russia in a cold war spirit.
