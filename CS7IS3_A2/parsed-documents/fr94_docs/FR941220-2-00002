ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: GIPSA announces the designation of Minnesota Department of Agriculture to provide official inspection and Class X and Class Y weighing services under the United States Grain Standards Act, as amended (Act). EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1995. ADDRESSES: Janet M. Hart, Chief, Review Branch, Compliance Division, GIPSA, USDA, Room 1647 South Building, P.O. Box 96454, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6454. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Janet M. Hart, telephone 202&hyph;720&hyph;8525. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This action has been reviewed and determined not to be a rule or regulation as defined in Executive Order 12866 and Departmental Regulation 1512&hyph;1; therefore, the Executive Order and Departmental Regulation do not apply to this action. In the July 1, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 33950), GIPSA announced that the designation of Minnesota would expire on December 31, 1994, and asked persons interested in providing official services in the geographic area assigned to Minnesota to submit an application for designation. Applications were due by August 1, 1994. There were five applicants for the Minnesota area: Minnesota applied for the entire area currently assigned to them; Southern Minnesota Grain Inspection, Inc., applied for all or part of the Minnesota area; Mid-Iowa Grain Inspection, Inc., applied for the Minnesota counties of Fillmore, Houston, Olmsted, Winona, Wabasha, Goodhue, and Dakota, or any area inclusive of the city of Winona; D. R. Schaal Agency applied for all or any part of the Minnesota counties of Faribault, Freeborn, and Mower; and Sioux City Inspection and Weighing Service Company applied for the Minnesota counties of Murray, Nobles, Pipestone, and Rock. GIPSA requested comments on the applicants in the September 1, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 45295). Comments were due by September 30, 1994. GIPSA received 51 comments by the deadline. One comment was about two of the applicants. There were no comments on Mid-Iowa. There were 14 comments on Minnesota. Two grain firms currently served by Minnesota and one official grain inspection agency supported Minnesota. There also were 11 comments from various State government officials and groups representing State employees, all supporting Minnesota's redesignation. There were 3 comments on Schaal. Three grain firms, in the area Schaal applied for and currently served by Minnesota, submitted comments supporting Schaal. There were no comments on Sioux City. There were 29 comments on Southern Minnesota. Twenty-three grain firms in the area currently served by Minnesota and 6 non-grain businesses supported Southern Minnesota. Four trade organizations and 2 grain firms also submitted comments with no specific recommendations. These groups urge FGIS to carefully consider all options, with a special view towards the quality and cost of service, and ability to provide service in the State of Minnesota. GIPSA evaluated all available information regarding the designation criteria in Section 7(f)(1)(A) of the Act; and according to Section 7(f)(1)(B), determined that Minnesota is better able to provide official services in the geographic area for which they applied. Effective January 1, 1995, and ending December 31, 1997, Minnesota is designated to provide official inspection and Class X and Class Y weighing services in the geographic area specified in the July 1, 1994, Federal Register . Interested persons may obtain official services by contacting Minnesota at 612&hyph;341&hyph;7190. Authority: Pub. L. 94&hyph;582, 90 Stat. 2867, as amended (7 U.S.C. 71 et seq. ) Dated: December 13, 1994. Janet M. Hart, Acting Director, Compliance Division.
