This action by the British Hong Kong authorities reflects that the British side is determined to move along the road of confrontation with the Chinese side on the issue of Hong Kong. Moreover, it has moved even further down this path and has become even more bogged down. In May and June last year, as the representatives of the Chinese and British Governments were holding talks on the arrangements for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong, the British Hong Kong authorities continuously took unilateral actions, such as approving the "Draft Regulations on the Boundary and Election Committees" and supporting the Legco constitutional panel in discussing the gazetted bill comprising the Patten package in order to pursue the practice of "discussing while talking," which had been rejected by the Chinese side. Furthermore, despite the strong opposition of district board members, they merged into one the two district boards of Yaotsim and Mongkok. While the British Hong Kong authorities were interfering with the talks, the people raised a question: Why have the British Hong Kong authorities repeatedly placed obstacles before the Sino-British talks? Real intentions are revealed in the end, and the development of the situation has provided a definite answer to this question. Specifically, the British side has no sincerity toward the Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994-95 elections in Hong Kong and has no wish whatsoever to reach an agreement. Formerly, the two sides agreed through consultations that the representatives of the two governments would hold talks in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of converging with the Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and understandings reached between the two sides. Even from the White Paper on the "Representative Development in Hong Kong" published by the British Government, however, we can also see that the British side -- apart from admitting that there was identical views between China and Britain on the need to have 18 directly elected seats in the 1991 Legco elections -- "there was no agreement whatsoever" on the electoral arrangements for 1995. This ran counter to the agreements and understandings reached through the seven letters exchanged between the two foreign ministers in early 1990. The British side has agreed in word that the talks between the two sides should conform with the aforesaid "three principles." In fact, however, they have acted otherwise, thus depriving the talks of their basis. In rounds 15, 16, and 17 of the Sino-British talks, in an effort to speed up the process, the Chinese side made tremendous efforts to quickly solve the less difficult issues of the district board and municipal council elections in line with the principle of "solving the less contentious issues first." Just as the differences between the two sides on this issue were narrowing and the talks entered the stage of discussing the clauses for an agreement, the British side deliberately found a pretext to leave the negotiating table first. They also tabled a partial political system package at Legco for discussion, which led to the termination of the talks. In spite of this, the Chinese side continued to repeat: As long as the British side withdraws the partial package that has been tabled at Legco, the Chinese side will continue to hope to resume talks on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements and reach agreement on this issue. The British side willfully took a series of actions, however, such as approving the partial political system bill at Legco, making a unilateral decision on publishing the substance of the Sino-British talks, and deciding to table the rest of the Patten bill at Legco. Thus, it has shut the door to the resumption of the talks. Consequently, the responsibility of disrupting the talks lies squarely with the British side. Why has the British side stubbornly persisted in contravening the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of converging with the Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and understandings reached between the two sides? It is by no means in order to have an electoral arrangement that is "open, fair, and acceptable to the Hong Kong people," as advertised by the British side. The true objective of the British side is to take advantage of the remaining time of its administration in Hong Kong to make some electoral arrangements favorable to the British side so as to extend British political influence in Hong Kong beyond 1997. Britain's attempt will certainly come to naught. In his statement on the passage of Patten's partial political system bill by the British Hong Kong Legco, a spokesman for the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office put it very clearly: It is stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law that Britain's administration over Hong Kong will terminate on 30 June 1997, and the Chinese Government will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. In line with this provision, the last district boards, municipal councils, and Legco, as component parts of the Hong Kong political structure of the British administration, will terminate with the end of the British administration. As of 1 July 1997, the political structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be set up in accordance with the decisions of the National People's Congress and the relevant stipulations of the Basic Law. The historical trend of China's reunification is irresistible and the principle of "one country, two systems" will certainly be implemented in Hong Kong. Hong Kong, the "pearl of the Orient," will become even more resplendent after 1997.
