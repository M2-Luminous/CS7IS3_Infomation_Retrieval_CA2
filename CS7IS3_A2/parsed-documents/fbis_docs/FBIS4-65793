The President made this warning clear today in an address at a luncheon hosted by the Limassol Bar Association. The topic of his speech was on the latest developments in the Cyprus issue. Mr. Kliridhis stressed in his address that the Turkish side is trying to avoid the implementation of the confidence-building measures [CBM's], but without being condemned for its intransigence. He added the Turkish side is taking advantage of the delayed release of the UN secretary general's report to create the impression that it has accepted the 21 March document. By asking for clarifications for points of the document, the Turkish side is actually attempting to alter them, President Kliridhis stressed and then warned: [Kliridhis] I have told the United Nations and I say again that we abandoned certain stipulations that we wanted under the condition that the Turkish side would also accept the document as is. Any attempt to alter the 21 March document by Mr. Rauf Denktas or Turkey, would release us from our acceptance of it. Despite our reservations, for the sake of progress in the Cyprus issue, we accept the document as it is. [Khristofidhou] The president then called upon the United Nations to submit the report without any further delay and warned: [Kliridhis] I would also like to stress that we have both protested and stressed that these delaying tactics do not find us in agreement. They say they are not postponing it to see whether or not the Turkish side will accept it. I would like to inform them that we are not children, some of us have long familiarity with how the United Nations operates, and that we are not sure if this is so. For a while, it was true that the secretary general was away from his headquarters and he needs to approve the final form of the report, but I think this excuse no longer exists. I am not convinced that the report will be translated into various languages and I publicly call upon the United Nations to submit its report without any further delay as I have also called upon it in private. [Khristofidhou] Mr. Kliridhis further pointed out that the Cyprus issue has reached a crossroads which should make both the Greek Cypriot side and the Security Council ponder. The president stressed: The time has come for the Security Council to think of alternative ways of promoting a Cyprus solution, given the fact that the other side follows filibustering tactics. Referring to the significance of the European element, President Kliridhis said that we must convince Europe that only when Turkey realizes that talks on Cyprus' accession have begun will it then abandon any expansionist designs on Cyprus in that such designs could not be realized if Cyprus is a member of a united Europe. Referring to the Turkish policy, Mr. Kliridhis said that the Turkish side is not interested in a Cyprus solution but in a period of avoiding a solution and also perpetuating the problem with the aim of having the pseudostate recognized or, at a later stage, the recognition of a federation. President Kliridhis also added in his speech that we are not seeing light at the end of the tunnel of the Cyprus problem due to the lack of political will by the Turkish side. He stressed: It is necessary for the Security Council to adopt the appropriate measures which would create the prerequisites for the Turkish side to acquire political will.
