The statement says: "The mass media has reported with references to diplomatic sources that considered at present `is the possibility of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Ukraine' and that `the problem of the Black Sea Navy could be discussed at a possible meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents'." In connection with this, Kostikov explained that "Boris Yeltsin regards the situation in quite another sequence. Yeltsin's visit to Ukraine is not on the president's immediate agenda. Yeltsin believes it is first necessary to resolve the Black Sea Navy problem proceeding from the fundamental agreement on separate naval bases. After this problem is settled and a political climate of trust and dependability is created, it is necessary to draw up a full-scale treaty, which is to open up prospects for the Russian president's visit to Kiev," says the statement of the presidential press secretary.
