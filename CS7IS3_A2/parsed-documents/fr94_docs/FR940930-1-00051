FR940930-1-00051 FR940930-1-00016 Supplementing this authority in the area of alternatively fueled vehicle safety, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires that NHTSA must ``within three years after enactment promulgate rules setting forth safety standards in accordance with [the agency's statutory authority] applicable to all conversions.'' In addition, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 include a provision that NHTSA promulgate necessary rules regarding the safety of vehicles converted to run on clean fuels. NHTSA wishes to assure the safe introduction of EVs and other alternatively fueled vehicles to the market without impeding technology development. II. Background On December 27, 1991, the agency published in the Federal Register an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) on EV safety (56 FR 67038). The purpose of the notice was to help NHTSA determine what existing FMVSSs may need modification to better accommodate the unique technology of EVs, and what new safety standards may need to be written to assure their safe introduction. The ANPRM requested comments on a broad range of potential EV safety issues including battery electrolyte spillage and electric shock hazard, and elicited widespread public interest. A total of 46 comments were received. After reviewing all of the comments and information received in response to the ANPRM, NHTSA concluded in a November 18, 1992 notice (57 FR 54354) that it was premature to initiate rulemaking for new EV safety standards at that time. In the areas of battery electrolyte spillage and electric shock hazard in a crash, the agency concluded that further research was needed. In 1993 NHTSA conducted research and testing on two converted EVs. The vehicles were tested relative to several FMVSSs, including a crash test in accordance with FMVSS No. 208, Occupant Crash Protection. The two vehicles were equipped with lead-acid batteries located in the front and rear (engine and luggage compartments). One vehicle was equipped with twelve 12-volt batteries (five in the front and seven in the rear). The second vehicle was equipped with ten 12-volt batteries (four in the front and six in the rear). The tests involved frontal crashes into a fixed barrier at 48 kilometers per hour (kph). In both crashes the front batteries sustained significant damage, spilling large quantities of electrolyte. On one vehicle 10.4 liters of electrolyte spilled from the front batteries as a result of the crash. On the other vehicle 17.7 liters of electrolyte spilled from the front batteries. In addition, several electrical arcs were observed under the hood of one vehicle during the crash. Based on the results of this research and the increasing interest in using EVs to meet clean air requirements, the agency has decided to reexamine through this notice the safety issues involving EV battery electrolyte spillage and electric shock hazard. NHTSA notes that the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) through its various committees is also exploring possible voluntary industry standards and guidelines in these two areas. The agency wishes to identify the magnitude of the potential safety hazards involved, as well as possible solutions for both original equipment EVs and EV conversions. With respect to conversions, NHTSA's statutory authority distinguishes between two populations of vehicle conversions. The distinction is based on whether the vehicle is converted before or after the first sale to the ultimate consumer. When a vehicle is converted to an alternative fuel before the first sale to the ultimate consumer, the converter is in the same position as an original vehicle manufacturer. The converter must certify that the vehicle still complies with all applicable FMVSSs, including any fuel system integrity standards applicable to the alternative fuel. For example, if a converter before the first sale converted a gasoline powered vehicle to an EV, and if NHTSA has promulgated an electrolyte spillage standard applicable to that model year EV, the converter would need to certify that, among other requirements, the vehicle complied with the electrolyte spillage requirements. In the case of a noncompliance, the manufacturer or converter must recall and remedy the noncompliant vehicles by repair or replacement; in addition, NHTSA has the authority to impose a civil penalty of $1000 per violation up to a maximum of $800,000.
