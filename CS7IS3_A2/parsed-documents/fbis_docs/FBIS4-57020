In order to join the OECD, which includes the world's most developed nations, Mexico will no longer be in the so-called Group of 100, in other words the Nonaligned Movement, in which Mexico participated as an observer. Mexico is no longer in that group. Senator Porfirio Munoz Ledo participated in today's debates. Of course, he was not very pleased and said that Mexico is now a poor country within an organization of rich nations. [Begin Munoz Ledo recording] We have resigned what, on many occasions, has been described as leadership, which in fact was Mexico's recognized historical moral authority over developing nations to become the poor relatives of an organization with which we have no historical links. I will not mention the case of Turkey, out of our respect and friendship toward that sovereign nation. [end recording] Munoz Ledo stressed that Mexico's withdrawal from the Nonaligned Movement at this time will be very costly. Senator Jesus Rodriguez y Rodriguez, president of the Finance Commission, reacted to Munoz Ledo's statement. He described Munoz Ledo as an archaic politician who has remained in the seventies and who never sees anything positive when the country takes a step forward. He said that by entering the group of developed nations, Mexico seeks to be in a better position for international competition. [Begin Rodriguez y Rodriguez recording] I did not hear any good arguments from him. I only heard miserable and pathetic expressions. Although his words may have some impact, I want to hear arguments. I would like to say that I am afraid that as in the case of the legendary Rip van Winkle, the opposition senator has remained in the past, he has remained in the decade of the seventies. He moved into the eighties with some difficulty because his personal participation was necessary, but the truth is that he continues talking about a world and an economy.... [pauses] first he talks about the postwar period and then about [word indistinct]. The reconstruction of Europe is way back in history. [end recording] Senator Rodriguez y Rodriguez said Mexico's entrance into the OECD is a fundamental step toward achieving the development for which we are striving.
