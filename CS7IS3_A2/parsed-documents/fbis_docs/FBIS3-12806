According to the sources, Peres will try to convince 'Arafat to immediately resume the peace talks. Last Friday Peres conveyed a message to 'Arafat via Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. Foreign Minister Peres urged the PLO chairman to immediately resume the negotiations and offered him a "package of steps" Israel is willing to implement. Among these steps are accelerating the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho in an attempt to complete it by 13 April, granting the Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho immediate authority and increasing the size of this police force, and deploying international observers in Gaza and Jericho. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 6 March broadcasts a report by political correspondent Udi Segal on the proposed Israeli steps, adding that "Foreign Minister Peres says that in addition to the above proposals, Israel will agree to discuss additional demands and has some more proposals of its own. He emphasized, however, that Israel will not agree to illogical demands such as the dismantling of settlements and disarming all the settlers." In recorded remarks, Peres says: "We distinguish between useful and senseless demands. We will examine every demand and will not oppose anything which can help calm tempers and facilitate the peace process." Asked to elaborate, Peres adds: "We will not oppose strengthening the Palestinian police force. Also, when there is a curfew in an Arab village we will object to armed settlers entering it and other things of this nature."] Peres told Papoulias it is possible to complete the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho within three to four weeks. Prime Minister Rabin told the Greek foreign minister, on the other hand, that between three to four weeks will be required for finalizing and signing the agreement with the PLO, whereas the implementation of the agreement will require six more weeks. According to Israeli political sources the U.S. Administration has made it clear to the PLO -- via meetings between senior State Department officials and Nabil Sha'th -- that the United States has no intention of getting actively involved in the negotiations. According to reports which have reached Jerusalem, the Americans told Sha'th -- who demanded that settlements such as Netzarim and the Jewish settlement in Hebron be dismantled -- that they will accept "whatever you conclude with Israel." The PLO has sent its delegates to an agricultural conference in Cordova, Spain, attended by regional experts in the framework of the multilateral peace talks. Aside from the Palestinians and Israelis, representatives of Arab countries participating in the multilateral talks also attended the meeting. Israeli sources last week expressed the fear that the delay in the bilateral talks would also suspend the multilateral talks. [passage omitted]
