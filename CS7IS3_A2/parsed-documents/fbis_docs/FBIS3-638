The students demanded to be paid before the end Sunday of the holy Muslim fast month of Ramadan. They burned tyres and tree branches blocking access to the only bridge linking the banks of the Niger River which divides the capital, Niamey. Police cleared several barricades making traffic possible at parts of the city. Three demonstrators were wounded, the executive secretary of the Union of Niger Students at Niamey University, an affiliate of the Niger Students Union [USN], Ousmane Abdrahmane, said.

In that incident the government put the number of people wounded at 39. The demonstrators were also protesting against the non-payment of their grant. [Dakar PANA in French at 1032 GMT on 11 March, in a Niamey-datelined item, adds: "A Niamey University student died early this morning from wounds received yesterday during clashes between antiriot police and activists of the radical USN."]
