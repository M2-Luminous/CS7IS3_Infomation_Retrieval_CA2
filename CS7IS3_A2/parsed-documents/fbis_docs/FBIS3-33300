During a news conference, Yoshiyama added: "The opposition is seeking to politicize the case by involving a general who has been very successful in the battle against terrorism in incidents in which he did not participate. Frankly, they are very mistaken in regard to Gen. Hermoza." Yoshiyama, who by law is the vice president of the Republic but who does not perform the duties of the office, said the opposition is also attempting to involve high-ranking Army and intelligence officers in this case. The CCD president also rejected statements being made by many people, including Catholic Church Bishop Augusto Vargas Alzamora, for military justice to impose the harshest punishment possible on those guilty of the disappearance and deaths of nine La Cantuta students and one professor. "I believe a 20-year sentence for the guilty parties, as requested by the military prosecutor, is a drastic and severe sentence," the president of the CCD stressed. The military prosecutor believes that six soldiers participated in the incident, and the punishment requested for them is between 15 and 20 years in prison each. The sentences requested for the other five soldiers, who are all charged with negligence, range from 30 days to five years in prison. Since April 1993, the Peruvian opposition has been demanding "Hermoza's resignation so that justice can be meted out freely, because, as commander of the Armed Forces, the soldiers involved in La Cantuta case were under his command." Likewise, the opposition has also reiterated the charge made by Gen. Rodolfo Robles, who is currently in exile in Argentina. Gen. Robles has said "Gen. Hermoza is harboring" the death squad that carried out the killings at La Cantuta University in July 1992.
