What is the opinion of Jozsef Kaproczay, parliamentary representative from Szigetvar? [Kaproczay] Before answering this question, I have to tell you that my electoral district includes 71 local governments and 85 topographically distinct areas. There are numerous very small settlements, with 50 villages having fewer than 500 inhabitants. Szigetvar's three large enterprises--the canning and shoe factories, and the state farm--are in an unbelievably difficult situation; I mention this because of the unemployment situation that has developed, which obviously has an impact on the so-called agglomerated districts as well as on agricultural production. In spite of this, as I go around among my electors, I have the feeling--and I am trying to formulate this cautiously--that we have moved from the low point of unpopularity. [Nagy] What do you think is the reason for this? [Kaproczay] Perhaps first is the farmers' circles movement, which is increasingly "on solid ground." Thank God, in our area during the past few months such farmers' circles have been formed in five or six settlements. The preferential machinery-purchasing drive also has had a very good effect on the people who live in villages, especially in South Baranya county, where conditions are more favorable for agriculture. I should note, however, that as far as I know, this drive has 2 billion forints at its disposal; it would be a very great mistake if it would not be possible to continually "replenish" this sum. It would cause tremendous disappointment. Thus I can say unequivocally that something has started to move. At the same time, I must emphasize that people are interested in knowing what is going on and they are starting to notice that many things have happened in this country during the past four years. [Nagy] Do you think the media had a role in this? [Kaproczay] Undoubtedly, although this is precisely what prominent members of the opposition parties object to. I personally object strenuously to the suggestion that this is similar to the rosy propaganda of the last part of the Kadar era.
