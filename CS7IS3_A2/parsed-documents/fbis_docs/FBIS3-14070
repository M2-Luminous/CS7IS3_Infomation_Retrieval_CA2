To avenge the continuing Zionist crimes in Palestine; in reply to the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre; to vindicate the souls of our people's martyrs; to confirm that direct clashes with enemy troops are the way to defeat the occupation troops and the Zionist expansionist scheme; because the heroic mujahidin and revolutionaries believe armed struggle is the only possible way to liberate Palestine and other occupied Arab territories and defeat the liquidatory plan promoted by the Tunis-headquartered PLO leadership as enshrined in the Gaza-Jericho accord; and to expose the resolutions of the UN Security Council, which has turned into a pliable tool in the hands of the United States and the Zionist enemy, one of our units operating behind enemy lines laid an ambush for enemy patrols in the al-'Ayshiyah-al-Rayhan mountainous area. At 1200 on Monday, 21 March 1994, our heroic fighters opened fire on a Zionist patrol. As usual, the enemy attempted to underestimate its losses. However, it later admitted that two of its soldiers were killed. In view of the immense losses sustained by the enemy, the Zionist aggression troops, in cooperation with the agent Lahd troops, poured their terrorist firepower on the heads of Lebanese and Palestinian civilians, targeting schools, markets, and residential neighborhoods. While underscoring the importance of stepping up armed struggle, and while persisting with this jihad course, we, in the PFLP-GC [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command], believe the best reply to the enemy's massacres; that is, protecting our people against its terrorism, is only achievable when the fire of the blessed intifadah is fuelled, and when the course of jihad and armed struggle is nurtured. We would like to address the following questions to all those engaged in bargaining: What do you call the current shelling and killing of civilians? Is not the shelling of al-Nabatiyah, Sidon, and 'Ayn al-Hulwah the epitome of terrorism? Our open war against the Zionist enemy and the mujahidin attacks are the resistance approach our people have chosen as a way to liberate land and man. We will apprise you of any new developments or details. It is a revolution until the liberation of land and man. [Signed] The PFLP-GC [Dated] 22 March 1994
