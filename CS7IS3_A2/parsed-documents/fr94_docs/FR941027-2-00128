FR941027-2-00128 FR941027-2-00077 supplementary information: Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity''should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender, ethnicity, religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are stongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle. Overview: The purpose of this program is to link a network of U.S. secondary schools with a network of schools in one or more NIS countries to serve as the basis for exchanges of Educators and Students during the academic year. The USIA's main objective is to foster interaction between American and foreign participants. Proposals should demonstrate how participants will interact in a way which encourages the exchange of ideas and promotes mutual understanding in both the short- and long-term. The linkages between networks of secondary schools in the U.S. with networks of schools in the NIS must occur through at least three main program components: (1) the Exchange of secondary school educators between the U.S. and participating NIS countries; (2) the exchange of secondary school students, and 14 to 17 years of age, between the U.S. and participating NIS countries; and, (3) the establishment of institution-building ties between the schools in the networks. Guidelines : This solicitation is for two separate models of multiple secondary school linkages between networks of schools. Applicants must submit a proposal for only one of the two models. The proposal should state clearly which model is being used. In both models, each network, one in the U.S. and one in the NIS, should consist of a minimum of three schools. Model A is designed to enhance and expand existing linkages between a network of U.S. secondary schools and a network of secondary schools in one or more of the countries listed above. USIA funding may not be used to supplant existing private sector funding. Applicants must indicate how activities have been funded in the past and how the activities will be expanded with assistance from USIA. The U.S. recipient of the grant is responsible for recruiting/selecting/organizing a minimum of three U.S. secondary schools to form the U.S. network, strengthening an existing working relationship with an organization or agency of government in the NIS responsible for a network of schools there, and linking the two networks through three main components of the program: Educator exchange, Student exchange, and Institution-building links. Model B is designed to encourage the development of new links whereby the U.S. network that does not have existing links to secondary schools in the NIS will be matched with an NIS network chosen by USIA. Proposals must rank-order participating NIS countries where the applicant would like to establish linkages. The U.S. recipient of the grant is responsible for recruiting/selecting/organizing a network composed of a minimum of three U.S. secondary schools, agreeing to form partnership with a NIS network selected by USIA, and linking the two networks through three main components of the program: Educator exchange, Student exchange, and Institution-building links. In some special cases, applicants who are involved in existing linkage activity may request that USIA select new schools and networks in the NIS for a proposed expanded linkage. In this case, the applicant should rank-order the preferred countries to be considered for linkage. Depending on availability of suitable matches, USIA will select the NIS network or school and inform applicant of the match. For both Model A and Model B, the U.S. recipient of the grant will: Design the overall plan which integrates the three components of the linkage, manage all travel arrangements, logistics, passports, visas, etc., provide competent and informed escorts for student groups, and distribute and account for grant funds. Proposals must address other essential operations of the program including the incorporation of a feasible plan to establish communication (through computer linkages and other forms of correspondence) and the formation of a solid working relationship between the partner schools before the student groups arrive in the host country. Recipients of the assistance award are responsible for ensuring the selection of exchange participants who are suitable for the program. Participants (both Educators and Students) from the U.S. and the NIS countries should represent a broad array of backgrounds to give greater understanding to the culture and society as a whole. Selection of individual participants from the U.S. and the NIS in the exchange components of the program must be merit based; the proposal should describe the mechanisms used for participant selection. Partnerships should have an existence beyond the scope of this initiative; that is, there should be an inherent reason for their linkage apart from the availability of grant funds. Competitive proposals demonstrate this linkage and the types of activities (follow-on) that will continue after the grant has expired.
