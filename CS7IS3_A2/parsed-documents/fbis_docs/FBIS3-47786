Shunji Yanai, who headed a Japanese survey team to the former Yugoslavia, told a press conference the ministry has to study various requests made during the mission's trip to decide what kind of contributions Japan can make. The ministry will then ask for a judgment from the foreign minister, the chief cabinet secretary and the prime minister, Yanai said, adding that there have not been any "specific instructions" from them. Yanai, director general of the ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, said Tokyo has to study the legal aspects of whether it is possible to send unarmed military observers to Macedonia as requested by the commander of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Macedonia last week. Yanai said he did not immediately respond when Brig. Gen. Saermark Thomsen [name as received] made the request in person. Yanai's remarks followed comments by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura earlier in the day that Japan does not intend to dispatch Self-Defense Forces (SDF) personnel to join U.N. peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia. Takemura told a press conference he had instructed Yanai to "respond with discretion so as not to cause misunderstanding." On Sunday, Yanai said in Budapest after wrapping up his nine-day survey mission that it is "worth considering" Thomsen's request and that Japan could send peacekeepers to Macedonia if the nation agreed to the dispatch since no military conflict has broken out there. Japan's law on U.N. peacekeeping cooperation bans any deployment of peacekeepers in a nation that rejects them. Yanai explained at Wednesday's press conference that he was pressed to present his personal view in Budapest. He also said Yasushi Akashi, head of the UNPROFOR, has asked Japan to participate in consultations among major countries at the UNPROFOR headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia, to discuss problems in the region. Akashi reportedly said he wants to set up a consultation system because such a system was effective in U.N. Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) activities. In Cambodia, permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Indonesia, Japan, Australia and ambassadors of other nations in Phnom Penh held talks whenever problems occurred, Akashi was quoted as saying. Akashi said he wants Japan to participate in the proposed consultation system because it is not directly participating in UNPROFOR activities and because it is in a position to consult on problems of great international interest, according to Yanai. Yanai also said that during his trip, officials of Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia strongly called for strengthening ties with Japan at both the government and private sector levels. Macedonia also asked for economic assistance and cooperation to solve its debt problem, he said. International organizations engaging in humanitarian activities in the former Yugoslavia cited the lack of facilities to accommodate refugees and also medical and other goods, he said. In a related move the same day, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said Japan has appointed a Foreign Ministry official as political officer to assist Akashi, as part of Japan's contributions there. Tomiko Ichikawa, assistant director of the U.N. Administration Division in the ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, is the first woman among five Japanese political officers dispatched in connection with U.N. peacekeeping operations.
