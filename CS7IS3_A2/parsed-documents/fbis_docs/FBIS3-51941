[Vigil] Absolutely not. We will continue to talk with all groups. We will always be willing to debate, discuss, and hear their opinion on the communique. We are always willing to participate in discussions. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] stop the strike decreed by the transportation commissions [words indistinct] since Monday? [Vigil] We believe the measures are quite beneficial for the transportation sector and the general public. That includes the production sector, which will also enjoy the benefits. We do not think there is any reason to continue the stoppage. We are giving an overall solution, a clear and positive solution, to members of the transportation sector, the people in general, and all groups that have not supported the stoppage to achieve peace and help the economic reactivation. Thus the growth process we began in January will not be obstructed by a situation that might be extremely dangerous. That is why we have decided to solve many of the problems discussed during the preliminary meetings, and the solutions are included in this document. [Reporter] The communique and the talks you held have [words indistinct] official communique. [Vigil] In most cases, yes. [Reporter] When will the [words indistinct]? [Vigil] The measures taken by the Nicaraguan Government are intended to guarantee peace for the citizens and to overcome the impasse once and for, because it has cost the government between 7 and 8 million cordobas. We will recover the sum with better tax collection, meaning by increasing the efficiency of the administration. There will not be any new taxes. This must be quite clear from the beginning. We will make tax collection more efficient to create the revenues outlined in the budget, which was submitted to the National Assembly. [Reporter] [Question indistinct] [Vigil] We can try. The next agreement will be based on established policies and current prices at the international level. [Reporter] What happens [words indistinct] if the strike continues and the [words indistinct]. What will the government do tomorrow? [Vigil] Minister Mendieta will answer that question. [Mendieta] First it is important to emphasize the government's efforts to find a negotiated solution to the transportation sector's problems. As the communique stated, it has been practically impossible to get these organizations together and find a joint solution. We believe the Government Ministry is capable of guaranteeing, through the National Police, the free circulation of people and vehicles throughout the national territory. We have deployed Police, Special Disarmament Brigades, and Special Riot Police forces to guarantee this free circulation. We have also deployed special units to clear areas where people have tried to close the streets. This has already been done. You can confirm that this has been permanently guaranteed throughout Managua despite threats that traffic would be obstructed. Moreover, we want to point out that anyone who endorses a strike or an illegal stoppage will be punished according to the law. We want to state that all vehicles used to obstruct traffic and free circulation will be fined. Consequently, we think the measures taken today by the government should be sufficient to encourage people to set aside their current attitude. Nevertheless, we believe some people may still be trying to find pretexts for continuing their actions, but they will no longer be considered a result of the transportation sector problem. We would have to investigate those persons' plans. We believe these measures are a clear answer to the proposals presented by the transportation sector. They will solve most of the problems we have discussed, and above all, they will guarantee peace for the citizens, as Minister Vigil said. We hope there are no more situations of this kind. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] would you explain how will you manage to [words indistinct]? [Vigil] We created the Temporary Transportation Council [Consejo Temporal del Transporte], but because some of the federations objected to the legal formation of this council, we decided to form a commission made up of all sectors that wish to participate so they, the sector representatives, can work with us to draft the new law that will be presented to the National Assembly. We do not want to draft that bill unilaterally. In fact, there is a pledge for an agreement, and the National Assembly president thinks it is very important for the Assembly transportation, energy, and communication commission to participate in drafting this new law. [Reporter] There has been some discontent with bonds [words indistinct]. [Vigil] The bond process went very smoothly. In some minor cases the cooperatives did not provide the proper cooperation, and the lists needed to clearly define the number of members were not received on time. We must remember that many times there is a certain fluidity within the transportation cooperatives, with members moving from one cooperative to another, or one person resigning and another one joining. In December we established an effective system with the Finance Ministry to deal with this. We think we can improve it even further, with help from the cooperatives, to ensure that each member receives his corresponding coupons. [Reporter] The organizations have said that they will meet with you again tomorrow. Will you accept? [Vigil] The organizations that were here and that left late without reaching any agreement have been informed of this document. They are studying it, and we will meet with them tomorrow.
