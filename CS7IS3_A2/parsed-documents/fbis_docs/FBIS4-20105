[Juppe] We have enforced our principles in Sarajevo, and we are enforcing them in Gorazde, because the goal which we had when we approved the resolution of the Security Council and the decision of the Atlantic Alliance has been reached now in Gorazde. [Snow] The problem is, isn't it, that the Serbs, although they may have stopped shelling Gorazde now and are pulling their heavy weapons out, they're still there, their infantry isn't pulling back. Doesn't mean that Gorazde is effectively neutralized? [Juppe] I don't think so. Sarajevo is not neutralized, life is coming again in Sarajevo. And we have the same target in Gorazde and it's only a first step of course, because the solution will be diplomatic and political and not military. We must have a cease-fire, then a cessation of hostilities, then a withdrawal of troops, and then a political settlement. And the withdrawal, the final withdrawal of Serb troops, will take place only when we have a political and global settlement in Bosnia, of course. [Snow] Are you confident, Foreign Minister, that you can get the Serbs not just to stop where they are, not just to cease fire, but to withdraw from where they are? [Juppe] The Serbs have accepted the percentage of the territory of Bosnia of about 50 percent, so they must withdraw by about 20 percent, according to their presence at the moment on the ground. So that's the target.
