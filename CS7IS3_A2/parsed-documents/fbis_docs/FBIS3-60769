Police said the explosions, which occured almost simultaneously at about 6:20 p.m. (1020 GMT), caused pandemonium among some 3,000 Roman Catholic church-goers present. Some of those hurt were injured in the stampede. A fourth explosive device was found beside a pew near the altar and was detonated by bomb experts. Davao police chief Superintendent Rogelio Abaday said that four people were killed, including 15-year-old Rachel Lu who died on the spot, and that 119 others were wounded, many seriously. He declined to comment on the suspects or any possible motive. Restituta Plete, a candle vendor, told AFP said she was standing with her father and husband, Roberto, on the cathedral steps when they heard the explosion and saw a blinding flash of light. Plete and her husband were wounded but her father, 51-year-old Thomas Juliano, was killed. Tears welling in her eyes, she said doctors told her that her husband's feet might have to be amputated. "I don't know what I will do now. We don't have any money. I'm appealing for help," Plete, in a local hospital, said. Police said two of the explosions were apparently caused by homemade bombs and were attempting to verify witness reports that the third blast was caused by a grenade hurled by a youth who then fled. The first bomb exploded five rows from the altar, the second near the parking lot at the rear. The third, believed to be the grenade, exploded in a middle row of the church. "I was seated on the third pew from the altar when I heard a loud explosion," Sarah Sapun, 27, said from her hospital bed. "Immediately we ducked for cover. My husband covered me and my four-year-old son." Her husband was also wounded. "I am grieving over what happened," said a shocked Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, still clutching a child's slipper he had picked up. In the blasts' aftermath debris such as bags, slippers, shoes and seats littered the church and outside. Residents living near the downtown cathedral, which is near police headquarters, also panicked. Some clambered atop passing mini-buses to get away from the scene while others ran for safety or sought cover. Abaday ordered stepped-up police patrols in the city and all exits were sealed to prevent the suspects from escaping a police dragnet.
