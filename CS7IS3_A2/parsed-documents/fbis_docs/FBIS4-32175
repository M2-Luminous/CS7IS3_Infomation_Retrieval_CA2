In its statement adopted yesterday and given to CTK today, the MKDH said it had confirmed the powers of a commission to represent it in talks on the coalition of three. The MKDH and Egyutteles have a total of 14 out of a total of 150 parliamentary seats. The MOS is an extra-parliamentary party. Early parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place on September 30-October 1. About 560,000 (11 per cent of Slovakia's population) ethnic Hungarians live in Slovakia. The idea to form a coalition of three, which is promoted particularly by the MKDH, has not met with much support from Egyutteles, which would prefer a coalition of four, including the Hungarian People's Party (MLS, extra-parliamentary). But with the elections drawing near, the movement is ready to discuss the "close coalition." Miklos Duray, Egyutteles chairman, told CTK recently that the "fundamental conditions" for the formation of such a Hungarian parties' coalition are: creation of a joint group once they are represented in parliament, common policy in local elections along with common slates in mayoral elections, and a common line on Slovakia's foreign policy. According to a June poll carried out by the Statistical Office, the present MKDH-Egyutteles coalition would be supported by 8 per cent of voters. The parliamentary border is 5 per cent.
