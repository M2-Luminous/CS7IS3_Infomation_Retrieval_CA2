FBIS4-56810 "drlat090_f_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-090 Daily Report 7 May 1994 El Salvador Onusal Reports Improvement in Human Rights Onusal Reports Improvement in Human Rights PA1005043094 San Salvador EL DIARIO DE HOY in Spanish 7 May 94 p 47 PA1005043094 San Salvador EL DIARIO DE HOY Spanish BFN [Text] In his 10th report to the UN secretary general, Diego Garcia-Sagan, director of the Human Rights Division of Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] noted "a slight improvement" in the human rights situation, compared to the critical problems noted in recent months. Nevertheless, Garcia-Sayan revealed that arbitrary executions and threats of arbitrary execution still represent the largest number of reports received by Onusal. Between November 1993 and February 1994, the Human Rights Division received 35 reports of arbitrary executions and 12 threats of arbitrary execution. Onusal does not rule out political motives in some of these cases. Regarding the death of Francisco Garcia Veliz, leader of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front], the report says that investigations have not progressed enough and that they apparently have reached "a stalemate" as a result of limited sources of information. Velis' autopsy revealed that he was a drug addict, so no one knows who would benefit from the crime. Garcia-Sayan said Onusal's Human Rights Division is continuing its investigation and does not rule out any hypothesis, "even though a political motive seems most probable." Likewise, he says that "the police's inability to capture the culprits and the Judicial Branch's inability to prosecute them still represent the basic reason for the high percentage of rights violations, particularly with the status of impunity, which is still very critical." Garcia-Sayan said the various organized groups of criminals who operate in the country comprise former Armed Forces members and former FMLN fighters. Referring to the violent actions carried out by these groups, he said that they possibly involve crimes resulting from "a settling of accounts" with "private" political components and that this could be a result of the war. The number of death threat reports received by Onusal rose to 77, which is the highest registered level in 1993 and 1994. Some of the cases were a result of the electoral process. The report adds that the Judicial Branch and the National Police are still the institutions most frequently mentioned by Onusal as responsible for human rights violations in the country. Other reports received during that period involve mistreatment and the state's legal duty to investigate and prosecute.
