This was stated by CIA Director James Woolsey. Judging from Woolsey's statements, it is not a question of ordinary Americans, but of staffers at various government departments. Journalists are assuming that these departments include the State Department, Congress, the Pentagon, and the White House, where, according to U.S. sources, there was a Soviet "mole" throughout the James Carter presidency. The CIA director added that both retired and active government officials are under investigation. Some people believe that most of the pointers may have come from Germany -- as a result of access to the archives of the former East German intelligence. It is not ruled out that CIA and FBI investigators were also able to make Ames talk -- he is currently doing a deal with the authorities in an attempt to reduce the sentence facing his wife, who is also charged with espionage. Although, on the other hand, Ames could hardly have had access to information about who else among his colleagues might have been recruited by intelligence services behind the Iron Curtain. This is partly confirmed by the CIA director, who stated that Ames did not play a decisive role in exposing other spies in different government departments. The most important catch so far has been an as-yet-unnamed staffer from the Carter White House. Under Carter U.S. intelligence organs -- and particularly the CIA -- were demoralized as a result of the decision by the then president and the the CIA director to considerably cut back the intelligence apparatus. As can be imagined, this situation could not fail to make it easier to recruit people from the intelligence organs themselves and from government structures directly involved in or monitoring intelligence work.
