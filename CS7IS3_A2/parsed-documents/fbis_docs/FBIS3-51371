Minister of Government German Quiroga has denied this possibility. [Begin Quiroga recording] Hugo San Martin, a national government secretary was sent to Santa Cruz. He spent 15, 16, and 17 January looking for these alleged safe houses together with the local prefect. They found none. They found places where the Special Antinarcotics Forces [FELCN] and DEA work, but they found no safe houses. [end recording] The minister of government has asked Deputy Justiniano to provide the address of these safe houses. [Begin Justiniano recording] Here is the proof. The newspaper HOY found a safe house in Santa Cruz. Here is the full address; 240 Rene Moreno Street, opposite Blacutt Square. The house belongs to Mrs. Pura Bowles de Fernandez. This was verified by national and Santa Cruz press sources. Journalists visited this house and confirmed this. What other evidence do you want? I am not a policeman. It is the duty of the Interior Ministry to make pertinent investigations. If they do not know about this, they are either accomplices or foolish. [end recording] Minister Quiroga nonetheless insists that safe houses do not exist because even U.S. Ambassador Bowers has assured him of this. [Begin Quiroga recording] I have spoken with the U.S. Ambassador to express the Bolivian Government's concern over this subject and he has assured me that such charges are not true. Neither the DEA nor the U.S. Embassy acknowledge the existence of this kind of safe houses in the country. [end recording] The minister of government reported that he asked Deputy Justiniano to join the delegation that went to investigate the existence of these safe houses but that he did not want to accompany the group.
