As for the world position of the Republic of Croatia, over the last few weeks the president of the Republic personally and the government and our diplomats have been totally preoccupied with, and have spent most energy in, putting in order relations with neighboring countries. Relations with neighbors are always seen as the first criterion that the international community uses to assess the policy in general, the level of its democratic development, and the level of civilization in a country. In the case of young countries and democracies such as Croatia, the world relies on the nature of their relations with their neighbors to assess the level of their maturity and their capability to join integrational process on a wider scale. In addition, when outlining the strategic attributes of our foreign policy, we placed our relations with neighbors at the very top. Namely, we cannot enter Europe over the heads of our neighbors. We made efforts of differing intensity and at different times but with the same amount of dedication to normalize -- in some cases to remove the initial and in some the old obstacles on the road towards full normalization of relations with the countries in our immediate and near neighborhood: with Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia, Montenegro, with Slovenia, with Italy, and even with Macedonia. We can proudly say that in relations with some of our neighbors, we no longer need to put anything in order but only try and advance them. I refer here to Hungary and Austria. However, I firmly believe that one day we shall come before this chamber to talk only about further improvements in goodneighborly relations of the democratic, sovereign, and integrated republic of Croatia, which we aspire towards and which is our prime goal. In any case, all we did in the preceding period was governed by this goal. However, it should be stressed that at the same time we have made and will continue to make considerable efforts to bring forward the date when Croatia will join many of the European and world processes. The president of the Republic, Dr Franjo Tudjman, headed our state delegations at negotiations in Bonn, Brussels, and Geneva. In addition, he met a large number of world statesmen. In Zagreb he had meetings with a member of the U.S. Government, Ambassador Madeleine Albright, former French president Valerie Giscard d'Estaing and the cochairmen of the international conference. I have just returned from a visit to the Council of Europe -- that inevitable and decisive stop on the road to functional integration in the European Union. Prime Minister Valentic and I talked with the Slovenes in Ljubljana yesterday. I had a very successful visit to Bulgaria, I will be meeting Italian Foreign Minister Benjamino Andreatta in Rome at the beginning of February. We plan to initiate a procedure geared towards joining the process known as Partnership for Peace under the auspices of NATO and we are conducting bilateral talks within the framework of the CSCE on regional security arrangements both in the Mediterranean and in this part of Europe. The normalization of relations with our neighbors, regional security arrangements, participation in the Partnership for Peace and membership in the European Union and NATO itself -- with an active role in economic arrangements -- this is part of the network of the continuous activities and logical objectives of Croatia's foreign policy. The realization of these objectives perfectly, clearly, and permanently determines the position of the sovereign, unified, and integral Republic of Croatia in Europe and the world. It occasionally happens in this process that our efforts are not in proportion to the results just as it happens that a positive result can be reached unexpectedly owing to a favorable alignment of circumstances. However, this is also a process where even the longest journeys begin with a first step in which politics are an art of the possible but in which the essence and objective are always clearly defined and unmistakably in the interest of the Croatian state, the Croatian nation, and all citizens of the Republic of Croatia. In this respect, most of the attention of the Croatian and foreign public over the past couple of days was focused on the joint [Serbian-Croatian] declaration signed in Geneva on 20 January. Before this, an equal degree of attention was commanded by our negotiations with the Muslim side. Both talks were conducted within the framework of the international conference as well as through numerous bilateral channels and mediatory efforts. The talks have a continuity, sometimes they are mutually interdependent and they are also known to have affected the development of events in the UN Protected Areas. We should reiterate this clearly: Croatia is not conducting talks with anybody to the detriment of a third, absent party. Ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to Croatia, the goal of both negotiations is the normalization of Croatian-Serb relations and interstate relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the permanent resolution of overall Croatian-Muslim relations. We entered these talks guided by the principles of our peace-loving policy and obligations stemming from our participation in the international peace conference. But at every moment we were deeply aware that the war of aggression within the Greater Serbia project is the main reason for and the only real source of the crisis and all the indescribable suffering both in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Hence, at that time we gave priority to our relations with the Muslims, while we have achieved considerable and important results in out relations with the Serbian side. However, it is beyond any doubt and it comes as proof of our priorities that we offered much more to the Muslim side and are still offering it under certain conditions: a treaty on the establishment of a permanent and global peace between the Croat and the Bosnian Muslim nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the foundations of their coexistence. Such a proposal was repeatedly offered to them in Bonn, Brussels, and Geneva. This is a precondition for the permanent normalization of relations. It is actually a proposal for an alliance between two nations and two states, for halting the war, eliminating consequences of the aggression and destruction, and for long-lasting and mutually beneficial cooperation in all spheres from the economy, to security and foreign policy. For such a proposal which is in essence a refinement of the overall and consistent Croatian policy towards Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also a further expansion of the peace initiative, Croatia and her president received numerous praises from foreign statesmen: in Bonn, Brussels and Geneva, and also at many meetings with foreign ministers Kinkel, Claes, Cetin, Hurd, Mrs af Ugglas, [name indistinct], and Mock. Despite such offers and such assessments of our policies and efforts, there have been no satisfactory results so far that could place the progress achieved in our relations with the Serb side in the right perspective and context. I am deeply convinced of the existence of such a possibility, and we shall do our utmost in this respect, because the normalization of relations with the Muslims and their state entity in wartime, and especially in peace, is of strategic importance for and in the interest of the Croats and the Republic of Croatia. The joint Geneva declaration is an important political document, maybe even a crucial step in the normalization of relations between the two signatory countries and an important contribution to the beginning of the establishment of a lasting peace, stability, and security in this part of Europe. If the Serb side displays goodwill, this document will determine the future course of the normalization of the situation in both states and the normalization of relations between the two states and it will also have an impact on the position of minorities in these states. This is a document whose final form was shaped by the international community, but also by the dynamics of the international conference on former Yugoslavia. This declaration contains several elements that could be relevant to UN Security Council Resolution 871 -- in case a real peace is achieved -- inter-state relations were mentioned, offices are being opened. It was said that the two sides should be guided by the principles of the UN Charter and the basic tenets of the CSCE in the establishment of goodneighborly relations. Moreover, an official statement from Belgrade calls on the Serbs in Croatia to regulate their relations with the Croatian authorities in the Republic of Croatia. This represents the first, and very important, step in the normalization of relations between Zagreb and Belgrade and it should lead to the establishment of full diplomatic relations. This is also an important step towards the peaceful reintegration of the UN Protected Areas into the constitutional, legal, political, and economic system of our country which would effectively finalize the integrity of the sovereign Republic of Croatia. This once again reiterates Croatia's determination to establish peace in these areas and to restore and consolidate stability and security, primarily through political means, in other words through dialogue and negotiations in an atmosphere of goodwill and respect for the individual interests of the two sides and for the efforts outlined in the documents of the international community such as the European Union's action plan and relevant documents of the UN Security Council and General Assembly. The international community has already expressed and will continue to give us support for this policy. If we continue to pursue this policy, we will move closer not only to finding genuine and lasting solutions but also to the political, European milieu to which we belong historically. It is important to stress that both the comprehensive offer made in Bonn to the Muslim side and the joint declaration consistently reflect the basic idea and the logical theme of President Tudjman's peace initiative and to a large extent represent a concrete step toward implementing it. As a vital step toward the day when the two sovereign states are eventually recognized within their international borders the declaration is seen as being of crucial importance for contributing to and enhancing the effectiveness of the international conference and for helping to implement all the points in the European Union's action plan on the so-called modus vivendi, or rather of Resolution 871 which is so crucial to us. Any delay in normalizing Croat-Serb relations, or rather the absence of any shifts in them hamper the efforts to normalize the situation in this part of Europe. Accordingly, any shift in this sphere must be welcomed and supported. However, while on the one hand we will continue to normalize relations with the Serb side in order to accomplish our own objectives as soon as possible -- in particular those concerning the temproarily occupied territories -- on the other, we will again try to restore dialogue with the Muslims to tackle all vital issues, including the territorial integrity of the two entities in a future state, releasing prisoners, normalizing the humanitarian situation, in particular, providing gurantees for the free passage of humanitarian convoys, and the general state of relations -- in other words, harmonizing our Bonn proposal with their reply to us in Geneva recently. The Bonn proposal for negotiations and agreements to benefit both peoples and peace in this part of Europe will remain on long-term offer. However, the Muslim side's current behavior demonstrates a lack of genuine desire to find a lasting and systematic solution to Croat-Muslim relations and to establishing appropriate relations with the Croatian state. There are very clear indications that the Muslim side wishes to invalidate and reject the Geneva documents on the establishment and set-up of the union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the negotiations, and even more so in its public relations, the Muslim side very skillfully evades and jumps from the concept of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the union of the republics and then into the Bosniak Muslim entity, mixing and intertwining the actual situation on the ground with the real level which has been achieved in negotiations. In addition to this, by repeatedly issuing demands for the replacement of the negotiating forum, it has been trying to return the negotiations to square one. This has considerably burdened our negotiations, because the other side's definition is constantly changing. In negotiations, and even more so through its behavior in the field, the Muslim side has shown that it was not ready to recognize the equality and constitutionality of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, nor is it ready to recognize all indisputable achievements of the struggle of the Croat people and the realization of its right to self-determination expressed through the establishment of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. By shunning the union of the republics, which is the level of the resolution achieved in objective terms in the negotiating process, and which is a euphemism for the agreement reached aboard the "Invincible", back to the model of the republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Muslim leadership is in reality trying to negate the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. The current Muslim offensive in central Bosnia, with its horrific proportions, duration, and tragic consequences, most obviously proves the lack of real will and reveals the genuine intentions of the current Muslim leadership -- the eviction of the Croats from their historic and ethnic areas in central Bosnia. This is in complete contravention of the fundamental documents and constitutional principles of the present-day republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the principles of the set-up and demarcation within the union of the republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This entitles and obligates the president, the assembly, and the government of the Republic of Croatia, in line with the constitution and their own conscience, to do everything in the political, diplomatic, humanitarian, and every other legitimate field in order not only to stop that merciless offensive but also to secure the survival of the Croats and guarantee them a life worthy of human beings in those historically ethnic Croat areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croats must remain in their homes in central Bosnia, which is in the interest of Bosnia-Herzegovina and of peace in this part of Europe. Despite everything, we again call on Bosnian Muslim representatives to continue negotiations in good faith so that a permanent and just solution for all sides be achieved, peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina restored, a permanent community of equal constitutive nations set up, and conditions for their coexistence be preserved. If the Muslim offensive is halted it is not yet too late for politics and negotiations. At the same time we again wish to express the readiness of the Croatian side to work toward and persevere in reaching precisely such a political, peaceful, negotiated and mutually beneficial solution. In the course of the last meeting between two delegations, i.e. between presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic, certain progress was achieved as regards [Muslim] access to the sea, without calling into question the territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia. An agreement in principle on Mostar and the hydroelectric system on the Neretva River was also achieved. However, the important problem of central Bosnia remains to be solved: In this respect demands by the Bosnian Muslim side were ultimatum-like and thwarted any agreement. At the same time Izetbegovic's sudden demands as regards central Bosnia called into question the very principle, which has been one of the foundations of the negotiating process so far and which had been coordinated by all three sides, according to which the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina would get 17.5 percent of the territory. Esteemed ladies and gentlemen. Let me say just a few words about our relations with Slovenia: A meeting that took place in Ljubljana yesterday between the prime ministers and ministers of foreign affairs of our two neighboring states was, in many aspects, a great step forward in the removal of obstacles burdening bilateral relations, i.e., as Prime Minister Nikica Valentic stressed after the talks, it transpires that no problem is of such a nature as to prevent the interest of the two nations and the two states in the establishment of better and friendlier relations. In brief, as regards open issues, a complete agreement on the Krsko nuclear power plant is likely to be reached by the end of the summer; we have coordinated a trade agreement as a framework for the future exchange on the free trade principle, and also an agreement on payment transactions. In a few days we could settle the issue of our property relations. Standpoints regarding Ljubljanska Banka have been clarified and brought closer, agreements on air traffic, fishing, and cooperation in culture and education have either been completed or are nearing completion. Through treaties on employment and social security, which are also nearing completion, the issue of employment of Croatian citizens in the Republic of Slovenia will be resolved. A joint commission will continue work on the demarcation of the border line. The Croatian side presented to the Slovene side a proposal in writing on the Bay of Piran with a number of interesting solutions as regards political, customs and ecological control and fishing. In line with these proposals, Piran would become a linking bay -- not a contentious issue on which international mediation could make decisions should it become necessary. An increase in bilateral trade between the two neighbors was singled out as one of the most urgent tasks. Finally, it was agreed that the same delegations meet again in Zagreb on 7 February to sign the agreements that have already been coordinated and to continue the dialogue. As regards our relations with Italy, i.e., the forthcoming 3 February meeting and talks with Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta in Rome, I would like to stress that on that occasion we wish to remove all remaining misunderstandings in our relations and thus give a fresh impetus to the good-neighborliness of the two states. For us, Italy is not only one of the most important business partners, but is also an influential state and a factor creating European and world politics to which we are inevitably inclined, and with which we are very closely cooperating in regional organizations, such as the central European initiative or Alpe-Adria. We are convinced that Italy will play an even more important role in the resolution of the crisis in this area and also in the peace-time reconstruction. My visit to the Council of Europe in the course of which I had numerous complex, but very important talks, showed that it understood our position, but also that Croatia can and must do most on its own. Further strengthening and widening of democracy in all its forms is our first and fundamental imperative. Croatia has kept its special guest status in the Council of Europe, while the change of that status will depend on the development of the situation, the nature and the course of a denouement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Esteemed deputies. We attach great importance to the recent NATO summit, bearing in mind the pivotal position of this organization in the building of an adequate system of security and stability in Europe and the world in general. Our particular attention was attracted by decisions on further strengthening of the so-called NATO European component, or wing, on the basis of the development and strengthening of the European Union, i.e., the WEU [Western European Union]. Croatia supports NATO standpoints on political and security priorities, particularly as regards support for the stabilization of new European democracies, the further improvement of the CSCE process and mechanisms, the struggle against terrorism, and arms control and disarmament. Even though some NATO standpoints are inadequate when it comes to the real state of affairs and the need to establish security in our continent, particularly as regards crises in areas such as the Balkans, we derive hope from the fact that NATO has expressed its awareness of the interdependability of security in all democratic European states, and readiness in principle to gradually extend its membership. In this sense an invitation was sent to European states and CSCE members to develop direct cooperation in practice with NATO through Partnership for Peace. Principles and goals of Partnership for Pease are in their essence in agreement with Croatia's standpoints and its long-term interests, and therefore we welcome them expressing our readiness to join the implementation of that initiative. We are not regarding our possible participation in the Partnership from the standpoint of our current defense needs and interests, but rather as a way and modus of standardization and long-term inclusion of our defense system and forces into the institutional framework for the defense of the democratic order, security and stability in Europe and the world in general. Ladies and gentlemen. We have achieved significant moves forward in the strengthening of our international position and thus our internal security. We have approached our main goal by several more steps. But in the forthcoming period very complex tasks, fresh huge challenges are awaiting us. Quick breakthroughs are possible, but also long-lasting frustrations in the implementation of our fundamental policy. It will be necessary to make quick decisions, react quickly and even more quickly adapt to circumstances in order to achieve our strategic goals to an optimum degree and fulfil our national task consistently. We are leaving the war behind and entering peace and Europe, being aware that forces that pull us back are still strong. Two words are decisive in this connection: National unity and the future of the nation and the state. Therefore I call on you to unite and give support to each other when it comes to our mutual goal. Let me paraphrase a well-known statesman: Let's not allow the opening up of disputes between the past and the present lest we should find out at one moment that we have lost the future. Thank you, madam deputy speaker.
