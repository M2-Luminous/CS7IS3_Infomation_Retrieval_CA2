Yevgenyev under the "Point of View" rubric; place and date not given: "The Man Who Does Not Hurry Is Always on Time"] [Text] [Yevgenyev] Pavel Grigoryevich, do you not think that, in its uncertainty, the current situation resembles the situation that we had a year ago? You remember: Parliament flew into a rage, Gaydar left, and the premier's chair, it seemed, was occupied by a man of a different mettle -- a "gas magnate." No one could say then what awaited the country. Even the commentaries of analysts were somewhat timid and inarticulate. [Bunich] At that time I, too, would not have undertaken to make forecasts. Chernomyrdin was unknown and not understood. Hence everyone was possessed by great alarm over whether we would continue with the reforms, or retreat back to the command economy. Right now, things are calmer in this sense. The premier's intentions are clear. The same goes for the general direction of movement toward the market. The question is, how to move forward. We can continue to do what we did before -- then it will be just as difficult as now, but will not become worse. The other option is acceleration. We will get to the goal quicker, but at the cost of maximum exertion of energy, which society might not have in sufficient supply on the home stretch. And finally, we could try a more sparing regime -- extended in time, and not so socially austere. All these are, in general, questions of tactics. Not one of these genuinely market-oriented models is a retreat to the past. [Yevgenyev] On the other hand, the State Duma is a pig in a poke. [Bunich] I hope that we will never again see the naked extremism that lately characterized the Supreme Soviet. I somehow think that the parliament of the present convocation will be "fluid" -- that is to say that there will not be draconian discipline. Just because a man is elected from one bloc or party or another, he will not be deprived of the freedom to think and make decisions independently. The democrats will most likely squabble among themselves over secondary issues, but when it comes to crucial issues they will find in themselves the strength to unite. I do not know Zhirinovskiy's program, but I am not quite convinced that he will blindly follow the communists with their naivete toward everything to do with the market. Thus the outlook looks to me at least no worse than one year ago. [Yevgenyev] But the Duma will gather and raise a hue and cry: Industry is perishing, everyone to the rescue of industry! [Bunich] The slump in production is indeed great. According to some statistics, there has been a 52-percent downturn in production since 1989. Although this process is not simple. Some enterprises are commonly acknowledged to be doomed, and should expire on the road to a normal economy -- they are superfluous! Others are so unprofitable, labor-intensive, and nontechnological that there is no sense in reviving them. I am more worried by something else: While losing enterprises, we are creating nothing in their place. [Yevgenyev] With an annual inflation rate of 1,000 percent? [Bunich] This is the very premise on which the Cabinet proceeds: Whatever the cost, inflation must be squeezed. But what is the result? It is still harder to cut expenditure, and you do not especially increase revenues -- production shrinks, and tax revenue into the state coffers with it. The jacket shrinks to fit the wearer. Hence the delays over settling debts to the military-industrial complex and the countryside and over payments to the budget-financed sphere. I am afraid that stabilization achieved at such a cost would prove unstable. At one time we loved to talk about production reserves. Today there are almost none left. Fixed capital is 50 percent worn out. The volume of investments in industry has fallen by two-thirds since 1989. Enterprises do not have the funds for simple reproduction, let alone development. I am not calling for trillions of rubles to be poured wholesale into industry again. But I do think it necessary to aid through reasonable allowances those who are ready to take risks, who have the ability and knowledge to escape from the clutches of the crisis, and have a promising business plan. Picking out such enterprises is work of a special kind. Piecework, if you like. We have somewhat gotten out of the habit; from the pinnacles of power it looks to some people almost shameful. What is an individual little plant, pit, or building, on the scale of Mother Russia! The time will come when these things will get back on their feet by themselves. Reliance on this "by themselves" could prove illusory. Credits and taxes acceptable to all on the strength of which we might get back on our feet will not appear in our country quickly, if we undertake nothing. At the same time, labor collectives are realizing more and more clearly that no one is going to come along and wave a magic wand for them or cross their palms with silver, and are ready to go without some things today in order to reap the profits tomorrow. An example that is near to home for me: Right now in the Academy of the National Economy we are building a facility that will bring in hard-currency revenue, and have told our staff that we could pay them far more, but then the construction work would be delayed. Choose the one or the other. They all decided that we would be patient for three years and then let the facility. But on the other hand, inflation is snapping at our heels: Better a bird in the hand... [Yevgenyev] Nevertheless, without major investments, you will not get far. [Bunich] Well, first, we are getting wiser after all. How many joint-stock companies of the closed type appeared in the initial period. Now they have got accustomed to their new surroundings, looked around, and are gradually "opening up." They are issuing shares and increasing capital. It is said that loans at the market rate are dear. But why not take them on security? Bankers do not especially trust promises to pay through future output -- maybe it will exist, maybe not. But industrial property, land -- that is reliable. And advantageous to the industry itself. You keep the money, and you even get more in the form of handsome credits. That is how it is done the world over. But in our country people are still apprehensive: As if you were removing your underwear and taking it to the pawnbroker's. What it is, I do not know: Either the general atmosphere of uncertainty is taking its toll, or directors have insufficient grasp of the basics. Investment auctions could be more widely practised, selling shares advantageously to those who guarantee investment contributions -- these also amount to assets of a kind. But look what is happening with depreciation payments. They were deliberately exempted from taxation in order to ensure the revival of production. But enterprises are constantly plowing them into pay. Since the new year, following the revaluation, the value of fixed capital has grown thirtyfold. But what is the benefit of this, if we continue to squander funds set aside for depreciation [amortizatsiyu proedat]? That being the case, you might as well tax it, if you cannot put things in order. [Yevgenyev] But you say we should start helping industry. But it will once again throw everything to the four winds. [Bunich] What I mean is: He who seeks is capable of finding something. But this is not enough. On the other hand, we should help only those who know how to make use of this help. And not, of course, state enterprises. Even in the current difficult times privatized facilities look far healthier than state facilities. Among the former only 9 percent are unprofitable, against 20 percent in the state sphere, and profitability is on average 10 percent higher. But of course, they were not allocated sufficient time to recover. [Yevgenyev] Nevertheless, Ukraine has clearly shown what happens when you try with all your might to preserve industry. [Bunich] I think that we have already passed this station. Also the station at which it was justified to pay any price for victory over inflation. Now we should look ahead and learn to optimize our decisions, while not forgetting about the old rule of thumb: "The man who does not hurry is always on time." Let the budget temporarily lose out somewhat over relatively low taxes and cheap credit for a chosen few -- at reasonable levels, this is not so terrible. Some inflationary indulgences quickly become a powerful anti-inflationary factor -- this is what should be kept in mind. Tomorrow's gains will cover today's losses many times over. He who takes his opportunity will not only pay back his debt a hundredfold, but also will become a reliable support for the new economy, which quite simply has no chance of developing in the present conditions.
