It is believed that the corpses have been there anywhere between two to five years. There is already speculation as to why they are there. Some versions say it is the result of accounts settled among poppy growers. Others say the deaths were due to executions by guerrillas. Amid five hectares of poppy plantations in the place known as El Roble Heights, in Landazuri Municipality in Santander Department, troops of the Rafael Reyes Infantry Battalion found a mass grave with the remains of at least 60 people buried some time within the past five years. According to the Army, they are all FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] guerrillas, and many of the victims have bullet wounds. The "National Newscast" has learned that apparently the 60 murdered guerrillas could be the result of executions among the rebels because of disloyalty. The executions may have been ordered by Braulio Herrera, former representative to the chamber by the UP [Patriotic Union], when he was the fourth-ranking FARC commander. For this deed, the former congressman was sentenced to death by the guerrilla command, but he was able to leave the country illegally. However, the authorities of the Landazuri municipality believe the corpses found there could be the result of a war among poppy growers of the region. In the town today there is an atmosphere of mourning and anxiety because never before had such serious deeds been registered in the jurisdiction.
