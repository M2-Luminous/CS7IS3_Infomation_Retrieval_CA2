Chang Chae-yong, the Ministry's North America bureau chief, said his Ministry had just received from the U.S. State Department a letter officially confirming Kim's permanent residenceship application. The U.S. Government said the immigration and naturalization office would make the final decision on Kim's application because it falls under the office's responsibility. It is hard at the moment to tell when the office will start examining Kim's application and when it will finish the examination. Kim's application was for permanent residenceship, and not for political asylum, Chang quoted a U.S. Government official, who handed the State Department's letter to the Ministry, as saying. The U.S. Government promised a maximum cooperation in dealing with Kim's permanent residenceship application, stressing the issue is not a matter of political consideration, Chang said. Asked about Washington's decision to shelve Kim's application, Chang said the U.S. Government is not in a hurry to take action on this matter. The government has earlier asked the U.S. Government not to permit Kim's permanent residence on the ground that he is wanted in Korea in connection with the irregularities related to the military modernization program.
