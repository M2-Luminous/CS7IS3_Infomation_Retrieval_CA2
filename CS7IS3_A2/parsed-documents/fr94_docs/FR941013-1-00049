FR941013-1-00049 FR941013-1-00006 There is no collection of information in this rule requiring approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3504. The Department of the Interior certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). An unknown number of individuals, small businesses, and tribal governments may be affected in some way, but they do not exceed several thousand in aggregate. These possible effects, such as increased demand on tribal governments from some of their members to document their status, stem from the statute itself rather than the proposed regulations, as the preponderance of the proposed regulations does not exceed the non-discretionary statutory requirements. The Department of the Interior has determined that these proposed regulations will not have a significant effect on the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4347). In addition, the Department of the Interior has determined that these proposed regulations are categorically excluded from the procedural requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act by Departmental regulations in 516 DM 2. As such, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement has been prepared. List of Subjects in 25 CFR Part 309 Indians-Arts and crafts.
