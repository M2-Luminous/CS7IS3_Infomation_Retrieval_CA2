The FPLS is led by Mohamed Anako, a 30 year-old indigene of the Agadez region (750 km northwest of Niamey), who presents himself as a "moderate federalist" in his demands, the same sources indicate. Niger Interior Minister Ousamane Oumarou, in an interview with AFP, stated that the government had "only learned" of the emergence of this movement. "We have not been informed officially. We therefore do not know the reasons for its establishment and do not have any information on its members," he added. [passage omitted]
