The understanding worked out late Wednesday [8 June] will clear the way for the resumption of negotiations for the merger of Alitalia and the airline's domestic subsidiary, ATI [Italian Air Freight Lines], and for returning flying personnel to their full schedules through to the end of the month. On re-capitalization, the communique said the labor side is calling for at least 1.5 trillion lire (928 million dollars) and that both the unions and management agree that the idea of assigning Alitalia the status of a regional carrier should be dropped. On the sensitive areas of excess staff and cost-cutting, the company referred to the unbreakable link between "recovery and development" and the need to "pursue the objectives" set forth in the three-year restructurization plan on reducing operation costs and boosting productivity. In this area, industry sources reported today, the airline is insisting on curbing running costs by 12 percent, the workforce by 20 or some 4,000 workers, and hiking productivity by 25 percent. All the while, Alitalia is committed to "re-defining organizational processes and optimizing all the group's resources," that is, said these sources, that the number of future layoffs will have to be agreed to by the unions. Also coming into play will be such safety-net features as profession training to enhance mobility within the group, especially on the side of the administration. Also promised was that the Alitalia-ATI merger "will not have fallout in the Naples area," where the activities of the group will be transferred and that changes in work rules for flight personnel, hours in the air, rest period and the like will be dealt with in line with the wage pact agreement of July 1993, "taking into account the company's state of crisis." Speaking for the labor side, Valter Cerfeda of the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] and Paolo Brutti of the FILT-CGIL said the problem of re-capitalization will have to be taken up with the government, "without forays aide from the individual ministers." The joint statement said the efforts of Alitalia management and the unions could be nullified if the right choices are not made by the government. "There can be no attempt to maintain a flagcarrier airline if sufficient resources for investments and development are not provided," said the statement.
