Vladimir Zhirinovskiy himself told the press on that triumphal Tuesday that they are the ones who "do not know LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] politicians. The Russian people, however, do know them, and that is why they voted for them." Nevertheless, it seems that the people had other reasons. As to the history of his party, it is still shrouded in semi-mystery. The Beginning. From Novodvorskaya to Oleynik It is unlikely that Mr. Zhirinovskiy would have made it to the current pinnacle with the help of the LDPR had he not been expelled from it at some point in the past. He appeared on Russia's political arena in May 1989, on the second day of the founding congress of the Democratic Union. Only in those naive times could a person, having walked into this sort of meeting for the first time, find himself elected on the spot into the Democratic Union's coordinating council for his eloquence--only to be expelled a couple of days later "for communist leanings." Having spent the summer and the fall at rallies, in the winter of 1990 Zhirinovskiy received an invitation to join forces with Vladimir Bogachev, who also had left the Democratic Union and founded the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. At the LDP's founding congress in March, Mr. Bogachev, impressed by the legal, linguistic, and oratorical luggage of his partner, promotes him to chairmanship, while settling for the job of the party's coordinator himself. At the time the LDP consisted of about 20 members, and anyone who wanted to could get a deputy mandate and a membership card at the congress. Mr. Zhirinovskiy concentrated his activities on the so-called Centrist Bloc, created in June 1990--an alliance of dwarf parties that had the obvious sympathy of the CPSU's Central Committee, whose member Boris Oleynik openly backed the bloc in general and Zhirinovskiy in particular. Mr. Zhirinovskiy's former confederates maintain that it was at this stage that his rhetoric began to change significantly, acquiring populist and imperial overtones. In October 1990 the LDP chairman received an invitation to attend the congress of the Liberal International [LI] in Helsinki. (By the way, Mr. Zhirinovskiy still refers to his "ties with the LI," although the leadership of this union said right then that "any cooperation with Zhirinovskiy and his party is out of question"). Having returned from the capital of Suomi [Finland], the LDP chairman learned that he had been expelled from the party. Observers are inclined to believe that Mssrs. Bogachev and Zhirinovskiy simply could not agree on how to apportion the illusory power over the party. Bogachev's supporters insisted that they expelled the competitor for ideological reasons--"for pro-communist activities in a centrist bloc." Zhirinovskiy's group maintains that Bogachev simply was covering up his financial transgressions (Zhirinovskiy's attempt, however, to prove it with the help of the OBKhSS [Department for Combating the Embezzlement of Socialist Property and Speculation] and the court failed). It should be noted that, according to Bogachev, "At the time Zhirinovskiy's name did not attract any sponsors or money to the party. He definitely was alone--without any structures behind him." A hastily convened (with the help of the Centrist Bloc) conference of Zhirinovskiy's group did the reverse--expelled Bogachev and approved as "vice Zhirinovskiy" Akhmet Khalitov, an elderly water-tower operator in a kolkhoz in the environs of Moscow. Since then the fortunes of the current victor began to rise swiftly. The LDP leader began to appear on television. According to Mr. Bogachev, "Zhirinovskiy's views after the split underwent an incredibly rapid evolution." In January 1991 the proposal of the "committee for national salvation of the USSR," drafted by Zhirinovskiy and two other "Centrist Bloc leaders" Vladimir Voronin and Valeriy Skurlatov, was made public; among other things, the proposal advocated imposing a state of emergency and disbanding all parties. (When, half a year later, Mr. Zhirinovskiy was reminded of this at the election campaign press conference of the presidential candidate, Zhirinovskiy demanded that journalist Sergey Parkhomenko be removed from the studio "for provocations.") The Ministry of Justice registered the LDPSU [Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union) in April 1991 (before the CPSU); it turned out later that the lion's share of the required 5,000 signatures had been falsified, and in August 1992 the Russian Ministry of Justice annulled the registration (restoring it again, however, in November). On 12 June 1992 Vladimir Zhirinovskiy became a fact of public conscience, having come in third in the race for the title of the president of Russia. To this day, only one sponsor of his campaign is known for certain--the head of the Galant concern Andrey Zavidiya, who was on the ballot as his vice president and who, after the putsch and the dissolution of the CPSU, took upon himself the financing of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper. `The Inner Party.' Military-Industrial Complex Heroes From the Shadow Cabinet The LDP structure is designed to be strictly a pyramid: "the party--the Central Committee--the Supreme Council, consisting of five persons--Chairman Zhirinovskiy. In reality, however, the "salt of the LDP" and its brain center is the "inner party"--the LDP's shadow cabinet. Interestingly, there are only a very few LDP veterans in its current elite. As soon as the party got down to "serious business," Mr. Khalitov, the water-tower operator, left the party "for reasons of advanced age." Besides Zhirinovskiy himself, only two "veteran swordsmen" may be counted among the LDP's top echelon. Stanislav Zhebrovskiy, the party's deputy chairman and "the minister of the economy" in the shadow cabinet, a physicist, has known Zhirinovskiy since 1983 from working together in the Mir publishing house. In the party, his responsibilities include organizational matters and the PRAVDA ZHIRINOVSKOGO newspaper. Until then he worked as an editor in the Sovetskaya Entsiklopedia publishing house, and before that, he worked for a quite a while in Algeria. Viktor Bogatyy, 46, a year ago gave up his Supreme Council membership and the post of "the minister of foreign economic relations" in the shadow cabinet because of a heart surgery. He now intends to return. He is the president of the Eksodin company (insurance, real estate, commerce) and the owner of seven similar companies; in the past, for many year a staff member of the [Soviet] trade representation in Great Britain, and then later a deputy editor in chief of the VNESHNYAYA TORGOVLYA magazine. It appears that the party owes its successful campaign to the "second draft": relatively young people who came to the LDP after the 1991 presidential elections as a rather cohesive group with its own hierarchy and remarkably similar biographies. The current membership of the shadow cabinet is estimated by various party functionaries to be between 20 and 40 people; its structure is not rigid, moreover; it practically is not subordinate to the party's Supreme Council, but is formed and acts at its own discretion. It is believed that the party maintains control over it, since the head of the cabinet, Mr. Vengerovskiy, is a member of the Supreme Council. Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, 40, is the "deputy prime minister" and "the head of intelligence" in the shadow cabinet, No. 8 on the party list, served for a long time as an officer in the military space program; after that he worked on secret topics in the same field in research centers; he maintains that he has "conceptual experience in counterintelligence," and was the head of a corresponding main administration in the State Committee for Computing Technology. Mikhail Musatov, the "deputy for defense affairs" in the shadow cabinet, also was an officer in the military space program. He joined the party in 1991. Viktor Kobelev, 50, a member of the LDP Supreme Council, and No. 2 on the party list. In the past a vice dean of the Ministry of Heavy Machine Building's professional training institute. Sergey Abeltsev, 32, member of the Supreme Council and "the minister of security," is No. 9 on the party list. A former GRU [Main Intelligence Directorate] officer (according to other sources, he combined this service with assignments for the KGB). Andrey Mitrofanov, 31, "the minister of foreign affairs," in the past represented the USSR MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] at the Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. Sergey Barskiy, "the minister of internal affairs," a former MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] officer, now works for a private agency. Viktor Lymar, "the minister of science and technology," is a product of the Radio Industry Scientific Research Center. As we can see, the "core" of the shadow cabinet noticeably revolves around sectors of the military-industrial complex, in particular, the space industry and nuclear power generation (especially those under the control of special services). Vladimir Gusev, the former deputy minister for chemistry and timber in Ryzhkov's government (No. 11 on the list), and Academician Aleksey Zvyagin, currently teaching at the Commerce Academy, give the list and the cabinet respectability. Mr. Vengerovskiy maintains that "the shadow cabinet, which resembles the Rand Corporation, functions without remuneration." Writer Eduard Limonov and well-known rock-nazis Andrey Arkhipov and Sergey Zharikov did not fit with the cabinet (according to Vengerovskiy--"because of their frivolous attitude and zealotry"). The New Generation Chooses According to Mr. Zhebrovskiy, the flow of people who wanted to join the LDPR especially swelled during the last week before 12 December. It still has not receded, which anyone walking into the headquarters at Rybnykov Lane in Moscow will easily see for himself. The party's average age (over 30) has been declining lately. The procedure of joining the party is still simple: an application, a photo, a 200-ruble membership fee, and the card is issued on the spot. Or not issued, if one does not want it. Of the 50,000 membership cards printed some time back, about 1,500 still have not been used. There is no system of registration, so new members can easily escape paying membership dues (1 percent of the declared earnings a month). As Mr. Zhebrovskiy says: "Who wants to go looking for your money?!" Just recently he maintained that the entire income of the indigent LDPR consists of membership dues. * * * * How many of them were there four years ago--Voronins, Skurlatovs, marginal chairmen of parties of peace, individual, and other assorted centrism! For all 10 days after the elections, I have had visions of them gnawing on their pillows in impotent envy: "Had I been more careful in choosing friends, I could have, too!"
