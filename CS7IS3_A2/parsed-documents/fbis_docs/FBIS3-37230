For the past few days you have not been accused of plans to destroy Germany but of something much worse in the eyes of the mass media: You would welcome it if the Oder-Neisse line were revised and Germany got back its eastern parts, including Stettin [Szczecin], Danzig [Gdansk], Koenigsberg [Kaliningrad], and Breslau [Wroclaw]. Moreover, you want to give Poland access to the sea between Gdansk and Kaliningrad and, at the same time, expand Poland eastward with the area around Lemberg [Lvov] as compensation. A revision of the injustice of the deportation of the east Germans is certainly the worst that the tabloid press in Germany can imagine. After all, how these people have suffered because of the unification of FRG and GDR! [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, this was certainly a terrible shock for the enemies of the Germans. I have been involved in geopolitics ever since my youth. I am also the chairman of the Geopolitical Committee of the Russian parliament, the Duma. Naturally, I think very much about just solutions. A U.S. president once said that nothing is settled that is not settled justly. Why should it not be permitted to discuss a revision, that is, a completely peaceful solution for eastern Germany, which would conform to international law and would be achieved by means of negotiations? Why should a lesser law be applied to the German people? After all, it is not as though Poland has derived any benefit from Germany's eastern areas and that eastern Germany is now a flourishing land. Such considerations cannot be taboo any more. I rely on a healthy and strong, self-confident, sovereign, and once again German Germany as an equal partner with Russia. [Correspondent] You have also commented on the problem of South Tirol. [Zhirinovskiy] So much is being talked about the right to self-determination. Hardly anyone in the world will doubt that the South Tiroleans are Germans. No one will want to deny that about three-quarters of the population of South Tirol belong to the German ethnic Group and the Ladinian ethnic group, which is closely linked to the German group. Why should this issue not best be settled by the voters, as in the Crimea? Why do we not let ourselves be guided by democratic principles? [Correspondent] How do you see the development of democracy in Central Europe? [Zhirinovskiy] To what extent is it a democracy and to what extent is it a media democracy? To what extent do the masses of the voters decide and to what extent are decisions made by a few thousand journalists, some of whom bitterly hate their fatherland? To what extent does the law decide whether undesirable events are permitted, and to what extent is this decision made by a few thousand bandits of the so-called autonomous scene? The state is strong enough to show criminals their place. Desired rallies take place without problems. The rule-of-law state is called upon to punish criminal gangs, which are specialized in terror against rallies. [Correspondent] The judiciary in our country is overtaxed when, half a century after World War II, it is still having to pursue proceedings against more than 8,000 accused on the defeated side for war crimes or Nazi crimes that were committed half a century ago or more. [Zhirinovskiy] What is the purpose of that supposed to be? How is one supposed to reach just judgments such a long time after the alleged deeds? These defendants must be very old and seriously ill. How can a clever and intelligent people like the German people permit this to be done to it? Germany must be freed from this Babylonian captivity, and it can be freed by Russia as a partner and a friend, by a Russia that loves the Germans. [Correspondent] Such statements.... [Zhirinovskiy] ...will increase the hatred of the anti-German opinion industry against me. [Correspondent] It is implied that you do not want to withdraw Russian troops from Germany but increase them by a factor of 10. [Zhirinovskiy] Quite the contrary: I have repeatedly demanded that all foreign troops be withdrawn from Germany. I cannot understand that, on the one hand, the Bundeswehr is to be reduced and, on the other hand, U.S. soldiers, British, French, Belgians, Dutch, and even 100 Canadians are to remain stationed in Germany. Do the German people expect any protection by a few tens of thousands of foreign soldiers? Naturally, Germany needs effective, strong armed forces, but it needs German armed forces. Anyone who does not want to afford a sufficiently strong army of his own incurs the danger of having a foreign army put into his country. And what is the purpose of splitting the Bundeswehr into multinational units, in particular under foreign command? Why is the German army not solely subordinate to a German General Staff? After all, the Germans certainly need not be ashamed of their soldiers and their military tradition. [Correspondent] The opinion industry does not like your views at all. [Zhirinovksiy] Yes, unfortunately this is true. But the Germans must understand that I, as a Russian, pursue a Russian policy, and that I love the Russian people and also the German people. What kind of a Russian would I be, if I were to pursue an anti-Russian policy and the carving up of Russia? When I advocate a large and strong Russia, I do not want to build up any conflict with Washington. But having several great powers, to which Russia and others belong, in addition to Germany and the United States, is better for the world than a single globocop, to whose tune the world dances. Equal rights in the family of peoples and states is the key to real partnership. I abhor war and any kind of military conflict, but I am for the peoples' right to self-determination. When, for instance, the people in the Crimea, in free self-determination and in democratic elections, are of an opinion that differs from the one of the Ukrainian Khrushchev, who "gave" the Crimea to Ukraine, for me it is the opinion of the people that counts and not the decision of a dictator. [Correspondent] Attempts are being made to present you to the people as an opponent or even an enemy of President Yeltsin. [Zhirinovskiy] But this is not so at all. I respect and value President Yeltsin, and this is mutual. President Yeltsin may occasionally make mistakes, but he wants the best for Russia. I was not involved at all in the putsch against him and, as is generally known; I had nothing to do with it. By the way, at that time I was with the German People's Union in the Nibelungen Hall [in Passau]. [Correspondent] But you have a constructive and not at all hostile or even just opposition relationship with the Russian communists in the Duma. [Zhirinovskiy] The communists in the Duma are in no way responsible for what happened under Stalin. Today's Russians and today's Germans should live and work and shape their future freely and completely free of the burden of the pasts. Today's Russian communists are, by the way, honorable people and not traitors who served a foreign power at some time in the past. Why should we dig artificial trenches and establish contradictions in the current, terrible situation in Russia, which reminds us of Germany's situation after the war. [Correspondent] If no miracle happens, and no murder or any other evil deed prevents it, you will be Russia's next president. How will you tackle the country's internal problems? [Zhirinovskiy] We will pursue a mixture of well thought-out planned economy and moderate market economy and give the people in Russia hope and work again; we will stop inflation and help the Russians to live a dignified life. Within three months I will destroy the several hundred mafia gangs that dominate business in our country by, among other things, so-called protection money, and every kind of serious criminals, who make our streets unsafe, with the entire rigor of the law and a police force that is free of any corruption. Law and order must be restored. I guarantee it. And the Russians know that.
