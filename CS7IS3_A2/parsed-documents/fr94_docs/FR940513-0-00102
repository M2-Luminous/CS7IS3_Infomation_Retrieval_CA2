Summary of Order I. Introduction 1. On March 8, 1994, the Commission adopted a Second Report and Order in this proceeding (Second Report and Order) 1 establishing general rules and procedures governing competitive bidding for radio spectrum (auctions). The Second Report and Order identified the types of services and licenses that may be subject to auctions, described a menu of competitive bidding methods, and adopted generic auction procedures. The Commission stated that specific competitive bidding rules for licensing individual services would be addressed in subsequent Reports and Orders. This Fourth Report and Order establishes rules and procedures for auctioning licenses in the Interactive Video and Data Service (IVDS). 2 1 Second Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;61, released April 20, 1994 (Second Report and Order). On February 3, 1994, we adopted the First Report and Order in this proceeding, which, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 309(i)(4)(C), prescribed transfer disclosure requirements with respect to licenses or permits awarded by random selection. First Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;32 (released February 4, 1994), petitions for reconsideration pending. 2 Concurrent with this Fourth Report and Order, we are adopting a Third Report and Order, FCC 94&hyph;98, in this docket addressing the specific competitive bidding rules and procedures for ``narrowband'' Personal Communications Services (PCS). 2. In this Fourth Report and Order, we find that the value of IVDS licenses is not expected to be sufficiently high to justify the use of simultaneous multiple round bidding. We therefore conclude that the auction methods most appropriate to the IVDS are oral bidding (open outcry) and single round sealed bidding. We also establish rules and procedures to deter possible abuses of the bidding and licensing procedures. Last, we establish preferences for small businesses and businesses owned by minorities or women to enhance their participation in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of IVDS system offerings. II. Background and Auction Eligibility 3. The IVDS is a point-to-multipoint, multipoint-to-point, short distance communications service in which licensees may provide information, products, or services to individual subscribers located at fixed locations in the service area, and subscribers may provide responses. 3 The rules governing IVDS were adopted in 1992 in Gen. Docket No. 91&hyph;2. 4 In that proceeding, the Commission decided to define specific service areas and license IVDS channels in these areas on an exclusive basis. As so defined, the IVDS has 734 service areas, with two licenses of 500 kilohertz each (218.0&hyph;218.5 and 218.5&hyph;219.0 MHz) available in each area. 5 In the event of mutually exclusive applications 6 for license, the Commission decided in that earlier proceeding to use the lottery processes specified in our rules. 7 3 Service offerings might include subscriber opportunities to provide real-time responses to educational and pay-per-view programming, commercial data applications such as home banking, and the downloading of data. See Report and Order in Gen. Docket No. 91&hyph;2, 7 FCC Rcd 1630, 1630 ¶2, 1637 ¶54 (1992). 4 Report and Order, supra note 3; see 47 CFR part 95, Subpart F. 5 See 47 C.F.R. §§95.803, 95.853. IVDS service or market areas are defined in terms of the 734 cellular system service areas. See Public Notice, Report No. 92&hyph;40, released January 24, 1992; 47 C.F.R. 22.903 (cellular). Many of these service areas cover rural or remote, sparsely populated areas. 6 The Commission, in general, ``considers two or more applications to be `mutually exclusive' if their conflicts are such that the grant of one application would effectively preclude, by reason of harmful electrical interference, the grant of one or more of the other applications.'' Second Report and Order at ¶12 n. 5. 7 See 47 CFR 1.972 (1992). On September 15, 1993, a lottery for nine IVDS markets was conducted. This lottery was permitted under the Budget Act described below, the pertinent applications having been accepted for filing by the Commission prior to July 26, 1993. See Budget Act, infra note 8, §6002(e).
