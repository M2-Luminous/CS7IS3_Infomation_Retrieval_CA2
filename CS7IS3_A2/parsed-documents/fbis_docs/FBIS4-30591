The nominations followed the common practice of choosing the most-elected lawmakers, and no outstanding exceptions emerged. But this was President Kim's first national lineup after December's large-scale reshuffle of his party and the government and last April's dismissal of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, the reason the nominations raised political antennae. The new house speaker and assembly committee chairmen will be tasked with supporting the latter half of Kim's presidential term and adapting to changing circumstances in inter-Korean relations and the post-Uruguay Round trade climate, among other things. Local autonomy elections are coming up in June next year, and a massive redrawing of the DLP camp is looming late this year or in early 1995. President Kim most certainly had this in mind when he made the nominations. In this context, Rep. Hwang Nak-chu was selected as house speaker, even though his nomination entailed a minor political gamble. The reason: Hwang was vice speaker when the ruling camp railroaded the new budget bill through the assembly last year. The decision to promote Hwang reflects Kim's determination not to be elbowed aside in ruling-opposition party relations. Rumor has it that the current house speaker, Yi Man-sop, will stay and that Rep. Kim Yong-tae will be tapped as his deputy in a goodwill gesture to the "TK forces," the acronym for those from Taegu and North Kyongsang Province, and in consideration of the upcoming by-election in Taegu. Moreover, Reps. Kim Yong-tae and Kim Han-kyu were included in the list to appease the TK forces after the changing of the house speaker. Rep. Yi Chun-ku, who has the president's personal trust, won the bid for house vice speaker in competition with Rep. Kim. The house posts were filled with political considerations in mind, but National Assembly committee positions were meant to respond to the issue of regional and factional balance. Floor leader Yi Han-tong orignally drew up a list that gave more than half of the committee chairmen posts to lawmakers from Pusan and South Kyongsang Province. Secretary-general Mun Chong-su, however, changed the list before it was sent to the president. In the end, the most expected nominees, Kim Pong-cho and Chong Che-mun, were absent from the list -- An indication of how important attaining a regional balance was. The final outcome stood at two from Pusan, two each for Taegu, Seoul, Kyonggi Province, Inchon and North Chungchong Province, one each from North Cholla Province and South Chungchong Province, and one lawmaker from a national constituency. All of the choices, except for Rep. Pak Hui-tae and Sin Kyong-sik, are old-timers who have served three terms or more in office. The last-minute dilemmas concerned the chairmen of the foreign affairs-national unification, finance, national defense and culture and information committees. The DLP is planning on replacing all chiefs of city and provincial offices with three-term or more lawmakers next month and also on reshuffling party executive posts, foreshadowing a stormy summer ahead.
