None of them is fully articulated, but it is obvious that the Russian initiative is the most serious one as it requires that the issue of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina be resolved at a summit between the major powers, or rather the most responsible powers, Yugoslav Foreign Affairs Minister Vladislav Jovanovic stated in the Hallmark of Time program broadcast on Kragujevac Radio [Serbia]. The fact is, the federal foreign minister said, that there is no other place that is more suitable nor any other participants more competent to take steps toward peace. Commenting on other proposals, and the West's refusal to offer support to the Russian initiative, Jovanovic said: "There have been some proposals favoring small steps and referring to lower level meetings under the pretext that larger steps require longer preparation. It is difficult to say whether they are only a way to prevent the acceptance of the Russian initiative, or whether they are guided by rational reasons. At the moment it seems to be more important to prevent the Russian initiative than to offer another alternative plan that would be as good and as useful."
