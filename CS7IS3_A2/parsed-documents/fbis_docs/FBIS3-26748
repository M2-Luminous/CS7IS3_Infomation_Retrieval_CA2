Regional party committee Secretary Zhao Fulin delivered a speech at the tea party in which he stated: Over the past year, we in Guangxi have actively and comprehensively implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the spirit of both the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 14th CPC Central Committee; seized each and every opportunity to speed up reform and development under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and scored noticeable results in all fields of endeavors. Comrade Zhao Fulin stressed: We have scored these achievements mainly because we have united as one and worked hard under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. The CPPCC organizations at all levels in Guangxi also have made invaluable contributions to the region by conscientiously carrying out political consultation and democratic supervision. In addition, the regional branches of various democratic parties, the regional federation of industry and commerce, as well as patriotic figures without party affiliation in the region also have actively played their respective roles and done much fruitful work to this end. After expressing thanks to all comrades concerned on behalf of the regional party committee and people's government, Comrade Zhao Fulin noted that the year 1994 is a crucial one in which Guangxi will strive to accelerate reform and development, and he called for concentrating on the following five aspects of work in 1994: 1) To seize each and every excellent opportunity to speed up reform; 2) To continually readjust industrial structure and accelerate economic growth; 3) To continually make painstaking efforts to build a link between the Southwest and coastal areas, and further expand opening up to the outside world; 4) To safeguard social and political stability, and protect and mobilize enthusiasm among the broad masses of people; 5) To further step up party building and clean government building. Comrade Zhao Fulin expressed the hope that the CPPCC organizations, the branches of various democratic parties, and the federations of industry and commerce at all levels across the region will continue in 1994, as they have always done, to support, cooperate with, and assist the party committees and people's governments at all levels and make more contributions to Guangxi's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization drive. Wu Keqing, vice chairman of the regional CPPCC committee, delivered a speech at the tea party on behalf of the regional branches of various democratic parties and the regional federation of industry and commerce.
