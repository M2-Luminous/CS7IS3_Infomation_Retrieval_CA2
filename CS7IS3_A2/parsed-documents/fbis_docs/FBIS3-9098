[Begin reporting] [Vranjes] In today's exchange the Croat side released 500 captured members of the Muslim army from the prison in Rodoc near Mostar. This afternoon they crossed over to the [Muslim-held] eastern part of Mostar, some of them went to Jablanica, and 20 went to their homes in the [Croat-held] western part of Mostar. The Muslim side released 72 captured HVO members from prisons in the eastern part of Mostar and 294 from the prison in Bugojno. The former prisoners crossed from the eastern to the western part of the town this afternoon. Released prisoners from Bugojno have also arrived in Mostar this evening.
