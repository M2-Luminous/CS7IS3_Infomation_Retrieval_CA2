The massive files relating to Oswald, who lived in Minsk for some time, are in the archives of the Belarusian KGB. According to Shirkovskiy, "the Oswald files are classified, and in the absence of parliamentary resolution on the destiny of the KGB archives it's impossible to hand these materials to any one."
