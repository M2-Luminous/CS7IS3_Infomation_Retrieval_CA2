FR940406-1-00004 FR940406-1-00001 According to a 1986 report to Congress by the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Government Operations, families, especially those composed of women and children, are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population nationwide (report cited by the National Advisory Council on Maternal, Infant, and Fetal Nutrition, 1992 Biennial Report to Congress on WIC and CSFP (Commodity Supplemental Food Program)). Although the homeless have not been well studied relative to other population groups, several studies have indicated that the homeless and migrants are predisposed to inadequacies in their diets and in the medical care they receive. Homeless infants and children appear to be at higher risk of low birthweight and malnutrition. (Chavkin, Kristal, Seabron, and Guigli, 1987). Studies have also found that a correlation exists between homelessness in women and a general lack of prenatal care and poor pregnancy outcomes. Homelessness may also impede access to health care services and other public assistance programs. Moreover, evidence indicates that homeless children have high rates of delayed immunization, a higher risk of exposure to infectious diseases, and higher rates of emotional and developmental problems. (Khan, 1991). Because of the difficulty in conducting research on the homeless, most studies have focused on the sheltered homeless. The risks to unsheltered homeless mothers and children are likely to be somewhat greater. A recent study indicates that migrants suffer most if not all of the conditions identified above afflicting the homeless. (Farmworkers Health for the Year 2000, 1992 Recommendation of the National Advisory Council on Migrant Health). In addition, testimony before the National Advisory Council on Migrant Health of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) suggests that a lack of permanent housing also predisposes migrants to higher rates of infant mortality than the general population. Over the years, FNS has incorporated into the WIC Program regulations various provisions with the expressed purpose of addressing the unique circumstances of migrant farmworkers. State plans are required to include information on how the State intends to provide program benefits to eligible migrant farmworkers and their families; State agencies' nutrition education goals and action plans must include a description of the methods that will be used to meet the special nutrition education needs of migrant farmworkers and their families; and, States must provide expedited processing services to special nutritional risk groups such as migrant farmworkers and their families. Because of the increased risks associated with homelessness and migrancy, the National Advisory Council on Maternal, Infant, and Fetal Nutrition recommended in its 1992 Report to the President and Congress that section 17(b)(8) of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, 42 U.S.C. 1786(b)(8), be amended to include homelessness and migrancy as predisposing nutritional risk conditions for the WIC Program. Congress and the President accepted this recommendation and, as manifested in section 204 of the Child Nutrition Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;342, specifically identified homelessness and migrancy as predisposing nutritional risk conditions for purposes of WIC Program eligibility. Definition of Homelessness/Migrancy As previously stated, the current definition of a ``homeless individual'' in the WIC regulations is based on the legislative definition provided in section 212(a) of the Hunger Prevention Act, Public Law 100&hyph;435 (42 U.S.C. 1786 (b)(15). Specifically, 7 CFR 246.2 defines a ``homeless individual'' as ``a woman, infant or child who lacks a fixed and regular nighttime residence; or whose primary nighttime residence is: A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter (including a welfare hotel, a congregate shelter, or a shelter for victims of domestic violence) designated to provide temporary living accommodation; an institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized; a temporary accommodation in the residence of another individual; or a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings.'' The Department believes this definition, along with its current migrant farmworker definition, should accommodate all individuals Congress intended to include in their references to homelessness and migrancy in section 204 of the Child Nutrition Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;342.
