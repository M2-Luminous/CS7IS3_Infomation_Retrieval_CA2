FR940804-1-00016 FR940804-1-00005 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [IL70&hyph;1&hyph;6254B; FRL&hyph;5027&hyph;3] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plan; Illinois AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve a February 11, 1993, State submittal requesting a revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP) for carbon monoxide (CO). The revision pertains to a site-specific emission limit for a iron foundry operated by General Motors Corporation (GMC) and located adjacent to Interstate 74 at G Street in Vermilion County, Illinois. Vermilion County has been designated by USEPA as ``unclassifiable/attainment'' for carbon monoxide. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the USEPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested in commenting on this notice should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received on or before September 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be mailed to: J. Elmer Bortzer, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (5AR&hyph;18J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60606. Copies of the State submittal and USEPA's analysis of it are available for inspection at: Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (5AR&hyph;18J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Fayette Bright, Environmental Protection Specialist, Regulation Development Branch (5AR&hyph;18J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: For additional information see the direct final rule published in the rules section of this Federal Register . Dated: June 16, 1994. Valdas V. Adamkus, Regional Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18956 Filed 8&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
