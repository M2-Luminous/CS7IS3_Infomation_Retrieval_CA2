The Middle East peacemaking process, which Egypt actively supports, was one of the issues which you addressed. Do you believe it was the Palestinians who had to make the greatest concessions? [Musa] I would not speak of "concessions," but I would rather highlight the fact that this was the first step in a long process leading to self-determination for Palestinians. They have now obtained certain territories. We do not think the issue now is to discuss the importance of these territories. The very fact that the Israelis have withdrawn from the territories and that power has been restored directly to the Palestinians, rather than to the Egyptians or the Jordanians, is itself a major political, psychological, and territorial step forward. True, there are limitations and conditions imposed on the Palestinians, because this is only the first step. [Loos] When PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat refused to sign a document as part of the conclusion of the Israeli-Palestinan agreement, 15 days ago in Cairo, it seems your president, Husni Mubarak, became very angry... [Musa] I can only say that a last-minute problem did in fact arise. However, 'Arafat had a just claim to put forward at that time, and this point was solved immediately, when (Israeli Prime Minister) Rabin's letter, which had to be attached to the documents, was indeed annexed to the latter. All this can undoubtedly be explained by the long night spent in discussions, just before the agreement was signed. In Cairo, you saw the tip of the iceberg of the kind of problems encountered at every step by the parties engaged in the negotiations. Jewish Settlements Are Dangerous. [Loos] Many Palestinians criticize the fact that the agreement does not contemplate putting a stop to Jewish settlements in the territories. [Musa] This is a very serious issue which must be tackled immediately, and Israel should be advised not to continue to expand the settlements, because such a policy is essentially very dangerous and is harmful to the peace process. I believe this makes sense, and that Israel is aware of it. [Loos] What is you assessment of the problems encounterd by the PLO in its relations with the World Bank, which is acting as an intermediary between Palestinian autonomy and the donor countries? [Musa] The problem lies in 'Arafat leading the PLO, considering there is now a territory, and citizens. The objective is to transform a resistance organization into an administration, and it has taken some time to assess the situation. I believe the problems have now been largely overcome. [Loos] What is your message to the numerous Israelis who reproach Egypt for agreeing only to a "cold peace?" [Musa] This sort of reproach is the language of the past. We do not understand the term "cold peace." Peace is peace. We have peaceful, normal relations with Israel, which are following their course and developing. [Loos] Egypt is considered the U.S.' best Arab ally in the region. On the other hand, does your country not view a number of issues rather differently? [Musa] We do in fact have excellent relations with the United States. However, we do not share the same views on certain problems such as Somalia, Libya, and regional disarmament. Sanctions: It is up to the Iraqi Leadership [Loos] What about Iraq? [Musa] Iraq must comply with the UN resolutions, which it seems to be doing. Also, in order to enter a new era, it must formally renounce any claims on Kuwait and recognize the latter as an independent country, one which cannot live for ever exposed to such a threat. [Loos] You have said that the sanctions were penalizing the Iraqi people excessively... [Musa] Everybody knows that, including Iraq's leaders. It is up to them to diminish the suffering, and they know what must be done for this to happen. But it would be a mistake to believe that the world can forget their adventure in Kuwait without a political and legal change taking place. Having said this, I must add that we are prepared to contribute to helping the Iraqi people, as members of the United Nations and the Arab League. [Loos] What can Egypt do to help extinguish the conflict in Yemen? [Musa] We asked for a meeting of the Arab League, but things have rapidly developed out of control. We believe the solution must include three aspects: a cease-fire, a withdrawal of troops, and resuming negotiations immediately on the basis of the Amman agreement, which was signed between the two sides on 20 February but never implemented. We are in touch with both sides, but some are hoping for a military victory in the field. It must become clear that war leads nowhere, that the country must remain united, but without resorting to arms, because this would mean long-term instability.
