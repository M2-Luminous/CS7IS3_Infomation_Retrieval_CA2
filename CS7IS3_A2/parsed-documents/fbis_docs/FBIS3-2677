In his speech, Chen set the following six tasks: Developing rural economy, improving operation of large- and medium-sized state- owned enterprises, optimizing investment structure, opening wider to the outside world, expanding scientific, technological and educational undertakings and improving the people's livelihood continuously. He said that China will continue to strengthen the agricultural base, invigorate the rural economy and increase peasants' income, all of which "has an important bearing on the nation's economic development and social stability," he said. The country will make every effort to obtain a good harvest and retain a steady, high and increasing output of such principal products as grain, cotton and oil bearing crops, he said. China is planning to turn out 450 million tons of grain, 4.85 million tons of cotton and 17.65 million tons of oil bearing crops. He urged localities to protect arable land, slash the financial burden on farmers, raise purchasing prices of grain and cotton, develop highly efficient farming, step up construction of agricultural infrastructure, boost investment in the sector, accelerate application of scientific and technological advances to agriculture, expand township enterprises and help the poverty- stricken rural areas. "Irrational economic structure and poor efficiency are currently the prominent problems of the economic development of China," he said. He urged industries to focus on optimizing the structure and improving performance and to maintain an effective growth rate through deepening of the reform, opening of new markets, strengthening of management and accelerating technological progress. "The current volume of total investment in fixed assets is already large," he said. It is necessary to bring this runaway investment growth under strict control by focusing the work on optimizing investment structure and improving economic returns of investment. He said that, of the total investment in fixed assets in state- owned enterprises and institutions this year, 485 billion yuan will go to capital construction, 250 billion yuan to updating of technology and 80 billion yuan to development of real estate. In line with industrial policies, China will "increase investment in the construction of infrastructure, basic industries and key industries, use the additional state investment this year mainly in projects for agriculture, water conservancy, transport, telecommunications, energy, necessary raw and semi-finished materials, electronics, science and technology and education," he said. The government will increase investment in the development of natural resources in the central and western regions of China. He also urged the country to open wider to the outside world and vigorously and effectively use foreign funds, resources, technologies and markets. He said that the country should realize economic growth on the basis of scientific and technological progress and the development of education. He urged governments at all levels to vigorously promote advances in industrial technology, develop key scientific and technological projects and key industrial projects that are important to economic and social development, quicken the commercialization, industrialization and internationalization of China's own high and new technologies, strengthen the infrastructure for scientific research and develop a strong contingent of technical personnel. He said that the government should keep education in a strategic position, strengthen elementary education, increase investment in education and improve the living conditions of school teachers. He called for continual improvement of the living standards of the people on the basis of economic growth and increased labor productivity. "To meet the need of continued reforms and maintain social stability, we will gradually establish a multi-form, multi-tier social security system," he said. He pointed out that promoting all-round progress in social undertakings is an important task of macro-controls by the state. This year, the government will formulate an outline program for a nationwide development of social undertakings to guide work in this regard, he said.
