Denktas headed today's Council of Ministers meeting in which the recent developments on the Cyprus issue and various domestic issues were assessed. In a statement [issued] prior to the cabinet meeting, Denktas said that the Cyprus question can be solved only by Turkish and Greek Cypriots and called on the Greek Cypriot side to abandon the arms race. He said: Let us sign a nonaggression pact. Let us move toward disarmament within an atmosphere of trust to be created by such a pact, on condition that we preserve the guarantee agreement. Let us create a new atmosphere. Recalling that the Cyprus Republic was a partnership republic established by the Turkish and Greek Cypriots, Denktas said: [Begin Denktas recording] For the past 30 years, we have been unable to form a government in Cyprus that represents the entire community on the island just because one of the sides claims to be the Cyprus Government, and because the Security Council has accepted this claim to suit the interests of certain Council member countries. This is the problem. The problem is that, for the past 30 years, the Greek Cypriot side, through the use of arms, has been occupying the position that is said to represent Cyprus. The problem is that the Greek Cypriot side believes it can continue this occupation and is obstinate about it. As long as this obstinacy continues, and as long as the two communities on the island do not find the opportunity to get together to discuss and solve their problems, this problem cannot be solved. We have seen that for the past 30 years, the Security Council and the United Nations have been unable to solve this problem. The sole reason for this failure is recognition of the Greek Cypriot Administration as the legitimate Cyprus Government. There is no other reason whatsoever. [end recording] Denktas stated that the current negotiating process is a waste of time and called on the sides involved in the Cyprus conflict to make a new assessment and reach an agreement.
