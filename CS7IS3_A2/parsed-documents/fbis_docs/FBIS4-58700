[passage omitted]. Faysal al-Husayni, the senior Palestinian leader in the West Bank and Yasir 'Arafat's lieutenant there, said Jericho and other issues such as Jewish settlements would create problems for the agreement. He told Middle East correspondent Tony Hill that the signing of the agreement in Cairo would now bring changes, but it was still of concern to many Palestinians. [Begin recording] [Al-Husayni] Fortunately there will be a change, but we are worried because we know that there are some articles in this agreement which can create a real tendency to (?so complicate it) and the Israelis are insisting that to keep some articles there which we know very well that it will be obstacle for any solution in the future. [Hill] You said the day before that you believe Mr 'Arafat should not sign this agreement under these present circumstances. Should he have signed it in Cairo? [Al-Husayni] I don't know what he writes on the map before he signed it but he put a long statement which means that he was signing on it under very bad circumstances that he found himself forced to write something before signing on it. [Hill] Isn't this a matter of public confidence in this agreement and won't that problem in Cairo over the signing only undermine that public confidence in this agreement? [Al-Husayni] A lot of problems will created, a lot of price will be paid until the Israelis will convince that what they are asking us now is unpractical and unrational [as heard]. [Hill] So you believe this agreement as it stands now may not succeed? [Al-Husayni] I believe that this agreement as it is now and if the Israelis will try to implement it literally, it will cost a lot of us a high price, but in the end the Israelis will discover that this is not the way. [Hill] What can Yasir 'Arafat and Palestinian leaders like you do then to make sure this agreement does succeed as it is signed? [Al-Husayni] First I was hoping that it will not be signed today [4 May] before making these changes. As far as it was signed today, so we will do everything to improve it in the right way, and to show the Israelis from the beginning where is the points which is not right points to be there and to convince them to take it out [as heard]. [Hill] There has only been a very quiet response from Palestinians in the occupied territories. Do you now feel an urgency to try to get some real changes quickly on the ground to improve confidence? [Al-Husayni] Yes, the only thing that can bring back this confidence is the implementations on the ground and that's what we are insisting on now. [end recording]
