Following the energy minister's report, National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh delivered a speech and highly appraised the completion of the power line, a major project of our nation. He said: [Begin Nong Duc Manh recording] "Today, we are very pleased to hear Energy Minister Thai Phung Ne's report on the construction and completion of the North-South 500-kilovolt power line, a major and significant project of our nation. We welcome the government's close guidance and the uniform and urgent construction work carried out by various sectors, echelons, and localities. We highly commend the spirit of diligence, intelligence, creativity, and boldness shown by all cadres, workers, and the people to overcome numerous difficulties and acute ordeals during the building process. They have, indeed, contributed great efforts and energy to and made sacrifices for the completion of this important project. We would like also to thank our friends from around the world for their assistance to this project. "Through the construction of this power line, we have not only built a competent contingent of scientific-technological cadres for the Vietnam electric sector, but we have also asserted new progress and our maturity in this field. This proves that we are able to build and manage major and modern projects. Also, through this project we have drawn valuable lessons in mobilizing workers, integrating the combined strengths of our nation, and attracting international cooperation in the new situation for the renovation undertaking. "The North-South power line is the backbone grid of our national electric network. It is one of the most significant infrastructure projects built with an aim to attain national industrialization and modernization. Henceforth, our history records another route linking the North with the South, that is the 500-kilovolt power line. This is another manifestation of our unity and the unification of our fatherland. "The successful construction of the project is very significant, yet effective and safe operation of the power line is much more important. I hope that the electric sector, while bringing its achievements into full play, will closely coordinate with various echelons, sectors, and localities to strictly protect this power line. All responsible agencies must strive to effectively use this project while ensuring its optimal safety. "On this occasion, through the Minister of Energy, we would like to extend our kind regard and best wishes to cadres and workers of the electric sector and those who participated in the construction of this project. We wish all of you a good health and ever greater achievements so as to positively contribute, together with people throughout the country, to attaining the objectives of making our people prosperous, our nation powerful, and our society just and civilized." [End recording] Dear friends, also at this morning session, National Assembly deputies debated the implementation of the socioeconomic development program during the first half of this year. All deputies expressed their unanimous views of the government's report appraising the situation in four major domains namely the economy, society, international cooperation, and state management. Regarding our legal system, many deputies held that we still are in need of more laws. They noted, however, that although many laws were promulgated, their enforcement was not effective because of the lack of proper guiding documents.
