Melara Granillo added, however, that experience shows that continuous pursuit can lead to heavy blows against drug trafficking, such as those delivered by the Drug Interdiction Executive Unit [UEA] in 1993. The unit reported five major seizures totalling 2.3 billion colones worth of cocaine. The official told LA PRENSA GRAFICA that "had we not intercepted the drugs, they would have harmed thousands of people, if not in our country, surely in those for which it was bound. This is not only a violation of human rights but a violent attack against the victims who have fallen into the clutches of this world-wide plague." Melara Granillo believes drug trafficking is primarily an insidious activity in pursuit of absolutely selfish, evil purposes. He acknowledged that drug trafficking is highly profitable but said such economic benefits are immoral. The Prosecutor General's Office is well aware of its position regarding drug trafficking. It is making painstaking efforts to fight this enemy with the law to see that those responsible are tried and punished with the full force of the law. Melara Granillo has been prosecutor general for five and one-half months now, during which he has confirmed the seizure of 121.598 million colones worth of cocaine. The drugs were intercepted at El Pulido landing strip in Melara Canton, La Libertad Municipality. He has also certified the seizure of a second shipment worth 700 million colones at the San Jorge industrial complex on the road to San Antonio Abad in San Salvador. A third seizure took place 42 km off the coast of Puerto Acajutla, Sonsonate, and included a total of 300 million colones in drugs. The prosecutor general pointed out that never before has there been such a relentless pursuit in El Salvador but added that there are many clandestine landing strips remaining from the war. There is no radar system to detect illegal aircraft. Melara said "this is a paradise stopover that the armies of drug traffickers have taken advantage of, because they have the technological and economical resources to operate in countries such as ours." He indicated that despite all the institution's efforts, it still faces serious financial and personnel limitations when the ideal scenario would be for it to grow so as to face the challenges of 1994.
