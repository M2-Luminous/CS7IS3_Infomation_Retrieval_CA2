According to a military source, the puppet Army's tank corps, which was deployed in areas around Chomwon-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi Province, near the Demilitarized Zone of the Military Demarcation Line on 4 February, staged a ground offensive operation exercise intended for Northward aggression under coordination between mechanized units and infantry troops. In addition, the puppet Army's large-caliber gun troops, which advanced to the area in Kajon-ri, Imje County, Kangwon Province in South Korea, took a posture of firing at our side, thus gravely irritating us. That day, armed hooligans of the puppet Army, who occupied combat positions in areas around Nosang-ri, Ogum-ri and Yongsan-ri in Paju County, fired at random more than 1,000 bullets of large-caliber machine guns and automatic rifles, thus reeking of gunpowder. In addition, more than 10 armed helicopters and transportation helicopters of the puppet Army, which were mobilized in the air above Yonchon and Pochon in Kyonggi Province and Chupa-ri, Chorwon County in South Korean Kangwon Province, staged exercises of supporting ground troops, dropping special units and transporting operational equipment, while making low-altitude and super low-altitude flights. In parallel with exercises of a Northward war of aggression, the puppets are running amok with arms buildup maneuvers. It is a fact already exposed to the public that the puppets are scheming to bring Patriot missiles to South Korea in collusion with the United States. In addition, the puppets recently decided to buy three more German-made submarines. Bellicose and violent remarks, such as preparations for a combat posture, fostering combat capabilities and so forth, were put forward during the recent conference of the puppet Marine Corps commanders. War exercises and arms buildup maneuvers, which have been further strengthened in South Korea, clearly show how frantically the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is running amok with maneuvers of preparations for a Northward war of aggression. The puppets justify their arms buildup and war exercises by saying they were prompted by the threat of someone else. However, this is a brazen-faced sophism. The danger of war on the Korean peninsula comes from the South, not from the North, therefore, the one who is subject to threat is not South Korea, but our Republic. The United States and South Korean puppets always keep in combat posture tens of thousands of U.S. Forces in South Korea, who are armed with modern war equipment, and nearly 1 million of the puppet Army. They are also scheming to bring dark, dangerous clouds of war by attempting to stage, by all means, large-scale exercises of Northward aggression, including the Team Spirit joint military exercise. Moreover, the United States has recently forced brigandish full-scope inspection [kangdojogin chonmyon sachal] on us on the pretext of our nonexistent nuclear problem. By designating even a deadline, the United States assumed a final notice-like attitude [choehu tongchopsiguro naoda] by raving about sanctions and the like. Despite this fact, the puppets made gibberish about someone else's threat and so forth. This is no more than a sophism designed to mislead public opinion and to justify their adventurous maneuvers of Northward aggression. All fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and overseas, who designated this year as the year of great national unity, are hoping that a breakthrough is opened for reconciliation and unity in conformity with the nation's enhanced zeal for reunification. Therefore, the North and the South should discard war exercises and arms buildup that go counter to the nation's aspiration and demand. As long as war maneuvers continue, reconciliation and unity between the North and the South cannot be achieved nor can peace and reunification of the nation be realized. Instead, tensions will be aggravated and only confrontation and war will be brought about. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is frantically running amok with maneuvers of a Northward war of aggression to attack fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces. This is indeed an intolerable antinational and antireunification criminal act that challenges fellow countrymen's aspiration to reunification, which goes against the nation's reconciliation and unity, and which leads the situation to the brink of war. It became clearer that the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime, which is running amok with war maneuvers against fellow countrymen under a veil of a civilian government, is the separatist regime opposing reunification and a group of national traitors who pursue only confrontation and war. As long as the Kim Yong-sam group, which is not interested in peace, reunification, and fellow countrymen; remains in power, our nation cannot avoid suffering disaster of nuclear war. There is nothing to increase hope and expect from the traitorous Kim Yong-sam regime. It is natural for the South Korean people to call for overthrowing the civilian warmongers. The South Korean people, who want the nation's reconciliation and unity and who aspire to peace and reunification, absolutely will not pardon the Kim Yong-sam clique, a group of warmongers.
