A total of nine (9) measures were included in the Capital Region Airport Authority recommended program. Of the nine (9) measures, two (2) are listed as ``Noise Abatement Plan Measures,'' two (2) are listed as ``Program Management Measures,'' and five (5) are listed as ``Land Use Management Plan.'' The FAA has approved all of the nine (9) measures. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of the FAA's approval of the Capital City Airport noise compatibility program is January 21, 1994.

The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel. Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR part 150 program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in part 150 and the Act, and is limited to the following determinations: a.
