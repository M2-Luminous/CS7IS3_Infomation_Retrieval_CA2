The two countries shared this view during talks between Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed and General Secretary of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Communist Party of Vietnam Do Muoi, an aide to Do Muoi said. The aide said that the U.S. military reinforcement in South Korea was "unwarranted and an act of provocation against the North", adding: "This spectacular military display by Washington against Pyongyang must be taken seriously." The aide contended that Washington had triggered tensions in the Korean peninsula in the hope of diverting world attention away from growing U.S. domestic problems, President Bill Clinton's fate in the "Whitewater scandal" and other issues.
