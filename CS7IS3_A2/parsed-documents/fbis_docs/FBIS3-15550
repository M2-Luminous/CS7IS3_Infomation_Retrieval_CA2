But it cannot afford this now because it has no financial means," Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said. Speaking at a news conference devoted to the results of his visit to the United States in New York City on Monday, Kravchuk said that the termination of Russian gas supplies to Ukraine may worsen the economic crisis in the republic and cause a social explosion. "We did not stop holding talks with the Russian side on this issue. They have been held on a permanent basis. We have really no money to pay in hard currency. The paradox is that we can supply Russia with various manufactured goods for roubles -- for example railway carriages or pipes -- but Russian enterprises cannot buy them because they themselves have no money. We cannot earn hard currency either, because Ukraine has not so far received a quota for exports to the United States. It's a vicious circle," Kravchuk said.
