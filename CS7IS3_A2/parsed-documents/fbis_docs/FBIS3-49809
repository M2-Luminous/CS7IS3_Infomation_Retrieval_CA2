[passage omitted] "Since the rockets fell in areas controlled by the Bosnian Army, it appears that the raids came from the other side," he said. Aikman said the attacks had not been confirmed by either the UN or NATO, but that the two air raids had been witnessed by UN forces on the ground. [passage omitted] David Owen, the European Community's negotiator in the Bosnian conflict, said "a very substantial part" of the Croatian Army was operating in Bosnia and called on the international community "to react more firmly." Geneva conference spokesman John Mills refused to comment on the raids Friday [14 January]. A Bosnian Croat HVO spokesman in Mostar said he did not know to whom the helicopters belonged. "All I know is that these past few days Moslem forces have overflown Mostar, the Neretva river and Vitez," spokesman Veso Vegar said. "We suppose that the helicopters seen yesterday were Moslem, since the Serbs fired on them." [passage omitted] In the meantime, two people were killed and 23 wounded by shelling in Sarajevo Friday, hospital officials said.
