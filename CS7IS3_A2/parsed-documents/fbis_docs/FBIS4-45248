The republic was the first in the region to establish contacts with the United Nations in fighting the spread of drugs. Therefore the United Nations is willing to support Kyrgyzstan in addressing this issue. The state commission for control over drug trafficking will be provided with technical assistance: video films, laboratory equipment, and a car, worth a total of $500,000. A special program will be adopted which envisions cooperation aimed at upgrading legislation related to drug abuse, consultations, training of experts, and sharing information. An office of the UN's fund for drug abuse has been set up in Tashkent. It will also assist Kyrgyzstan.
