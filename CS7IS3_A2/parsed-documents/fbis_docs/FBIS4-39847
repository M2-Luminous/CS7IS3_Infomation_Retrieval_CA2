Akayev explained the emigration of ethnic Russians from Kirghizia by the imperfection of the local economic reform which cause a slump in the living standards and overall disillusionment. According to Akayev, 918,000 ethnic Russians lived in Kirghizia back in 1990. They accounted for 21.2 percent of the Republic's overall population. As of 1 April 1994, though, there were some 750,000 ethnic Russians in Kirghizia. They made up 17 percent of the overall population. In four years, Akayev said, 170,000 Russians had left Kirghizia. That inflicted irreparable damages on the Kirghiz economy. Akayev agreed that the social and political problems, for example the introduction of Kirghiz as the Republic's official language, were largely to blame for the wave of emigration. And, Akayev said, Russian-speaking entrepreneurs stood little chance in Kirghizia, and discrimination against ethnic Russians was, indeed, a fact of everyday life.
