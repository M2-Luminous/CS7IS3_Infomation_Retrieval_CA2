The regulation, which is aimed to stress implementation of the compulsory education law, noted that at the beginning of each semester, parents and guardians of school-age children must ensure that the children enter school to receive compulsory education. The compulsory education period in China lasts nine years including six years for primary school and three years for junior secondary school. Beijing adopted an educational inspection system in 1986. Now 14 counties and districts in the city have set up educational inspectors' offices. Recently, the Beijing municipal government appointed a group of new educational inspectors to supervise the implementation of the compulsory education law in the city. Song Baozhang, one of the inspectors of the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, said that there are now 1.46 million youngsters who are studying at primary schools and junior secondary schools in Beijing. The schooling rate at primary schools in Beijing reached 99.9 percent and the rate at junior secondary schools was 99.92 percent, Song said.
