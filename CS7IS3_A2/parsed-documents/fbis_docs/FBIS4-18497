I think that he has lost his nerve." This was the first reaction of Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, to the decision of Silvio Berlusconi to suspend negotiations with the League. People, Bossi continued, can see that Berlusconi has broken off talks because of the fact that he is the one who wants to take charge. In that case we have not made a mistake in understanding that with a virtual party [as received] we are marching toward an autocratic type of government. We must now safeguard democracy. His nerves have got to him because he is used to having everything his own way immediately. He now finds himself face to face with an entire people. This is a very powerful force."
