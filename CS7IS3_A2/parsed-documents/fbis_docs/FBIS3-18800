However, a precondition for that is better access to the markets in the region, Rexrodt will say at the traditional "East Asian Love Feast" of the East Asian Association in Hamburg on Friday [4 March] evening, according to the prereleased script of his speech. Asian products have almost unlimited access to the German and the European markets. "We wish for similarly good and fair conditions in Asia," the minister will say. Thus, foreign trade in particular is to be promoted, but also cooperation in the fields of science and technology, environment, development, education, and culture. Trade and industry are to be supported more intensively in their efforts by the German trade chambers on site, the Federal Office for Foreign Trade Information, and the German embassies. Already, 10 trade delegations or chambers are operating in the Asian-Pacific area. Other representations in Shanghai and Guangzou (China) are being planned. Hermes export guarantees and federal loan guarantees are to be issued in greater numbers to ensure direct investments. At the end of 1993 these investment guarantees in this region amounted to 1.8 billion German marks.
