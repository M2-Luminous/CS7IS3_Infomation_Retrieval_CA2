FR940419-1-00046 FR940419-1-00008 Thus, trade in specimens from some populations is not detrimental to the wild population, and commercial trade is allowed under CITES with proper export permits from certain countries of origin and re-exporting countries. The Service's concern has been that trade in non-endangered species has in the past provided the opportunity for specimens of the endangered species or populations to be commingled with legal trade, especially during the manufacturing process. Numerous U.S. law enforcement actions as well as past actions by the CITES Parties attest to this concern. The underlying premise behind this special rule is that the current management systems for the Appendix II populations of Nile crocodile with assigned export quotas and the Australia and Papua New Guinea populations of saltwater crocodile are being sufficiently sustained to support controlled commercial use; the key risk to these populations as well as other similar-appearing crocodilians, is inadequate controls in the countries of re-export, especially in those countries in which manufacturing occurs. The CITES Parties have adopted and are in the process of implementing provisions of a universal tagging system for crocodilian skins, and the Service supports these efforts. Adherence to the new marking requirements should reduce the potential for substitution of illegal skins and reduce the trade control problems with the similarity in appearance of skins and products among different species of crocodilians. Further, this proposed special rule contains other steps designed to ensure that the United States does not become a market for illegal trade in crocodilian species and to encourage other nations to control illegal trade. With the requirement that all skins are to be tagged up to the country of manufacture, and that manufacturers maintain records concerning the products produced from the tagged skins they receive, as well as document the chain of transactions preceding their acquisition of the skins, it is hoped that there will be greater accountability and accuracy in the manufacturing of crocodilian skins. In summary, the proposed special rule allowing limited trade in these saltwater crocodile and Nile crocodile populations should provide incentives to maintain wild populations, as well as encourage all countries involved in commerce in crocodilian species to guard against illegal trade. 1. Saltwater Crocodile. Allowing import of farm-raised specimens is expected to benefit the conservation of wild populations. Under Australia's conservation program, eggs or hatchlings are removed from the wild for crocodile farm operations under an approved management program, and wild populations are carefully monitored. Should any decline occur in the wild populations, the program would return a greater number of 1-year-old captive raised crocodiles to the wild than would have survived to that age in the wild had no eggs or hatchlings been removed. Limited trade with the United States would provide economic incentives for conserving wild populations and their habitats, owing to the dependence on them as the source of eggs. Careful regulation of take and the prescription of specific corrective actions ensure that crocodile farming activities will not cause declines of wild populations, and have the added potential of reversing declines caused by other factors. In addition, under this proposed special rule, parts or products of both the Australian and Papua New Guinea crocodile populations imported into the United States must be identified in accordance with the CITES marking system for crocodile skins and parts (refer to section on marking, and provisions of special rule). These marking requirements should ensure that only legally taken specimens are traded, and thus should also benefit the conservation of the species. 2. Nile crocodile. The appropriateness of the original endangered listing under the ESA and Appendix I listing under CITES has been the subject of much international debate. However, improvements in the status of Nile crocodile populations and their management have prompted the CITES Parties to transfer 11 national populations to Appendix II. The proposed downlisting to a ``threatened'' status does not end trade controls for the species. The species remains in Appendix II of CITES with export permits required. The proposed special rule should strengthen adherence to the CITES marking scheme for crocodilian skins as well as compliance with other CITES trade control provisions. Allowing commercial importation into the United States from CITES-approved countries is expected to benefit the species by encouraging proper conservation practices and by promoting adherence to the CITES marking system. Effects of the Proposed Rules This proposed rule, if made final, would change the status of the saltwater crocodile in Australia from endangered to threatened, and treat the saltwater crocodile in Papua New Guinea as threatened because of similarity of appearance so that the regulations specifically pertaining to threatened species (50 CFR 17.31, 17.32, 17.51, and 17.52) would apply to it. A special rule is proposed with this rule to amend 50 CFR 17.42 to allow the importation, under certain conditions, of whole and partial skins, and finished products thereof of Nile crocodile, which was previously reclassified as threatened (58 FR 49870), and saltwater crocodile that originate in Australia and Papua New Guinea, without a threatened species import permit for individual shipments otherwise required by 50 CFR part 17, if all requirements of the special rule are met. Importation of skins and other parts of Nile crocodile from countries where this species is listed in Appendix II of CITES and of the saltwater crocodile from Australia and Papua New Guinea will be allowed without part 17 permits only in the case of shipments imported directly from respective range countries to the United States. Otherwise, the provisions of the proposed special rule, when applicable, or all provisions of subpart D of 50 CFR part 17 shall apply to Nile and saltwater crocodiles, and their eggs, meat, skins, and other parts and products. Information Collection Requirements The proposed special rule contains no information collection requirements for which Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under 44 U.S.C. 4401 et seq. The import/export permits and other documentation requirements are those currently required in parts 17 and 23 of this title 50, which are currently approved by OMB clearance number 1018&hyph;0022. Public Comments Solicited The Service intends that any action resulting from this proposal be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, the trade industry, or any other interested party concerning any aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments are particularly sought concerning biological or commercial trade impacts on any saltwater crocodile populations, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to the wild populations throughout their range.
