Draft bill 2530/92, which is included in the executive branch message 36/92, has already been approved by the Chamber of Deputies Economy Committee and has a preliminary favorable opinion of coordinator Fabio Feldmann, of the Consumer Defense, Environment, and Minorities Committee. His advisers state that the report will be finished by the end of the month and will be included the amendments proposed by the Navy Ministry last week. The draft was also sent to the National Defense, Science and Technology, and Constitution and Justice Committees. Having been approved two by committees -- because the Foreign Ministry already has the approval of the Environment Committee -- the government will now ask for very urgent discussion of the bill using a procedure that sends the bill directly to the plenum without passing through other committees. Diplomatic sources have stated that the government wants to increase Brazilian credibility before the international community. To become a member of the MTCR, Congress must first approve the bill controlling the export of dual-purpose materiel. Congress must also ratify the quadripartite nuclear safeguards agreement among Brazil, Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control (ABACC), and the amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty that ban nuclear weapons in Latin America. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee postponed voting on both items last week. A diplomatic source commented: ``Brazil's participation in the MTCR comes under the nonproliferation policy.'' By approving the bill, Brazil will be prohibited from passing technologies received from industrialized countries to countries considered untrustworthy, such as Iraq, North Korea, and Libya. The bill sent to the Chamber of Deputies in August 1992 provides for the creation of an international importation certificate by which importers commit themselves to refrain from exporting certain goods without previous authorization of the appropriate Brazilian authorities. The bill also creates a delivery verification certificate to confirm the entry of the product into the importing country. The bill anticipates -- under the jurisdiction of the president of the Republic -- the creation of a permanent inter- ministerial commission comprising representatives of various ministries. The position of executive secretary will be filled by the Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE). In his preliminary report, Fabio Feldmann (PSDB-SP) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party - Sao Paulo] says: ``Military materiels, such as ammunition and explosives in any of their diverse forms, require strict controls on their handling, transport, and storage.''
