In his tour of Asian countries, Robaina said that economic and trade prospects with Indonesia are very promising and that the two countries are also interested in strengthening the Nonaligned Movement. Robaina added: During our visit to Bangkok we met with Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri. The meeting allowed us to study formulas to increase our economic ties. Our next visits to Asia will seek the same objective. Cuba is open to all forms of cooperation and, despite the U.S. pressure through the blockade, is day by day demonstrating its capacity to resist and its determination to succeed, Robaina concluded.
