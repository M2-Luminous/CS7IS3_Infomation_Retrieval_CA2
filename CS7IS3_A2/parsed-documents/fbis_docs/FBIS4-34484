Seven persons have left in the past few days. According to local observers, this indicates that the idea that violent actions are useless is beginning to take hold among the group that forcefully entered the building on 28 May. The Cuban Foreign Ministry today confirmed that whoever uses force to enter a diplomatic or consular installation in the country will lose the right to secure a visa to leave the country, even if they later leave the occupied diplomatic installation.
