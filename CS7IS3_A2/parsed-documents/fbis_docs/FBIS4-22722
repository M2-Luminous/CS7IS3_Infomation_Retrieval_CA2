This decision in fact provoked the war that is still lacerating this Balkan republic. SEGODNYA offers on this topic an interview with Vitaliy Churkin, special representative of the president of the Russian Federation in the former Yugoslavia and deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia, who returned from Zagreb the day before yesterday with a new diplomatic victory: With his direct assistance the leadership of Croatia and the leaders of the Serbs of Krajina reached agreement on an end to armed operations. [Shchedrunova] What, for all that, was the cause of the war in Bosnia, in your opinion? [Churkin] There was a historical structure going by the name of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, which, by virtue of certain political conditions, lasted for several decades. Then, when, in 1980, Tito died, it gradually began to weaken, and many experts began to express fears that it would collapse. This in fact happened. At the time of the disintegration of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia the most vulnerable spot was Bosnia-Hercegovina, where three national groups with complex historical relations were most closely intermingled. And they were unable at this difficult time to achieve political solutions that would have made it possible to avoid war. The fact that the international community moved in haste to recognize, specifically, Bosnia-Hercegovina did not, most likely, help either. This was done on the basis of the parties' preliminary accord on the plan of the Portuguese diplomat Cutellero. This plan, which was devised in March 1992, is reminiscent of the present proposal concerning the creation of a union of three states. After Bosnia had been recognized by the EC, a succession of other recognitions followed. The intention was very good--to support by the authority of the international community the new realities--but the result proved the opposite. The Muslims and Croats adopted a decision on independence without the consent of the Serbs. A war, which subsequently developed according to its own laws, began. It is not only soldiers who are fighting. Hostility has begun among the peaceful inhabitants also. [Shchedrunova] One has the impression that the Serbs have, for all that, won this war. [Churkin] Well, yes, certainly. There need be no doubt about this. This is their tragedy, to a certain extent. Because while they are asking why the international community is up in arms against them--they are capturing territory. They now control 72 percent of the territory, although even by their estimates they are entitled to 64 percent. Yes, in the military plane they have proven more successful. As for the question of who the aggressor in this war is, I have from the very outset employed the following wording, which was recently repeated by President Clinton, incidentally: It is a civil war aggravated by outside interference. This also is understandable. These were, after all, internal borders. And here is the conclusion the international community needs to draw: Some realities in the world exist independently of borders. Particularly when these are borders within a mononational state. Borders are borders, and the peoples lived cross-wise, paying no attention to them. The border of the conflict did not coincide with the borders of the republic. A more involved preliminary political period of a search for solutions should have been negotiated, obviously, before the proclamation of independence by the Muslims and Croats and the world community's recognition of it. [Shchedrunova] About the efforts of the world community. Following the London conference, which afforded some prospects, there has been a break in diplomatic work of many months. [Churkin] This is, indeed, the case. It seems to me that a principal reason for such a protracted conflict was the fact that originally the format of the coordinating committee created by the London conference was insufficiently convincing for the parties. Because neither Russia nor the United States were sufficiently vigorously engaged in this format. The United Nations and the EC lacked, for all that, sufficient political weight. Generally, granted all the respect for the EC, a conclusion is that a serious crisis, even if it is purely European, cannot be resolved by the EC independently. The inclusion of heavy artillery in the shape of Russia and the United States was needed. But under no circumstances can all efforts be turned into a purely Russian-American operation. Everything should be done in an alliance with the EC. And we have now approached the most successful option here. It was actually this new format--Russia, the United States, and the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, that is, the EC and the United Nations--which is at this stage the most effective, most likely--which emerged in Zagreb. Although not one guaranteeing rapid success. But I now have more of a feeling that the parties themselves have approached the fact that it is time to negotiate. [Shchedrunova] As far as the relations of Russia and the United States on this question are concerned. One sometimes has the impression that certain actions of Russia have been inspired by actions of the United States, that is, that Russia has tried to keep pace with it, as it were. [Churkin] I would not, to be honest, be opposed to such "socialist competition" with the Americans in respect to who would do more for a settlement of the situation in the former Yugoslavia, provided that we worked together, keeping one another informed. But as far as recent events (the signing of the agreement on the creation of a Croatian-Muslim federation in Washington and the agreement on a cease-fire between the Croats and the Serbs in Krajina in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb--Ye.Shch.) are concerned, this was pure coincidence. Before my last tour of the "towns and villages," which began on 11 March, it never crossed my mind even that such a round of negotiations would be organized in the Russian Embassy. Everything was born in the course of conversations with Tudjman and Milosevic, which left the impression that the parties were really interested in finally signing an agreement. I jumped at this. [Shchedrunova] Your opinion of the development of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Churkin] There are three or four sore points, agreement on which having been reached, the problem of the borders of the new republics could be resolved. The most important point is Sarajevo, where the parties' positions are directly opposite. Whereas the Muslims are saying that Sarajevo "must be ours," the Serbs are declaring that they cannot conceive of any kind of agreement without part of Sarajevo. We see as a solution the preservation of the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Sarajevo as the capital of this state. A capital consisting of two parts. The problem, true, will be how to reestablish normal life in the city in order that it not be divided. Despite the fact that politically it would belong to two parts of one and the same union. Specialists say that this is possible. But the division of territories is, of course, a complex issue, and rapid success is not to be expected here. As far as the plan for the entry of the new state formations on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina into a confederation with other states is concerned, the proposal according to which the Croatian-Muslim federation would form a confederation with Croatia, and the Serbian Republic, with Serbia, would seem perfectly fair. That is, Bosnia-Herzegovina would not wholly become part of a confederation with anyone. The Croats are not objecting to this plan. [Shchedrunova] But this would be unprecedented in world politics. [Churkin] Yes, this is a unique plan, but perhaps it would pave the way toward the solution of other conflicts also. But this needs to be approached very cautiously, for we are talking no more, no less, after all, about one state entering into confederative relations with part of another state.
