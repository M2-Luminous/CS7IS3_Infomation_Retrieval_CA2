He made clear that he did not authorize any large deployment, as had been reported by some peasant leaders over the last few days. He said that the social situation in that conflictive coca growing region requires that the institutions in charge of guaranteeing public security take the necessary measures to fulfill their objective. Gen. Caceres told PRESENCIA: "I don't know why they are making a fuss out of some military movements there. I am the one who gives the orders for the Army to move, and I have not given any orders in that sense. There are some things, however, that should be investigated, but this is a military matter." He said that military deployment anywhere in the country is fully supported by the Constitution, and that such action seeks only to preserve the constitutional guarantees of the Bolivian people. Asked about the official who ordered the military deployment in the tropical region of Cochabamba, Gen. Caceres said: "We don't need to ask permission of anyone, because to fulfill our mission effectively we need to move throughout the entire national territory. We do that constantly and routinely, and there is no reason why the public should be alarmed. Our presence anywhere should not be reason for alarm." He noted: "The Constitution clearly determines the mission of the Armed Forces, and we only fulfill that mission." Armed Forces Commander General Fernando Sanjines corroborated the comments made by Gen. Caceres, saying: "Of course the Armed Forces can be in any place at any time, like all the people, but basically there is no military deployment, and no order was given in that regard." On 19 May Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz said that the intelligence services of the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) found indications of the presence in the Chapare region of people linked to international drug trafficking, and that they are reportedly encouraging the formation of armed irregular groups in their service. In this regard the Army commander said this possibility should not be dismissed, and admitted that the Army intelligence services are evaluating the preliminary intelligence reports. Gen. Caceres said: "Nothing should be dismissed, as such indications do exist, which is why we should evaluate and investigate the reports. We cannot dismiss anything."
