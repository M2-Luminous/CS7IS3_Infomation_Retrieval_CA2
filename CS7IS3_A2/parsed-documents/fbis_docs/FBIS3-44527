This Standing Committee meeting is held when Comrade Mao Zedong's birth centenary is being marked. Members of the Standing Committee attended a commemoration meeting sponsored by the party Central Committee and paid their respects to the remains of Chairman Mao. At this standing committee meeting, Comrades Qian Qichen and Wen Jiabao made important reports on the international situation and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, respectively. Members of the Standing Committee put forward many good opinions and suggestions. This meeting has just adopted a "Decision on Studying and Implementing the `Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure,'" and we must conscientiously carry it out. Now I would like to discuss several views. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee was another extremely important meeting held in the course of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization in our country. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, held in December 1978, effected the strategic shift of the stress of work throughout the party, marking the great beginning of reform and opening up in our country. At that time, the stress of reform was put on rural areas. The Third Plenary Session of the 12th CPC Central Committee, held in October 1984, adopted the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on the Reform of the Economic Structure," indicating that the reform of the economic structure, with the stress on urban areas, was in full swing. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, held last month, adopted the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure," signaling that the reform of the economic structure in our country has entered the period of combining package reform with breakthroughs in key areas. This "decision" represents a profound summing up of historical experiences since the founding of the PRC, especially a profound summing up of experiences in reform and opening to the outside world over the past 15 years; and it is an overall plan for establishing a socialist market economic structure in our country as well as the program of action for reforming the economic structure in the nineties. Striving to carry out the tasks set out in the "decision" and to effect the transition from the old economic structure to a new one is of great practical and far-reaching historical significance for further liberating and developing the productive forces; accelerating the pace of reform, opening up, and modernization; and promoting the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Establishing and improving a socialist market economic structure is a great system-engineering project, a great practice of history- making by the Chinese people. In this process, it is inevitable to encounter many hardly predictable difficulties and unusually complicated situations. We must keep a clear head and make a full assessment of and preparations for all of this. We must understand that it is an entirely new undertaking to establish a socialist market economic structure. Human society thus far only has experience in developing the market economy under capitalism, and it is undoubtedly an unprecedented exploration to integrate the socialist system organically with the market economy. For a fairly long time after the founding of the PRC, we considered planning and the market to be criteria for distinguishing socialism from capitalism and took a critical and rejective attitude toward the market economy. As a result, people, including leading cadres at various levels, had little or no understanding of the general laws and key elements of the market economy. Through reform and opening to the outside world over the past decade and more, market regulation has gradually expanded; but we still have to familiarize ourselves with laws, principles, mechanisms, and international practices generally observed in the modern market economy. How to persevere in and give play to our political superiority under the conditions of a socialist market economy is also a new question for study. We must note that establishing a socialist market economic structure is a profound revolution. For a long time, things from the management system, rules, and regulations, to people's way of thinking, work methods, and habits in daily life have become suited to the planned economy. The development of a socialist market economy and the values and the code of conduct required by such developments are bound to produce a powerful impact on such things. This impact will touch on vast political, economic, and cultural spheres as well as on social life and every link of work in various regions, departments, and units. This calls for making a series of changes in both the economic base and the superstructure, remolding our subjective world while changing the objective world, practically and effectively strengthening the socialist legal system and the building of a socialist spiritual civilization, and coordinating all these and making them harmonize with the socialist market economic structure so as to provide an effective guarantee for a healthy development of the socialist market economy. We must note that establishing a socialist market economic structure is a very difficult job. The decades-old planned economy has left behind many long-standing, big, and difficult problems, some of which are very hard to solve. In the process of changing to a market economic structure, it is hard to avoid causing some new economic and social problems. When new contradictions mingle with old ones, they will present a complicated picture of good and evil, advantages and disadvantages existing side by side. This will often make our choice difficult, and there will be also many knotty problems to deal with. If reform measures, especially those involving the adjustment of the masses' immediate interests, are not prudently handled, it could cause social turbulence [she hui bo dong 4357 2585 3134 0520]. We must note that establishing a socialist market economic structure will be a fairly long process. The developed Western countries are where they are today because they have employed the market economy for several hundred years. In a big Eastern country like ours with a weak economic and cultural foundation and with a deep-seated influence from the planned economy, we just cannot reach our goal of such a deep social change in one step even though we have many favorable conditions. Moreover, stagnation or even a reversal may occur for various reasons in the change from an old structure to a new one. This requires us to be mentally prepared to wage a long struggle, to carry out overall planning and to take all factors into consideration, to do our work in the order of its importance and urgency, and to stress continuous and coordinated efforts. In the entire process of establishing, developing, and improving a socialist market economic structure, there always exists the question of how to properly handle the relationship between reform and development and stability. Reform is our driving force, development is our goal, and stability is the prerequisite. We must take the protection of the people's immediate interests as the starting point, modestly heed their opinions, attentively observe their feelings, grasp the principle of benefiting the people and the principle of their tolerance, and strive to make all our policy decisions accord with their wishes in order to win their support. We must seize reform opportunities, see to it that the intensity of reform is proper, take reform into account in doing everything, make a correct assessment of the situation, try to see from a small clue what is coming, and strive to smoothly carry out reforms in a relatively stable and harmonious social environment. To accomplish the historic mission of building a socialist market economic system and to avoid major twists and turns or losses, we must always arm our minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must assiduously study the recently published Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, which is the theoretical foundation of the socialist market economic system. We must study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's stand, viewpoints, methods, and character so that we can become more capable of understanding and rebuilding the world. We must integrate theory with reality and constantly sum up our experiences so that we can become more aware of the need to uphold the party's basic line for 100 years without wavering. Through studying the third volume, we must firmly establish the ideological line of emancipating our minds and seeking truth from facts and be good at upholding the fundamental criteria that our work must be conducive to three causes [developing the productive forces of the PRC's socialist society, increasing the overall strength of the PRC's socialist country, and improving the Chinese people's living standards] so that we can creatively deal with all sorts of problems arising from the development of the socialist market economy. The "decision" has summed up the experience that China has gained in launching reforms and opening up to the outside world, and we must continue to gain more experience from our work under the new historical conditions. While the "decision" has outlined the basic framework of our socialist market economic system, we must reinforce the small parts when we do our work. The "decision" is a programmatic document for guiding the nation's reform of the economic system, and its implementation must be integrated with actual local situations. During their implementation, the basic principles and policies stated in the "decision" must become the common awareness and actions of people throughout the country. The issue of building a socialist market economic system is, in the final analysis, an issue of practice. While we must set our minds on studying the "decision" painstakingly in order to implement it, we must dare to put it into practice. We must practice under the guidance of theory, and we must study and develop theory during practice. The process of practicing, summing up, practicing again, and summing up again is the process of the development of China's reform, and it is also the process for us to deepen our understanding. We must always respect the masses' initiatives. The masses are the knowers and the doers, and they are the source of strength for reform and construction. While the "decision" has incorporated developed countries' applicable experiences in developing their market economy, it has summed up the fresh experiences which Chinese people have created while launching reforms and opening up to the outside world. When the "decision" is being implemented, the masses certainly will continue to demonstrate their initiatives and creativity, which were restricted by the highly centralized planned economic system, and they will certainly come up with many innovative ideas. We must warmly approach the masses' inventions and creativity and be good at employing their experiences to guide them. We must continue to wage arduous struggle. Now that the cardinal policy of carrying out reforms has been established, the most important job we must do is to firmly implement this policy and immerse ourselves in hard work. Reform and opening up are a cause that will benefit the whole nation, but it is not likely that each and every one of us will benefit at the same time. In fact, certain people may have to suffer a little. Thus, we must be prepared to do hard work and be ready to make some short-term sacrifice for the sake of national needs. Because of the socialist market economic system, China certainly will certainly become a prosperous country and Chinese people certainly will become an affluent people; but if Chinese people of various nationalities fail to make concerted efforts and to work hard, our grand plan cannot be achieved. Whether people are willing to work hard lies primarily in whether those in leading positions can set good examples. Leading cadres at all levels must be ready to work hard mentally and while doing their work, and they must live plainly. Leading cadres must go deep into the realities of life and immerse themselves among the masses. They must take the initiative to solve problems and create a new situation at places with many problems. In short, the opportunity for us to speed up reform and development is good, and the situation is favorable in many ways. As long as we study theory earnestly, respect practical experience, maintain close ties with the masses, and persevere in doing hard work, we certainly can surmount all sorts of difficulties and can accomplish the historic mission of building a socialist market economic system. The issues mentioned above are issues that must be attended to and studied when we implement the "decision." These issues are also important issues which members of people's political consultative organs must deal with when they are involved in managing government affairs. We must throw ourselves into the great cause of building a socialist market economic system, give full scope to our strengths, and contribute what we can. Fellow Standing Committee members, 1993 will soon be over. I remember I said at a previous meeting that we were fortunate that we can come together from various corners of the country. Because of our close cooperation during the past year, we have promoted mutual understanding and have deepened our friendship. This has created a good beginning for members of this CPPCC National Committee. During the new year, we must rally even closer around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, work with one heart and one mind, and continue to work hard to create a new situation for people's political consultative organs! Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to wish you a happy new year, good health, and happiness for all your families!
