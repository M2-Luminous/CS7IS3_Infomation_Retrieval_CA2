FR940627-0-00031 FR940627-0-00009 The Commission continues to find that retention of most of the Standards of Conduct are necessary to prevent affiliate abuse, as will be discussed below with respect to specific provisions. A. Definitions Indicated Parties suggest that the Commission include a new definition of marketing affiliate that makes clear it applies to pipelines' new merchant service established under Order No. 636 and a revision in the definition of transportation to make clear that transportation includes storage. Section 284.286 provides that pipelines' new merchant divisions are subject to the marketing affiliate regulations, 21 and, therefore no new definition is needed. The Commission, however, will revise both Part 161 and §250.16 to cross-reference §284.286. 22 The Commission also is revising §284.286 to conform to the changes being made in §161.3. 23 Section 284.1 of the Commission's regulations defines transportation as including storage, 24 and the Commission will revise the definition of transportation in §161.2 to parallel the Part 284 definition. 25 21 18 CFR 284.286; Order No. 636, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles at 30,442. 22 The Commission also is revising §161.1 to correspond with the current Part 284 regulations by deleting the unnecessary references to pipelines transporting gas pursuant to Subparts H and K of Part 284. Section 161.1 will continue to refer to pipelines transporting gas pursuant to Subparts B and G. Continued reference to Subparts H and K is redundant since both Subparts apply to pipelines transporting gas under Subparts B and G. 23 Because the revisions to Part 284 are purely ministerial, the Commission concludes it has good cause under the Administrative Procedure Act for finding that notice and public comment on these revisions is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. 5 U.S.C. 553(b). 24 18 CFR 284.1. 25 The Commission further is deleting the obsolete reference to pipeline interruptible sales certificates. See Arkla Energy Resources Company, et al. , 59 FERC ¶ 61,173 (1992). B. Information Disclosure Requirements Standard E provides that pipelines may not disclose to affiliates any information the pipeline receives from non-affiliated shippers. Standard F provides that pipelines must contemporaneously disclose to all shippers any information related to transportation that the pipelines provide to affiliates. In Order No. 497&hyph;E, the Commission revised Standard F to eliminate the requirement for contemporaneous disclosure of sales and marketing information the pipelines provide to marketing affiliates. 26 26 Order No. 497&hyph;E, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles at 30,985 & n.19. 1. Standard E_Disclosure of Information Received From Non-affiliates Tenneco contends Standard E should be removed entirely. It argues no basis exists for prohibiting disclosure to marketing affiliates of information received from other shippers, while permitting that information to be disclosed to non-affiliates. It maintains that if a shipper would be harmed by pipeline disclosure of information the shipper provides, the same harm would result from disclosure of that information to another non-affiliate. The Commission concludes that the Standard needs to be retained to prevent potential affiliate abuse. The Standard recognizes that the pipelines have access to non-affiliate information due to the pipelines' control over transportation service and that the pipelines have an economic incentive to favor affiliates with such information when disclosure will benefit the affiliate. The same incentive does not apply to sharing of non-affiliate information with other non-affiliates. 27 27 Tenneco's argument that harm may result from disclosure of non-affiliate information to other non-affiliates would not necessarily dictate the deletion of Standard E, as Tenneco argues. It could justify expanding the Standard to prohibit disclosure to non-affiliates as well. But the Order No. 497 regulations are limited to affiliates because the pipelines have an economic incentive to favor affiliates, which is lacking in their dealings with non-affiliates. Undue discrimination with respect to non-affiliates would be covered by the general Part 284 regulations.
