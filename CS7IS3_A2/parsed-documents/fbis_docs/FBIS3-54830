Their number had grown to 36,900 by last June and to 41,820 by November, the Economics Ministry reports in its 1993-1994 economic survey. Some 10,000-12,000 new businesses will be established next year, economists predict, provided the regulations are not substantially changed. The level of enterprise was the highest in the Tallinn area with 43 businesses per 1,000 people and the lowest in East Virumaa, where 12 businesses per 1,000 people were registered. Tallinn and Saaremaa showed the biggest increase in the number of registered companies, about seven enterprises per 1,000 people in six months. Experts estimate there will be over 40,000 unemployed and 78,000 job seekers in Estonia early next year. They predict the growth of unemployment will stop in the second half of next year. Forecasts put the number of people employed in the Estonian economy next year at 600,000-650,000. Personal income, according to revenues from personal income tax, is the biggest in northwest Estonia -- over 700 kroons, and the lowest in southeast Estonia, where it remains below 400 kroons.
