According to Gvero, the Serb soldiers have withdrawn three km from the center of Gorazde, and the decision on the evacuation of the wounded and civilians from Gorazde has also been implemented. The passage of humanitarian convoys to Gorazde is also continuing successfully, Gvero added. He particularly stressed that he expected that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] deployed along the separation lines would not allow any further provocative actions by the Muslims from Gorazde. Gvero also said that today he had demanded from UN officials that all Serb prisoners be unconditionally released from Gorazde and that this should not be considered a prisoner exchange. For, according to General Gvero, the Serbs have shown goodwill so many times, by allowing humanitarian convoys in and by withdrawing their troops from Gorazde. It is time that the other side shows goodwill too, Gen. Gvero stressed.
