The statement stresses that the provocative menace and blackmail posed by the United States against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea under the pretext of its "nuclear issue" are a violation of and threat to national sovereignty and security, which is an act quite contrary to the United Nations Charter. It expresses full support to the DPRK's stand on the negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue and calls upon the people of the United States and the world to show a positive response to it. The Ugandan National Executive Committee of the Seventh Pan-African Congress in a statement issued on the same day charges that paying no head to the nuclear arms deployed in Europe and Israel and other places, the United States is taking issue with North Korea which is using nuclear facilities for a peaceful purpose, and maneuvering to remove them. The statement calls upon the world progressive people to decisively check such brigandish and aggressive act of the United States.
