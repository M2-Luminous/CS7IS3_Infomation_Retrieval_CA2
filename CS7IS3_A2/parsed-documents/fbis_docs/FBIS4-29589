According to the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, the company's production shift will be made to cope with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect in January. The company will begin manufacturing tv chassis this summer at a plant in Tiajuana on the U.S.-Mexico border. Hitachi will aim to produce chassis for 500,000 TV sets annually during a five-year period, the paper said. Hitachi's move is expected to facilitate other Japanese electric makers' plans to shift their productions to Mexico to avoid disadvantageous tariffs on goods manufactured outside North America, it added.
