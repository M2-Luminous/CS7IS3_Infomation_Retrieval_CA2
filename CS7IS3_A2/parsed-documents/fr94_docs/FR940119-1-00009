FR940119-1-00009 FR940119-1-00002 It is expected that most of the time the insurable value of the collateral will exceed the amount of all liens on the property (plus SBA's assistance, if unsecured). Thus, for most borrowers, the amount of flood insurance required would be determined by the liens on the property (plus SBA's assistance, if unsecured) so long as flood insurance in that amount were available under the NFI Act. On those occasions when the insurable value of the collateral dips below the liens on the property (plus SBA's assistance, if unsecured), only enough insurance to protect the collateral would be required. Compliance With Executive Orders 12866, 12612 and 12778, and the Regulatory Flexibility and Paperwork Reduction Acts Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not be a significant regulatory action for purposes of E.O. 12866 and, for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, for the following reasons: 1. It would not result in an annual economic effect of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. 2. It would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency. 3. It would not materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof. 4. It would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in E.O. 12866. Executive Order 12612 SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted, would have no Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612. Paperwork Reduction Act For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C., ch. 35, SBA hereby certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted, would impose no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements. Executive Order 12778 SBA certifies that this proposed rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in section 2 of E.O. 12778.
