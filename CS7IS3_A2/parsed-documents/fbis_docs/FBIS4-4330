FBIS4-4330 "dreas062_d_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 South Korea Results of Han-Christopher Meeting Reported Results of Han-Christopher Meeting Reported SK3103003094 Seoul YONHAP in English 0020 GMT 31 Mar 94 SK3103003094 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Washington, March 30 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the United States agreed to push their plans to adopt a resolution at the UN Security Council on the North Korean nuclear dispute. The agreement came during a meeting Wednesday morning between South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Han and Christopher decided they would retain the content of the draft resolution worked out by the United States but tone down the phrasing, informed sources said. At the same time, they did not rule out the possibility of going along with a statement by the council president as demanded by China, the sources said. The two countries will continue to seek a compromise with China, they added. Talking to reporters after the meeting, Han said his agreement with Christopher was not just a gesture to facilitate negotiations with China. "We have actually agreed to push our plans to adopt a resolution," Han said. Prior to the meeting, Christopher had consulted with Foreign Ministers Tsutomu Hata of Japan and Andrey Kozyrev of Russia on adopting a resolution on North Korea. The foreign ministers are still negotiating among themselves, the sources said. "Be it a resolution or a council president statement, the security council is expected to adopt it by Thursday," Han said. He added, however, that the timing could be put off a little if minor problems cropped up. In either case, there would be a deadline for North Korea, Han said, hinting that it would be around mid-May when the International Atomic Energy Agency could resume inspections. Han said that if the IAEA cannot undertake additional inspections, the United States will forget about talks with North Korea and enter directly into a phase where the Security Council would impose sanctions. Therefore, North Korea will have to respond to the resolution or the council president's statement, Han said. Han also briefed Christopher on the results of South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China and discussed possible Chinese cooperation. Han and Christopher discussed follow-up measures to the Security Council resolution, as well as problems related to the joint military exercise Team Spirit and a third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks, the sources said. Later Wednesday, Han met with Samuel Burger, deputy White House aide for national security affairs, and they agreed to continue maintaining close coordination and cooperation on the North Korean nuclear row. Han is scheduled to visit the United Nations in New York for talks with Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and both permanent and non-permanent members of the UN Security Council.
