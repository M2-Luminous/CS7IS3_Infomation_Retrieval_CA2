Trunkline Gas Company [Docket No. CP95&hyph;67&hyph;000] Take notice that on November 10, 1994, Trunkline Gas Company (Trunkline), P.O. Box 1642, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1642, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;67&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon 160 feet of 16-inch diameter pipeline located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Trunkline proposes to abandon 160 feet of its 205A&hyph;0100 Kaplan mainline located between Gate Valves 205A&hyph;1 and 205A&hyph;101, downstream of its Trident Lowery Plant. Trunkline states that in August 1992, it discovered that this segment of pipeline had incurred an internal corrosion leak and determined that it should be replaced under ยง2.55(b) of the Commission's Regulations. Trunkline also states that in December 1993, it removed the 160 feet of pipeline and rerouted the gas coming from the Trident Lowery Plant into its adjacent 24-inch Line 200&hyph;2 for a short haul to the next downstream crossover. Trunkline asserts that it is not necessary to replace the subject pipeline segment because its present system is capable of the short-haul of the Lowery Plant volumes without any detrimental impact on system requirements or daily operations. Comment date: December 7, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.
