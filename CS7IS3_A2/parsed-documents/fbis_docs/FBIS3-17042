Sadly, my interlocutor asked me not to turn on the tape recorder: "Let it be an unofficial conversation, and you will write an article after you have traveled around our country." Yet I managed, not without difficulty, to secure Askar Akayevich's consent to publish excerpts from our conversation. Akayev believes that Kyrgyzstan is vitally interested in a comfortable existence of the Russian ethnic minority not out of only purely humanist considerations. In its ethnic composition, Kyrgyzstan differs appreciably from the other Central Asian states where Slavs account for a relatively small share (some 10 percent) of the country's population. Tranquillity in Kyrgyzstan rests on a precarious ethnic balance between the three most numerous peoples of the state: Kyrgyz (nearly 50 percent), Uzbeks (more than 10 percent), Russians and Ukrainians (nearly 25 percent). In this ethnic "crucible" the Slavic component fulfills the role of a stabilizer that maintains relations of harmony between the peoples. A massive outflow of Slavic people would tip the ethnic balance in the republic, and the probability of interethnic clashes would grow sharply. [passage omitted] The main reason for the Slav emigration is a low living standard. The Kyrgyz leader thinks that Western countries have proven in practice totally indifferent to such notions as democracy and freedom of speech, and prefer to invest money in countries that bring profit. "We are being helped only by America and Japan; as for Europe, I do not visit it," Askar Akayev added with sadness. As for Kyrgyzstan's neighbors, which have much richer natural resources, they are securing credits all over the world. The other important specific feature in the life of Kyrgyzstan's Slavs is that, unlike their fellow Slavs in the other Central Asia states, most of them work for defense. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, virtually all workers of the military-industrial complex have been left without a job. The Kyrgyz president pins great hopes on an understanding with Boris Yeltsin on creating an investment fund to turn the enterprises where Slavs work into joint enterprises. "This would finally provide jobs for our Slavs, and they would not be leaving for Russia," Askar Akayev said. Finally, there is the dual-citizenship problem. In the president's view, it can be only granted to local Slavs and Germans. The granting of dual citizenship to Uzbeks and Tajiks would, Askar Akayev thinks, lead to unpredictable consequences. The Kyrgyz president reminded me that Tajikistan had made territorial claims on his country not so long ago. If one grants dual citizenship to Tajiks, who densely populate areas close to the Tajikistan border, there would actually be no avoiding a territorial division. A similar problem also exists in Osh Oblast, with a dense Uzbek population that borders on Uzbekistan. Askar Akayev admitted that in Uzbekistan, too, there are certain forces interested in a revision of borders. A similar problem also exists in northern Kazakhstan, and the Kyrgyz president appreciates Nursultan Nazarbayev's stance very well. Akayev thinks that the best solution in such situations is bilateral agreements to guarantee an immediate granting of citizenship when one changes the country of residence or decides to go back. Let me note that Kazakhstan Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko, who visited Moscow last week, came up with almost the same initiative. To the "provoking" question from your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent: "What forces in Uzbekistan are interested in territorial division when all power in the neighbor state is in the hands of one person -- Islam Karimov?," Askar Akayev replied: "Islam Karimov holds a very constructive position, and we have no differences on this question. However, this problem has always been there -- both before Karimov, Nazarbayev, Niyazov, Rakhmonov, Akayev, and their time, and it will remain after them. We should be very cautious about provoking a catastrophe."
