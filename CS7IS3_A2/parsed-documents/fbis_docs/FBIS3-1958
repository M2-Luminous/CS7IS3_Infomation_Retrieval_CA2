At 0800 that morning, Jiang Chunyun travelled to the Zibo deputies' group to discuss the government work report made by Governor Zhao Zhihao. In his speech, Jiang Chunyun said: We must correctly understand and handle the dialectical relations among reform, development, and stability. Reform and development constitute the foundation of social stability, and stability constitutes the pre-conditions for reform and development. We should achieve the goal of grasping reform to promote development, grasping development to embark on a new stage, and grasping stability to ensure a good overall situation. Successfully grasping these three issues means successfully grasping crucial issues that will enable us to gain the initiative in leadership work. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: In carrying out reform, we should focus on reform packages, make breakthroughs in major aspects, and make a big step around the general objective of establishing a socialist market economic structure. At the same time, attention should be paid to reforms in the spheres of planning, finance and taxation, banking, investment, foreign trade, enterprises, rural areas, and circulation. The pace of shifting to the socialist market economic structure should also be accelerated. Jiang Chunyun stressed: Development is the last word. We should firmly grasp the central link of economic construction at any moment without the slightest degree of slackness or deviation so that we can ensure that the national economy will embark on a new stage every few years. In accelerating development, we should not only effect an increase in quantity but also effect an improvement in quality. We should go all out to readjust structures, strengthen management, effect technological progress, improve quality, and increase economic returns. Considering this to be a major guiding ideology for the province's economic work, this should be assigned to each level for implementation in order to ensure sustained, sound, and rapid development of the province's economy. Jiang Chunyun also went to visit deputies of Qingdao and talked about his opinions on Qingdao city's reform and development.
