Yesterday evening [Northern League leader] Umberto Bossi set out his conditions [for joining a government coalition] on the spur of the moment. Mariano Squillante reports from Northern League headquarters where a news conference is underway. Mariano, what has Bossi said? [Squillante] The news conference ended a few minutes ago. Bossi said that over the next 24 hours he would contact people and start negotiations with the two other components of the Freedom Alliance, which won the elections. Let us hear what he says in this short excerpt: [Begin Bossi recording] The alliance must now say and forcefully spell out that it is more than just the sole political force which can govern this country. This is valid not only for Forza Italia but also for other political forces. I mean, the MSI [Italian Social Movement] has lost no time in becoming the National Alliance, and we would like to know -- we will try to understand -- if the party itself has actually changed. [end recording] [Squillante] [passage omitted] He said that only the League has the moral right and the political unity needed to conduct negotiations to form a government, while Forza Italia and the National Alliance cannot be trusted in that they are unknown quantities. He has once again given the thumbs down to Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister, saying that he would prefer the Northern League's Roberto Maroni. Meanwhile, Francesco Speroni has put himself forward as a candidate for the post of speaker in the Senate. [passage omitted]
