He said the Chinese people would become even poorer and the problem of human rights in China would never be solved if the United States decided to stop giving such privileges to China because of its poor human rights record. He disagreed with the United States for linking trade talks with other issues. He said that constituted interference in the internal affairs of others. Concerning Thailand, he said the United States tried to link the special trade privileges given Thailand with Thailand's treatment of its labor issue. Suphachai said this is not approriate because Thailand has been trying to solve its problem by fully adhering to international norms on labor. The Thai Government has always tried to irm the United States whenever its labor organizations tried to interfere with or instigate the Thai labor force. He said that at the meeting of the International Labor Organization, Thailand and its allies would try to counter the United States on this matter. Suphachai said that the Thai Government has been trying to solve trade problems with the United States by fully complying with international rules, such as suppressing pirated tapes, and protecting intellectual property. Yet, there are certain areas where Thailand cannot comply with U.S. demands. He noted that without Thailand as its friend, the United States would hardly have any friends left.
