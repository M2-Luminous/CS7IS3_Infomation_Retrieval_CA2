FR940627-0-00022 FR940627-0-00008 VI. Information Collection Requirement Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations require approval of certain information collection requirements imposed by agency rules. 9 This final rule neither contains new information collection requirements nor makes any changes to existing information collection requirements. Therefore, it is not subject to OMB approval. 9 5 CFR 1320.14. VII. Effective Date Section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 10 generally requires that a rule is to be effective not less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register unless good cause is found to shorten the time period. The sunset date for the current reporting requirements will expire on June 30, 1994 before the APA's 30 day publication requirement is fulfilled, which would result in a gap in the reporting requirements. To prevent such a gap, §§250.16 (a)(3), (c)(1), and (d)(1) will be revised, effective June 30, 1994, to continue the current reporting requirements until July 31, 1994. 10 5 U.S.C. 553(d). List of Subjects in 18 CFR Part 250 Natural gas, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. By the Commission. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
