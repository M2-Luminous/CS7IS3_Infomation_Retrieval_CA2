FR941021-0-00143 FR941021-0-00021 Inspection One comment recommended that all equipment should be subject to an annual inspection. Overfill devices will be subject to examination during the annual tank vessel examination for foreign flag vessels or the inspection for certification and reinspections of U.S. flag vessels and Canadian tank barges. In addition, 33 CFR 156.120 requires the PIC of an oil transfer operation to test each overfill device for proper operation prior to each transfer of cargo. Phase-In Two comments from tank barge operators expressed support for the timetable for phasing in the installation of each overfill device at regularly scheduled cargo tank internal examinations. One comment recommended a 2-year time limit for installations on barges. The Coast Guard considered accelerating the phase-in period but decided that the costs associated with gas-freeing a vessel and taking the vessel out of service would be prohibitive. Another comment asked if a grace period for overfill device inspection would be granted for vessels undergoing a cargo tank internal examination immediately after the effective date of the regulations. The effective date of the regulations is 90 days after publication in the Federal Register . The Coast Guard expects that vessel repairs or cargo tank internal examinations can be completed within 90 days. Therefore, vessels which are being repaired or examined would not be subject to these regulations until, as in the case of a U.S. flag vessel, the vessel's next cargo tank internal examination. Tank Level and Pressure Monitoring Devices One comment suggested that this rulemaking be combined with standards for equipment detecting leaks in cargo tanks also required under section 4110 of OPA 90 (CGD 90&hyph;071). The Coast Guard disagrees. Overfill devices are used to detect overfills while transferring, discharging, or loading cargo. They have a completely different function when compared with tank level or pressure monitoring devices which serve to detect leaks in cargo tanks. Maximum Cargo Level of Oil Two vessel operators objected to limiting the amount of cargo in a cargo tank to 98.5 percent of the cargo tank volume. The Coast Guard has not changed the requirement in the interim regulations. Both the vapor control system regulations (46 CFR 39.30&hyph; 1(e)) and these regulations reflect the Coast Guard's position that filling a tank more than 98.5 percent poses too high of a risk that there will be a tank overflow. Therefore, the rule continues to establish a 98.5 percent level as the maximum level of fill. This rule has been revised to be consistent with the rules for vapor control systems, to specify that a tank may not be filled higher than either 98.5 percent or the level at which the overfill alarms are set, for those cases where shutdown must be initiated at a level below 98.5 percent to ensure that an overfill does not occur. Assessment This rule is a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is significant under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). Although it does not require an assessment of costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of Executive Order 12866, an assessment has been prepared and is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ``ADDRESSES.'' The Assessment is summarized as follows. The Coast Guard assumes that tankship and tank barge owners and operators will purchase one high quality, float-type overfill device for each cargo tank. The Coast Guard also assumes that 25 percent of all vessels covered by this rulemaking already have some acceptable form of overfill device installed. Costs for the purchase and installation of the single alarm system required on the remaining tankships are estimated at $3,125 per tank, or $43,750 for a tankship with 14 cargo tanks. Costs for the purchase and installation of the high level indicating system required on the remaining tank barges are estimated at $1,650 per tank, or $13,200 for a tank barge with eight cargo tanks.
