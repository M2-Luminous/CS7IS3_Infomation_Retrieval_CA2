The forecast emerged yesterday from a meeting of a subcommittee considering the country's competitiveness, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Phanitchaphak. It is outlining plans to increase the country's exports until the year 2000. An adviser to Dr Suphachai, Dr Thirana Phongmakaphat, said Thai exports were likely to expand 13 percent-15.5 percent annually in the period. The estimates were also based on world economic growth of 5 percent a year but this figure would have to be readjusted in line with trends. The subcommittee outlined 15 measures to hoost exrports, including promotions, increased efficiency and a greater role for regional groups such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation organisation in technology development. The subcommittee also suggested measures be adopted for industries in which Thailand has an advantage over its rivals, such as agriculture, textiles, gems and jewellery, electronics and printing and packaging.
