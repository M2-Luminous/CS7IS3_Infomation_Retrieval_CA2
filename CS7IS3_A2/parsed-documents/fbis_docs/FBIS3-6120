The statement expressed joy over an affirmative agreement at a recent DPRK-U.S. contact. Noting that the United States has continued to aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula, it said that the point is what stand and attitude the United States takes to implement the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in the future. The statement said: If the United States sincerely implement the agreed conclusions, a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula would be smooth, and if the United States do not implement what it should do under an unreasonable pretext, it would be complicated. The United States, which is directly responsible for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, must no longer disgrace itself.
