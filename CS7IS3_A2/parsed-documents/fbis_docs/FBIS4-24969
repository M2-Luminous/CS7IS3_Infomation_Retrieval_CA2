Full of zest, Li Tieying and Chen Xitong viewed the progress made by the Beijing Department Store (Group) Limited Company in Wangfujing, the Beijing Tongrentang Group Company, the Beijing Chemical Industry Group Company, and the Beijing Peony Electric Group Company in establishing a modern enterprise system. They also held informal discussions with Zheng Wanhe, Tian Yumin, Sun Zhenyan, and Chen Jie, the general managers of the four enterprises, regarding the establishment of a modern enterprise system. In recent years, the four enterprises carried out plenty of preparatory work as they explored the means of establishing a modern enterprise system. Li Tieying fully affirmed their efforts. Li Tieying said emphatically: A fundamental way to lift state-owned enterprises out of their predicament is to establish a modern enterprise system. He hoped that enterprises in Beijing would keep exploring boldly, intensify research, constantly sum up experience, and explore a microeconomic course for organically combining public ownership with the market economy while bearing in mind the need to solve their existing practical problems. The Beijing Department Store has evolved into a limited company engaged in 10 major lines of business, including commerce, production, processing, advertising, and stock business. Grouping scientific, industrial, trading, production, supply, and marketing operations, the Beijing Tongrentang Group Company sells its products nationwide, as well as to more than 40 countries and regions. The Beijing Peony Electric Group Company has joined the nationwide ranks of electronic industries, acquiring a capacity to produce 1 million color television sets, its leading product. Last year, the Beijing Chemical Industry Group Company achieved 5.28 billion yuan in total industrial output value, posted 500 million yuan in profits and taxes, and took in $40.50 million in export-generated foreign exchange, ranking second in the country's 100 large chemical groups in terms of composite economic efficiency.
