Qiao made the remarks when meeting with visiting French Senate President Rene Monory here today. He said that though China's economy has developed rapidly over the past years but an overall development requires the efforts of several generations to come. "So, we hope that France would be a very good partner in the development of China's economy and the two countries would strengthen bilateral cooperation in various fields," said Qiao. He noted that this year is the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic ties, and generally speaking, China and France have conducted effective cooperation during the past 30 years, but there were also difficulties and setbacks. Now that the two countries have opened up a new page in their bilateral relations, Qiao Shi said, they should make concerted efforts to promote the development of such relations. Qiao expressed the belief that that monory's visit, which precedes that to be made by French Prime Minister Balladur, would play a good role in strengthening Sino-French parliamentary relations and in the bilateral relations as a whole. Monory said that the purpose of his visit is to strengthen mutual understanding and create a good atmosphere for Balladur's coming visit to China. He said that he hopes the difficult period in the bilateral relations will come to an end soon and a harmonious atmosphere would prevail. He also hoped that bilateral cooperation in economy, education, scientific research and other fields can be strengthened, so as to ensure a good fresh start in the bilateral relations. The two sides exchanged views on international issues of common concern. After the meeting, Qiao and his wife Yu Wen hosted a banquet in honor of the French guests. Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC, was present at the meeting and the banquet. Monory and his party will leave here for Shanghai tomorrow.
