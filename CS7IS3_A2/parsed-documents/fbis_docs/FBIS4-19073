The party garnered only 1.4 percent in the Gallup poll published by HELSINGIN SANOMAT on Saturday [26 March]. The SMP [Finnish Rural Party] could be swept out of parliament in the next election. There are several reasons for SMP's decline. In the views of many the party has argued itself into the ground. This is denied, however, in a statement released on Sunday by Party Secretary Timo Soini. "An attempt is being made to destroy the SMP," Soini asserted in his news release. "Our parliamentary delegation has been thrown into disarray especially by money. There is no one who has not been selling out," Soini stated. He saw the biggest scapegoats outside of SMP, but also saw that the SMP "has to clean up its own house. There must be no room for those who threaten and gamble." Parliamentary Representatives in Difficulty The party's prospects in the 1995 elections seem dismal. Only SMP Chairman Rimo Vistbacka is starting from a moderately favorable position for the parliamentary elections. He has had solid support from Pohjanmaa voters since 1987. Chances of continuing in parliament for most other SMP representatives are for differing reasons hanging in the balance. [passage omitted] "Everything Adrift" The SMP is entering the election campaign in poor condition in other respects also. The Justice Ministry has handed over the party's economic backbone, the SMP Support Foundation, to court-appointed trustees. The party's debts amount to 3-4 million markkas. Secured loans are still being found. On the other hand, the party's newspaper publishing company is in continuous economic difficulty. [passage omitted] Soini described the party's situation as "everything adrift." Matters are not being taken care of by anyone. Vistback is overcautious, does not dare to make decisions, does not take a stand, nor bang his fist on the table. [passage omitted] Other parties consider the SMP an outcast. It is only to be accepted as a campaign alliance partner in extreme emergency. For example, campaign alliance master SKL [Finnish Christian Party] takes the SMP along where the Center Party does not care to join in alliance. [passage omitted] The SMP may find itself in an extraordinary situation at the party convention this June in Tampere: it cannot be ruled out that there will be no seriously acceptable candidates for party leadership posts, or even any challengers to the present leaders.
