Often it seems that creativity and imagination are required to keep the process alive and kicking, and you never get tired, and always come up with new phrasings and terminology. [Peres] Some say that the Oslo agreement is very difficult, but it is not the agreement that is difficult -- it is the situation. We have to deal with a difficult situation, not a difficult agreement. We must always keep our aim in mind, while remembering the support that we have. We have a Knesset majority of one, and that majority can be lost. Hence, we must work with our eyes on the goal and our ears attentive to the support. This is what makes the process so difficult. At the same time, the Palestinians have very high expectations and make very high demands. [Shahar] What do you mean when you say that the Oslo agreement was difficult? Was it the fact that we talked to the PLO, the content, or the discussions? [Peres] Sitting with the PLO was difficult too. The PLO used to be taboo for most Israelis. This was a major obstacle to overcome, for us and for people outside our camp. The second thing was the issue of Jerusalem. Had we not stumbled over the issue of Jerusalem today, we would have reached an agreement. The third matter were the settlements. There are 130,000 settlers. It is nothing like the Sinai. Another issue was security. [Shahar] Looking back, do you not believe that the decision to leave them intact was a mistake? [Peres] No, because had we made the opposite decision, we would have antagonized and lost the support of all of those who support them. [Shahar] Perhaps they should not have been mentioned at all in the negotiations? [Peres] Not mentioned? The settlers would have asked: What about us? This way we tell them: You stay where you are. [Shahar] Thus putting off the confrontation for how long? Two years? Five years? [Peres] But this cannot be done. There are certain questions that need to be answered first regarding the police force that would operate there; their rights; their protection. What do you mean not mention them? Their status has to be determined. [Shahar] But leaving them in their place creates a situation of constant friction? [Peres] And if they are not mentioned, what then? Should they be removed or not? [Shahar] A decision will have to be made. [Peres] Such as? [Shahar] I am not expressing opinions here. I am the reporter. While you attempt to solve the problem of two to five years of friction, there are Israelis and Palestinians who want to establish facts on the ground.... [Peres] And what it the alternative? [Shahar] Settle the matter now. State that you wholeheartedly believe they should be removed in order for the Palestinians to be able to maintain their autonomy, perhaps. [Peres] This would have created an intolerable situation. Remember how hard it was to remove the settlers from the Sinai. [Shahar] But you will reach this point in the negotiations on the permanent arrangement. [Peres] Maybe yes, maybe no; we will see. [Shahar] You typically think of long-term results. What do you believe will happen at the end of the interim period? [Peres] I believe that if there is a change of attitude between us and the Palestinians, the settlers could stay. I see no reason why not. [Shahar] Do you not see the Palestinians presenting an ultimatum for a state after the interim period? [Peres] What do you mean ultimatum? Will they aim their artillery at us? I believe they will make demands and we will seek a compromise, a solution. [Shahar] The problems on the Palestinian track are extremely difficult, and it appears that the Palestinians and the Syrians are holding up comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Last week it was announced that a Jordanian bank is opening a branch in the West Bank. Are we expecting economic relations with Jordan before we establish diplomatic relations? [Peres] I doubt it. [Shahar] Why? [Peres] Jordan is hesitant at this time. Perhaps it believes that nothing will come out of the 'Arafat business. Perhaps it believes the same about al-Asad. It also could be that it wants to change the current pace. [Shahar] Does the fact that negotiations with the Palestinians move slowly help our relations with al-Asad, who feared that we will reach an agreement with the Palestinians and leave Syria isolated? [Peres] I am not certain. This speculation is hard to verify. [Shahar] What is really happening with al-Asad? [Peres] Al-Asad has made a strategic decision to opt for peace, but he has not yet answered four cardinal questions. The first regards the nature of the negotiations, which projects on the nature of peace. The negotiations cannot be held on a narrow and rigid basis. He must change that if he wants peace. Second, when he speaks of comprehensive peace, he remains vague. [Shahar] Several senior Syrian figures appeared in international symposiums where they spoke of full peace for full withdrawal, explaining that full peace includes all of the.... [Peres] I have not heard a Syrian official doing that. [Shahar] What about the meeting between Clinton and al-Asad? [Peres] We saw Clinton answering this question, not al-Asad. [Shahar] But he said that al-Asad has reached a decision. [Peres] We will see. The third is the issue of security arrangements. We are on the Golan for security reasons, and we must provide answers to the security problems that would be created in case of a withdrawal from there. [Shahar] Do you not often say that peace is security? [Peres] Yes, peace is definitely an element of security. I am not saying that it is the only one. The fourth thing is Lebanon, because both Syria and Lebanon have been hinting that it is not standing on its own feet. [Shahar] What is the solution we seek with Lebanon? [Peres] We believe it would be desirable for Lebanon to be independent, in control of its territory. Securing the north of Israel is our supreme interest. We have no business in running the Lebanese policies for them. We conduct an Israeli defense policy which has bearings on Lebanon. [Shahar] Do you mean that if al-Asad guarantees appropriate security arrangements in Lebanon we would settle for that? [Peres] Yes. [Shahar] It has been often said that in 1994 matters will be determined. Do you really believe we will reach some comprehensive breakthrough this year? [Peres] We will reach breakthrough; I do not know if it will be comprehensive. [Shahar] Where will it take place, and where not? [Peres] I see a good chance for implementing the agreement with the Palestinians. I also regard this a major psychological and political breakthrough. We may also start things with the Syrians, but this depends on the way Syria behaves. [Shahar] Does Jordan depend on the Palestinians, Syria, or both? [Peres] Jordan depends on whoever it believes it does. I believe it is independent. [Shahar] Who does it believe it depends on? [Peres] They apparently believe that Jordan cannot precede everyone with its treaty. [passage omitted]
