The provincial agricultural department predicts that wheat output will reach that of 1992, a record year, and rapeseed output will increase by 10 percent over last year. Sichuan's grain and edible oil output decreased last year. Since the beginning of this year, local governments have attached more importance to agriculture and taken measures to lessen the burden on farmers. Meanwhile, the provincial government has sent some 100 experts to the countryside, who, together with 25,000 agronomists working at the county and township levels, have helped local farmers to manage 2.33 million hectares of farmland, 30 percent of the province's crop-growing areas. The local governments are now working out purchasing prices for wheat and rapeseed. Local farmers say that they expect higher and more reasonable prices for their products. The rapeseed output of the province makes up 17 percent of the national total. The provincial government expects to purchase 400 million kg of edible oil this summer, half of which will go to the rest of the country. Local officials say that a good harvest in the province would stabilize the country's edible oil market.
