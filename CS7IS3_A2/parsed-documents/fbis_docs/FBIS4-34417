Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, Central Information Office [OCI] minister, made the announcement while reporting on the topics discussed at the special meeting. Although he admitted there were technical problems involved in immediately paying savings account holders at the intervened banks, he did not rule out the possibility that these banks could reopen their doors on Monday and Tuesday to honor these commitments. He said the decree approved by the president will be published in the official gazette on Saturday night, a task for which printing press personnel have already been designated. [Begin recording] [Alvarez, in progress]...invest 400 billion bolivares at this time. The first investment is 150 billion to cover Fogade's demands to meet the requirements of the eight banks you already know about. This was the main point on today's agenda. This decree will be published in the official gazette tonight. As a sign of the urgency with which we have treated the case, we have already assigned printing press personnel to perform this task. [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] [Alvarez] Our intention, which was announced by the finance minister a few days ago, was to get the banks to open tomorrow and resume normal operations. Excuse me, I meant Monday. The bank superintendent has said there are technical problems which they are trying to overcome and which could prevent them from opening on Monday. If they cannot open on Monday, they will open on Tuesday. It would be a 24-hour thing, at any rate. There is no contradiction here. [end recording] The OCI minister said that if Congress and the executive branch have submitted this plan to pay savings account holders on Monday and Tuesday, the money does exist.
