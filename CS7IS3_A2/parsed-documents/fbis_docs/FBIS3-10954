Colombia and Cuba also agreed in February that Colombia would sell 20,000 barrels of oil per day to the island, a fact that has provoked protests from opponents of Cuban President Fidel Castro's regime. The preliminary agreements for food sales were the result of Colombian Deputy Agriculture Minister Santiago Perry's visit to Havana. Perry has said Cuba will design and build a pilot plant for the production of biological control measures in Colombia. Likewise, a joint project will be developed to obtain banana strains resistant to Black Sigatoka via genetic engineering techniques, and research will be conducted to combat the white fly, which attacks vegetables. Colombian Agriculture Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo will travel to Havana shortly to ratify the agreements.
