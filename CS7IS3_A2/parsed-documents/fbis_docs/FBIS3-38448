He was speaking after Jacques Delors, president of the EC's executive European Commission, told environmentalists earlier this week that he would continue fighting for the tax to the end of his presidency on December 31. [passage omitted] But the EC official said Delors was prepared to concede exemptions "to one or two countries" if necessary to push the proposal through. The energy tax aims primarily at reducing vehicle emissions of carbon dioxide. It was originally supposed to start at the equivalent of three dollars a barrel of oil and rise to $10 by the turn of the century. [passage omitted]
