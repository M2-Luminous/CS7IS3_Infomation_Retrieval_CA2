Under a contract with the firm, a group of Russian engineers in Uruguay is fitting these helicopters with weapons; they are a civilian version of the mass-produced combat helicopters. Afterwards, they will be resold to other countries. The first helicopter has already been purchased by Peru's Armed Forces. The Ka-32 helicopters are being delivered from Russia by sea to Uruguay's free economic zone, to the town of Florida, 90 km north of the Uruguayan capital. Each helicopter costs no less than 2.5 million dollars. The newspaper notes that these helicopters are one of the most promising models in Russia, which are noted for their high degree of maneuverability.

In addition to this, they have a spacious cargo compartment and equipment for the transportation of suspended cargo. The Ka-32 helicopters can be used to assemble equipment, lay power lines, and also to carry out operations to rescue people and equipment during natural disasters. The Uruguayan newspaper notes that the intention in Peru is to use the helicopter to fight the drug mafia. Contracts for the sale of the military version of the Ka-32 helicopters have already been concluded with a number of other Latin American countries.
