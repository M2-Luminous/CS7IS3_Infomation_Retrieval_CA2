The papers say Alhaji Ibrahim yesterday declared NADECO an illegal political body, warning its members to desist from confronting the government. According to the papers, the police boss warned NADECO of the consequences of its activities which the police was not ready to tolerate. They say Alhaji Commassie ordered the group to wind up its activities or face the wrath of the law. The papers say the inspector general's warning came amid public anxiety over the expiration today of NADECO's ultimatum to the military government to relinquish power. And the dailies also report that NADECO has unfolded the agenda aimed at restoring democracy in Nigeria. They quote a member of the group as saying that the struggle to restore democratic rule in the country will not necessarily be a confrontation with the military but will involve the participation of all patriotic Nigerians. The papers quote a statement by NADECO urging Nigerians to remain resolute in their demand for democracy. THE PUNCH and THE VANGUARD report that the group also demanded the resignation of democrats and progressives in government who, according to it, have been lending credibility to the military administration. The group's ultimatum to the Abacha administration to hand over power to a democratic national government expired last night. "Federal Government Keeps M.K.O. Under Close Watch" -- the TRIBUNE: The paper reports that a secret security network has been woven around Chief M.K.O. Abiola, apparently to prevent him from making any move that might undermine the authority of the government. The TRIBUNE notes that though there have been no overt moves to restrict his movement, Chief Abiola is believed to be tailed by security agents who also monitor his interaction with people. The paper reports that the fresh security measures might have been adopted in a move widely interpreted as government's reaction to threats by prodemocracy groups to wrest power from it. THE VANGUARD reports that the Nigerian Government has given the National Constitutional Conference the green light to discuss the annulled 12 June election when it convenes this month. The issue, according to the report, will be discussed under a broad topic: Sanctity of Democracy and the Democratic Process. According to THE VANGUARD, the issue has been placed under Item 28 in the conference agenda.
