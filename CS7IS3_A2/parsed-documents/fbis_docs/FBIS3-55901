FBIS3-55901 "drsov008_s_94007" FBIS-SOV-94-008 Document Type:Daily Report 12 Jan 1994 Georgia Independent Press Terms Media Policy, `Injustice' AU0801173294 Tbilisi NOVAYA GAZETA in Russian No. 37 (66) Dec 93 p 1 AU0801173294 Tbilisi NOVAYA GAZETA Language: Russian Article Type:BFN [Unattributed article: "If You Behave Yourselves Well, We Will Help"] [Text] The Cabinet of Ministers has allocated 3 1/2 billion coupons from the state budget to cover the debts of four newspapers to the "Samshoblo" Publishing House where they are published and from whom they rent offices. The lion's share of this amount -- approximately 1.8 billion [coupons] -- has been allocated to the newspaper SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA. As the heads of the publishing house have said, this sum is being formally transferred from the budget simply for publishing needs. However, to all intents and purposes, this "injection" is being allocated specifically to SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA, SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA, and two publications appearing in the Armenian and Azeri languages. The sum is nothing out of the ordinary and, in general, there would have been nothing unusual in this had it not been for one circumstance. All four newspapers were formerly the official organs of the Communist Party Central Committee and Supreme Soviet of Georgia. However, following all the state political upheavals that started in Georgia three years ago and that have seemingly continued to this day, they were reregistered as independent publications. Nevertheless, they have continued, in the main, to fulfill their previous functions. The problem would not have arisen had the state structures admitted that they were openly protecting their own papers. Such a draft decision now seems to be in preparation. However, this as yet hidden patronage is causing justifiable resentment among the mass of other truly independent publications. The overwhelming majority of papers that are not so loyal to the authorities are barely managing to make ends meet. However, they are regularly paying their debts to the publishing house as they fear for their fates. True, even by doing this, they cannot boast that they are being regularly published. Objective difficulties concerning paper supply, electricity, and many other things encountered by the single publishing house responsible for production and equipment affects, first and foremost, precisely independent publications. Some of them have been hit harder than others. Criminal proceedings have been initiated against the "Zviadist" newspapers [IBERIA-SPEKTR, SAKARTVELOS SAMREKLO] and their publication has been halted. DRONI employees are still being hauled up before the Procurator's Office for publishing an interview with Nodar Natadze, chairman of the Popular Front and one of the leaders of the opposition in parliament, whose remarks opposing Georgia's entry into the CIS were assessed as an incitement to violence. The popular newspaper 7 DGHE, which takes a restrained but very critical line against the current authorities, is in very bad shape. A few months ago, a group of armed people, who were not pleased with certain articles that had been published, raked the editor in chief's office with gunfire and damaged a large amount of editorial equipment. Then, last week, the remaining computers and printers were stolen. In general, when certain independent newspapers have to suffer in this way, it is understandable why government help to other -- also "independent" -- newspapers is viewed as blatant injustice. Meanwhile, the resignation of Archil Gogeliya, chairman of the Television and Radio Broadcasting Corporation, has been received in Eduard Shevardnadze's office. Certain television employees with whom we spoke suppose that it was the result of incessant "pressure" applied on the chairman from "above." The leaders of opposition forces in Georgia have also pointed out that their access to radio and television has been made extremely difficult of late. However, Gogeliya's resignation has yet to be accepted.
