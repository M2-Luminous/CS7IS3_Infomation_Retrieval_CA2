The foregoing is part of the presentation on contamination of the environment offered yesterday [7 Nov 1993] by Luis Munguia, the director of the Center for the Study and Control of Contaminants (CESCCO) of the Ministry of Health. The official basically attributed this problem to industrial wastes and feces deposited in the water and on the ground, from which they are carried by the air to food consumed by the public. Munguia confirmed what had already been published by LA PRENSA, that 80 percent of the water used by the public is contaminated by human waste, except for Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, where water is treated before reaching the consumer. As an example, the CESCCO researcher indicated that, of 36 industrial firms in this city, only one has anything approaching a system for treating industrial waste. This suggests, he said, that the remainder of the industries contribute to environmental contamination by discarding their refuse anywhere. He said that in San Pedro Sula there is a tannery whose highly toxic waste is contaminating the Chamelecon River. He described similar situations in innumerable municipalities throughout the country, where Public Health and municipal inspectors do nothing while contamination becomes worse. Obsolete drainage systems, systems of ``floating'' sewage in the streets, and inadequate drainage systems in industrial enterprises stimulate the increase in environmental contamination. This will continue as long as the necessary measures are not taken, Munguia said. With unusual frankness for an official, Munguia said that there are agencies that have no reason to exist. Some agencies are afraid to enforce the law with companies that contaminate the environment, and others authorize unrestrained urban construction without any regulation. The timidity shown by the authorities in applying the law to those companies without sewage treatment systems is related to political commitments they have made with business during campaigns. ``Something must be done today, not tomorrow or the day after.'' With that remark, Munguia launched an appeal to society to join the fight to protect the environment from pollution. CESCCO expert Guillermo Espinoza also took part in the cycle of lectures and outlined the actions that the organization carries out in its role as investigative agency for problems of contamination.
