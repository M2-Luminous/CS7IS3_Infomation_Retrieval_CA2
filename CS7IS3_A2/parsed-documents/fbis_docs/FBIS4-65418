In the interrogatory motion he presented on Friday [13 May] to the Office of the Parliament Speaker, Sadak asked Interior Minister Nahit Mentese to respond to those claims. He said according to the claims of the villagers and local sources, the villages of Caglayan and Hisar annexed to the town of Cizre, the villages of Kusagili and Beave annexed to the Sirnak city center, the village of Kuskonar annexed to the town of Guclukonak and the village of Sapaca annexed to the town of Uludere town had been bombed by Turkish warplanes. In his motion, Sadak claimed that there were allegations that 48 people had been killed and that the names of all the deceased could not be determined due to the migration of the villagers. He listed the names of the people who he claimed were identified as having been killed in the bombings as follows: "The village of Kuskonar: Mehmet Benzer (30), Ali Benzer (25), Omer Benzer (10), Nurettin Benzer (7), Cicek Benzer (2), Ayse Benzer (35), Ayse Benzer (30), Elmas Yiuldirim (50), Serfie Yildirim (30), Baharuk Yildirim (13), Melese Yildirim (14), Saban Yildirim (4), Mirza Yildirim (2), Cicek Yildirim (2), Irfan Yildirim (4), Krem Yildirim (2), Fecire Altan (40), Haci Altan (10), Kedin Altan (3), Mahmut Aygur (65), Adil Aygur (18), Ayse Aygur (18), Ibrahim Burak (50), Anna Burak (50), Omer Kalkan (40). Those who were wounded in this village are Suleyman Benzer (4), Rasit Benzer (4), Fatma Benzer (30) and Asya Benzer (30). "The village of Kusagili: Serve Kacar (100), Xoxe Kacar (60), Masallah Kacar (17), Ahmet Kacar (baby), Hasan Kacar (baby), Ayse Bengin (60), Nuriye Bengin (14), Fatma Bedir (6), Leyla Erdinc (baby), Zahide Kilinc (baby) and an unidentified villager.

Sadak inquired whether or not Mentese had launched an investigation into the bombing incidents which resulted in the death of 48 people and the wounding of more than 100. His motion contained the following questions: "More than one month has elapsed since the incidents. Has your office launched any investigation? "If an investigation has been conducted, have the people who suffered from the bombing been interviewed? "Do you agree with the statement that the bombs were dropped mistakenly? If you do, do you play to compensate for the damages suffered by those people? "If a `deliberate' action led to the massacre or `negligence' caused the disaster, has anyone been prosecuted or punished? "Do you play to take serious action and enlighten the public about this issue? If those who gave instructions to bomb are not brought to the surface, it will be very difficult for the people to become motivated to be loyal to the administration."
