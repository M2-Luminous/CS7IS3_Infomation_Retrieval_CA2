Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or the ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270. B. Montana Montana received partial Phase I Interim authorization in February, 1981. Complete Phase I authorization was received in February, 1982. Final authorization of the base program was received in July, 1984. EPA has reviewed Montana's application, and has made an immediate final decision that Montana's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Montana. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until February 18, 1994. Copies of Montana's application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the Addresses section of this notice. Approval of Montana's program revision shall become effective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received, EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. A draft application was submitted on January 7, 1991. The State of Montana addressed all of EPA's concerns prior to submittal of the final application. Thus, the Montana program is granted immediate final authorization for the provisions in the following Table.
