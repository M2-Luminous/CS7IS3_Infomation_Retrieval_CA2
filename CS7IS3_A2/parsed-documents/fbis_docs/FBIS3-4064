When it comes to the economy, however, Zhu Rongji is actually the archenemy. His position and official duties can help give authority to his remarks on China's economy on one hand, while they easily turn him into a target of public criticism on the other. His ability to rein the economy, which he displayed last June when he took charge of macroeconomic control and regulation, has once again shown his talent in the economic field. Up until now, however, he continues to insists on carrying out macroeconomic control and regulatory measures, remaining firm on his stance even when described unfavorably by some local officials as "a man who believes in withdrawing and centralizing power." Some important figures at the central level have also made veiled criticisms of him, thus adding to the pressure on his work. Such a situation is a clear indication of the existing divergence between the central authorities and local governments on the future direction of economic development, especially on the question of whether autonomy should be withdrawn from or delegated to lower levels and whether we should centralize or decentralize power. Although the "50 Provisions" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee have already answered this question through the assertion that only the establishment of a market economic structure can solve this problem, friction between the central authorities and regional governments are increasing during the process of the planned economy's transformation into a market economy, and Zhu Rongji is naturally the first to bear the brunt. Sources from Beijing have revealed that, in the speech he delivered in his capacity as State Council vice premier and president of the People's Bank of China at the national financial and monetary work conference in mid-January this year, Zhu Rongji reaffirmed the results of last year's campaign of rectifying the financial and monetary order, stressing the need to unremittingly abide by the "three-point law" formulated at the previous national financial and monetary work conference in July last year. Some local officials do not agree with him, however, and have called for "a serious study of last year's campaign of rectifying the financial and monetary order and stepping up macroeconomic control and regulation." Some have even accused Zhu Rongji of being "a man who advocates the planned economy under the cover of reform" and "plays a role in resuming and reestablishing the planned economic structure." Suffering New Pressure From the "Eight-Character Canon" What merits special attention is that Tian Jiyun, NPC Standing Committee vice chairman, delivered a speech entitled "The Eight-Character Canon of 'Reform, Opening up, Delegating Greater Power to Lower Levels, and Relaxing Control'" at a recent symposium on the study of Deng Xiaoping's market economy ideology, which was attended by many famed economists in Shenzhen not long ago. In his speech, Tian Jiyun asserted that the "Eight-Character Canon" is the only way to promote China's market economy, and raises a question on whether we can continue to abide by this "Eight-Character Canon." Tian Jiyun's speech won the general approval of most participants. The basics of the "Eight-Character Canon" include persistent efforts to "delegate greater autonomy to lower levels" and oppose the "centralization and withdrawal of powers." It is believed that such remarks are directed at Zhu Rongji's macroeconomic control and regulation, putting new pressure on the man. However, an economist who is in favor of Zhu Rongji's economic reform strategies believes that the delegation or centralization of power is an inevitable phenomenon under the planned economic structure. The "50-clause" policy decision made by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee is precisely aimed at breaking with the format of the delegation or centralization of power so as to establish a new market economic structure. Judging by the standards of the market economy, the delegation of power is not necessarily the synonym of reform, while the centralization of power does not necessarily antireform. It will prove more beneficial to the establishment of a market economic structure if we can centralize the powers that are abused in arbitrary fund collection and investment, and concentrate our financial strength on infrastructure construction projects, which have a great bearing on the national economy and the people's standard of living. The macroeconomic control and regulation advocated by Zhu Rongji is aimed precisely at achieving this goal. The Charges Made by Regional Officials Against Zhu Are Not Totally Groundless Sources have said that, according to the analysis of some economic experts, the charges made by the regional officials -- though involving misunderstandings in many areas -- are not totally unwarranted. Some local officials believe that the enthusiasm displayed by both central authorities and regions help form the basis of development, and reform is also aimed at bringing the two enthusiasms into full play. All they have said is quite right. The most striking feature of mainland China is its imbalanced economic development. It is impossible to carry out development and reform at the same pace in different localities. The forced implementation of a policy or a program formulated by the central authorities throughout the country will either intensify or suppress the imbalance, both of which will have an adverse effect on the entire economy. Therefore, uniformity should not be imposed on different localities and regions; instead, development plans need to be drawn up in light of local conditions. For example, under the new financial and taxation system, the central authorities put forward a "financial and tax refund" policy, by which the central authorities will first centralize local tax revenues and then make pro rata refunds to different localities in accordance with the basic figures of their financial expenditures. This policy is aimed at strengthening the central authorities' ability to keep control of the local economies. When it comes to reality, however, regional governments feel restrictions in many ways, and they all worry about a slowdown in their economy if the central authorities fail to keep their promises. What is more, with the defects of overcentralization, major waste, high accumulation, and poor economic efficiency, the central authorities have had hardly any success in the projects that they were committed to over the past many years, thus making the local government very skeptical about the central authorities' capacity to set up a powerful macroeconomic control and regulation system, even though they have such major centralized financial power in their hands. People from Beijing's economic circles have pointed out that Deng Xiaoping once aired his view on protecting the enthusiasm of different localities on the eve of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Deng said: "It is necessary to strengthen macroeconomic control and enhance the authority of the central officials. We should not use the old methods of the planned economy to reach our goal, however. The central authorities should have a clear idea on what they should or should not handle and should never restrain the enthusiasm of the localities and enterprises by keeping all power in their own hands. To this end, we need to carry out reform and rely on reform to build up the central authorities' capabilities in macroeconomic control and regulation." Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of economic work and macroeconomic control and regulation, needs to heed the warning in Deng Xiaoping's remarks. The principal officials of the central government must pay attention to protecting the enthusiasm of local governments, for in this way they can dissolve contradictions between the central and local governments. Raising the "Theory of Moderation" During His Japan Visit Sources have indicated that, despite the local officials' misunderstandings and unfavorable comments about Zhu Rongji, the CPC top leadership and senior statesmen still affirm and support Zhu's work. At the start of last year's campaign of rectifying the financial and monetary order, Deng Xiaoping warned "not to interfere in Zhu Rongji's work." Recently, Deng Xiaoping again affirmed Zhu's accomplishments in rectifying the financial and monetary order, saying "To succeed in reform, we must advance in an orderly way under leadership" and "successful macroeconomic control should be reflected by the authority of the central authorities," for "if the party Central Committee and the State Council lack sufficient authority, the situation will get out of control." On many occasions, Zhu Rongji has stressed the need to "carry out Deng Xiaoping's ideological theory in a positive, comprehensive, and correct way." We should be good at seizing favorable opportunities, yet we also need to restrain ourselves from making blind moves. Another CPC senior statesman Bo Yibo also said recently: "The pace of development and economic efficiency must be integrated organically. While speeding up the pace of development, we should persistently seek truth from facts, proceed in everything from reality, and never compete with one another to attain faster growth." He also stressed the need to "acquire an accurate and comprehensive understanding of Deng Xiaoping's thought." All these represent powerful support for Zhu Rongji. However, it has been known to all that one of Deng Xiaoping's major theories reads "Development is the last word." How will Zhu Rongji put this theory into practice? The "theory of moderation" that he raised during his visit to Japan in late February this year is fresh and new to everyone. Zhu Rongji said: "In 1992, China's economy entered a phase of high-speed development, and its economic growth rate has gone as high as 15 percent for two years running. Such rapid growth also resulted in an overheated economy, however. The macroeconomic control measures we have adopted since last June have helped bring a swift and favorable turn to the situation. From this, we have realized that we should remain moderate in everything we do. Here we emphasize once again that there should not be big fluctuations in China's national economic growth, and we should maintain sustained, healthy, and rapid economic development. Any move to abruptly slow down the speed will prove destabilizing to society. Therefore, it is highly essential that we maintain a certain speed. This year, China will achieve a fairly high economic growth of 9 percent, and we expect to maintain this rate in the coming several years. We are all oriental countries which believe in the doctrine of the mean, and moderation is the essence of the doctrine of the mean." If what he says is true, China stands a very good chance of success in maintaining healthy economic growth.
