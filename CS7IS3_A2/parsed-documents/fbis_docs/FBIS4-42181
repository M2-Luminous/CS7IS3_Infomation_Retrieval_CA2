A statement stressed that the move was libertarian in inspiration. A similar proposal was presented to parliament by the Reformists' predecessors, the civil libertarian Radicals, in 1982. In their statement, the six signatories to the bill said that "it is just at this difficult time that one must affirm with intransigence and rigour the values of that same liberal tolerance, that safeguarding of all freedoms starting with freedom of speech, that were and are the inspiration and the founding criterion of antitotalitarian antifascism." "It is at a time that the postfascists have obtained full legitimacy, while legitimate concerns have been raised, that rigorous tolerance must be affirmed in all its force," the Reformists said, apparently in reference to a threatened encroachment on free speech in the wake of a national rally of neo-Nazi skinheads 10 days ago. Two officials at the northern town of Vicenza, the scene of the march, were sacked by Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, who said there would be no repetition, and yesterday declared war on extremists of all stripes. The bill is identical to one represented on May 16 by Foreign Undersecretary Vincenzo Trantino, of the hard right National Alliance, immediately disowned and withdrawn by party leader Gianfranco Fini, who has stepped up his drive to distance what he calls the "postfascist" Alliance from the neofascist roots of its major component, the Italian Social Movement. The libertarian MPs' stance contrasted somewhat with that of Fini, who has repeatedly condemned neo-Nazis as "racist idiots" and said that those who took part in the Vicenza march should be "sent to the salt mines." Around 30 young members of the Italian Social Movement who took part in the march were immediately ejected from the party. But the move by one of the conservative government's smaller and lesser-known allies -- who have not actually entered government, but profess "external support" -- will do little to snuff flickering international concern over the presence in the Berlusconi cabinet of three ministers and numerous undersecretaries from the Italian Social Movement. Italy's partners have been assured by Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino, in Brussels last week and in Washington yesterday, that Berlusconi's is essentially a centrist government and that the National Alliance's moves away from the Italian Social Movement are strong and sincere.
