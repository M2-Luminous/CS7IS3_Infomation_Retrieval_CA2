In the Asia Pacific region, ASEAN members have been making brisk moves toward creating a regional security system following the end of the Cold War, and Australia's bid for exchanges with Japan in the defense area is interpreted as an indication that nations in the region are showing great interest in Japan not only in the economic area, but in the security area. Australia has begun reviewing its post-Cold War security strategy. It has recently compiled a basic defense plan, analyzing that, "although U.S. influence on the security of the Asia Pacific region has waned, the military presence of China, Japan, and India in the region has grown." Australia is believed to have sounded out Japan about military exchanges between the two countries with the aim of making it clear that it also places importance on Asian nations in the security area. Japan has responded to Australia's proposal by simply saying, "We will study" out of consideration for our position of attaching importance to relations with the United States. Japan, however, plans to make a final decision on the Australian proposal after analyzing the situation in the Asia Pacific region. The Asia Pacific region has yet to build its own collective security system because of its ethnic and cultural diversity. With regard to multilateral dialogue for the regional security, the "ASEAN region forum" is set to hold its first session this year and it will be attended by ASEAN member nations' foreign ministerial conference, Japan, the United States, China, and Russia.
