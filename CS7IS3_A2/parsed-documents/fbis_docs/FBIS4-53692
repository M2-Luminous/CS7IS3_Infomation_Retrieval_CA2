FBIS4-53692 "dreas099_a_94028" FBIS-EAS-94-099 Daily Report 20 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Hata Revises `Universal Security' Statement Hata Revises `Universal Security' Statement OW2105005694 Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese 1000 GMT 20 May 94 OW2105005694 Tokyo NHK General Television Network Japanese BFN [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" program] [Text] In the upper house Budget Committee session today, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata explained the coalition's uniform definition of the expression Fuhenteki Anzen Hosho [Universal Security] -- the expression used in describing Japan's concept of security in the coalition parties' policy agreements. Hata said the coalition's uniform view is that this expression refers only to the general framework of peace and security provided by the United Nations. The collective security in the UN Charter means a cooperative act by the international community to restore peace if peace is threatened or an act of aggression takes place. The charter also talks about possible specific actions, including military operations. But Prime Minister Hata said the concept of universal security refers to the general framework accepted by the international community on maintaining peace and security under the United Nations. He said this term is different from collective security, but did not clarify whether this term has a military connotation. The coalition partners have been said to have different views on the question of whether the term [universal security] included the possibility of military action. Prime Minister Hata had earlier told the lower house Budget Committee that the words -- universal security and collective security -- have roughly the same meaning. Today's announcement that the two terms do have different meanings amounts to an amendment to Hata's earlier statement. Observers said this is an attempt by the coalition partners to avoid giving the impression that since the two terms are said to be the same thing, the Japanese Government may be willing to take part in UN military operations.
