In a statement issued today on the world environment day, the assembly pointed out that the Iraqi people are denied the simplest requirements of life; namely, food and medicines, with the full knowledge of the UN organizations. It also pointed to the practices pursued by such UN institutions on the pretext of protecting human rights. The statement added that safeguarding the world environment should emanate from curbing the U.S. policy which is hostile to the world states and people. In this regard, the statement pointed to the aggressive war against Iraq which destroyed drinking water purification stations, sewage disposal stations, fuel tanks, and oil wells. This resulted in the worst environmental disaster in the world. The statement stressed the need for consolidating and continuing the efforts to safeguard both the environment and public health as a prelude to lifting the unfair economic blockade on the Iraqi people because it would be another environmental and health gain on the international level.
