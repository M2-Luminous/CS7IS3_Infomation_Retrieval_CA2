Now that a new year has been ushered in, what fate lies in store for the state bonds market? Securities dealers hold that this market is likely to take off from its present trough and become brisk again as a result of the enactment and promulgation of certain laws, such as the "Law on the People's Bank of China," the "Law on Securities," and the "Law on State Bonds," along with the progress in reform of the monetary and financial systems. "Gilt-Edged Bonds" Should Be Favored Nowadays the Chinese people have a better understanding of monetary affairs, as they are earning more and more money. They want to put their spare money to work and are seeking the most profitable channels for investment. Despite the numerous other ways to make investments, there are at present three major ones: Bank deposits, stocks, and bonds. To make the right choice, people have to take three factors into consideration: security, mobility, and return on investment. In terms of security, state bonds are guaranteed by the credit of the government. No matter how the market trend changes, the investors will not suffer risks -- such as those caused by poor management and bankruptcy of enterprises, as well as by bad debts -- and their principal and interest are assured. The risks on the stock market are much greater. On 10 October 1987, which was called Black Monday," the Dow-Jones Index fell 508 points in a single day, or a slump of 23 percent. Within only a few hours, more than US$500 billion-worth of stocks became worthless. Two big slumps in the stock markets in Shenzhen and Shanghai also gave Chinese stockholders their first taste of the risks in investing in stocks. In terms of gains, the interest rate of state bonds is 1.72-2 percentage points higher than that of bank deposits. If one is shrewd and buys state bonds on the securities market, one normally can reap an even greater profit of 14-17 percent. Some experts hold that judging by the experience in the development of securities markets both at home and abroad, the rate of gains from investment in stocks is roughly 10 percent, while that from investment in bonds is about eight percent. The current situation in China is that gains from investment in stocks are several times or even a few dozen times higher than the gains from investment in bonds. This is an infantile disorder of the stock market, but it certainly cannot last for long, as the stock market is becoming more mature. In terms of mobility, a market for the circulation of state bonds is taking shape in China. Along with the progress of reform in the monetary and financial systems, a much improved and unified national bond market develop rapidly. The mobility of state bonds then will be greatly improved. Compared with stocks and other securities, state bonds are less risky, and they yield more lucrative gains than bank deposits. Having the advantages of being risk-free, of being cashable, and of being circulated throughout the country, state bonds are the best thing for people to invest in: saving much time, eliminating a lot of worry, and reaping steady profits. If speculation in stocks and real estate is considered the prerogative of the wealthy, investment in state bonds should be regarded as the "territory" for wage earners. There is no reason why state bonds should not be favored by the broad masses. Why Does the State Bond Market Fluctuate? When the state first issued national treasury bonds to citizens in 1982, it set the interest rate at 10 percent, which was fairly high considering the actual situation at the time. The bonds did not receive much response because the people did not have as much money as they do now. At that time, the issuance of state treasury bonds was treated as a political task, and the overwhelming majority of people bought the bonds merely to show their patriotism. Even then, however, a tiny number of people saw that the value of the bonds could be increased in circulation, and they secretly engaged in buying and selling the bonds. After only a few years, some of these people had become very wealthy. In legal terms, they were "speculators" on the "black market." Objectively, however, they played the role of promoting the circulation of state bonds. The state treasury bonds issued in 1988 fared even worse. Owing to the high inflation rate, those who bought the bonds immediately dumped them on the market, causing a big slump in the prices of state bonds and a rather long-term depression in the state bond market. In 1990, the interest rate was raised to 14 percent. When people cashed the bonds three years later, they found that gains from investment in the bonds were very lucrative. When the bonds were put up for sale, they did not neet with an enthusiastic response, probably because people had not yet emerged from the shadow of inflation. The bonds were neglected for a long time. Things began to turn for the better in 1991. When the first batch of state treasury bonds was issued in 1992, people rushed to purchase them, and in many major cities people stood in line all night. By the end of May, when the sales ended, many people -- especially those in the smaller cities and rural counties -- complained that they had been robbed of the opportunity. Nevertheless, the exciting situation did not last long. When the second batch was issued in June and July, the trend took a dramatic turn, and sales in major cities were sluggish. When the first batch of bonds began to enter the market for circulation in June, the prices nosed down continuously. Later, the pirces of the first and second batches of bonds even dropped below face value. The major reasons for this situation were: First, most of the first batch of bonds were held by institutional investors, and as the state adopted measures to limit the hoarding of securities and the re-loaning of funds, a large number of these investors had to dump the bonds, to their own loss. Second, the overheated craze in stocks and the pooling of funds siphoned off large amounts of funds, which adversely affected the people's enthusiasm for state treasury bonds. Third, the state bonds were not put on sale in vast areas, and sales were not promoted vigorously. People who bought the three-year state treasury bonds suffered losses in 1992 owing to devaluation of the bonds. They were scared away when the bonds were issued again in 1993, even though the interest rate for three-year bonds was raised to 13.96 percent and that for five-year bonds was raised to 15.86 percent, in addition to government-approved measures to guarantee their value. Only 15 percent of the bonds were sold on schedule. In view of this situation, the sales period had to be extended and administrative measures had to be taken. The task was not completed until 15 July. Despite the setbacks in the issuance of state treasury bonds, great achievements were made in 1993 in the development of the state bond market. For instance, in conjunction with the introduction of contracted buying and selling of some no-certificate state treasury bonds in 1993, China successfully established a system of self-management in dealing with state bonds. This indicated that China's state bond market had taken a satisfactory step toward standardization and operation in accordance with international conventions. The introduction of state bonds futures trading and the mechanism for buying back the bonds also greatly spurred the development of the spot market for state bonds. In mid-December 1993, the spot prices of various types of state bonds all witnessed hikes to different degrees, and began to emerge from the long-term trough. Since the beginning of this year, the price hikes have become even greater. The major reason for this situation is that the state, be means of macroregulation and control, has curbed the the overheated development of the real estate industry and the pooling of private funds. Moreover, the introduction of major measures for reform of the monetary and financial systems has further demonstrated a brighter future for the state bond market, thus enhancing investor confidence in these bonds. State Bonds Hopefully Will Be in Demand Again Judging from the problems arising in the issuance and circulation of state bonds in recent years, there are many setbacks in the operational mechanism. The major ones are: The circulation of state bonds has not been linked with the circulation of bank credits, conspicuously narrowing the room for development of the circulation market for such bonds; the periods and varieties of state bonds are too restricted, making them unable to meet the varied demands of investors in different social strata; state bonds are issued in only a few months of the year, which upsets the balance between supply and demand; the interest rates of the bonds cannot change in line with changes in the market, so China cannot establish a regulatory fund to enforce effective regulation and control according to changes in the market; and there are too many organizations in charge of the issuance of state bonds, and they are inefficient. In view of the problems in the operational mechanism, a series of reform measures will be taken in the issuance of state bonds this year. Securities dealers hold that the market for these bonds this year enjoys promising prospects. Their major arguments are: The establishment and development of a unified national money market system, including state bonds, has been listed as a major item on the reform agenda this year; the State Council has decided that, starting from this year, the central financial departments will no longer be allowed to overdraw from the central bank to offset deficits, which can only be balanced through issuing state bonds, and this means that both the amount and varieties of bonds will be increased; on the basis ofthe current medium- and long-term bonds, 8 to 10-year long-term bonds and one-year short-term ones will be issued to meet the varied demands of investors in different strata of society; this year the central bank will try out the method of open market operation, that is, using the purchase and sales of government bonds and other monetary commodities to regulate the money market, money supply, and interest rates. The issuance of state securities will be contracted to a group of monetary organizations that have the ability to undertake wholesale business in these bonds, so as to replace the former practice of apportioning, and the interest rates will be decided through price competition on the market -- this, no doubt, will greatly promote the circulation in the state bond market; the marketing time for various bonds will be adjusted to give priority to the issuance of state bonds, and bonds with different terms also will be issued at different times so as to balance supply and demand; work will begin to establish a unified national account transfer and settlement system to provide investors with a complete range of services in the purchase and transfer of state bonds, as well as the payment of principal and interest, and to introduce and expand the circulation of no-certificate state bonds, improve the efficiency of market operation, and establish a fund to regulate the operations of second-class markets and improve the environment for first-class markets. In addition, public fear of inflation will last for some time, and it inevitably will drive many people to invest their money in securities to prevent devaluation -- this will cause large sums of money to flow into the state bond market. Although state bond will be issued mainly to organizations this year, this does not mean that ordinary citizens will not be able to buy them, as it is reported that the Ministry of Finance will issue savings bonds to individual investors in the form of selling the bonds over special counters.
