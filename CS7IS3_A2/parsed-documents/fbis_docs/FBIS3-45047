As greatly excited as other cadres, staff members, and workers throughout the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC], I cherish the memory of Mao Zedong, the great man with outstanding achievements. Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist. He was the chief founder of our party, Army, and state, and the great leader of the Chinese people of all nationalities. He has held an everlasting important position in contemporary history as well as in the history of the development of Marxism and socialism. He creatively combined the fundamental tenets of Marxism with concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, pooled the experience and wisdom of our party, and formed Mao Zedong Thought. His erudite and profound theoretical thinking is a spiritual treasure house that is inexhaustible for our study and application. The great achievements of Comrade Mao Zedong are comprehensive. Through protracted and extreme hardships and difficulties, he led the Chinese people in overthrowing the three big mountains, founding New China, and subsequently engaging in various facets of construction. As a great strategist in foreign affairs, he conducted substantial pioneering work for, and made tremendous contributions to, the establishment of China's foreign strategy and the formulation of foreign policies. He also performed immortal deeds in the establishment of China's foreign economic and trade system and the formulation of the principles and policies of foreign economy and trade, which has been part and parcel of the foreign work. Comrade Mao Zedong always took the country's undertaking in foreign trade and economic cooperation very seriously. As early as the time when the CPC was setting up revolutionary bases and liberated areas before the founding of the republic, Comrade Mao Zedong proposed that decisionmaking power in foreign trade should be in the hands of the people, which should be taken as an objective of China's new democratic revolution. For this purpose, practice in pioneering the cause should be carried out. At a preparatory meeting of the new Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held on the eve of New China's birth, Comrade Mao Zedong proclaimed: "The Chinese people are willing to have friendly cooperation with the people of various countries in the world, and resume and develop business contacts with them to facilitate the growth of production and bring about a prosperous economy." After the PRC was founded, Comrade Mao Zedong took hold of the overall situation and enthusiastically showed concern for China's foreign economic and trade undertaking, regarding the positive development of foreign economic cooperation and trade relations, to be based on independence and self-reliance under the principle of equality and mutual benefit, as a guiding ideology of economic and trade exchange between China and the world. He presided over relevant meetings several times to keep abreast of the foreign economic and trade work and to examine and approve major steps for the establishment and development of New China's socialist cause in the area of foreign economy and trade as well as the basic principles and policies of relevant work. Also, he repeatedly pointed out the necessity of relying mainly on the domestic market while making the foreign market subsidiary, but stressing the importance of developing the latter. Its significance must not be underestimated, nor must the efforts to develop this market be slackened. It was his consistent view of doing business, both with the socialist and people's democratic countries and the capitalist countries. When he met with leaders and delegations who came to visit China or when he personally visited commodity fairs, he would instruct foreign trade workers to conduct wide-ranging exchanges at home and abroad, open up the international market, expand exports, and ensure product quality, with a view to rapidly developing and expanding China's national economy. With a view to furthering friendly relations between China and the world, Comrade Mao Zedong, in the spirit of patriotism and internationalism, stressed the need to vigorously conduct economic cooperation and trade with foreign countries to serve China's foreign work and socialist construction. Guided by his brilliant thought, foreign economic and trade work has become a bridge promoting friendly contacts between the Chinese people and the people of various countries, which has given impetus to developing China's cooperation with the international community. Thanks to Comrade Mao Zedong's concern, the foreign economic and trade system of New China deliberately took shape in a relatively short period of time, which has played an important role in socialist modernization, and which has held a certain position in international economic relations and trade as well. Such momentous achievements have opened vast vistas for the development of China's foreign economic and trade undertaking. Today, the purpose of reviewing Comrade Mao Zedong's immortal feats for China's revolution and construction, his tremendous contributions to the liberation of the oppressed peoples and the cause of human progress, and his concern for foreign economic and trade undertaking lies in cherishing memory of Comrade Mao Zedong, in expressing our feeling of respects for him and, more importantly, in emulating Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant thought of developing foreign economic and trade undertaking under the new historical condition, in a bid to open up the future of the foreign economic and trade undertaking under the constant guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has inherited and developed Mao Zedong Thought by integrating Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought with practice in contemporary China and the characteristics of the age. He put forth a complete set of theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is the valuable wealth of the CPC and the Chinese people. At present, we should develop the style of study of integrating theory with practice, conscientiously study Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, systematically master the spirit and essence of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, arm the minds of party members, cadres, staff, and workers of our ministry with this theory, and more consciously apply the Marxist stand, views, and methods in studying and resolving new problems. It is particularly necessary to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the theoretical base and guiding principle for doing our foreign economic and trade work, and to seriously study and solve the major practical and theoretical problems urgently awaiting a solution in the course of the in-depth foreign economic and trade structural reform to wrest new victory in the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and in the foreign economic and trade undertakings. Today, in recalling Comrade Mao Zedong, we should take the great achievements and ideological examples of Comrade Mao Zedong and other proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation as well as the concern and expectations of Comrade Mao Zedong for foreign economic and trade work as an enormous spiritual strength that constantly inspires us in our victorious advances. Under the leadership of the party's Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, let all party members, cadres, staff, and workers throughout MOFTEC steadfastly persist in the party's basic line, unite as one, forge ahead, and work in a solid manner, to prove ourselves to be worthy of the concern shown by Comrade Mao Zedong and other proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation for our foreign economic and trade work, to achieve the magnificent objective of the in-depth foreign economic and trade structural reform sketched by the 14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and to strive to fulfill various missions set forth by the party and state for foreign economic and trade work!
