They filled the streets, squares, and highways of the kray center and environs. "Some VIP's have come, evidently," the shrewdest onlookers decided, glancing around apprehensively. The ordinary people of Kransodar were clairvoyant. In fact, Internal Affairs Minister V.F. Yerin had flown into the kray to attend a session of the kray administration collegium to discuss the crime situation, which has become critical. Our big chiefs are automatically kept away from the people, given the kid glove treatment. Because the people are a multitudinous mass, there is no need to be particularly protective toward them. If someone is killed or goes missing he will immmediately be replaced by several law-abiding or not very law-abiding citizens. At least, that was the case before the reforms, when Russia's women, without shirking and without delving into politics, would unfailingly keep the population topped up. Now they are clearly falling down on the job. Are they on strike, perhaps, or are they too politicized? The more we democratize, in fact, the more noticeably thin our ranks become. Well, what of it? Some people would say there are too many people in the country anyway. So they fire pistols, submachineguns, and tank guns at the people and at their elected representatives. They have crack units on the ready, so that the people know their place. While their leaders, not fearing and not made to feel awkward by the "common folk," confidently drove wherever they needed to go -- toward the yawning heights of capitalism. So it is probably no accident that Viktor Fedorovich paid such keen attention to the actions of "Cobra" -- a crack subunit of the special purpose militia detachment -- during his visit to the kray. And there was certainly something to see. These Russian equivalents of the U.S. supermen were expertly restraining and blocking the "mob" and stopping the "toublemakers" operating. On this occasion the special militia was showing off its combat training in a demonstration exercise. The guys acted in the proper manner -- swiftly, vigorously, resolutely, without a moment's hesitation. So they would not let anyone down in future incidents. The minister liked the militia subunits' combat equipment, although the fact that the kray does not have a mounted militia is in his view a major deficiency. Anyway, while the bosses were inspecting their subordinates and having their meeting, life went on as usual in the Kuban. The criminals, who, despite the constant swelling of the law enforcement ranks, still outnumber the militia and who were ignorant of Mr. Yerin's visit, carried on their business as usual -- robbing, killing, raping, thieving, stealing cars. Yet another remarkable fact now from the life of your coprrespondent. At the very moment when Yerin arrived in our crime-infested kray, the head of a Krasnodar organization which leases rooms to various offices, including the firm for which the aforesaid journalist's wife works, was visited by two racketeers with a business proposal -- without causing a fuss and without needlessly bothering the militia (we have our people working in the militia, they said) he must come up with 6 million by such and such a day, or else... The boss was somewhat flabbergasted and tried to show that, in the first place, he did not have that kind of money, because he lived on his modest pay, and second, he was already paying a regular amount through the proper channels, and he gave the name of a specific representative of the "Kuban business world." No dice! The uninvited guests were insistent. Where it will all end no one knows.... To round off, I would like to borrow the words of the poet, paraphrase them somewhat, and ask the question: "Who is my militia protecting?"
