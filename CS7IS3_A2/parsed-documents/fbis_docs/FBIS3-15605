Viktor Glukhovtsev, our Almaty correspondent, is now on the line to the Mayak studio. Over to you, Viktor Ivanovich: [Glukhovtsev] Hello. [Berezovskaya] We can hear you. [Glukhovtsev] First and foremost, Yelena, let me greet you and all of our courageous women on the holiday; but here is what I have to tell you about the election. This is the first time in its history that Kazakhstan has held democratic elections in which every citizen has had the right to stand for the country's parliament. Many have made full use of this right. Public associations, for instance, registered 330 candidates for the Supreme Soviet election, but there are actually 30 more nominees than that. Those are the fruits of democracy for you. Here's another point that needs to be noted. This is also the first time that foreign observers are monitoring the poll. Twenty-four states in Europe, the United States, and Asia have sent representatives to Kazakhstan, and they are scrupulously recording the slightest infraction of the election rules. There have not been many of these infractions, but there have been some, unfortunately. The election code stipulates that premises where ballot papers are kept should be sealed and guarded by the militia. Checks have shown, however, that this rule has not been followed in some places. In some cases, packets of ballot papers were found to have been opened, the seals broken. The same code stipulates that each voter should vote in person and should turn up with the document proving his right to vote, but this stipulation has been ignored rather often in the scramble to ensure that the official turnout is as big as possible. Such violations of the electoral code are no credit to members of constituency and polling station commissions. They cast doubt on the legality of the final results. Let me tell you a bit about the actual voting. According to preliminary figures, over 9.5 million people were eligible to vote. Voting began at 0700 this morning. By 1100 the figures were as follows. Some 1,275,000 people had turned up at polling stations to vote. This is 14 percent of the total. This is, of course, not much compared with previous years. In the republican capital, for example, only 11 percent had voted by then. In Turgay, West Kazakhstan, and Aktyubinsk oblasts it was even less. [Berezovskaya] Viktor Ivanovich... [Glukhovtsev, interrupting] Yes, yes. [Berezovskaya] The latest figures may even have reached Moscow sooner than they reached you. At the moment -- or rather about two hours ago -- a third of the voters had already turned out in the Republic as a whole, it is reported. [Glukhovtsev] Well, the Central Electoral Commission told me that in the Republic as a whole 58 percent of eligible voters had already cast their votes by 1600. So I have fresher information, so to speak. Those are the figures. Well, that's all I have to tell you at the moment. This is Viktor Glukhovtsev with a special report for the Mayak "Panorama."
