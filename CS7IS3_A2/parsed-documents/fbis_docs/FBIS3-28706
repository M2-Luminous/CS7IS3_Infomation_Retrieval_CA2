He said the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo will result in the Vietnamese economy being more active. This will result in increased trade and investment activities which will benefit Thailand. The finance minister believes foreign investment in Vietnam will increase and that Vietnam will benefit from the investment and improve its economic position. However, this will not result in Vietnam drawing the capital market away from Thailand. This is because Vietnam and Thailand have different development and technological bases. Foreign investors in Vietnam will be attracted by the cheap labor, while in Thailand investors emphasize value added products. As a result, there is no fear of market competition. Tharin said: "In fact, increased investment in Vietnam will benefit Thai businessmen because it will result in investment opportunities, such as in the construction sector."
