To Remain in Government or Go Into Constructive Opposition?"] [Text] Whatever the end of the "rotation" of cadres saga which began as a result of Yegor Gaydar's resignation statement Sunday, the very fact of this "incident" already speaks volumes. It feels like a new revolt or coup, or Zhirinovskiy's final victory at some future elections, has just been announced. And this is despite the fact that, even without Gaydar, the government managed to maintain its reformist course in the first nine months of last year. But now is not September 1993 but January 1994. Last fall it seemed that the market coordinates had finally been plotted and that the government's policy had been entirely formalized in this sense. The elections in December 1993 confirmed the forecast of virtually all sober analysts that opposition in society could not be eliminated through coercive methods and the situation of September-October 1993 would be repeated more than once according to the same pattern. And therefore it would be just as difficult to carry out a liberal economic policy as before the October events and the elections. As it turns out, it is even harder. Can it be that Gaydar, whose intellect is equal to the sum of all three presidential analytical centers now undergoing reform, did not realise this? Can it be that his resignation was predetermined even before the December elections? Let us suppose that Gaydar will stay in the government, or return to it. What will this change? It is extremely difficult to carry out a liberal economic policy today given the present composition of the government. The combination of Gaydar, Zaveryukha, Soskovets, and Chubays produces, in Yegor Timurovich's own words, "an indeterminate state." Economically irresponsible decisions -- for which, as always, no one knows who answers -- brought about the "breakdown" of this politician, dubbed in journalists' circles "the Iron Winnie the Pooh." Even "iron" politicians have emotions. It is quite another matter that the presence of Gaydar in the government, given his entirely understandable unwillingness to take responsibility for inflationary decisions, in itself might have become a factor maintaining the reformist line in a more or less acceptable form. But Gaydar is going to the Duma. And here there is an element not only of emotions but normal political tactics. However, will the economic price of this tactic -- a budget deficit -- not be too high? And has not too high a price for the elections already been paid in a political sense? As Gaydar himself once remarked, a government of like-minded individuals is a rare phenomenon. Such a government arises in specific situations, such as, for example, the situation of November 1991. Is not Gaydar preparing to return to the government in precisely such a situation -- but to a homogeneous rather than a coalition government? There are two fundamentally different tactics for the reformers. The first is to remain in the government and carry out their promises: 5-7 percent inflation by the end of the year, financial stabilization, ensuring a favorable climate for investments, slowing the production slump and gradually boosting production -- but not by printing money. Taking account of the emerging composition of the government, the hints of a soft reorientation of economic policy, and the gamble of the cabinet's conservative wing on economic populism, the reformers cannot be confident that it will be possible to fulfill this program. Naturally, they have no desire to share responsibility for economic failures with the proinflationists. Which means that they have to leave the government -- that is the second tactical option. And not simply leave, but become parliamentary oppositionists and criticize expenditure decisions, pumping money into production sectors, growing hyperinflation, and other such socialist "measures" that will inevitably follow their resignations. No one knows how events will develop. Which of the reformers will remain "hostages" in the government is also not yet clear. It cannot be ruled out that the logic of reforms will again return key reformers to Chernomyrdin's cabinet, as happened in 1993. In the final analysis, it is too early to speak about a reorientation of the policy and the views of the incumbent premier -- after Yeltsin the second most notable political figure of the past year. It also cannot be ruled out that another team of reformers will take over the executive levers -- we all know which team I am talking about. Complex political horse-trading lies ahead. All the same, the last word will probably belong to the president.
