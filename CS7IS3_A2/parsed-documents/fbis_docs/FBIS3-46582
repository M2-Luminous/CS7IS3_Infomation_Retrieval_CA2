The investigation into such payments rocked Japanese society during the past year. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office has narrowed the number of possible suspects to the handful of parliamentarians, who had either been cabinet ministers or had exerted influence on general contractors and Construction Ministry officials, the sources said. Prosecutors are looking into whether those politicians had professional authority in connection with the receipt of the money, an essential precondition for being able to arrest and then indict them, the sources said. Over the past decade of bribery scandals involving politicians in Japan, prosecutors faced difficulty in proving that they had official authority. In most cases, politicians called the money they received "political donations," paid to support their political activities. In the past year, prosecutors arrested and subsequently indicted two governors, three mayors and a number of executive officials of general contractors for bribery in connection with prefectural and municipal public works projects. Among the businessmen arrested were Takashi Hashimoto, 57, then vice president of Taisei Corp., Hiroyuki Koyama, 67, then vice president of Shimizu Corp., and Shinji Kiyoyama, 67, then vice president of Kajima Corp. Hashimoto was charged with sending 20 million yen each to then Miyagi Gov. Shuntaro Honma and then Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii, Koyama with giving 10 million yen to then Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi, and Kiyoyama with supplying Takeuchi 20 million yen. The delivery of the money was conducted between December 1992 and January 1993. These governors, mayors and businessmen all resigned after their arrest. Kiyoyama, Koyama and Hashimoto have told prosecutors that they provided secret money to politicians. Over the past several years, general contractors have reportedly provided 5 million to 10 million yen each in secret money to former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, former Posts and Telecommunication Minister Hideo Watanabe and former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura. These politicians were once highly regarded members of the Liberal Democratic Party's construction lobby. Takeshita, who was prime minister between November 1987 and June 1989, is currently a conservative independent after he was dropped from the LDP list of candidates in the July 18 general election for the House of Representatives. He was at the center of public criticism for allegedly winning support from an underground boss to become LDP president in 1987, a position that carried with it the post of prime minister at that time. Ozawa currently is one of the most influential politicians as the chief political strategist for the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. As the favorite disciple of disgraced political power broker Shin Kanemaru, he served as an LDP secretary general and acting head of the LDP's largest faction headed by Kanemaru. But he parted from the LDP to form Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) in June. Watanabe, who was posts and telecommunications minister under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for one year starting in November 1991, lost his seat in the July general election. Nakamura joined the Miyazawa cabinet as construction minister in the December 1992 reshuffle. A number of construction scandals have surfaced since Kanemaru, a former LDP vice president, was arrested in March on suspicion of evading more than 1 billion yen in income tax. The arrest came five months after Kanemaru retired from politics. The number of contractor executives and heads of prefectural and municipal governments apprehended stands at 29.
