The tasks were spelled out by Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, in a report he delivered to the annual session of the National People's Congress [NPC] on the implementation of the 1993 plan for national economic and social development and on a similar draft plan for 1994. In his report, Chen stressed the need to make full use of the favorable international climate to further expand foreign trade and economic and technological exchanges. In the area of foreign trade, he said, "through the restructuring of the foreign trade and foreign exchange systems, we shall promote an increase in exports and allow a reasonable flow of imports to achieve a balance between foreign exchange revenues and expenditures for the year." Chen Jinhua spelled out the following policies to attain that goal: -- As China's export strategy, it is necessary to unswervingly increase the number and types of markets, succeed by putting quality first, and open up new markets while maintaining and developing existing ones; -- It is necessary to continue to improve the mix of export products, accelerate a switch from exporting semi-processed goods to intensive-processed goods and promote the export of high- and new- tech products; -- It is necessary to integrate technology, production and trade, and vigorously expand the export of mechanical and electrical products and complete sets of equipment that are competitive on the international market, rely heavily on modern technology, and have a high added value and good export potential; -- It is imperative to speed up the establishment of a quality certification system; -- It is necessary to encourage and support stronger large and medium-sized enterprises with good credit to move into foreign markets with quality products and good after-sale services; -- It is imperative to develop integrated trade companies in the form of enterprise groups for different industries to engage in international trade; -- It is necessary to strictly implement the system of making settlements and sales in foreign exchange for exports, raise the settlement rate for exports and improve the system of tax refunds on exports; and -- It is imperative to strengthen control over imports and optimize the import mix. Chen Jinhua said, "we shall continue to severely crack down on smuggling. We shall exercise strict control over the outflow of foreign currency in investment and capital accounts outside the country and tighten supervision over enterprises located abroad." He pledged to continue expanding international tourism and increasing foreign exchange revenues from non-trade sources. He said that it is necessary to diligently check trade and non- trade collection and payment of foreign exchange and strengthen supervision over and examination of the collection and payment of foreign currency to prevent leaks resulting from arbitrage and evasion of state control over foreign currency and from capital drain. "We shall continue to operate in an efficient way special economic zones, the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, open coastal cities and economic and technological development zones, and open up more central cities in border regions, along the Chang Jiang river and in the interior," he told the NPC deputies. Speaking of the utilization of foreign funds, he said that it is necessary to further better the investment climate in China, expand the scope of projects using foreign funds, improve the performance and quality of projects using foreign funds, and make efficient use of foreign funds. He outlined a series of policies concerning the use of foreign funds: -- It is necessary to absorb more direct foreign investment in line with the country's capacity to provide supplementary funding and increase the proportion of foreign investment committed to projects; -- It is imperative to guide the orientation of foreign investment in accordance with the state's industrial policies, directing more foreign investment towards infrastructure and basic industries, key projects and technology upgrading in existing enterprises, in particular towards projects that make foreign- exchange-earning products; -- It is necessary to support the central and western parts of the country to use foreign capital to develop local resources; -- Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative enterprises should strictly abide by the principle of sharing both benefit and risk, and work to achieve a balance of payments in foreign exchange; -- State-owned enterprises must evaluate their assets before they sell stock rights or use existing assets to establish joint ventures or cooperative enterprises with foreign businesses so as to prevent the loss of state assets; and -- It is imperative to strictly control the use of international commercial loans, continuing to keep it under mandatory planning control. With regard to foreign debt, Chen Jinhua stressed the importance of encouraging and supporting localities, departments, and enterprises with heavy foreign debts to establish a system of debt repayment financing to ensure that foreign debts be repaid on schedule.
