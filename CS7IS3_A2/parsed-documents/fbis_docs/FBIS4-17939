Tariffs as valid before March 15 this year will remain in effect until June 30. This means that exporters in Estonia who have already paid the Russian tax under the higher rates can get back their money or leave it as pre-payment for next consignments, the ministry adds in its remarks. The Russian Government in a ruling from March 14 imposed higher tariffs on some articles of imports from Estonia. The new tariffs for farm products, confectionery and bakery products, textiles, were established at two times the rate used for imports from other European countries. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets in an interview with the Interfax news agency earlier this month said Moscow is not going to revise the new tariffs in the near future.
