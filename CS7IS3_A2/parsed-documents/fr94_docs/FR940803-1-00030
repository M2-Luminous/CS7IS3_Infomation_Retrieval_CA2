FR940803-1-00030 FR940803-1-00005 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 330 [Docket No. 92N&hyph;0454] RIN 0905&hyph;AA06 Labeling of Drug Products for Over-The-Counter Human Use AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend its general labeling policy for over-the-counter (OTC) drug products that allows for the interchangeable use of certain words in labeling required by an OTC drug monograph. Examples of words already allowed include: ``doctor'' or ``physician,'' ``consult'' or ``ask,'' and ``indications'' or ``uses.'' This proposal provides for an additional phrase (``Drug interaction precaution'' or ``Avoid mixing drugs'' or ``Do not mix drugs''). The agency is also requesting public comment on changing the wording of warnings from negative phraseology to a more positive approach (i.e., ``Do not use more than 7 days'' to ``Use only 7 days''). DATES: Written comments by October 17, 1994; written comments on the agency's economic impact determination by October 17, 1994. The agency is proposing that any final rule that may issue based on this proposal become effective 30 days after the date of its publication in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William E. Gilbertson, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD&hyph;810), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;594&hyph;5000. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In the Federal Register of April 5, 1993 (58 FR 17553), the agency proposed to amend its general labeling policy for over-the-counter (OTC) drug products to allow for the interchangeable use of certain words in the labeling required by an OTC drug monograph. The agency had previously proposed in a number of tentative final monographs and included in a number of final monographs a provision that the words ``doctor'' and ``physician'' may be used interchangeably in the labeling of OTC drug products. Instead of including this provision in each OTC drug monograph, the agency proposed to include such a provision in §330.1 (21 CFR 330.1) as part of the general conditions under which an OTC drug is generally recognized as safe, effective, and not misbranded. The agency also proposed that, at manufacturers' discretion, the word ``ask'' could be substituted for the word ``consult,'' which appears in the directions for many OTC drug monograph ingredients. Thus, the agency proposed that the phrases ``consult a physician,'' ``consult a doctor,'' ``ask a physician,'' and ``ask a doctor'' could be used interchangeably. The agency invited comments and suggestions as to such other terms that could be used interchangeably, i.e., terms general in nature that appear in more than one OTC drug monograph. The comments received in response to the proposed rulemaking were favorable and suggested a number of additional terms that could be used interchangeably. In a final rule published in the Federal Register of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 3998), the agency allowed the following terms to be used interchangeably: (1) ``Ask'' or ``consult,'' (2) ``assistance'' or ``help,''(3) ``clean'' or ``cleanse,'' (4) ``continue'' or ``persist,'' (5) ``continues'' or ``persists,'' (6) ``doctor'' or ``physician,'' (7) ``indication'' or ``use,'' (8) ``indications'' or ``uses,'' and (9) ``lung'' or ``pulmonary.'' These terms are included in §330.1(i). The agency intends to continue to examine labeling required by OTC drug monographs to provide consumers more simplified and understandable information. This includes interchangeable terms, alternative phraseology, and possibly a new or different labeling format. At this time, the agency is proposing additional words or phrases that could be used interchangeably. The words ``Drug interaction precaution'' appear in a number of OTC drug monographs. See, for example, §341.76(c)(4) (21 CFR 341.76(c)(4)) which states: `` Drug interaction precaution . Do not use this product if you are presently taking a prescription drug for high blood pressure or depression, without first consulting a doctor.'' The agency believes the phrase ``Avoid mixing drugs'' or ``Do not mix drugs'' may be better understood by consumers than ``Drug interaction precaution.'' Accordingly, the agency is proposing to amend §330.1(i) to include these additional terms that may be used interchangeably in the labeling of OTC drug products. Additionally, the agency is requesting comment from manufacturers and the public on whether it would be desirable to change negatively worded warnings to a more positive phraseology. For example, in the labeling of first aid antibiotic drug products in §333.150(c)(1) (21 CFR 333.150(c)(1)), the warning ``Do not use in the eyes or apply over large areas of the body,'' could be changed to read: ``Avoid use in the eyes or over large areas of the body.'' Similarly, the warning in §333.150(c)(2), which states: ``Do not use longer than 1 week unless directed by a doctor,'' could be changed to read: ``Use for only 1 week unless directed by a doctor.'' Another example is the warnings in §331.30(c)(4) (21 CFR 331.30(c)(4)), which states: ``Do not use this product except under the advice and supervision of a physician if you have kidney disease,'' and in §331.30(c)(5) (21 CFR 331.30 (c)(5)), which states: ``Do not use this product except under the advice and supervision of a physician if you are on a sodium restricted diet.'' These warnings could be changed to read: ``Use only with a physician's help if * * *,'' or ``Use only with the help of a doctor if * * *.'' The warning statements cited are only selected examples. There are many other similar statements in proposed and final OTC drug monographs. At this time, the agency seeks comments on the following specific questions: (1) Should the terms ``Drug interaction precaution,'' ``Avoid mixing drugs,'' or ``Do not mix drugs'' be used interchangeably? (2) Is a positive phraseology for some warnings a desirable labeling approach or should the more emphatic negative phraseology be retained as the only allowed language in warning statements? (3) Will consumers pay more attention to ``Do not use'' language than to ``Use only'' language? Do repetitive terms such as ``Do not use'' lose their impact and become less important when read by consumers? (4) Should negative warnings be used only for the most important advice? (5) Is it essential that similar products have identical warning language or may the language vary and still be desirable provided the meaning is the same? The agency seeks comments from manufacturers, health professionals, and consumers on these issues. Any party having any survey data on these labeling approaches should provide that information to the agency. FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order and, thus, is not subject to review under the Executive Order. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant impact of a rule on small entities. If this proposed rule becomes a final rule, the labeling options could be implemented at very little cost by manufacturers at the next printing of labels, for those products for which the manufacturer chooses to make a change. Accordingly, the agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required. The agency invites public comment regarding any substantial or significant economic impact that this rulemaking would have on the labeling of OTC drug products. Types of impact may include, but are not limited to, costs associated with relabeling. Comments regarding the impact of this rulemaking on OTC drug products should be accompanied by appropriate documentation. The agency will evaluate any comments and supporting data that are received and will reassess the economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule. The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. Interested persons may, on or before October 17, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments regarding this proposal. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination may be submitted on or before October 17, 1994. Three copies of all comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 330 Over-the-counter drugs.
