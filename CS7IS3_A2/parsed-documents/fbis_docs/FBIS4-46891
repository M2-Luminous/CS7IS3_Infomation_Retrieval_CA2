Is this coincidence not an sign? If you look at the hardships the true Christians and the true Communists are bearing in our time, you will say: Yes, there is some kind of sign, and right away you will add: and not just some kind. I think that the fate of the Communists and Christians are in some way the same. Although the majority of Communists in Soviet times declared their lack of faith, as the philosophers say, a lack of faith is the back door to faith. They are basically for the people, they care about their well-being, and they are self-sacrificing, their heroism being reminiscent of the Christian martyrs. Take just Anpilov, who stated outright that he is a natural Christian and can even forgive his enemies in spite of the fact that they are constantly tormenting him. Therefore, I would like to send an Easter greeting first of all to the orthodox Christians and Communists. Christ is risen!--this means that our suffering will turn to joy! No, this has never happened on our earth, not to mention the fact that the physical collapse of the country will soon be complete and moral degradation is making an ever more stunning impression. From the screens of television sets and on the radio the people are being duped, lied to outright, and exposed to unconcealed cynicism and Satanism. It would seem that evil forces are triumphant. But it just seems that way; behind all this one must be able to see the triumph of Christianity. We must not live the way they are living and the way we are called to live! It illuminates Christian truths. Along with the poet you will say: The darker the night the brighter the stars. Christ is risen!--and Hell has been destroyed, its locks are worn out, although some people are trying to reinforce them. Hell has been destroyed not only in eternity but also here and now, on earth. Listen to the beating of your heart: It beats harmoniously and confidently. Sheep and wolves do indeed feed together. Chekists who were previously threatening to us are now asking forgiveness from their victims. Even from me. I cannot forget the humble image of two Chekists who in the church where I serve got down on their knees before me and said: "Forgive us." I closed my eyes to all their offenses and said to the Chekists: And you forgive me for the fact that I once allowed myself to become bitter, willingly or not. Orthodox Christians and Communists must walk in the front ranks to save Russia--help us God, Christ is risen. But it is not just I who see that believers and Communists can speak the same language; soon all of us who populate Russia will start speaking in the same language--of courage, cheerfulness, and joy. Easter is celebrated in Russia as it is in no other country. In the West they celebrate Christmas more and in a secular way; here even the so-called atheists back in Soviet times celebrated this holiday along with believers because Russia, like Christ himself, has always been on Golgotha awaiting its resurrection. On which Golgotha or, rather, on which one of the Golgothas are we celebrating Christ's resurrection and, consequently, ours this year? The Golgotha with the name of Christ will not and cannot bear destruction, this exhaustion of creativity. Russia is exhausted in order to create because her creation is needed by more than just the Russian people. Look at what America is doing, at the police-like fervor under the guise of reconciliation with which it inflames hostility. Russia, tempered by all kinds of troubles and misfortunes, having emerged from the crucible of all kinds of temptations, is necessary to everyone. Her loving heart which reconciles earthly passions is needed. Without her wise word, said Dostoevsky, there will be no harmony in the world. That would be a minor loss, but the disaster is that the world would believe the deception of the Antichrist and blindly follow him into the abyss. Our Golgotha leads not to death but to resurrection!--it is with these encouraging words that I wish to address all readers of the newspaper DEN-ZAVTRA. Dear readers, you along with the newspaper workers have experienced both the bitterness and the joy, you have stood before the shameful court of law, and more than once. That will not be in vain. We will not gloat about our enemies and the fact that they have not always managed to realize their evil intentions. Thus we want to say to them: God be with you! I also want to address my Easter message to workers and readers who are not Russian and not Christian. Who knows the human heart? Perhaps Christian truths are already beginning to take hold in your hearts. Therefore I do not think that the truths of love and resurrection are alien to you. And that being the case I say to you: Christ is risen! We all have the same God, there is no other God than the true God! Since for the present day we are involved in the newspaper together it means that we are proceeding together toward the true God, although in different ways. And that which unites and gladdens us--this is our common suffering. We shall always be brothers and rejoice in one another's success, especially the success of our long-suffering motherland in which we live together. Nor would I want to forget those who are hostile to us. Hostility has blinded you and you yourselves cannot see what you are doing. Some day you will shed bitter tears: After all, many of you are our blood brothers, but we are going against one another as aliens. God grant us that, having looked from our Golgotha of 1994 we have seen the crucified and resurrected Christ and, along with him, the crucified and resurrected Russia. All is forgiven with resurrection, as it is said in the Easter Psalm, embracing one another we shall cry out: Christ is risen from the dead, defying death with death, giving life to the entombed.
