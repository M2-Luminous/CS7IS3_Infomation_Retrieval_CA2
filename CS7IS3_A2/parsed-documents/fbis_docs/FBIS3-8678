This was the reason we put several questions to SDL Chairman Peter Weiss. [Correspondent] Mr. Weiss, only two weeks ago you feared most what would happen after D day (?in terms) of responsibility and the takeover of power. Has there been a change in the situation within the opposition over the past two weeks that would make you ready to take over the entire responsibility, not just the power, from the previous government? [Weiss] I would like to point out that we held intensive talks with both the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and other opposition parties. We were seeking ways out of the crisis. The offer I made to the prime minister today was voiced during our talks. A signal was sent to me that it was possible to hold talks with the HZDS. I would also like to pay a visit to the president. We could continue the intensive work carried out by the experts from opposition parties, who managed to agree on the basic priorities of the government, which will be an interim government. The main role of this government is to prepare early parliamentary elections. [Correspondent] Am I to understand that now, shortly before 1800 after the end of today's debate, the HZDS said it was ready to form a government with you without Former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar? [Weiss] I would not say so. There was a readiness to hold talks, and I think that is what is important. [passage omitted] The president informed me that, as is customary, he would ask someone from the HZDS, which is the biggest group in the Slovak parliament, to try to form a government for this interim period. [Correspondent] Mr. Weiss, do you not fear that the parliamentary opposition needed the SDL to remove Vladimir Meciar's government and that, figuratively speaking, the SDL could be a ladder for the opposition achieving power? Or, in other words, are you not concerned that a right-wing coup could take place now? [Weiss] That is not what I fear because the SDL would not be able to agree on this kind of (?policy-related) solution. Also, right from the beginning, we insisted on holding early elections. We rejected as absolutely unrealistic that this interim government could stay in power until the spring of 1995. We adopted an accommodating position regarding the opposition, regarding the date of the elections. At the moment, we are going for early elections. We have been promised that the bill on reducing the election period should go through the parliament. A new situation will arise if this bill does not go through. We will be forced to resort to other means, such as a referendum. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Do you have any guarantees that the new Cabinet will survive at least until early elections? [Weiss] Those guarantees are to be found in broad cooperation, in a willingness to engage in a dialogue, and in outlining good priorities for the [new] Cabinet. [Correspondent] Does this mean that those agreements will be confirmed in writing? Do you consider that form of confirmation a sort of coalition agreement on a broad basis? [Weiss] I think it is always very good in politics to have agreements in writing. [Correspondent] When are you going to see the president? [Weiss] As soon as possible. [Correspondent] That means when? [Weiss] This evening. [Correspondent] Who do you intend to include in the government of a broad coalition from among parliamentary parties? [Weiss] I think it is not possible to exclude anybody in advance. However, I think that, during today's deliberations of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, some stances were voiced. We naturally count on the participation of opposition parties. [Correspondent] Including Hungarian ones? [Weiss] Talks with those parties have not concerned their participation in the Cabinet. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] When do you think early elections will take place? [Weiss] I think they will take place at the beginning of October at the latest. Even if a referendum takes place, elections could not take place before September. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Following today's events, is the parliamentary opposition going to consider a change in the post of the chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic? [Weiss] My view is that, so far, no reasons have emerged for us to leave the principle chosen after the elections, which is that the National Council bodies are to be elected on the basis of proportional representation. The HZDS continues to be the strongest political parliamentary group, and, if no extraordinary political circumstances emerge, I do not see any reason to abandon this principle.
