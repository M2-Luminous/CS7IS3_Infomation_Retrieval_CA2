He stood on a street corner in Postmasburg, went down on one knee in a firing position, and pulled off several shots at the motorcade as it passed. Security men accompanying Mr de Klerk on his two-day election tour turned round and arrested him and confirmed to SAPA later that he would be charged. "He is lucky our snipers were not on that corner," a senior policemen said. "He could have been killed before it was established it was a toy pistol." Mr de Klerk addressed about 200 supporters outside postmasburg city hall before a lunchtime address to a further 200 National Party guests inside.
