Despite this holiday, the head of state and the leadership of the city and the region, at a meeting behind closed doors, managed to discuss a wide range of actual problems for the region which demanded the settlement at the presidential level. According to Anatoliy Sobchak, the president promised to support the St. Petersburg authorities in financing, from the federal budget, the construction of new metro lines which are extremely necessary to the city. The mayor of St. Petersburg obtained Boris Yeltsin's consent to promote the St. Petersburg project of accomplishing the construction of the dam [as received]. This issue will be submitted for the Russian Government's consideration. Participants in the meeting discussed the possibilities of crediting of house building which is very actual for St. Petersburg where considerable part of the population are still living in shared flats. The spectrum of issues discussed today was extremely wide, also including subsidizing products of stock breeding which are delivered to St. Petersburg from the Leningrad region, timely receipt of funds for the preparation for the Good Will Games due to be held in summer, and quoting some kinds of goods. Special attention was paid to the settlement of problems with petrol taking into account that the Surgut Company is the monopolist in petrol deliveries to St. Petersburg and therefore maintains prices for this fuel at the highest level in the country. According to Anatoliy Sobchak, the city authorities proposed to the president the mechanism for overcoming the monopolism in this field, and the president intends to sign an appropriate decree. The sensation of the day was the St. Petersburg mayor's report that Boris Yeltsin agreed in principle to turn the city of Kronshtadt into a free economic zone. This city will be stage-by- stage opened up for tourists and citizens of St. Petersburg. The navy base located on the territory of Kronshtadt will have to be moved to some other place. According to Anatoliy Sobchak, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev who was present at the meeting said "yes" on this issue. In addition, many problems concerning the Leningrad region were solved at the Russian president's meeting with the leadership of this region.
