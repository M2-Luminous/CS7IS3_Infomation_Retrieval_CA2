And Calls on U.S. Businessmen To Be More `Go-Go'"] [Text] At a meeting with representatives of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, in Moscow, Yuriy Luzhkov expressed regret over the fact that the U.S. business community is pursuing an "overcautious" line in the sphere of joint cooperation and investments in Russia and Moscow. After enumerating a number of projects executed and in the process of being implemented by Moscow authorities with foreign (non-U.S.) companies, the Moscow mayor admitted the existence of problems both in the legislative sphere and in ensuring security for businessmen, and called on representatives of U.S. business circles to be more forthright in pointing out existing shortfalls to the Moscow authorities: "We cannot be reproached for not wanting to listen to foreign businessmen." Yuriy Luzhkov described as "absurd" rumors about Moscow city officials demanding bribes and payoffs from U.S. business people. Talking about the efforts by the Moscow authorities to create a favorable climate for foreign investments, the Moscow mayor spoke about deposit funds to ensure against "force majeur" circumstances. According to Yuriy Luzhkov, the services sector, tourism, and construction are the most promising areas for foreign investment in Moscow. In the construction sphere alone, according to Luzhkov, at least $2 billion worth of investments is needed annually. Touching on problems of crime control, Yuriy Luzhkov admitted the complexity of the current situation, noting that in the past year the Moscow authorities have done their utmost to improve the situation. According to Luzhkov, work along these lines is under way, but additional legislative measures are called for. In this connection the Moscow mayor highly appraised the latest presidential crime control edict. Yuriy Luzhkov denied elite militia formations would be created to defend entrepreneurs. On the issue of his disagreements with Vice Premier Chubays, Yuriy Luzhkov pointed out that the president's decision about privatization in Moscow is a triumph not for Luzhkov but for common sense. Accusing "democrat Chubays" of implementing "the worst possible communist principles," Luzhkov declared that "voucher" privatization has been a flop. At the same time the Moscow authorities intend to find ways to remedy the situation, in particular, according to the Moscow mayor, by insisting that the life of the privatization check be extended. Furthermore, the Moscow authorities plan "actively and expeditiously" to translate into reality their own model for the second stage of privatization the result of which will be the sell-off of property to "real masters" at realistic prices.
