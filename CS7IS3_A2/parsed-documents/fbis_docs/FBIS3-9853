Olechowski said that Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak would go to Brussels to make the application as soon as the lower house of Poland's parliament approves the measure, sometime after April 7. Warsaw wants detailed negotiations with the European Union to begin in 1996 or 1997, finishing before 2000, when Poland could become an EU member with a special transitional status. Poland has already signed a "Europe agreement" in preparation for eventual EU membership.
