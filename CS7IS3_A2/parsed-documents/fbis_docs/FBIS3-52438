On the line from the Knesset, David Ze'ev reports: Both sides were mobilized, and the vote was close: 46 in favor, 52 against, and three abstentions. The bill presented by the Likud's Me'ir Shitrit stated that an agreement with the Palestinians will be possible only if five points are ensured: no Palestinian state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean; Jewish settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza remaining under Israeli rule, with the government responsible for their existence and security; freedom of movement of the Israeli security forces throughout the territories to stop terrorist activity; no right of return of Palestinians who left in 1948 and 1967; and Jerusalem remaining Israel's united and eternal capital. To reverse any one of these points, three quarters of the Knesset, not just a simple majority, would have to vote in favor. Cabinet Minister Yosi Sarid, responding for the government, said the government supports certain aspects of the bill, such as on Jerusalem, but objects to Jewish settlements in the territories continuing under Israeli rule forever -- certainly those settlements, said Sarid, that were built with the intention of sabotaging this government's policy of territorial compromise. Minister Sarid, himself a participant in the recent negotiations with the Palestinians in Europe and Egypt, said he also objects to the principle of such legislation, limiting the authority of Israeli negotiations, and its acceptance, he said, would mean an end to the peace process.
