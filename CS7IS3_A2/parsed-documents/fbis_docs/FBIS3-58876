In a statement to the press today, Denktas pointed out that the confidence-building measures are being based on the premise that they will bring great economic advantages to the Turkish Cypriot side. The UN secretary general and the experts have confirmed this, Denktas said, adding: Our people will see. If that is so, then naturally the negotiations will be held in a comfortable atmosphere. Denktas said that the reactions of the Greek Cypriot side must be well assessed. The principles of the Turkish Cypriot side are out in the open and we are not moving back, he said, adding: However, we are not going to shun negotiations to be held with goodwill. Denktas recalled that in a speech in Thessaloniki, Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis said he wants everything and every place and that he will not allow the Turkish Cypriot side any atvantage. On the other hand, Denktas stressed, we are being strongly reassured that the Turkish Cypriots can take their passports and fly from Lefkosa International Airport. Denktas pointed out that another point on which the Turkish Cypriots are being strongly reassured is the fact that the Ercan [Tymbou] Airport control area and Ercan airspace will not be affected, and that Ercan will continue to function as it does today. The president said that planes registered in Turkey will be able to land and take off from Lefkosa Airport without intervention. He explained that this would mean an extensive relaxation of the embargo imposed on the Turkish Cypriot side. Denktas went on to say that the entry into the Lefkosa International Airport will be from two separate gates, and that the gate from the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] will be solely in the hands of the TRNC authorities. He added: The FIR [Flight Information Region] line between us and Turkey which concerns our security will surely not be affected and will continue as it is today. Denktas pointed out that the Greek Cypriot side said earlier that it would participate in the negotiations for tactical reasons only. It is necessary, he stressed, not to underestimate the difficulties, to remain cool, and to be patient. Denktas said: It has been explained that the confidence-building measures were drawn up not in order to deceive the two sides, but to lead to new cooperation and to grant extensive economic advantages -- in the words of the UN secretary general -- to the Turkish Cypriot side which has been the subject of an embargo for years. At the end of the negotiations, we will see whether these promises were true or not, and we will ask our people for their opinion. The president pointed out that the secretary general's special envoy Joe Clark will meet with him and Kliridhis on Monday, and that the shuttle diplomacy between the two sides might begin at the end of February. If positive results are achieved, Denktas said, it may be necessary to go to New York. Replying to a question, the president said that he might be going to Turkey during the first week of February.
