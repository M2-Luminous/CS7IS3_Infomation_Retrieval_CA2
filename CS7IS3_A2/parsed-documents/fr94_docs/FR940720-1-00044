FR940720-1-00044 FR940720-1-00014 Federalism This proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Considerations Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4332(C)) and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543) is ensured when hunting and sport fishing plans are developed, and the determinations required by these acts are made prior to the addition of refuges to the lists of areas open to hunting and fishing in 50 CFR part 32. The amendment of refuge-specific hunting and fishing regulations are subject to a categorical exclusion from the NEPA process if they do not significantly alter the existing use of a particular national wildlife refuge. The B.(5) Service exclusion is employed here as these amendments are considered ``[m]inor changes in the amounts or types of public use on FWS or State-managed lands, in accordance with regulations, management plans, and procedures.'' These proposed refuge-specific hunting and fishing revisions to existing regulations simply qualify or otherwise define an existing hunting or fishing activity for purposes of resource management. The changes proposed in this rulemaking would not substantially alter the existing uses of the refuges involved. Information regarding hunting and fishing permits and the conditions that apply to individual refuge hunts, sport fishing activities and maps of the respective areas are retained at refuge headquarters and can be obtained from the regional offices of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the addresses listed below: Region 1_California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.
