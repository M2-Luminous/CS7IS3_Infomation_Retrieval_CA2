The lead partner in ECAM is the Netherlands electronics company Philips, which combined forces in 1992 with French companies Thomson and SAGEM. The result was "Flat Panel Display Company," a joint venture company based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, employing over 500 people. They have established two factories -- a pilot line, where most of the new developments are tested, and a full-scale production assembly line, the largest in Europe. "Tomorrow's market in LCDs is enormous, because they will soon move from portable computers to all sorts of consumer and industrial equipment," explains Dr. Robert Hartman of the newly established company. We estimate a market of over ECU1.5 billion by 1996. Unfortunately, the world's five largest LCD companies are all Japanese. They have a strong position on the market, so if we do not invest today we will always rely on foreign sources for what will become an essential element in many new electronic systems." Started in January 1993, the ECAM project involves a total of 19 partners from the Netherlands, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Belgium, and is composed of 11 subprojects. The overall aim is to develop technologies and components to make feasible larger display sizes and/or higher resolutions, increase the number of potential applications of LCD technology and develop less complex designs and more cost-effective production methods. Simpler and Cheaper Technology Of the eleven subprojects, the most important is "2S-3S Thin Film Transistors." "Briefly, 2S and 3S refer to the number of steps required to produce the LCD matrix," Dr. Hartman explained. 2S technology can be used to manufacture computer monitors, while the 3S system can be used in TV projectors. "2S and 3S were patented by SAGEM's [Company for General Applications of Electricity and Mechanics] research partner, CNET-France Telecom, the French telecommunications laboratory," he continued. "The subproject has two elements: SAGEM and CNET are transferring both 2S and 3S as "direct view technologies" to our pilot line here in Eindhoven, and Thomson in Moirans (near Grenoble, France) is developing a "projection" 3S display." These new technologies are simpler than those used today and use less raw materials, adding up to a less expensive factory, both in start-up and running costs. A Complete Project In general, most of the other partners are involved in one or two subprojects specific to their interests. BARCO, a Belgian manufacturer of TV projectors, for example, aims to develop active matrix LCD projectors that can display video and data graphic images with XGA (1024*768 pixel) resolution. In this way the joint venture combines specialised expertise from around Europe and ensures that the technologies have a range of marketable applications ready as soon as possible. There are also four universities and private research laboratories contributing their expertise. The University of Dundee in the United Kingdom, for example, is contributing its knowledge of certain types of amorphous alloys to the SWITCHMAT subproject, where materials for TFD-R (Thin-Film Diode plus Reset) devices based on amorphous silicon alloys are being developed. TFD-R devices hold out the promise of a low-cost, high-yield production process, but also have some drawbacks. The University's experience with similar alloys will help in the assessment and perhaps the exploitation of this potentially valuable method. Other subprojects are developing additional applications and materials, examining future technologies, working on international standards and plotting the joint venture's R&D programmes. According to Dr. Hartman, "We are quite pleased with results so far, particularly in the important 2S-3S subproject, and expect to complete the project by the end of this year as planned."
