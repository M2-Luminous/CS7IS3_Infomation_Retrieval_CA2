In an interview held on Thursday evening with Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno at Cerro Hueco Prison, the 24 members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) complained about mistreatment. Among other things, the Zapatists said they were denied medical attention and food. They added that they were isolated and some of them tortured for hours and that no authority tried to prevent this, a government source told EFE today. Father Pablo Romo, member of the Fray Bartolome de las Casas Human Rights Center (led by Bishop Samuel Ruiz, mediator in the armed conflict), told EFE the Zapatists were subject to physical and psychological torture. "The tortures and threats -- which he did not specify -- mainly occurred at the time of their arrest rather than in prison, but other arbitrary actions occurred there," Romo said. The EZLN members were arrested, along with 46 comrades who have been released, shortly after the EZLN's 1 January military uprising, and their release has been demanded on numerous occasions by nongovernment human rights organizations and the EZLN general command. Following his meeting with the prisoners, the governor said an investigation will be ordered "to ascertain if the inmates' complaints are justified" and, if they are, the culprits will be "severely" punished. "I am interested in an investigation to learn if it is true this abuse was perpetrated. All the complaints will be investigated because no inmate's human rights should be violated," the governor stated. Lopez Moreno visited the Cerro Hueco Prison a day after meeting with Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, chairman of the National Human Rights Commission. It is surmised they discussed the Zapatists' case during the meeting. Pablo Romo told EFE that the Zapatists who have already been released were also subject to arbitrary actions at the time of their arrest and during their imprisonment and that "it is almost certain they will file criminal charges against their aggressors." Romo admitted the government is "firmly" determined to receive and solve their complaints because it will not let the authorities perpetrate illegal actions. Two weeks ago the Chiapas Congress approved a law to punish torture, and it adheres to other reforms carried out by Chiapas State legislation within the last 40 days to decriminalize certain activities, including riots and demonstrations against the government, which were formerly punishable. The reforms were followed by the approval of an amnesty law for the Chiapas rebels and other groups which might rise up in arms, but it holds the amnesty contingent with the surrender of weapons. Thirty-eight of the 70 Zapatists arrested at the beginning of the armed conflict were released on 28 January, and eight more were released on 22 February following recommendations from the Attorney General's Office to the state's Superior Court of Justice. All the released rebels had to pay between $330 and $666 each to leave prison. Their bail was paid by the National Indian Institute and the Fund for the Management of State Justice, given the EZLN's lack of resources.
