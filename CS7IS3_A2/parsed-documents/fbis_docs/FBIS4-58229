The committee was widely highlighted by world media as the first of its kind in Saudi Arabia, which is ruled completely by the royal house of Sa'ud. The Saudi regime did not receive the shock with much patience. The regime pursued members and supporters of the committee. It arrested many of them, dismissed many from their jobs, and prevented their travel abroad. The step came in the wake of two important developments: The first was the establishment of the much awaited Shura Council, which is appointed by the king and whose decisions are just recommendations to him, to take or leave as he pleases -- indeed, it would be unimaginable for this council to deviate from the regime's directives -- and the second was an operation to contain the opposition, which took London as its headquarters. Most of its leaders returned to the kingdom. The conditions for their return were regarded to be greatly in the interest of the Shiites. The Shiite opposition closed down their AL-JAZIRAH AL-'ARABIYAH magazine, which they issued from London. The government even bought the paper's archives at the exorbitant price of 200,000 pounds sterling, despite the little information they contained on the ruling family and its activities. As a result, the Sunni opposition found itself under siege. A move was needed to stir the stagnant water. Therefore, the group which established the CDLR decided to follow in the footsteps of the Shiite opposition by working abroad. Therefore, the committee's spokesman, Dr. al-Mas'ari, left for London with a fake passport -- his original passport was withheld by the regime. Dr. Sa'd al-Faqih traveled with him. Last week, the two men began their political activity after asking for political asylum in Britain. The committee's opening statement explains the reason for their actions and the basis of their moves in the future. The CDLR statement said the committee transferred its activities to London after every means of expression and reform in the kingdom become impossible. The statement also said: Repressive methods used against the reformists have increased and have included preventing their travel, expelling them from their jobs, and denying them the right to practice any work. They are being pursued, interrogated, detained, imprisoned, and tortured and are being threatened with death. The statement appealed to Saudi nationals, those who support the removal of injustice and who would like truth and justice to prevail, to cooperate with it. AL-SABIL has learned from sources close to al-Mas'ari that before his departure, the committee contacted all effective forces and figures in Saudi society to arrange matters. It won great support for this course of action. Al-Mas'ari's activities abroad are supposed to be coupled with great activity at home. Al-Mas'ari enjoyed wide-scale coverage in Western media. It was learned that the Saudi government contacted London with a view to returning him to the kingdom or preventing his political work. However, the British government rejected the Saudi demand because it infringed on British laws. The Saudi government also pressured Dr. al-Faqih's family to force him to return, but al-Faqih said he would not return. In light of the above, al-Mas'ari will be the Saudi opposition's vigilant eye abroad. He will convey what is happening in his home country to the media abroad. His presence will spur the opposition at home into action, especially when he establishes a magazine or a daily newspaper in the name of the opposition, which is expected soon.
