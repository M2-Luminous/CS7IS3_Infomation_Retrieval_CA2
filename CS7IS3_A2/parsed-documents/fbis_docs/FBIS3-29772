According to the survey, a decline in import prices was observed in 18 out of 20 surveyed items, and 14 items were cheaper even in the consumer market. The EPA commented: "The market trend is beginning to show the effects of the yen rate appreciation." The survey was conducted to compare the import and retail prices of 20 items -- foodstuff, clothes, and durable consumer goods -- imported in December 1993 with prices in the previous year. The import prices were calculated from the average on customs entry in December, and retail prices from statistics on price trends in Tokyo in mid-January. As a result, a decline in import prices was observed on beef, chocolate, and golf clubs. Although the import prices of oranges and lemons increased due to brisk demand and cool weather in producing nations, their retail prices in Japan actually dropped in line with the price decline of Japanese-grown citrus. On the other hand, automobile prices dropped on the customs clearance basis, but became more expensive in the consumer market. This was mainly because of price hikes after model changes. The average foreign exchange rate in December was 108.35 yen to the dollar, up 12.7 percent from the previous year.
