Dr. Gildenhuys also announced that the National Peace Secretariat would meet in Durban tomorrow to discuss the situation in Natal. A member of the secretariat, Mr. Rupert Lorimer, said the events in Johannesburg were directly related to the situation in Natal. He added that the peace structures had not been officially informed of the march and only found out about it yesterday. Mr. Lorimer confirmed receiving calls from IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] members claiming they had received reports that agent provocateur would be infiltrated into the crowds to begin shooting and causing chaos.
