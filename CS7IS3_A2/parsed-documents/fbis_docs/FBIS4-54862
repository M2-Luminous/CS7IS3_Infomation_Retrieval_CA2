This can be learned from the most secret annual report of the State Office for Nuclear Safety SUJB ("Statni urad pro jadernou bezpecnost") to the Economics Ministry in Prague, which has reached the hands of the Upper Austrian Greens Party. A short glance into the secret report, which officially exists only in two copies, even exceeds the worst fears regarding the state of the Czech nuclear power plants in terms of security technology. --In the 52 serious incidents, the operators of the Dukovany nuclear power plant had to declare an "unplanned decrease in output," which, according to the report, is 28 cases more than in 1992, a twofold increase within a single year. --All in all, 13 emergency shutdowns had to be carried out at Dukovany within a single year--for example, on 27 June 1993 in Block 2, as a result of a major operational fault, or on 29 September in Block 1 and on 29 October in Block 3, as a result of a sudden failure of two of the six main central cooling pumps. However, the other "deviations" from normal operations with unchanged reactor output bore considerable risks. Some of them were classified by the Nuclear Safety Office as "dangerous" in retrospect. --During a check, the high-pressure pump for the emergency water did not start at all, while, during another check, the electric engine for feeding the boron solution into the system, the lack of which might lead to a disaster in an emergency, ran in the wrong direction. --Contrary to the opinion of the state safety experts, the fire in the hydrogen system on 11 January 1993 was initially presented as absolutely harmless by the Dukovany engineers. The Dukovany plant, which has been operating since 1985, is quite obviously showing major signs of wear and tear so that its continued operation is possible only by accepting ever-increasing safety risks. Lower Safety Standards? In its ultrasound checks in Block 2, the state office discovered cracks in the steel beneath the interior lining of the reactor vessel. Moreover, in one area, the inner lining of the reactor vessel no longer stuck to the ground material, which can lead to material tension and cracks. Yet, instead of repairing the defective material, which would cost considerable amounts of money, the inspectors in their annual report suggest a much cheaper solution: The quality defects, they wrote in their "recommendation," would be acceptable for the further operation of the reactor if "the safety criteria were overhauled"--that is to say, lowered. Yet, as they stated themselves, the inspectors were unable to check the real state of the steel in the reactor vessel because of permanent defects in the ultrasound equipment.... That the position of the reactor vessel in Dukovany's Block 4 is too angular as a result of obvious construction defects, that it deviates more than 100 percent from the applicable safety regulations, hardly seems to count anymore. Even in this case, the State Nuclear Safety Office regards the further operation as "acceptable until further notice," despite this grave defect. Is Prague Playing a Wrong Game? For Rudi Anschober, Greens deputy from Upper Austria, this annual report of the Czech Nuclear Safety Office only provides the final proof that the Prague government is playing false: "All defects in the Czech nuclear reactors that we have pointed to have been confirmed in this secret report. Dukovany is a nuclear time bomb, only 35 km north of Austria's border. However, even we were surprised about the dramatic increase in the number of incidents last year. Dukovany has long since been fit for the scrap heap." Yet, surprisingly, the secret report of the State Nuclear Safety Office supplies nuclear opponents with new ammunition against finishing Temelin. If the responsible district authority at Ceske Budejovice classifies the planned refitting of the Temelin reactors by the U.S. "Westinghouse" group as "essential," which is generally expected, then, in the view of the Nuclear Safety Office in Prague, the operators of the power plant also need a new construction license. Illegal Building Site Temelin With this view, the secret report indirectly supports Temelin opponents in the Czech Republic and abroad, for whom Temelin has been "the world's largest illegal building site" (Anschober) for some time. The new construction licensing procedure might then mean the ultimate end for Temelin at the very last minute. Within the next few weeks, with their signature, at least 100,000 Austrians should therefore, as a precautionary measure, claim their right to speak out in the hearing regarding the construction of the missing blocks of the Temelin plant at the district office at Ceske Budejovice. Despite all denials from Prague, the Czech Government is planning a massive extension of its nuclear program. At the moment, another licensing procedure is under way for a temporary storage plant for fuel rods not far from the Dukovany power plant, which would create an internationally unparalleled concentration of risk in this area. The Czech Nuclear Safety Office has not authorized this project because of planning mistakes. According to the secret report, a separate fuel rod plant is also being planned, which would ultimately make the Czech Republic the number-one nuclear nation in East Europe.
