A report on this topic was delivered by Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz. The legislative chairman paid a working visit last week to a number of Ukraine's oblasts and regions to clarify the principles of economic policy and the realistic, concrete steps for implementing these principles during the current stage. It is understandable that during a meeting with working collectives and citizens other issues were discussed, as well. In particular, Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz is being addressed as a candidate for the Ukrainian presidency. Certain organs of the media, however, while covering the working trip by the Ukrainian Supreme Council chairman, allow biased reports or insinuations to be filed, or sometimes simply produced outright provocative reports. Along these lines, the Moscow television company Ostankino made an unsubstantiated statement that Oleksandr Moroz had withdrawn his candidacy and refused to run for president. Alas, this provocative fabrication was picked up by other indiscriminating media, including some in Ukraine, which found themselves in an awkward position before the eyes and ears of their readers and listeners, having swallowed Ostankino's primitive bait. The Supreme Council press center is being addressed by the electors with demands to clarify the essence of these reports -- is this true? The press center is authorized to report that this so-called sensational report by the Ostankino television company is a vicious fabrication pursuing certain political goals. There were no reasons for the appearance of such a piece of reporting during either the meeting of Oleksandr Moroz with electors or the news conference. This is not the first time that Ostankino, in its reports from Ukraine, has released disinformation and twisted facts with the purpose of distorting the actual state of things, ignoring the truth -- one of the principal requirements of journalism. While covering such important official events as the working trip by the Ukrainian Supreme Council chairman, every paper, every television or radio agency should be even more accurate and objective, and inform people only of the truth, not spread clearly provocative fabrications.
