It is increasing to over 50 people design personnel for its sales subsidiary, which has the greatest opportunities to hold business talks with clients, a 25-percent increase, centering on fiscal 1994, and will create a system that will quickly reflect the demands of the client in the design. Since design personnel previously were assigned to the production subsidiary, the client's needs were not fully incorporated in the product design. In the United States, the largest overseas consumer market, strengthening of user accommodation capability is judged to be linked to an increase in competitive power, and they are laying out a new lineup. It is the sales subsidiary, Mitsubishi Electronics America (MELA, California) which is increasing design personnel. Until now, one Japanese and 39 Americans formed the design unit, but this will increase during fiscal 1994 to five Japanese and 45 Americans, making the design function of the sales subsidiary substantial. The company was established in 1973, but until now only a few personnel were concerned with design. Moreover, beginning this year, in order to supplement the design function of MELA, the production subsidiary, Mitsubishi Semiconductor America (MSAI, North Carolina), will make full-scale "design-in" activities where the product specifications and performance are decided one by one with the client. By strengthening the design function at local bases of both sales and production, they can promote the creation of products that reflect client needs. Mitsubishi is beginning to disperse to various countries the design function which previously had been rather concentrated within Japan, such as the placing of design personnel in a German subsidiary beginning this fiscal year. The strengthening of the design function in the United States also can be called a link in this. Japanese semiconductor manufacturers are altering their constitution which had depended excessively on memory and are aiming for repletion in non-memory fields such as ASIC and microcomputers in order to recover their international competitive power which has rather declined. However, how much the products incorporate the demands of the client holds the key that will decide competitive power. For that reason, making a substantial design function in consumer areas has become a big task.
