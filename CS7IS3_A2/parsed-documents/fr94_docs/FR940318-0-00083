FR940318-0-00083 FR940318-0-00014 (p) Effective date for rules relating to section 382(l)(6) _(1) In general. Paragraphs (i), (j), (k), (l), (m)(2), and (n)(2) of this section apply to any ownership change occurring on or after March 17, 1994. (2) Ownership change to which section 382(l)(6) applies occurring before March 17, 1994. In the case of an ownership change occurring before March 17, 1994, the loss corporation may elect to apply the rules of paragraphs (j), (k), (l), (m)(2), and (n)(2) of §1.382&hyph;9 in their entirety. The election must be made by the later of the due date (including any extensions of time) of the loss corporation's tax return for the taxable year which includes the change date or the date that the loss corporation files its first tax return after May 16, 1994. The election is made by attaching the following statement to the return: ``This is an Election to Apply §§1.382&hyph;9 (j), (k), (l), (m)(2), and (n)(2) of the Income Tax Regulations to the Ownership Change Occurring Pursuant to a Plan of Reorganization Confirmed by the Court on [Insert Confirmation Date].'' In connection with making this election, on the same return the loss corporation may also elect not to apply section 382(l)(5) to the ownership change under paragraph (i) of this section (if the loss corporation has not already done so pursuant to §301.9100&hyph;7T(a) of this chapter). If, under the applicable statute of limitations, the loss corporation may file amended returns for the year of the ownership change and all subsequent years (an open year), an electing loss corporation must file an amended return for each prior affected year to reflect the elections. If, under the applicable statute of limitations, the loss corporation may not file an amended return for the year of the ownership change or any subsequent year (a closed year), an electing loss corporation must file an amended return for each affected open year to reflect the elections and the section 382 limitation resulting from the ownership change must be appropriately adjusted for the earliest open year (or years) to reflect the difference between the amount of pre-change losses actually used in closed years and the amount of pre-change losses that would have been used in such years applying the rules of paragraphs (j), (k), (l), (m)(2), (n)(2) of this section to the ownership change.
