The suspension constitutes one of the toughest forms of sanction the world nuclear watchdog can take against a member state. The 35-member IAEA board of governors took the decision by 28 votes to one with four abstensions, amid Pyongyang's continued refusal to allow full inspection of nuclear sites suspected of producing material for nuclear arms. [passage omitted] In the IAEA vote, Libya voted against, while China, India, Syria and Lebanon abstained. Cuba and Saudi Arabia did not take part. The decision by the board of governors provides "in conformity with the provisions of...the (IAEA) Statute, to suspend non-medical Agency assistance to the DPRK (North Korea)." [passage omitted] The IAEA noted in its resolution "with deep regret" that the "limited opportunity...to select, segregate, and secure fuel rods from the DPRK's five-megawatt reactor for later measurements in accordance with Agency standards" had been lost. The Agency also regretted it was no longer possible to ascertain whether nuclear material had been diverted from the reactor. The Agency added it "deplores the DPRK's failure to implement essential elements of resolutions of the Board (of Governors)" and called on Pyongyang to cooperate fully and provide access "to all safeguards-relevant information and locations." The IAEA governors strongly commended the "tireless efforts" of its Director General Hans Blix and the IAEA secretariat to obtain North Korea's cooperation in implementing safeguards agreements, calling on them to continue their work.
