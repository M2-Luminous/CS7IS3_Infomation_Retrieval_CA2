The white paper offers a detailed explanation of China's basic position on the protection of IPR, a systematic account of legislation and law enforcement with regard to IPR, and the positive efforts it has made in undertaking international obligations in regard to protecting IPR. The white paper is divided into three parts and contains about 12,000 characters. The white paper points out in its foreword: As a whole, China, for a variety of historical reasons, began work on its IPR protection system at a comparatively late date. After China started reform and opening up to the outside world, it accelerated the process of establishing an IPR protection system to rapidly develop social productive forces, promote overall social progress, meet the needs of developing a socialist market economy, and expedite China's entry into the world economy. Since the end of the seventies, China has done a tremendous amount of effective work in this field, covering in a little more than a dozen years a distance that took other developed countries scores of years, even 100 years, establishing a relatively comprehensive legal system for IPR protection, thereby attracting worldwide attention for its achievements not only in establishing the system but also in enforcement. The white paper's first part elaborates on China's basic position regarding IPR protection. It points out: It is the Chinese Government's view that the intellectual property protection system plays a significant role in promoting progress in science and technology, enriching culture, and developing the economy. It functions both as an important institution ensuring the normal running of the socialist market economy and as one of the basic environments and conditions for conducting international exchange and cooperation in science and technology, economics, and culture. China considers the protection of intellectual property an important part of its policy of reform and opening up to the outside world and of the building of its socialist legal system. Beginning in the late seventies, China has been formulating laws and regulations for IPR protection, and has been actively participating in activities organized by relevant international organizations aimed at strengthening international exchange and cooperation in the IPR field. From its inception, China's IPR protection system was directed toward the world and geared to high international standards. Spurred on by its reform and opening up, China has carried on its intellectual property protection legislation at a speed never before known. After starting reform and opening up to the outside world, China has enacted several laws for the protection of IPR, including "the PRC Trademark Law," "the PRC Patent Law," "the PRC Copyright Law," and "the PRC Law on Combating Unfair Competition." It has also actively participated in activities sponsored by the World Intellectual Property Organization [WIPO] and other relevant international organizations. It has become a WIPO member, the "Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property Rights," the "Madrid Agreement for the International Registration of Trademarks," the "Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works," the "Universal Copyright Convention," the "Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms," and the "Patent Cooperation Treaty." China was among the first signatory states of the "Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits." China has consciously sought to fulfill its international obligation in IPR protection, endeavoring to bring its intellectual property protection level near the new international standards, and has taken many major measures to further raise its current level of IPR protection. Dr. Arpad Bogsch, WIPO director general, pointed out that "China has accomplished all this at a speed unmatched in the history of intellectual property protection." The white paper points out: While improving its legal system, earnestly enforcing the laws, and striking relentless blows at infringements and other unlawful practices, China has spared no effort in publicizing and providing education about the intellectual property protection legal system and in accelerating the training of professional personnel in this field. The fact that there has been an increasing number of cases involving IPR in recent years and that these cases have been remedied through recourse to law reflects the people's heightened awareness and the wide spread of IPR knowledge throughout society. The white paper's second part elaborates on China's legal system for intellectual property protection. In accordance with its national conditions and current tendencies in international development, China has formulated and fine-tuned various laws and regulations on intellectual property protection, thereby constructing a socialist legal system for intellectual property protection with Chinese characteristics. The scope of the IPR protected in China and the degree of protection afforded have gradually conformed with international practices and a high degree of legal protection for IPR has been realized. Effective March 1983, the "PRC Trademark Law" and the rules for its implementation set forth the principles of application, examination, and registration in trademark registration procedures that are entirely identical with common international principles. In 1993, China revised both its Trademark Law and the rules for its implementation to expand the range of trademarks protected. Regulations on commodity trademarks were joined by those on the registration and management of service trademarks; in examination as to form, a revision procedure was added; and in examination as to substance, a written comment system was established to provide convenience for registered trademark applicants. All these regulations coincide completely with the requirements of GATT's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property. In addition, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce has issued a series of regulations including the Regulations on the "Administration of the Printing of Trademarks" and the "Procedures for Filing License Contracts for the Use of Trademarks." In February 1993, the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee adopted the "Supplementary Regulations on Punishing Criminal Counterfeiting of Registered Trademarks" to further intensify punishment for such counterfeiting and other infringements. These laws and regulations fully and effectively guarantee the right to the exclusive use of Chinese and foreign registered trademarks. "The PRC Patent Law" and the rules for its implementation came into effect in April 1985, expanding the scope of intellectual property protection in China to include inventions and other new creations. To bring the level of China's patent protection closer to international standards, the NPC Standing Committee adopted an amendment to the Patent Law on 4 September 1992, which included important revisions. The revised Patent Law expands the scope of patent protection: patents may be granted to all types of technological inventions, whether new products or new techniques, including pharmaceutical products and substances obtained by means of a chemical process, foods, beverages and flavorings; an invention patent's duration has been extended from 15 years from the date of application to 20 years; the duration of utility model patents and of exterior design patents has been extended from five years from the date of application to 10 years; and the protection of patent rights has been further strengthened. In addition to extending the protection of a patented process to include products directly produced by that process, the law clearly stipulates that the importation of patented products requires the patent holder's permission; and conditions for imposing compulsory patent license were restipulated. These measures mark the reaching of a new level of patent protection in China. In this way, the PRC Patent Law has essentially been brought in line with the GATT "Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of IPR." "The PRC Copyright Law" and the rules for its implementation explicitly protect the copyright and other legitimate rights and interests of the authors of literary, artistic, and scientific works. The law also provides protection for computer software. China is among a select group of countries that have explicitly listed computer software as the object of protection by copyright laws. Moreover, the State Council has promulgated the "Regulations on the Protection of Computer Software," providing the specifics whereby the laws protecting computer software will be implemented. These regulations, a necessary adjunct to the Copyright Law, came into effect in October 1991. On 25 September 1992, the State Council promulgated the "Regulations on the Implementation of the International Copyright Treaty," providing specific regulations on protecting foreign authors' copyrights in accordance with the international treaty. These laws and regulations have been joined by the "PRC Technological Contract Law" and the "PRC Law on Scientific and Technological Progress" as formulated by the NPC Standing Committee as well as a series of administrative regulations concerning intellectual property protection worked out by the State Council, together further optimizing the nation's legal system for the protection of IPR, in the whole bringing the system close to and in coordination with international levels of protection. The white paper also points out that China's intellectual property law stipulates the legal responsibilities to be borne by anyone who violates the law, including civil liability, criminal liability, and exposure to administrative sanctions. The white paper notes: With the implementation of intellectual property laws, IPR are effectively protected in China. These laws also actively encourage invention and other forms of creation and fair competition. For instance, the protection of the right to the exclusive use of registered trademarks has resulted in the rapid growth of the number of trademarks registered by Chinese and foreign businessmen in China. By the end of 1993, there were over 410,000 effective registered trademarks. Of these, 350,000 were domestic, with the remaining 60,000 coming from 67 countries and regions. In 1993, there were 170,000 applications for trademark registration annually in China, including more than 130,000 applications for new trademarks registration, among the highest number in the world. In addition, the PRC Patent Law has greatly encouraged inventions and other creations in China, and has proved a magnet for attracting patent applications from other countries and regions. On 1 April 1985, the first day the Patent Law came into effect, 3,455 applications for patent rights were submitted. By the end of 1993, the PRC Patent Office had handled over 360,000 applications for patent rights. The white paper's third part elaborates on the law enforcement system for intellectual property protection; that is, the judicial institutions and administrative channels for intellectual property protection. In China, any citizen, legal person, or organization entitled to IPR whose rights and interests have been infringed upon may bring a lawsuit to the people's court in accordance with the law and receive practical and effective judicial protection. The people's courts exercise judicial power independently according to law; are subordinate only to the law itself; and are not subject to interference by any administrative organ, public organization, or individual. From 1986 to the end of 1993, people's courts throughout the country accepted and handled 3,505 cases concerning IPR disputes, 1,168 of which concerned copyrights, 1,783 patents, and 554 trademark rights. In accordance with the law, the people's courts defend the legitimate rights and interests of the foreign and domestic IPR holders through trying cases concerning IPR disputes. Intellectual property is an important civil right. In civil infringement cases, the people's court is empowered to order the infringer to bear civil responsibility for the cessation of the infringement, for the elimination of any negative effects caused by his actions, for offering apologies, and for compensation for any losses in accordance with the law. Furthermore, it is empowered to confiscate the infringer's illegal gains and/or adjudge the infringer to criminal detention or a fine. If the IPR infringement is so serious that it has disrupted the economic order and constitutes a crime, the infringer's criminal responsibility is investigated and dealt with according to law. Between 1992 and 1993, people's courts accepted 743 criminal cases for counterfeiting trademarks, of which 731 have been tried with 566 people being sentenced to fixed terms of imprisonment, criminal detention, or other punishments. The white paper points out: In addition to judicature in accordance with international practices, China's system for the protection of IPR comprises the Patent, Trademark, and Copyright Laws and other administrative channels designated in intellectual property laws, all proceeding from China's actual conditions. Since the Copyright Law was put into force, local administrative organs responsible for copyright affairs investigated and dealt with more than 150 cases involving pirated books and video products from June 1991 to the end of 1993. They have confiscated and destroyed the pirated goods and levied administrative sanctions on the infringers. In 1994, the Chinese Government organized the departments concerned to launch an assault, investigating and dealing with the illegal duplication of laser discs and illegal reproduction of books. Relevant government departments took steps to strengthen administration over the establishment of enterprises manufacturing compact discs and supervision over their production in accordance with the law. A large proportion of the cases concerning violations of foreigners' intellectual property rights were investigated and dealt with by China's intellectual property protection administrative offices on their own initiative, acting in accordance with their prescribed functions and powers. For instance, since 1988, administrative organs for industry and commerce at various levels in Guangdong Province have investigated and dealt with 301 cases concerning the violation of U.S.-owned trademarks. Out of these 301 cases, one third were filed by the American trademark owners, with the remaining cases being the product of market investigations by industry and commerce administrative organs or consumer complaints. In its concluding remarks, the white paper points out: More than a few international observers have concluded that in terms of intellectual property protection, China has reached international advanced levels. Nonetheless, China cannot remain satisfied with the achievements it has already made and much remains to be done toward optimizing China's intellectual property system. In its modern form, this system was established only a short time ago, and as a result, awareness of IPR remains comparatively weak in society at large. In some regions and governmental departments, there is insufficient appreciation of the importance of intellectual property protection. Some serious acts of infringement have violated not only the legitimate rights and interests of the intellectual property right's holder, but also the dignity of the law. Accordingly, the State Council has drawn up Decisions on Further Strengthening the Protection of Intellectual Property. The implementation of all the important measures contained in the Decisions will mark a great new step forward in the nation's efforts to ensure IPR protection. China will continue to actively promote international cooperation in the field of intellectual property and make positive contributions toward the development and optimization of the international intellectual property system. The Intellectual Property Protection in China White Paper (Chinese version) will be published in booklet form by Wuzhou Publishing House and sold through Xinhua Bookstores across the country.
