What is the dialogue about and has it had any results? [Al-Liddawi] The Palestinian problem is going through its most critical phases at present. Years of suffering and sacrifice have been forgotten and ignored. All our Palestinian people's rights have also been bypassed and ignored and there is no more talk about the Palestinian people's dream of returning to the homeland and establishing their independent state on all the national soil. Thus, in view of the gravity of the plot and the great sacrifices already made, we had to stand firm against the squandering of our rights and those squandering them in order to protect our people's right to their territories and homeland. The Islamic Resistance Movement [Hamas] was eager to consult all partners in the battle with a common destiny in order to discuss how to frustrate this genocidal plot. The dialogue was not limited to a specific party but to all those who are loyal to this cause. We were prompted in this by the accelerated squandering of our rights and our belief that all must be involved in a coordinated and organized move to foil this plot. [AL-SHIRA'] With which Arab Islamic forces is Hamas meeting? How do you justify the methods followed, specifically those in Egypt and Algeria? [Al-Liddawi] As written in its charter, Hamas believes that Palestine is an Islamic awqaf land, that is, it belongs to all Muslims everywhere, regardless of their race, and to all Muslim generations throughout the ages. Hence the burden of liberating it falls on the shoulders of all Muslims. On this premise, Hamas believes that it should have solid ties with all the Islamic and Arab parties whose objective is to liberate Palestine and restore the Palestinian people's legitimate and historic rights. Hamas believes that all the Arab and Islamic efforts must unite to liberate Palestine. Hamas needs the efforts of everyone who is faithful to the Palestinian people and their cause, even if we have differences with some of them over ideas and ideologies. As for what is happening in Egypt and Algeria, the Hamas policy is not to interfere in the affairs of others; this is based on our desire to maintain the uniqueness of the our Palestinian cause. Hence, we do not interfere. But at the same time, we call on all the parties to refer their differences to the Koran and the true Islamic path. We also call on all of them to begin a dialogue in order to end all the illusions and deceptions that the enemies of this Islamic nation are trying to plant in our midst to create more divisions and differences. [AL-SHIRA'] You stand accused of impeding the work of the Palestinian forces' alliance by rejecting the election of an alternative leadership to 'Arafat and because of your bad relations with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] which reached their nadir when you killed one of its military officials, "Yusuf Abu-Lafi," in the occupied territories? [Al-Liddawi] Everyone knows that Hamas was the first to come up with the idea of bringing the 10 Palestinian groups and other forces that reject the settlement process together for the sake of joint Palestinian action. We are serious about heightening the Palestinian groups' action and developing their methods of political confrontation in order to abort 'Arafat's defeatist policy. We made several proposals when we started the move for a framework of a Palestinian forces' alliance. We presented serious ideas in several working papers but we met many selfish and subjective obstacles from some groups. The delay in reaching agreement on the alliance was probably caused by these groups' study of the plan and not Hamas. Regarding the issue of electing a leadership that would act as an alternative to 'Arafat, we believe that we must first have more jihad work to abort the liquidationist plan while simultaneously embarking on a gradual rebuilding of the PLO institutions. We agreed on this with the other groups. I do not think that we disagree with those who say that the Palestinian people need a wise leadership that will save it from this gloomy fate, but at the same time we want to rebuild the PLO institutions gradually rather than leap into the unknown. The reports that the reason Hamas has no desire to elect an alternative leadership to 'Arafat and is opposed to holding elections outside the occupied homeland for that purpose is because it fears that it will not get very much support outside the territories are not true. Hamas has no fear about this because its increasing influence inside Palestine is the same as its influence outside. Though it does not have an organizational framework abroad, Hamas is still capable of having an effective popular and organizational presence. This only requires a clear organizational decision to publicize all Hamas members and supporters abroad and overnight we would become the strongest Palestinian organization inside and outside the territories. But we reject partial elections. We are seeking comprehensive Palestinian elections for the Palestinian people, wherever they are. We do not want flashy and formal elections that do not bring the best for our people or which are held through popular conferences where the conferees are not allowed any freedom of opinion. As for our differences with the DFLP, we were deeply pained by what happened and our pain increased when the DFLP opted to discuss some of the problems between the two sides in the media and in front of those who gloat over these differences. I do not want to rehash the problem's details, for we jointly put an end to it. But I hope that the brothers in the DFLP will embrace the principle of coordination with us and that none of us will resort to publicizing our differences in the media. The DFLP will find that Hamas is ready to deal with it on the basis of coordination and respect for each other, especially as we are both going through such difficult times. [AL-SHIRA'] You are part of an alliance of Palestinian groups. However, the narrow and self-promoting tactics you followed when election lists were being prepared for the formation of Palestinian institutions inside the homeland led to wins by 'Arafat's supporters. Are you going to continue these tactics? And, how will this affect other Palestinian groups opposed to 'Arafat? [Al-Liddawi] This is completely untrue. Hamas is fully committed to furthering its alliance in the elections in all syndicates and electoral constituencies. We have already won elections in many institutions in alliance with other Palestinian groups. Hamas has never followed any self-defeating self-serving tactics. Maybe others did, but not us. Hamas has long suffered from such practices and sees them as detrimental. There are many indications of this. In an effort to reinforce our alliance, we call on our brothers in other Palestinian groups to coordinate openly with us in all matters concerning elections. This will strengthen us and help us defeat 'Arafat, his supporters, and their capitulationist line. We and other Palestinian groups have agreed to act as equals within the framework of our alliance. We are all politically equal. There is no difference between one group and another. No group is entitled to veto another. Everyone has the right to express their own views. Each of us has its own vote, and decisions are made on the basis of consensus, not majority. As for the elections, Hamas is ready to merge its lineup with like-minded Palestinian groups in any location. Every group will get as many seats as justified by its representation and any prior agreement. But Hamas is the only active group in several areas, and it is only logical that we should run on our own in such cases. [AL-SHIRA'] Your killing of Abu-Lafi could trigger a Kabul-style conflict in the occupied territories. The elements of strife are there. What do you plan to do to avoid this scenario? [Al-Liddawi] As I said in my last answer, we seek closer coordination everywhere. We want to cooperate seriously with other groups in order to serve the Palestinian cause. We want to harass the enemy with more painful operations. We want to contain any problem, however big, by referring it to the joint coordination committee. We should not pay attention to press reports and allegations, for these normally throw fuel on the fire. With more understanding, coordination, and working together, we will avoid becoming a second Kabul. We have to remember that the enemy is doing everything it can to foment sedition and trigger infighting among us. [AL-SHIRA'] There were attempts to initiate a dialogue between you and 'Arafat after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. How far have these attempts gone? [Al-Liddawi] There will be no dialogue with 'Arafat until he withdraws from the settlement process and renounces the Oslo agreement. There have been no dialogues with 'Arafat following his recent involvement in the quagmire of the Oslo agreement. But at the same time, we might meet with Fatah members inside the occupied homeland to solve local problems and avert any further aggravation of the existing bad situation between the two movements. Such meetings would also help prevent the struggle from dissolving into infighting. We must make every possible effort to insure that such infighting never occurs. [AL-SHIRA'] You have been equated with the Zionist hardliners who reject the negotiations. Could you respond to this? [Al-Liddawi] Where and how are we equal? We are endeavoring to regain our usurped rights in Palestine, all of Palestine, and we are using all legal and legitimate methods in our struggle against our enemy for the sake of recovering our legal rights. As for the Zionist hardliners, they are unjustly trying to keep Palestine as their homeland. They are using all unlawful means to achieve their designs and are being assisted in this by the Zionist government. Finally, we reject the existing negotiations, which are bound to forfeit all the Palestinian people's rights and waste all their sacrifices from the long years of suffering and persecution. God willing, we will continue our jihad and our work until the occupation is driven from our land.
