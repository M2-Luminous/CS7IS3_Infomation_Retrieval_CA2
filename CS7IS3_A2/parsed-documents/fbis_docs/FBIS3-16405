They were declared valid in the majority of districts. According to preliminary figures, sufficient numbers of voters went to the polls in 35 of the 47 districts in the Chuvash Republic. The elections were declared valid in 34 out of 50 districts in Altay. In Khabarovsk Kray, the corresponding figure is 23 out of 25 districts. In Kostroma Oblast, elections were validated in 14 out of 15 oblasts. In the Jewish Autonomous Oblast the figure is 11 out of 15 districts. The Central Electoral Commission announced that more precise figures will be known tomorrow. [passage omitted] Altay Kray The experience of having government members become deputies and switch to work in the State Duma without leaving their government posts is evidently going to be repeated in Altay. By far, the greatest number of candidates for the Kray legislative assembly registered here were administration heads or directors. According to legal experts, if the elections end in their favor the principle of the division of powers expounded in the Constitution will thereby be violated. After all, the job of the majority of contenders for the kray legislative assembly is to resolve economic problems, while the functions of the representative power consist of adopting laws and monitoring administration activity, whereas administration heads and leaders of all ranks involved in the executive structures are going to start adopting laws, so to speak, "to suit themselves." It is not difficult to guess where this could lead. [passage omitted]
