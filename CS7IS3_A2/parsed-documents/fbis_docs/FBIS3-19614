So far it seems most likely that the referendum on the EU will be held at some time in November, and probably in the latter half of the month. However, a precondition is that the EU next week clears up its internal disagreement on voting rules. This would then mean that the European Parliament could debate the matter in May, and that the new members could be admitted beginning on 1 January next year. At her news conference in the early hours of Tuesday [15 March] morning, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland indicated that the referendum will come toward the end of the year. She also announced that the party leaders and the leaders of the the yes and no movements will be invited to discuss the date. Formally, the government will put a proposal to the Storting fixing the date. It is the Municipal Affairs Ministry that is responsible for the holding of the referendum. Municipal Affairs Minister Gunnar Berge has told AFTENPOSTEN that as soon as the situation has finally been clarified, he will be able to put a bill with a concrete proposal for the date for the referendum before the Storting relatively quickly. Last fall the Storting adopted a surprising resolution requesting the government to initiate contacts with the aim of adopting a common date for the referendums in the three Nordic applicant countries. At the recent meeting of the Nordic Council, Berge announced that such contacts had been made, but that the other countries would choose dates on the basis of their national political processes. In Sweden, June and November are possible alternatives, while the Finns are looking at a referendum in September. Reports that the Swedes are now looking at a referendum in November has given new fuel to Norwegian hopes for a common referendum date. A Norwegian referendum before the summer is not being considered. The Labor Party will hold its regular national congress from 10 to 13 November. The party's position on the membership agreement will be decided at an extraordinary national congress in May or June. Some people take the view that if there is not a common date for the referendums in all three countries Norway should at least go to the polls on the same day as one of the other countries. Christian People's Party leader Kjell Magne Bondevik backs this alternative, as does Center Party leader Anne Enger Lahnstein. Paul Chaffey of the Socialist Left Party would like the referendum on the same day as Sweden, but is less concerned about Finland. The Conservative Party has a different position: According to Per-Kristian Foss, the deputy leader of the party's Storting group, it would be an advantage for Norwegian voters if they know how things have gone in Sweden and Finland. In the Progress Party, deputy chairman Hans J. Rosjorde takes the same view.
