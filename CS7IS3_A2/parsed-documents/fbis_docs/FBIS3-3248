For the last 10 years, they have developed goods for civilian use, transformed projects, and developed nearly 1,000 major import substitutes by making use of techniques for the manufacture of rocket engines. Twenty percent of their innovations were unique in the country or filled in the gaps in the fields of science and technology. The research institute concentrated on developing the key components, projects, and major equipment for the petrochemical, metallurgical, light, and textile industries which China previously had to import from abroad. It utilized technologies for the manufacture of rocket engines, including vacuum [zhen kong 4176 4500], automatic control, heat exchange, special pumping [te zhong beng fa 3676 4429 3119 7042], and electronic quantitative [dian zi ji liang 7193 1311 6060 6852] technologies, and others. The safety valve needed for the equipment imported by the petrochemical department had been seen as an item that could not be manufactured in China, with the result that the state had to spend millions of U.S. dollars in importing the valve from abroad every year. During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," however, the research institute, with the assistance of the China National Chemicals Import and Export Corporation and of customers, developed 10,000 valves in 300 varieties, with 2,000 specifications. These valves were as good as or even better than their imported counterparts in terms of quality. The research institute is now the only unit in the country that can manufacture high-speed pumps for civilian use. Therefore, the institute was declared by the State Science and Technology Commission as China's engineering development center for special pump valves. Earlier, the institute carried out reforms designed to quickly transform science and technology into productive forces, and to adapt its scientific and technological products to market needs. Out of the nine research laboratories under the institute, three were still responsible for developing "defense products," and the remaining six were committed to developing civilian items. About 500 science and technology workers were sent to all quarters across the country to gather information and seek out markets, and they obtained a steady flow of orders for various civilian items. They now have set up close partnership relations with enterprises -- large petrochemical enterprises, in particular -- in more than 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Since 1990, the institute's output value has grown by 20 percent annually.
