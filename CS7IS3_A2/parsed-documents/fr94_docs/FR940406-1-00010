FR940406-1-00010 FR940406-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;37&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives: Beech Aircraft Corporation 35 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking; Reopening of the comment period. SUMMARY: This document proposes to provide additional time for the public to comment on a proposal to supersede two airworthiness directives that currently require the following on certain Beech Aircraft Corporation (Beech) 35 series airplanes: Checking the ruddervator static balance and adjusting as appropriate; fabricating and installing airspeed limitation placards; incorporating certain airspeed limitations into the airplane flight manual (AFM); and installing stabilizer reinforcements. Several comments received on the original notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) requested additional time to respond to the proposed action. This proposed action would incorporate and update the procedures and applicability of both AD's into one document. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent structural failure of the V-tail, which could result in loss of control of the airplane. DATES: Comments must be received on or before June 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;37&hyph;AD, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Comments may be inspected at this location between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, holidays excepted. Service information that applies to the proposed AD may be obtained from the Beech Aircraft Corporation, P.O. Box 85, Wichita, Kansas 67201&hyph;0085. This information also may be examined at the Rules Docket at the address above.

Discussion A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that would apply to certain Beech 35 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57760). The action proposed to supersede AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1 with a new AD that would require: (1) Checking the ruddervator static balance and adjusting as appropriate; (2) fabricating and installing airspeed limitation placards; (3) incorporating certain airspeed limitations into the airplane flight manual (AFM); and (4) installing stabilizer reinforcements. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with the instructions to either Beech Kit No. 35&hyph;4016&hyph;3, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;5, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;7, or 35&hyph;4016&hyph;9, as applicable and as specified in Beech Service Bulletin No. 2188, and the applicable maintenance manuals. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Several commenters request an extension of the comment period in order to have additional time to respond to the actions presented in the proposal. After careful consideration, the FAA has determined that the comment period for the proposal should be reopened to allow the public additional time to comment on the proposed actions. The FAA has altered the proposal to include additional information that was inadvertently left out or referenced incorrectly when preparing the original notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). Before final rule action is implemented, the FAA will evaluate all comments received in response to the original NPRM as well as this supplemental NPRM. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Beech 35 series airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1 with a new AD that would require: (1) Checking the ruddervator static balance and adjusting as appropriate; (2) fabricating and installing airspeed limitation placards; (3) incorporating certain airspeed limitations into the airplane flight manual (AFM); and (4) installing stabilizer reinforcements. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with the instructions to either Beech Kit No. 35&hyph;4016&hyph;3, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;5, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;7, or 35&hyph;4016&hyph;9, as applicable and as specified in Beech Service Bulletin No. 2188, and the applicable maintenance and shop manuals.
