Compared with the previous years, investment on the mainland in 1993 by Taiwan businessmen extended to more localities, and the sectors and scale of investment further expanded -- long-term investment began to increase and Taiwan's large consortiums and enterprises speeded up studies of the mainland's investment climate and quickened the pace of their investment. According to statistics provided by concerned departments, as of October 1993, the mainland had approved the establishment of more than 15,100 Taiwan-funded enterprises, with a total investment figure of more than $13.6 billion. Many people of insight in Taiwan's business circles point out that economic cooperation between the mainland and Taiwan has become an extremely important factor in Taiwan's further economic development. Taiwan business investment on the mainland in 1993 had the following distinct characteristics: 1. The areas in which investment is being made continued to grow quickly, spreading from the southeast coastal area to the entire coastal area as well as to some inland provinces. Taiwan-invested enterprises in the areas along the Chang Jiang, along the coastal area of the Bo Hai, and in inland provinces increased noticeably, and they also began to appear in such remote areas as Qinghai and Tibet. According to statistics compiled by the foreign economic relations and trade commissions of the four cities along the coastal area of the Bo Hai -- Tianjin, Dalian, Qinhuangdao, and Qingdao -- in January and February last year, the four cities approved a total of more than 700 Taiwan investment projects, with a total investment figure of more than $600 million. In areas along the Chang Jiang, Shanghai approved 482 direct Taiwan investment projects during the January-September period worth a total of $430 million, exceeding the total number of Taiwan investment projects and the total investment figure for the preceding 5 years combined. Both the number of Taiwan investment projects and volume of investment approved by Anhui in 1993 increased several fold over the year before. Jiangsu is now the province with the largest number of Taiwan-invested enterprises. Taiwan investments in Sichuan, Jiangxi, and other inland provinces also increased by a large margin compared with previous years. Northeast China has begun to become a hot spot for Taiwan investment -- Liaoning Province alone approved the establishment of more than 300 Taiwan-funded enterprises during the January-September period, more than the combined total of the previous 9 years. 2. Taiwan investment was spread over a greater area and long-term investment increased. In addition to the labor-intensive processing industries, which were the major target of Taiwan industrial business investment on the mainland in the early years, investment has now begun to shift to capital and technology-intensive modern industries; to the transportation, energy, and communications industries; and to other infrastructural facilities. Taiwan businessmen established on the mainland some new and high- technology enterprises such as plasma cutting machine manufacturing, laser products, silicon rubber, printed circuit boards, and a few bioengineering ventures. Also, foreseeing a prosperous market on the mainland, Taiwan's home electrical appliance and computer industry began to invest in many areas of the mainland. And, Taiwan investment also began to enter the financial, real estate, and other sectors on the mainland. Last year, Taiwan's financial institutions began to open offices in Shenzhen and other localities. The B-type shares issued by the Xiamen Shankun Industrial Company, a company solely owned by Taiwan compatriots, were listed at the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in mid-1993, making the company the first listed Taiwan enterprise on the mainland. Also, over the last few years, Taiwan investment on the mainland has focused on the purchase of factories and the right to use land as well as on building factories and dormitories; quite a few Taiwan investors have chosen to settle on the mainland and therefore have taken the initiative in planning long-term enterprise development strategies. 3. The scale of Taiwan investment reached a new level. The structure of Taiwan industrial investment on the mainland has also changed. Various surveys show that Taiwan investment on the mainland has not only has entered capital-intensive and high-technology industries and other long-term investment projects, but has also been injected into large, complex investment projects involving various industrial sectors -- Taiwan investment on the mainland has begun to be diversified. According to statistics released by Taiwan's "Council for Economic Planning and Development," 64 percent of Taiwan's manufacturing industrial enterprises have invested in the mainland; the volume of their investment on the mainland totaled $2.65 billion in the first 8 months of 1993, 14 times the figure for the same period in 1992. In Shenzhen, where the density of Taiwan investment is the highest, Taiwan investment has begun to shift to large and medium enterprises, with petrochemical and rubber industries leading the way. Taiwan's Tongyi Group and Weiquan Group, which are the leaders in Taiwan's food industry, have established solely-owned or co- invested food enterprises in various provinces and municipalities. Some of Taiwan's large enterprises have changed the "hit and run" experimental investment strategy they practiced at first and have begun long-term planning aimed at long-term development on the mainland. On the other hand, Taiwan investment in similar industries have become relatively concentrated in some localities, with the establishment of Taiwan industrial zones and processing zones. For example, Taiwan's Juda Bicycle Company and its satellite companies established a "bicycle production special zone" in Jiangsu's Kunshan city; the Taiwan Toy Association developed a "toy industrial city" in Zhejiang's Yuyao county; the Taipei City Computer Association established a "computer street" in Shanghai; and the Taiwan Machine-Building Association has plans to establish the "Taiwan Machine-Building Special Zone" in Zhejiang's Xiaoshan county. From these developments, Taiwan's economic sector has drawn this conclusion: Taiwan investment on the mainland has begun to increase in scale and has become more group-based. A survey conducted by Taiwan's China Economic Research Institute shows that every U.S. dollar of Taiwan investment on the mainland will create $2 in output value for Taiwan's economy and that Taiwan investment on the mainland has become one of the major driving forces of Taiwan's economic development. An official of a well-known Taiwan consortium said frankly: "The mainland has abundant resources and the markets there are becoming increasingly attractive. Therefore, whether we are seeking development or trying to expand domestic and overseas markets, investing in the mainland has all the advantages." For this reason, people in both the mainland and Taiwan business circles expect that, as economic and trade exchanges across the strait increase, and as mutually- complementary and mutually-beneficial, cross-strait economic relations are being gradually established, Taiwan investment on the mainland will reach new heights, and that this will push cross-strait economic cooperation to a new stage.
