In a statement to TANJUG Cairo correspondent, Juppe said the aim of France was to "exert strong political pressure on the warring sides in Bosnia" -- the Moslems, Serbs and Croats. France, together with Great Britain, initiated at the recent NATO summit in Brussels that a threat with air strikes on the positions of the Bosnian Serbs be included in the final document if the Serbs resisted opening of the airport in Tuzla and prevented replacement of the U.N. troops in Srebrenica. Tuzla and Srebrenica have been declared safe areas and are situated in northeastern and eastern Bosnia.
