The total land area that could be submerged is 1,072,000 hectares, 473,000 of which are farmland. The projected direct economic loss in 1991 prices is 17.2 billion rubles. There have been six major fluctuations of five to 10 meters in the Caspian's level in our era. Each one has devastated populated coastal areas and caused the destruction of many points of civilization. Specialists believe that global climatic changes largely determine water levels in the Caspian Sea. For example, while for nearly a century, from 1837 to 1933, the sea's level fluctuated insignificantly within a range of -25.3 to -26.5 meters, from 1933 to 1977 its level dropped by 290 centimeters, from -26.1 to -29 meters. Beginning in 1978 the Caspian's level began rising an average of 13 centimeters per year, for a total to date of 212 centimeters (-26.9 meters). The trend toward rising water levels remains stable. It cannot be ruled out that the sea's level will reach its critical mark of -25 meters in the next 15 to 20 years. Meanwhile, the ecological, sanitary-epidemiological, and medical-biological situation in the Caspian's coastal areas continues to deteriorate. Surface and subsurface waters are polluted with toxic substances and petroleum products, soil salinization is progressing, and infectious diseases and outbreaks of skin ailments and allergies are occurring over a widening area. Incidentally, this is confirmed by geochemical studies of soils, bottom sediments, and surface and subsurface waters in coastal cities; their findings have revealed the presence of toxic substances in concentrations that are tens of times in excess of the maximum allowable levels. Despite an unending series of acts and decrees adopted at various levels and apparently intended to save the territory from the "deluge," ecological conditions in the region are viewed as critical. A federal program for the Caspian, spanning the period up to 2000, was drawn up in 1993. Researchers at institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russian state meteorological service, the Russian Ministry of Economics, Moscow State University, and other leading research and design organizations were involved in drafting the program. It must be said that all the attempts made to prevent an ecological disaster during a three-year period were hindered by inadequate appropriations from the state budget and their use for other than the intended purposes. Russian Federation government decree No. 37 of January 19, 1993, set financing sources and volumes for various measures; they provide for capital investments of 1,021.45 million rubles (in 1991 prices) in 1993-1995. The clients were executive government agencies of Federation constituent members. According to the Russian Ministry of Finance, the following amounts of the established ceilings had actually been allocated as of January 1, 1994: to Dagestan, 65 percent; to Kalmykia, 49 percent, and to Astrakhan Oblast, 72 percent. Of these sums, the following amounts were expended on urgent measures: by Dagestan, 75 percent, by Kalmykia, 36 percent, and by Astrakhan Oblast, 25 percent. The studies' findings allow one to conclude that the level of the sea will continue to rise up to 2005 to 2010. Scientists currently disagree on whether the rate of the rise will stay within the range observed in previous years (an average of 13 centimeters per year) and reach the point of -25 by 2005 to 2010 or whether it will slow. However, the second scenario is more likely, given increased evaporation rates and additional outflow from the Caspian Sea into the Kara-Bogaz-Gol Gulf and undrained depressions on the territory of Kazakhstan. A promised federal program for solving social, economic, and environmental problems relating to the rising level of the Caspian was not submitted to the Russian State Construction Committee for consideration in January of this year. "Since the program is lacking," said State Construction Committee spokesman Timashev, "it is wrong to promote any particular hypothesis (effluent balance) to the detriment of others, such as the geotectonic hypothesis." Mr. Timashev is convinced that such "promotion" would overshadow the main issue--the need to accelerate efforts to protect the cities and communities. It is hardly appropriate in this situation to speak of the adoption of any sort of "urgent measures." There remains, contrary to Michurin's well-known saying, to pin our hopes on nature's favors.
