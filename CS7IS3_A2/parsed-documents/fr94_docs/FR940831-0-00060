FR940831-0-00060 FR940831-0-00022 40 CFR Part 180 [OPP&hyph;300348A; FRL&hyph;4905&hyph;4] RIN 2070&hyph;AB78 Amended Tolerance Exemptions for Encapsulating Polymers AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document amends the tolerance exemptions for three encapsulating polymers, poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-eicosene), poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-hexadecene), and vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, to remove language not directly related to the inert ingredient exemption and to replace the specific tolerance exemption listings (40 CFR 180.1104, 180.1105, and 180.1106, respectively) for these polymers with general listings under 40 CFR 180.1001(c). International Specialty Products requested these changes. The Agency is also amending a similar tolerance exemption for cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer in 40 CFR 180.1001(d) to add additional language to specify the reaction products and to remove the specific tolerance exemption (40 CFR 180.1039). EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation becomes effective August 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written objections, identified by the document control number [OPP-300348A], may be submitted to: Hearing Clerk (1900), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tina Levine, Registration Support Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: 2800 Crystal Dr., 6th Fl., North Tower, Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-308-8393. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of June 22, 1994 (59 FR 32173), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that International Specialty Products (ISP), 1361 Alps Rd., Wayne NJ 07470, had submitted petitions to amend the exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-eicosene), pesticide petition (PP) 4E4307, poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-hexadecene), PP 4E4304, and vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, PP 4E4306, to remove the specific exemptions in 40 CFR part 180 for these polymeric encapsulating agents and list them in 40 CFR 180.1001(c). In addition to the three polymers that were the subject of these petitions, the Agency noted that there was a similar specific exemption for cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer (40 CFR 180.1039) and proposed to amend this exemption also. Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading, and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. One comment was received in response to the proposed rule. The commenter noted that in the Federal Register of July 21, 1993 (58 FR 38977), EPA removed 40 CFR 180.1039 (cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer) and replaced it under 40 CFR 180.1001(d) (use as encapsulating agent). The commenter asked whether the current proposal was intended to replace or be used in addition to the listing finalized in the previous notice. The commenter is correct that the changes to 40 CFR 180.1039 proposed June 22, 1994 are redundant. The changes finalized last July, although based on the OPPT polymer exemption, effected the desired outcome. However, in reviewing the comment, EPA noted several ommissions from the July 21, 1993 notice which are now being corrected: (1) The final notice did not remove 40 CFR 180.1039, and (2) the general listing for cross-linked polyurea did not specify the reaction products. As cross-linked polyurea is a general term and may refer to several chemicals and only the specific chemical described by 40 CFR 180.1039 was reviewed, additional language on the reaction products has been added to the listing under 40 CFR 180.1001(d). Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
