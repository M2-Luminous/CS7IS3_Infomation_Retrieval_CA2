Shpilev and Candidate of Technical Sciences Professor Lieutenant-Colonel Ye. Matveyev: "Specific Features of Aviation Engineer Support for the Combat Operations of Ground Forces Aviation"] [Text] The improvements in the structure of the Ground Troops, accompanied by changes in their force composition and their saturation with air units (helicopter units in particular), require corresponding changes in aviation engineer support (IAO) for combat operations. This is commonly taken to mean the whole set of measures performed by engineering and technical personnel, aimed at maintaining aircraft hardware and the means of operating and repairing it in constant readiness for battle. The structural changes have unfortunately not yet had much of an impact on the organization of IAO in Ground Troops Aviation. The simultaneous use of a base airfield and sites for the dispersal of groups of helicopters, with the prolonged conduct of combat operations by small groups, pairs and individual helicopters separated from their permanent base locations, as is well known, is typical of Ground Troops' Aviation. This latter circumstance, as a rule, is the focus in the organization of IAO today, as is indeed reflected in the guiding documents. The principal and sole feature of the operation of Ground Troops' Aviation in accordance with them is "the organization of flights of solitary or small groups of helicopters away from their permanent basing."[.sup]1[/] The ways of resolving the problems of aviation engineering support that arise are thus sought within the standard organizational structure of Ground Troops Aviation. Here is an example: "The preparation of helicopters in group basing away from the main airfield is accomplished by the technical crews with the involvement of members of the flight crew," the corresponding manual states. "The regular maintenance and repair operations on helicopters that are away from their primary base airfield may be performed by a mobile (air-mobile) TECh [Technical-Maintenance Unit] or PARM [Mobile Aircraft Repair Shop], with the involvement of the crew.[.sup]2[/] Significant changes have occurred in recent years in both the helicopter hardware and the conditions for its application, while the structure of the system of IAO, combat preparation and combat operations in Ground Troops' Aviation has effectively not changed. The discrepancies between the ever-increasing requirements made toward Ground Troops' Aviation, the considerable changes in the conditions for its employment and the capabilities of the "old" IAO system were demonstrated especially visibly by the armed conflict in Afghanistan. Quite a few examples could be cited, at the same time, of the mutual integration of the technical and rear support for Ground Troops' Aviation and combined-arms formations, where entire helicopter squadrons operated for a long time together with units and formations of the ground forces as a unified, integral organism. A group of helicopters (6 Mi-8, 8 Mi-24, 2 Mi-6 and one Mi-10 and Mi-9), for example, supported units and subunits of a motorized-rifle division and an assault brigade in the Feyzabad--Taloqan--Qonduz--Sar-e Pol--Mazar-e Sharif--Meymaneh area for two months in June--August of 1980. The group, carrying out raiding operations, was constantly in motion--basing in one place did not exceed two, or more rarely three, days. The IAS [aviation engineer service] group was at just 70 percent personnel strength. The subunits for technical and rear support were operating together under these conditions. The "ground" people prepared the basing sites, provided security, defense and food, brought up ammunition and mat√©riel, repaired the ordnance loads (BK) and reloaded the helicopter weaponry (ASP). Mixed crews were formed in practice, with an aviation mechanic for aviation weaponry and five or six people from the Ground Troops subunits engaged in reloading the ASP, for example. All of the manpower was thus thrown into the fastest possible preparation of the aviation hardware (AT). The ground servicing equipment moved in a unified column. It is instructive that armored personnel carriers were the principal means of transport in a number of cases. They were used in particular for the delivery of ASP right to the helicopters. When a helicopter made a forced landing in a swamp in the area of the city of Feyzabad, it was an armored personnel carrier that pulled it out and towed it to the repair site. Ground troops in general were the first to come to the aid of helicopters in forced landings in areas where ground forces were stationed, assisting them in every way they could, starting with defense and ending with direct participation in restoring the craft. There are lots of examples where both the crews and the aviation hardware were saved thanks to the timely assistance of the ground forces. The improvement of IAO for ground forces aviation, in our opinion, entails a comprehensive review of all factors (conditions) that affect its organization, including of course specific features arising out of the operations of helicopters that are away from their main base locations. It should be taken into account therein that it exists within a system of overall technical support (TO) for the ground forces. Analysis of the nature of combat operations by ground forces, and the role and place of helicopter units or subunits in them, makes it possible to ascertain several specific features of the employment of army aviation. First of all, ground forces aviation performs a unified combat mission in close interaction with combined-arms formations and units. Second, the great intensity of battle is a cause of the mass damaging or disabling of armaments and combat hardware (VVT), and the necessity of performing recovery and repair operations that are close in nature for most types of VVT (including aviation hardware) in a very short time. Third, the reliance of the enemy on firepower against troops in their full depth and the substantial disruptions of lines of communication lead to increased demands on the lower levels of the systems of technical support for the troops, and an increase in the role and significance of their interaction in isolated areas. Finally, the increased maneuvering capabilities of ground forces groupings makes it necessary to ensure the equal mobility of all of their elements. Moreover, the results of research testify that the design and systems (type of operating body, parameters) are close for many models of aviation and armored hardware: Up to 24 percent of the entire body of aircraft weaponry and up to 70 percent of the GSM [oils and lubricants] employed on helicopters are also used in combined-arms units. The fasteners, technological methods, tooling and consumable materials are 60-80 percent similar for technical maintenance and repairs. The mobile technical-maintenance gear in service with the rear-support services of the ground forces may be used as much as 70 percent (for the types of work performed by the general-purpose ground-servicing for ground forces aviation), and the overhaul gear as much as 35 percent (for the types of work being performed by mobile ground forces aviation checkout and repair stations), for refueling and reloading operations and the overhaul of aircraft hardware. This value is close to 100 percent for its recovery by ground transport. Analysis of the conditions for the employment of ground forces aviation in contemporary battle thus testifies to the expediency of developing the system of technical maintenance for the ground forces in the direction of integrating the TO subsystems of the various branches, formulating uniform regulations (standards), and making joint use of some of the elements or facilities of the system of maintenance and repair. This system should include the elements (manpower and equipment) that performs general measures for the IAO of ground forces aviation and the TO of armored, engineer and motor vehicles, missiles, artillery and other types of VVT. The system of maintenance and repair of ground forces aviation hardware will thus include both the IAO elements of the combat entity itself (unit, subunit), and the common elements of the aforementioned system intended for the servicing and repair of AT. The variation we are proposing for the system of maintenance and repair of ground forces aviation hardware is presented in the diagram. Its realization, in our opinion, would make it possible to increase the firepower of field forces by 8-10 percent. [Left:] Existing system of TO We would note, in speaking of the integrated elements, that they include separate modules (repair and overhaul and recovery companies or battalions, the TEChs of brigades, VARMs [field aircraft repair shops] etc.). Some of them could be standardized, for example, for the performance of fitting, welding and soldering, dismantling and assembly, refueling and reloading, recovery, preparation and other operations, and another unit could specialize in individual types of VVT. The quantity of modules depends on the variation for the realization of the assigned combat task, and the requirements for work in recovery, salvage, overhaul and servicing of ground forces VVT. Improvements in the structure of TO for ground forces aviation hardware, in our opinion, should proceed in three directions from a practical standpoint: Refueling and reloading, recovery and salvage, and field repair of AT. The creation of forward points for the replenishment of ammunition and fuel for helicopters would be expedient, in order to organize refueling and reloading operations and reduce the time to prepare for repeat sorties and the deployment of teams or crews for technical maintenance in forward areas from the main repair elements of the ground forces. The refueling of helicopters, tanks and other types of VVT could be performed by refueling helicopters, as well as the ground forces rear-support gear. The dedicated purpose of the recovery companies and battalions must be expanded in order to organize the recovery and salvage of damaged AT, so that those units are able to recover all types of ground forces VVT, including aviation. Their composition would best include helicopters, and it makes sense to use the assault-transport helicopters in their interests. They could recover damaged hardware and bring it to the corresponding repair points when returning from forward areas. The overall supervision of the organization of TO (sequence and procedure for maintenance, recovery and overhaul of hardware) is exercised by the apparatus of the deputy commander for weaponry. Technical supervision (determination of technical status and the overhaul of the aircraft and helicopters, among other things) is accomplished by the aviation specialists, using the manpower and equipment of the ground forces. Domestic research has devoted a great deal of attention to experience in the organization of aviation engineer support in U.S. army aviation. IAO is performed there according to rules that take into account the specific conditions and requirements of the ground forces. The work on the technical servicing and repair (TER) is performed at three levels. The first includes the corresponding platoons of the battalion Ground Troops' Aviation. They perform field TER--all of preparation of aviation hardware for flights, as well as minor and routine repairs of assemblies. The second level is the AT TER companies and battalions of the corps and divisions. They perform medium repairs, complex inspections and regular servicing operations. The third level is plant repair. It is performed in the continental United States by aircraft-repair facilities of the ground forces, other branches of the armed forces and civilian firms. The IAS subunits that are performing intermediate TER are not part of the regular composition of the flight units, but are rather subordinate to the elements for technical and rear support of the divisions, corps and commands of the ground forces in a theater. They are the bulwark of the IAO of army-aviation units (the center of field repairs and technical servicing of aviation hardware in the areas where Ground Troops' Aviation units are stationed), and perform the principal repair and complex servicing operations, as well as allocating mobile teams to assist the field TER subunits. The subunits for intermediate TER are moreover the principal source of spare parts support for the flight units, from an exchange fund that is created from units and assemblies they have repaired. Analysis shows that the center of IAO operations is not in the flight units, but is rather in the subunits subordinate to the technical and rear-support elements of the ground forces. The comprehensive utilization of the manpower and equipment of technical servicing could facilitate an increase in the efficiency of IAO for combat operations for ground forces aviation under our conditions. A standardization of both the models of VVT themselves and the means of servicing and repairing them, assurance of the preparedness of the ground forces personnel to perform operations on various types of VVT and the creation of a unified system for the administration, supply and training of personnel and VVT orders are all necessary for this to happen.
