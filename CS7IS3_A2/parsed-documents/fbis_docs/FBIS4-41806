They Have Attempted To Strip Yuriy Meshkov of Some Presidential Powers"] [Text] Contradictions between Crimea's president and parliament are taking on the form of a direct standoff. Upon his return from Switzerland last week, Yuriy Meshkov caught the deputies in yet another attempt to curb his presidential powers: the Supreme Soviet tried to pass the so-called "Law on Enforcing the Crimean Constitution." The session did not specify which Constitution was at issue -- the new or the old one, which sparked a conflict with Kiev, but this seemed to be of no importance. The deputies wanted to pass a provision entitling them to rescind and to suspend presidential edicts, to stop the activity of local authorities, and even to appoint chiefs of local soviets, something that belongs to the Crimean president's few prerogatives. It is hard to say what stopped the lawmakers. Probably, with Mr. Meshkov back in town, conscience awoke in some of his "bloc friends" and the bill has not been passed so far. But... Observers note that all legislative trip-ups stem from the commonplace struggle for a place at the trough, which has continued at the parliament without letup since its election. The Crimea Supreme Soviet simply does not care about settling the conflict with Kiev. Also on 23 June, the presidential edict subordinating the Crimean State Property Fund to the Saburov government and the edict "on the privatization of Crimean state-owned enterprises" were rescinded. All this means just one thing: the parliament is intent on fully swilling everything out of the hypothetical "trough" and on dealing with privatization on its own. If the deputies, who acknowledged at the latest session their complete economic and legal ignorance, manage to succeed, Crimea will simply have no government at all, and the factions will start bickering over the distribution of property.
