Sean Dorney reports on a flurry of conflicting statements that had followed comments on Papua New Guinea [PNG] national radio by the secessionist representative to the United Nations, Mike Foster. [Begin Dorney recording] Interviewed on the PNG National Broadcasting Commission last week, Mr. Foster said there had to be some give and take from both sides and that the Wingti government's expectation of an unconditional surrender was as unrealistic as the rebel's expectation of complete and immediate secession. A statement issued from Sydney in the name of President Francis Ona attacked Mike Foster for letting down the revolution. He was also accused of being the White Judas of Bougainville by Lilian Cross, the Bougainvillian who is recently granted political asylum in Australia. However, a statement issued from Honiara in the name of Vice President Joseph Kabui sharply defended Mr. Foster and said the Bougainville freedom movement in Australia had no right to speak for the Bougainville interim government. In Papua New Guinea, there is division too. The minister for Bougainville affairs can't get the Wingti cabinet to endorse his support for Pan-Bougainville talks. [end recording]
