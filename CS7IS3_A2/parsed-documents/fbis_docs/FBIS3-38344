The Commission's initiative is to be formally unveiled at the CSCE conference taking place in Vienna today and tomorrow. The Commission's Balkans initiative falls into four parts: - Support for the Balkans customs corridor; - A series of short-term actions to address the most serious bottlenecks in the Balkans; - A medium-term plan to focus European Union investment on a number of "multi-modal" corridors identified by Balkan states themselves as alternatives to the trans-Yugoslav route; - Channeling further funds from the PHARE program into the construction of roads, ferry connections, customs posts and other needs identified by those Balkan states suffering most from the sanctions. Balkan Customs Corridor Civil war in the former Yugoslavia has caused severe delays and loss of trade resulting from the closure of road, rail and other traffic routes. The Commission believes that the establishment of a corridor passing through adjacent countries will greatly alleviate congestion if customs procedures are streamlined sufficiently. Furthermore, suitable technical assistance should enable such a corridor to be in place by this summer. The Commission will therefore urge the Vienna conference, due to discuss ways of helping those countries suffering from the sanctions, to consider the following proposals. The Commission believes that if followed, these proposals would ensure that trucks are delayed at borders for no more than one hour: Certain border posts should be reserved only for transit traffic carrying valid clearance documents (the TIR [international road transportation] carnet), enabling them to avoid normal traffic queues at customs. At other posts, where sufficient space is available, special "fast lanes" should then be created for those holding the TIR documents. Furthermore, two corridors should be assigned -- between Austria and Greece/Turkey, and between Albania, Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine -- and priority border posts will be nominated by the countries concerned. Valid TIR carnets could only be obtained, and the transit operation ended, at inland customs houses. Tackling the Most Serious Bottlenecks - Short Term Through the PHARE program, which channels over ECU1 billion of assistance every year to promote market economies in Central and East Europe, the Commission will identify the main transit bottlenecks and short-term projects for possible financing by PHARE. A plan for dealing with them will be submitted to the G-24 transport group for discussion in mid-April. Planning for the Medium and Long Term The Commission is participating in the "pan-European indicative plan for transport infrastructure development," through which the Balkan states have identified a series of multi-modal corridors toreplace the trans-Yugoslav route. This will be presented to European transport ministers in Crete on March 14. The plan is intended to guide governments and international financial institutions in the way they invest in infrastructure in East Europe, helping them to avoid overlap between such investments. PHARE is also preparing a study on the best site for a new bridge across the Danube between Bulgaria and Romania, although disagreements persist between those countries. In addition, PHARE will ensure that short-term transport projects tie in with longer- term priorities. Channeling Further Funds from PHARE Over the next four months, the Commission, through the PHARE program, will discuss with the countries worst affected by the UN sanctions additional ways of alleviating their most pressing transport problems. The following are examples of projects which will either move into action this year or will be budgeted in 1994 for action later: - Development of a ferry terminal in Calafat, Romania; - Upgrading customs procedures between Romania and Hungary at Nagylak/Nadlac; - Cofinancing with the EIB [European Investment Bank], the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] and the IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] of the rehabilitation of roads in Romania; - The upgrading of the road from Vidin to Sofia; and the upgrading of the road from Tirana to Dures and Rogozhine. Overall Funding Around ECU100 million could be made available through the PHARE budget to improve transit to and from the Balkans, provided the beneficiary countries give transport the urgency it requires when they draw up their own priorities for PHARE spending. Much of this funding is part of long-term programs which fit into a coherent overall framework and will provide long-term benefits to the countries concerned as well as alleviating the current bottlenecks.
