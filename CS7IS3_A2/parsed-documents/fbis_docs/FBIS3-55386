Yuriy Solton examines the significance of this visit: [Solton] It is symbolic that the new external political year for Russia is beginning with a meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton. This has once more refuted the speculations that have appeared in some media as though the Russian Government, embroiled in internal and other problems, considers its relationship with the United States less significant. In Moscow, the Vancouver Declaration, under which the two presidents attempt to conduct their business with the aim of strengthening bilateral cooperation and friendship, is seen as an important principle. By all accounts, Washington also feels the same about the Vancouver Declaration. As to what meaning the United States of America attaches to the Russian factor can be gleaned from the appointment of Strobe Talbott [as] coordinator of American policies on Russia and other Commonwealth countries. President Bill Clinton himself believes that the main task of his visit to Moscow is to demonstrate America's support for the democratic and market reforms, which are the preoccupations of Yeltsin and his team. He is not carrying with him any new aid package to Russia. The sum of $4.5 million has already been announced, and during the visit of the American Vice President Albert Gore to Moscow in December some concrete agreements were reached. Of course, during the Moscow talks prospects for further development in trade and economic cooperation between the two countries -- which for Russia, that has entered a period of radical changes, is important -- will be discussed. The negotiations in Moscow promise to be all-embracing and concrete, including the issue of security, cooperation in the control of weapons, the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and joint action in resolving regional conflicts. It is possible that different approaches to the solution of all or any problem may arise, but there can be no doubt that the meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, designed to define the program of cooperation and joint actions by these two great countries at the end of the century and the beginning of the next, will become an important event in world history.
