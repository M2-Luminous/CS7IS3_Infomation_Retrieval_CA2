FR940602-0-00029 FR940602-0-00010 Final Action USEPA is taking action to delete all TSP area designations in the State of Ohio since the Agency believes it is administratively more efficient than redesignating the TSP nonattainment areas, except for Cuyahoga County and a portion of Jefferson County, to attainment. Deletion of the TSP area delegations at this time eliminates the need for two rulemaking proceedings and has the same effect as redesignating TSP nonattainment areas to attainment. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. The Agency has reviewed this action for conformance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 enacted on November 15, 1990 and determined that this action conforms with the statute as amended. The Agency has examined the issue of whether this action should be reviewed only under the provisions of the law as it existed on the date of submittal to the Agency (i.e., prior to November 15, 1990) and has determined that the Agency must apply the new law. This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). Under Executive Order 12866, [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)] the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. OMB has exempted the regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. USEPA's action under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA does not affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this action. Moreover, USEPA's action does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA certifies that this action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements. Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 1, 1994. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).
