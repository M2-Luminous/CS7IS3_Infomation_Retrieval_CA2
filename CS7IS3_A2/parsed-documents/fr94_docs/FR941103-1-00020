ACTION: Proposed rule; correction. SUMMARY: This document contains corrections to proposed regulations (I.D. 092694A), published Monday, October 17, 1994. The proposed rule would implement Amendment 21a to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area, and would prohibit the use of trawl gear in specified areas surrounding the Pribilof Islands. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William D. Chappell, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2341. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 17, 1994 (59 FR 52277), NMFS published a proposed rule to implement Amendment 21a to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The action proposes to prohibit the use of trawl gear in specified areas of the exclusive economic zone surrounding the Pribilof Islands. Comments on the proposed rule must be submitted by November 28, 1994. In the preamble to the proposed rule in the third column of page 52278, the geographic coordinates of the area around the Pribilof Islands are correctly described. However, in the regulatory language in the third column of page 52279, the last geographic position, which would add a straight line closing the circuit of the Pribilof Islands and complete a description of the closed area, was inadvertently omitted. Correction of Publication Accordingly, the publication on October 17, 1994 (59 FR 52277) of the proposed regulations (I.D. 092694A), which were the subject of FR Doc. 94&hyph;25616, is corrected as follows: §675.22 [Corrected] On page 52279, in the third column, §675.22(i) is corrected by adding at the end of the latitude column, the coordinates ``57 ○57.0 ’ N.'' and at the end of the longitude column the coordinates ``168 ○30.0 ’ W.''
