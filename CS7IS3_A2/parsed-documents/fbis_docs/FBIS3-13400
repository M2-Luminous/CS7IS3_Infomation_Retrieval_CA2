The group appealed to King Husayn not to yield to pressure by launching a campaign against it. A statement by an official FRC spokesman said: We appeal to His Majesty King Husayn and the Jordanian administration to fully investigate events and facts and to consider the dangers of any compliance with Western pressure, regardless of their nature. The FRC statement denied any connection with the killing of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah and said: We were surprised that the al-Ma'ayitah case was attributed to our movement. The statement added that dozens of leading and well-known cadres were arrested in campaigns launched last month, but that these arrests will not drag the FRC into antagonizing Jordan. The official spokesman added: Proceeding from our movement's awareness of the ghastliness of what is afflicting the nation today and our awareness of possible future disasters, and in order to avoid making mistakes, we would like to emphasize that we refuse to be implicated. We also stress our commitment to our policy and refer to our endurance of sacrifices, pains, and difficulties with strength and nobility. The group denied that anti-government actions were taken by those recently arrested. It said most of those who were arrested had previously served long prison terms in Jordan despite the fact that their activities were conducted with the knowledge of the Jordanian authorities.
