Addressing participants in a regular ceremony of signing the treaty of social accord in the Grand Kremlin Palace, Filatov said the package of decress now under preparation is above all aims to improve efficiency of tax offices. "The poor performance of tax services results in such losses that their reducing by 20-30 per cent would enable to cover the entire federal budget deficit", he noted. The chief of the presidential staff listed priorities to be addressed by the said decrees. They include cutbacks in state subsidies and preferential support of enterprises, protection of private ownership, encouragement of private and foreign investments. The president also intends to issue an order on division between the economic and social activities of enterprises with a view to put an end to what head of the group of experts under the Russian president, Aleksandr Lifshits, described as "factory socialism". Some measures are also expected to be taken for equitable distribution of reform burden among all sections of the population. Filatov stressed that time had come to pass from words about reform to the reform itself, which the old parliament failed to do, despite repeated and urgent appeals by President Yeltsin.
