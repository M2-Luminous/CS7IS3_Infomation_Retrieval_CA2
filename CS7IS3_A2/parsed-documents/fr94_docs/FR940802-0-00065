FR940802-0-00065 FR940802-0-00009 40 CFR Part 721 [OPPTS&hyph;50589B; FRL&hyph;4752&hyph;3] Ethane, 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoro-; Modification of a Significant New Use Rule AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is modifying a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for ethane, 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoro- based on a request to modify the SNUR and EPA's previous response to comments for a similar situation in a proposed SNUR. EFFECTIVE DATES: The effective date of this rule is October 3, 1994. This rule shall be promulgated for purposes of judicial review at 1 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on August 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;543B, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 554&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of April 17, 1991 (56 FR 15784), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for ethane, 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoro- (P&hyph;88&hyph;1303, P&hyph;88&hyph;2177, and P&hyph;90&hyph;212). Based on a request to modify the SNUR and EPA's previous response to comments for a similar situation in a proposed SNUR, EPA is modifying this SNUR. I. Background The Agency proposed the modification of the SNUR for ethane, 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoro- in the Federal Register of September 15, 1993 (58 FR 48347). The background and reasons for the modification of the SNUR are set forth in the preamble to the proposed modification. The Agency received no public comment concerning the proposed modification. As a result EPA is modifying this SNUR. II. Objectives and Rationale for Modification of the Rule During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this modification, EPA concluded that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health or environmental effects of the substance, and EPA identified recordkeeping requirements necessary to enforce the rule. The basis for such findings is discussed in the rulemaking record referenced in Unit III. of this preamble. Based on these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter and a SNUR was promulgated. In light of the petition to modify the SNUR and EPA's response to a similar situation, EPA has determined that the recordkeeping requirement of §721.125(c) is unnecessary to enforce this rule. The proposed modification of SNUR provisions for this substance designated herein is consistent with that determination. III. Rulemaking Record The record for the rule which EPA is modifying was established at OPPTS&hyph;50589. This record includes information considered by the Agency in developing this rule. IV. Regulatory Assessment Requirements EPA is modifying the requirements of this rule by eliminating one of the recordkeeping requirements. Any costs or burdens associated with this rule will be reduced when the rule is modified. Therefore, EPA finds that no additional assessments of costs or burdens are necessary under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), or the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ).
