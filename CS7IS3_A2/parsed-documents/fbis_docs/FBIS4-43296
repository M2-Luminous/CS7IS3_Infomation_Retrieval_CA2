The Eduskunta rejected the proposal by the Leftist Alliance of a vote of no confidence by 97 votes to 80. Sixteen representatives of the government parties abstained: nine from the Center Party, six from the Christian League, and one from the Swedish People's Party. The National Coalition Party unanimously supported the government. No representative of the government parties voted against the government. Of the opposition parties, one representative of the Greens and the sole representative of the Liberal Party supported the government. Prime Minister Esko Aho interpreted the vote as meaning that there are no obstacles for the government to pursue its EU line. However, each government party must define its own stance on the matter. According to Aho, it was good that the results of the vote of confidence were clear. What was not so good was that the support from the government parties was not unanimous. According to Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen, the Eduskunta's decision will calm the financial markets.
