We talked on that occasion with Dr. Avramovic about the broader "systemic" issues related to the Yugoslav economy's transition. [Boarov] Mr. Avramovic, in a short time more people have rallied around your superdinar than all the political parties together can command. Are we looking at a widespread "hunger for stability," or did the old inflationary model collapse by itself, so that the superdinar was "fated to succeed"? [Avramovic] I do not know whether there is a difference between those two views. During the first week the desire to finally arrive at a stable currency was mixed with great anxiety. People were saying -- this is fine, but are they able to negotiate a turnaround? After a week, people began to believe that something good had been undertaken, although there was still fear. To be honest, I personally had become convinced that there was absolutely no other solution. In the end, we had only one choice: the choice between distribution of the remaining foreign exchange reserves and a new currency. The first solution would have only been a band-aid, while the latter offered a chance of radical remedy. The desire for stability is, of course, immense, because people have become frightened. In recent weeks, hyperinflation has seemed like profound social disintegration of a very serious kind. [Boarov] Even though real reconstruction of our system is only beginning, do you accept the argument that it is now evident in our country that real transition from a state economy to a market economy begins with a sound currency and the view is wrong that it should come only at the end of the reform? [Avramovic] A sound currency was an absolute precondition for anything else. I do not believe that we could have had even a nonmarket economy under the inflationary flood. It would have meant, for example, taking food from the farmers by force, which is what befell Russia in the 1920's. An extreme policy was not one of the choices. However, it is not easy to answer the question of what our market economy will look like in its further development. If I were making the decisions about that, I would say that the economy has to function according to very traditional principles. And that means: sound money, performance of contractual obligations, no price controls (except for pure monopolies), total equality of the private, government, and cooperative sectors, and so on. For me, those are categories which must be beyond political discussion. Only the future can show whether such a system would be predominantly a system of private ownership or not. The Socialist Party would probably want the volume of government intervention to be very broad, and some people would want something else. Perhaps a consensus could be arrived at concerning a significant role of the government in the economy, because it has not been proven that the private sector is inherently superior. What must not be allowed is for the government to be involved in setting prices, establishing rebates.... Nor can it be juggling interest rates; that is, it can influence them only up to the level to which a central bank normally influences the banking system. But here again there is a limit. [Boarov] Let us turn to the occasion of our meeting. How do you perceive the election as governor? Some interpret this as a concentration of responsibility for the possible failure of the superdinar, while others welcome this as a logical move. [Avramovic] I hesitated to accept the post of governor. That was an open secret. I thought the main thing was to draft the program, because I am not an administrator. I do not like administrative responsibilities. However, I would not like to see the whole thing go to ruin. Whether I can carry out that program better than someone else is a question others have answered. In any case, the argument that all the responsibility is now being thrust on me is not realistic. I do not think it is a question of that. No one can thrust everything on one person. There will always be such attempts if it all goes crazy. But I personally have no fear in this regard, although everything is possible. The main reason why I hesitated is that I am not the commander type, and we are talking about the system of the NBJ, which amounts to two Russian divisions--10,000 people. Nevertheless, I believe that I now have a chance to do what I think should be done in the way that I think it must be done. I am, of course, referring to what is in the jurisdiction of the NBJ. Within the limits of what can be done, and I have a precise opinion of what it can do and what it must not do, but also what it must do. The central bank cannot solve our tax problem, for example. Nor can it directly change a number of other things. But a firm dinar can do wonders in various sectors. That I have seen. [Boarov] There are already debates about the hard dinar in connection with the so-called stimulation of production. Is this a contradiction in your program; after all, market demand is usually primed with "soft money"? [Avramovic] Well, that is the most interesting question. In economic policy, the ideal is by instinct and skill to succeed in finding the "point of equilibrium" among the levels of wages, the foreign exchange rate, the price of credit, and the cost of government. Those are the four price blocks, and an economy is always some price or cost which has to be set properly, and everything hangs on that. A sound currency is the condition for that success. Germany, Japan, and Korea have demonstrated that. The foundation in all these examples was an absolutely firm fiscal policy. Incidentally, the Germans also had a firm monetary policy, but for decades the Japanese had a policy of a low price of credit, but they had a budget which was treated like Almighty God. It is not a question of any particular belt-tightening, the Japanese have been borrowing a great deal for the government on the domestic money market, but confidence in the yen was immense. You thus had a fantastic situation, you dropped the parity from 360 yen to the dollar to 100 yen to the dollar, and your credits were cheap. Loose money is a substitute for mistakes in setting basic prices. If you have a firm fiscal situation and a sound currency, then your possibilities in the field of social services are immense. Germany has proven that with its social welfare system. The great tragedy is that now they are tearing it down. Schmidt was a leftist, but a very serious man. He is not my ideal, but perhaps he resolved that contradiction among a hard currency, good social welfare, and a favorable market. Our situation is additionally burdened, after the catastrophe, by the problem that unfortunately it is very easy to move from stability into a new inflation. As soon as you have a more lasting stability, you need not be so orthodox. But at the outset, you must. [Boarov] You spoke about setting basic prices in some equilibrium. There are those who believe that it is very dangerous when the government touches those basic prices, and especially that basic basic price--the price of money. Particularly because Yugoslavia does not have built-in "controllers" of economic policy, by which I mean the money market, the market for capital, and other financial markets. [Avramovic] That is a key issue. For example, we will not solve the problem of financing our public services until they become economic units with a foreseeable profit of 10 to 12 percent, which in turn would make it possible for them to go to the market for capital. And what are the basic preconditions for setting up our financial markets? One is a firm currency, and another is resolving the issue of old foreign exchange savings. The latter is important not only from the humanitarian standpoint, but would be evidence that this government pays its obligations after all the mistakes that have been made. Savings depositors are aware how much the government can realistically pay at present, that it cannot pay much. But some arrangement must be devised to show that the government wants to discharge that debt. When those preconditions are met, you have an ideal position for the finance minister. First, issue a bond for two years or three at 10- percent interest. And when the price of that bond jumps to 110, 120, then you are on the move, all doors are open to you, then you can conduct a policy of low interest rates without forcing things. Unless we foul up in the next three or four months, we can arrive at a good foundation. At the same time, we should not forget that a blockade is a blockade. Money, however, "does not smell," and if you have a reputation of absolute solidarity, if the value of the dinar stands unwaveringly, and if you have an interest rate 2 or 3 points higher than neighboring states, and your wages are at the African level, capital will come. [Boarov] You talk about solidarity, and it occurs to me to ask about the first "adjustment of the projection" of monetary policy which calls for issuing 1 billion dinars in the first quarter. That is, twice or three times as much as was planned at the outset. Were you consulted about that? [Avramovic] No, I was not told about that adjustment. But I will simply tell you that I do not believe in any monetary projections. I think it is a disaster to project monetary policy in advance, and the IMF has been spreading that disaster. All those projections are based on assumptions about the rate of circulation of the money. From Friedman on down there is no expert who has invented a reliable method of guessing the rate of circulation of the money. There are a fantastic number of variables. We have been "turning over" the social product of the FRY with 60 million German marks [DM], while two years ago we did it with DM2.2 billion. To be sure, the economy almost died because of the rate of circulation. Before those monetary models were invented, the policy of the central banks, the Bank of England, for example, was to work with small foreign exchange reserves. Every noontime, the board of the central bank meets in London and decides what to do for the next three days about the movement of gold prices and commodity prices. After all, this is not the budget, which requires annual planning. It is disastrous to equate the budget, which has fixed obligations, with note-issue policy, which is not a fixed thing. At the same level of money, depending on the conditions, you can do twice as much at certain points as at some other points. I hope, for instance, that if we really restore confidence in the currency, we will have breathing room of one billion or two. For me, those numbers do not in and of themselves mean anything (I am speaking in rough terms, they do, of course, have significance for someone). But look at the American case: After all the disastrous mistakes of economic policy for 30 years, half of the dollars issued are sitting in foreign accounts, which means that the United States has two central banks. One is the Federal Reserve, and the other central bank consists of all the central banks in the world. It is much the same with Germany, whose currency comprises a fourth of world reserves. In such a situation, those countries have a dual financier. And what kind of "projections" are we talking about here? We are not, of course, either the United States or Germany, but if the world gains confidence that this country's leadership is not going to play with the money, that is, with the value of the currency, that is sufficient. We are not in a situation to be overly orthodox, because of employment of the labor force. Our immense plus is that it is objectively so cheap. So if we do not manage to stabilize the budget as well, at the same time achieving a high rate of growth, in spite of the sanctions, we will have to turn the country over to the Germans and the Koreans. They will stabilize it. [Boarov] Since the initiation of your program, there have been malicious comments to the effect that everything has become cheap except the government. Is our economy capable of supporting the planned 52-percent share of government expenditure in the social product? [Avramovic] You know, I do not like those percentages and do not use them. None of us knows what the social product of Yugoslavia is today. There is no figure on that in the first eight pages of the program. Nothing is known with confidence. We only know that those miserly $5 billion ($2.6 billion for the first six months) are the absolute minimum we could set for government expenditure. You cannot pay lower wages, lower pensions, you cannot pay the army more miserably than we are paying now. How the army is getting by with those $600-700 million, believe me, I fail to understand. Even if there are more policemen here or there, it is all being paid for cheaply. Our solution, our key, lies in reconstruction of the tax system. In the fiscal system we have now, there is an obstacle which, if I might so put it, I have not worked out intellectually. It is, after all, terribly illogical. The taxation of business firms in our country is not based on income, but on the firm's costs. Indeed mostly on the costs of labor, which in our country is a factor that exists in abundance. And because labor is the cheapest factor, instead of maximizing the use of labor, you multiply the price of labor by two because of taxes. So it is obvious, then, that there are problems; it is just not clear to me how this came about at all, because what is income to the worker is a cost to the firm. When wages are discussed, the battle is therefore not waged over those 35 dinars, because it is not 35, but 200 dinars. Much the same is true of cadastre income, which is really estimated at a low level, but it cannot be taxed in advance either. After all, when business firms and farmers begin to borrow money from the banks to pay their taxes, we are returning once again to inflationary financing. This must be changed, the tax cannot be paid out of goods that have been produced, but out of goods that have been sold. Business firms are still not paying taxes out of profit, but are borrowing in order to pay them. [Boarov] I am going back to the question of how to augment this unclear social product. [Avramovic] And I go back to that equilibrium of basic prices. If we find the point, the plateau, the brake (fren) between the price of labor, the price of credit, the price of government, the price of public services, and if we solve the problem of old foreign exchange savings, and if production does not start up under those conditions, then I do not know when it will. Even with the blockade. After all, our domestic needs are immense. Just one example--we have a million and a half automobiles. Half of them are worthless. That is a market to keep Zastava going for several years. And so on. Automobile production is a very important thing. Germany almost won World War II on the rise of the automobile industry. That industry has skilled workers, it has 1,500 engineers, that is not something to discard. People who talk about going back to a pastoral economy do not know what they are talking about. There is exaggeration in these outcries that the government should stimulate production. Do they mean that it should be buying goods? Before we advocate that the government should be ordering products to be produced, presumably there is something else that can be done with which your paper will surely agree. [Boarov] You talk about the space on the domestic market. What are your views on certain issues of a strategic nature, which, it is true, are not on the agenda at the moment? I am referring to tariff protection of the domestic market and foreign economic strategy (East and West). [Avramovic] As for our export policy, my view is real simple: Trade with the Devil himself if it pays. There are no ideological issues about going out into the world. The main thing is whether you are cheap and do you have adequate quality. On the import side, I favor protection. Not protection which will turn you into a sick man, not protection that would drive inputs of imported supplies for the economy way up, but protection. Of course, if something in the country cannot yield a profit of 10-15 percent, then it cannot be financed, there is no point in protecting it. In principle, if you have a good exchange rate and utilization of capacity, you can look at only two prices--the rate of foreign exchange and cost. If you have a hard stable currency, if you have cheap manpower, and even then you cannot produce--then get lost!
