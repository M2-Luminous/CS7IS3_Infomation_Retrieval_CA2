Wealthier people are more likely to have smoked cannabis or taken other drugs than those from the bottom end of earnings scale. The study, by academics from Sheffield University, found that two thirds of those questioned backed existing laws banning drugs, but the rest supported a limited form of legalising certain drugs on a controlled basis. Those from the higher social classes were more likely than other groups to favour decriminalising drugs. The survey, conducted among 5,000 people in Nottingham, Bradford, Lewisham, south London, and Glasgow, estimates that about one in five people in Britain has taken an illegal drug during his life, with much higher levels of drug-taking among people aged between 16 and 25. One in 15 had recently used an illegal drug. Between 14 and 24 per cent of people questioned admitted using an illegal drug at some time in their life and between 5 and 9 per cent confessed to recent usage. Among the 250 people aged between 16 and 25 who were surveyed, those who had taken drugs ranged from 32 per cent in Bradford to 52 per cent in Glasgow. Between 16 and 35 per cent admitted taking drugs within the past year. Its findings counter previous studies that have emphasised drug usage among lower economic groups, upon whom many government and local authority drug prevention initiatives are focused. The survey said: "With regard to lifetime drug usage, the wealthier respondents in the AB and CI socio-economic groups proved to the most prominent users. The most prevalent drug users in the general population are likely to be young, white males in those groups." Cannabis usage was found to be prominent among those from the higher echelons of society but the study revealed that in two sample areas--Lewisham and Nottingham--amphetamines, amylnitrate and magic mushrooms were also widely used. This trend was confirmed in other areas such as Glasgow and Bradford in West Yorkshire. While the upper and middle classes were prominent users of cannabis, the study found that heroin and crack were used more by the low-status groups, with injected drugs more common among the C2s and DEs. "The final picture, in terms of patterns of drug taking, is one in which, in these four cities, a substantial minority of young people made mostly occasional use of cannibis and, to a lesser extent, other drugs," the survey said. The study found that local availability of drugs was so good that any restriction on drug usage was governed by personal choice rather than controlling supplies. Most people said they had little difficulty obtaining drugs when they wanted. More men than women admitted to having ever taken a drug that was illegal, but the gap narrowed in the 16 to 25 age range with 45 per cent of men and 37 per cent of women admitting to having taken such drugs.
