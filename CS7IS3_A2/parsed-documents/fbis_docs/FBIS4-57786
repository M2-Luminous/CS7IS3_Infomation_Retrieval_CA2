My case is unique because I am attending the preparatory meeting, but another person will attend the summit. Ernesto Perez Balladares, who will be president then, will attend the summit in December. [Reporter] What is Panama concerned about specifically? [Endara] We are basically concerned about what concerns all Central Americans. We want to be treated equally, as friends of the United States. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] for example the pressures of international organizations on these countries. Do you think those pressures should not exist? [Endara] I think there should be equality. We should be given the same benefits given to Mexico, for example. That is what we think. [Reporter] The canal treaty with the United States concludes in 1999. Will it be renegotiated? [Endara] As far as I am concerned, from the start of my term I emphatically said there would not be a renegotiation. I think that the political position of Perez Balladares.... [pauses] I know he should be the one to express it, but in any case, I understand that his position is the same as mine on this topic. There will be no renegotiation, the canal treaty will be fulfilled, and at noon on 31 December 1999 the canal will be turned over to us. [Reporter] Southcom [U.S. Southern Command] continues in Panama? [Endara] Southcom continues in Panama, but I must say that next week I will attend a ceremony that I have never attended before. Military events are frequently held on the canal bases, and the only one I have agreed to attend is one next week during which the first brigade is pulling out of Panama for good. It is the first withdrawal of troops from Panama, and I will be very happy to attend this event because as a Panamanian it is a very important moment. [Reporter] What base [words indistinct]? [Endara] It is not a base. It is a brigade, an infantry brigade. [Reporter] Is Panama interested in joining Central America to be part of NAFTA? [Endara] I, President Endara, only have three months left in office, and I think this is how it should be. The best way for Panama to join NAFTA is through Central America. This is advisable for Panama and for the Central Americans. Unfortunately, I have heard a different opinion from my successor. I think President-elect Perez Balladares believes that, because Panama has had such an important bilateral relationship with the United States throughout its history, perhaps better results could be obtained individually. I think he is mistaken, but, in any case, he is the one who is going to be president of Panama. Let us hope he will change his opinion, because I think he is mistaken. [Reporter] Is your opinion, which is different from your successor, dangerous in Panama? [Endara] No, [laughs] I hope not. One of the greatest achievements of my administration is the establishment of full freedom of opinion in Panama. In Panama, there is full freedom. You should see what reporters say about me. They have every right, and I support them 100 percent. I think this situation is irreversible. No one can change that. Perez Balladares has promised to maintain the same situation. I will continue to give my opinion with full freedom, as all Panamanians do now and, I am sure, will continue to do so in the future. [Reporter] Are you going to bring up the canal issue with Vice President Gore? [Endara] I do not know whether we are going to have time to discuss bilateral topics. Above all, we are going to address multilateral topics. We have to study some recent remarks by President Clinton regarding the provisional organization that will exist in the canal until 2000, when the canal is turned over to us. I do not want to negotiate or discuss this at this time because President Clinton has just issued the statements. I have my foreign affairs advisory commission and the Panamanian representatives in the Canal Commission analyzing Clinton's opinion about the new organization of the canal until 2000. I do not want to issue an opinion until I receive proper advice on what position Panama should adopt. Panama's position has to be thoroughly studied. [Reporter] Who will guarantee the security of the canal after 2000, because there will be no gringos or Panama Defense Forces? [Endara] Look, the canal is defenseless. It is like a newborn baby. Any world power that wants to destroy it can do so even if the gringos and Russians are in the canal together. Therefore, the canal is defenseless. Now then, whatever must be defended in the canal can very well be protected by a police specialized in terrorist attacks. That is all that must be done. A police force can protect the canal perfectly well.
