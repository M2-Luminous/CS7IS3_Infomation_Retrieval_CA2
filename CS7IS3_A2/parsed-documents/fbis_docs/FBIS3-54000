Does he oppose the principle of peace, or just the proposed peace plans? [Habash] In fact, we oppose the current peace plan which is proposed by the U.S. Administration. Instead, we propose a peaceful solution to the Palestine question based on full compliance with UN resolutions. There is a difference between the letter and spirit of UN resolutions and the U.S. plan proposed to settle the Palestine question and the Arab-Israeli conflict. We want a peaceful solution to the conflict. Concerning our concept of this solution, we believe that it should pass through two stages; a stage at which this solution must be based on all UN resolutions, and at the same time, we want a strategic solution to this conflict. The strategic solution to the Palestine question is based on a democratic Palestine. This is the PFLP stand toward the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the Arab-Israeli conflict. [Badawi] What can you say about the self-rule plan and the agreement which was prepared in Oslo and signed in Washington? [Habash] We strongly resist this agreement, because it does not meet the minimum level of Palestinian demands. I do not want to talk about this plan's violation of the [PLO] Charter. Neither do I want to talk about the fact that this plan does not touch on the phased solution which is based on the self-determination, the state, and repatriation. However, I want to say that this plan, the Gaza-Jericho agreement leaves all major issues without a solution. The repatriation issue is left without a solution, the settlements issue, the Jerusalem issue, and borders are all left without a solution. The Gaza-Jericho agreement does not provide a solution for any of these issues. [Badawi] But, the text of the agreement leaves the definitive settlement of these points to future stages. Do you doubt the credibility of this agreement, or that it will be able to secure self-rule and later a state for the Palestinian people? [Habash] When this agreement postpones all these basic points to a future stage, who will decide the solution to all these issues? We say that the solution will be on the basis of the balance of powers. How can Yasir 'Arafat solve the question of Jerusalem, the question of settlements, and borders when he loses his principal weapons? The question of borders now represents a major problem. What will 'Arafat's stand be when he faces the question of settlements, when he has to tackle the issue of Jerusalem, and when he also has to tackle the question of self-determination and all the other basic issues for which the Palestinian people have struggled? [Badawi] Dr. Habash, is your participation in an expanded Palestinian front, which opposes the Oslo agreement, and which includes the Islamic movements, part of a short or long-term strategy ? [Habash] At present, there is a U.S. imperialist onslaught to settle the Palestinian cause and the Arab-Israeli conflict on the basis of the U.S. version. All forces should pool their efforts to confront this onslaught. This requires a long time. With respect to the confrontation of this onslaught, we support the establishment of a front which may last for a long time and whose objective is to defeat this onslaught. Thus, our alliance may be considered a tactical one if viewed from this angle, and if one views it from a strategic angle, meaning it seeks to confront this onslaught and triumph over it, then this needs much time. [Badawi] But all observers ask: What makes George Habash close to Hamas and the Islamic Jihad? [Habash] Our agreement with Hamas now is not based on ideological principles, it has political basis. Whether in Palestine or in the Arab world, we agree politically on fighting against this onslaught which is embodied by the American solution to the Middle East issue. This is the basis of our agreement with Hamas and all the other political Islamic factions which confront this onslaught. [Badawi] Dr. Habash, do you expect the recent Geneva summit between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad to have any effect on the opposition methods you adopt against the current settlement plan? [Habash] I do not think so. This is because our struggle in the PFLP, and this also applies to Hamas, is based on struggle inside the occupied territories. Concerning this issue, Syria still strongly supports the intifadah. Therefore, I do not believe that we are facing a great division between the Alliance of Palestinian Forces and Syria. Moreover, we must consider that despite the Geneva summit, Syria continues to demand the implementation of all UN resolutions, not only with respect to the Golan, but also with respect to Lebanon and the occupied territories, including Jerusalem. This means that this issue will be a long drawn out one, especially since we must take into consideration the intransigent Israeli attitude. What was Israel's attitude in light of the summit and its results? Israel's answer was to hold a referendum. To me this looks like an attempt to escape from the process on the Syrian front. [Badawi] But are you not worried about the return of Syria and Lebanon to the negotiating table following a freeze of several months in the bilateral talks? Doesn't this reinvolve you in political isolation? [Habash] No. There were negotiations while we were in Syria and there has been an implicit alliance between us and Syria since the Madrid conference, taking into consideration that it is an indication of this process. [sentence as heard] Despite this, there has been a kind of alliance between us and Syria. [sentence as heard] [Badawi] Dr. Habash, on what are you counting to tip the future equation in your favor in and outside the territories? [Habash] We primarily depend on two basic factors: The first is an objective one; our understanding of the Zionist scheme. The Zionist scheme fully conflicts with the basic concepts of our Palestinian and Arab national rights. This is the first factor. The other factor on which we depend is our masses, our Palestinian and Arab masses. These masses will never accept the hegemony of the Zionist onslaught and its designs, and the attainment of its objectives in this manner. From this premise, we feel that no matter what the obstacles and the difficulties, and the Palestinian or Arab defeatist stands, our Palestinian and Arab masses will ultimately triumph over this scheme, the scheme of injustice and aggression that the Zionist authorities represent. [Badawi] Dr. Habash, my last question: If the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho takes place in April, will George Habash go back to the occupied territories? [Habash] I will return in one instance. I will return when I return with my people. It is inconceivable for me to isolate myself from my people. Thus, if an agreement takes place--and the issue of the withdrawal is far-fetched because there will be no withdrawal, only redeployment--even if this redeployment takes place, we will pursue our struggle on the basis of freedom and independence, on the basis of the national program, the program consisting of repatriation, self-determination, and the establishment of the Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
