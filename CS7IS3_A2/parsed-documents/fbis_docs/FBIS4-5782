Qian made the remark in an interview with the newspapers's publisher, Kato Kiichiro, at the official Chinese guest house in Beijing. Qian also said it is understandable that Pyongyang rejected a UN Security Council presidential statement because North Korea opposes the council taking up the nuclear matter. The presidential statement, adopted unanimously by the council, urges North Korea to allow outside inspections of its nuclear facilities. The North Korean nuclear impasse, nevertheless, is "moving in the right direction bit by bit," Qian was quoted as saying. He said China favors talks through three channels -- between North Korea and the United States, between North and South Korea and between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Qian said China pushed the Security Council president's statement, which has no binding power, since it is against the United Nations handling the issue. Asked whether North Korea had nuclear bombs, Qian said he could not be sure. This seemed to indicate a slight change in China's previous position that North Korea has neither the intention nor the ability to develop nuclear weapons, the TOKYO SHIMBUN reported.
