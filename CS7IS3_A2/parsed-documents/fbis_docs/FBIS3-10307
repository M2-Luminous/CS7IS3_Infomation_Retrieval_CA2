Cuba Vision Network at 0100 GMT on 26 February reports that the Baracoa Cacao Experimental Station has produced 2.5 million hybrid cacao seeds over the past 3 years -- a feat that has positive effects on Cuba's cacao situation. The seeds were planted on 62 caballerias in Guantanamo and on smaller areas in Santiago de Cuba, Holguin, and Granma Provinces. The station's goal this year is to produce over 1 million such seeds. By using these seeds, it is possible to have plants in 4 months, as opposed to 1 year using another method, and the resulting plants are much more productive, with higher yields and greater resistance to diseases and pests. Some of the hybrid seeds that will be produced by the experimental station this year will be distributed to other provinces; in Guantanamo, they will be used to plant 17 caballerias, replant another 79, and supply a portion of the seedlings that will be necessary the following year. Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 28 February reports that "the first Cuban firm to specialize in tourism by road has just made its official debut in Havana Province, under the name Tropitur." The firm began operations on 16 October 1993 and intends, in a first phase, to provide cafeteria and bar service and sell flowers and souvenirs on two roads frequently traveled by foreign tourists, the national highway and the Via Blanca, which link important tourist hubs. Tropitur has four units: El Cayuelo and Habana-Club in Santa Cruz del Norte, the Los Morales farm in Nueva Paz, and the (Copei) in Madruga. Radio Reloj at 1509 GMT on 28 February reports that the nation's 1993 laboratory animal needs were fully met by the National Center for the Production of Laboratory Animals, located in Havana. Millions of dollars worth of imports were thus avoided. "Because of the center's high productivity and quality, it was also possible to export a number of animals to Latin America, as well as to make all the concentrated feed for the animals." Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 1 March reports that the sale of construction materials such as cement, ceramics, and marble brought in $14 million in 1993; in this connection, the Transportation Ministry made $3.5 million in transportation fees. In the same newscast, Rebelde notes that Cubana de Aviacion has received the first two of eight 44-passenger Dutch Fokker planes Cuba has purchased from the Spanish company Aviaco. Rebelde adds that Cuba's largest bicycle factory, currently under construction in Santa Clara with PRC cooperation, will begin operating in the second half of 1994. Half the factory equipment is in Cuba, the remainder in the port of Shanghai awaiting shipment. The factory will produce 150,000 bicycles a year. Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 2 March reports that Orlando Lugo Fonte, president of the National Association of Small Farmers, ANAP, has stated in Havana that during 1993 approximately 2,000 people joined agricultural-livestock cooperatives. This brings the number of people working in cooperatives to 62,000 nationwide. Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 2 March reports that El Cobre mine workers plan to produce 1,300 tons of copper concentrate, approximately 7 percent over 1993. The mine complex is undergoing renovation and technological updating, and this is already contributing to increased efficiency. Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 4 March reports that the Luxembourg Government today donated 18 tons of nails and 1,000 hammers to the victims of the heavy rains that affected the eastern provinces. The Luxembourg envoy to Havana handed over the donation to Carlos Morales, representative of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation. This is the result of the UN humanitarian aid program, which submitted the request to the Luxembourg Government. Luxembourg also donated medicines worth $68,000 for the Calixto Garcia and the Pediatric Hospitals in Havana.
