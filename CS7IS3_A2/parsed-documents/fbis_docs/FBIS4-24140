Taking into consideration the important role of the South African National Defence Force and the challenges it faces with regard to the vital process of integrating the different armed forces, the request was acceded to. I am therefore pleased to announce the decision to appoint Ronald Kasrils as deputy minister of defence for the Republic of South Africa. Mr Kasrils has acquired experience in military affairs as a leading officer of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing]. His experience, expertise and skills enabled him to play an important role in the defence sub-council of the Transitional Executive Council. I am confident that he will do the same in his new role as deputy minister of defence. [Signed] Nelson Mandela President
