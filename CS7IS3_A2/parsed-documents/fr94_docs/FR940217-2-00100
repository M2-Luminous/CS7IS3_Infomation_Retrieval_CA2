FR940217-2-00100 FR940217-2-00059 Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration [Prohibited Transaction Exemption 94&hyph;20; Application Number D&hyph;5700] Class Exemption Relating to Certain Employee Benefit Plan Foreign Exchange Transactions AGENCY: Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Labor. ACTION: Grant of Class Exemption. SUMMARY: This document contains a final exemption from certain prohibited transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and from certain taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code). The class exemption permits the purchase and sale of foreign currencies between an employee benefit plan and a bank or a broker-dealer or an affiliate thereof which is a party in interest with respect to such plan. The exemption affects participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plans involved in such transactions, as well as banks and broker-dealers and their affiliates which act as dealers in foreign exchange. EFFECTIVE DATE: Section I(a) of PTE 94&hyph;20 is effective for transactions occurring from January 1, 1975 to June 18, 1991. Section I(b) of PTE 94&hyph;20 is effective for transactions occurring on or after June 18, 1991. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Lyssa Hall, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Office of Exemption Determinations, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210, (202) 219&hyph;8971 (not a toll-free number) or Susan Rees, Plan Benefits Security Division, Office of the Solicitor, (202) 219&hyph;9141 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Exemptive relief for the transactions described herein, as well as for other transactions not covered by the proposed exemption, was requested in an application dated July 18, 1984 (Application No. D&hyph;5700) submitted by the American Bankers Association (ABA) pursuant to section 408(a) of ERISA and in accordance with the procedures set forth in ERISA Procedure 75&hyph;1 (40 FR 18471, April 28, 1975). In a letter to the ABA dated December 28, 1984, the Department of Labor (the Department) tentatively denied the application. By letter dated June 21, 1985, the ABA modified its application in response to the Department's tentative denial, explaining that it was no longer seeking exemptive relief for foreign exchange transactions between banks and plans where the banks or their affiliates have investment management discretion over the plan assets involved in the transactions. On September 15, 1986, the Department published a notice in the Federal Register (51 FR 32695), requesting additional information from the public on various issues being considered by the Department in deciding whether to propose a foreign exchange class exemption in response to the ABA application. The comment period ended on February 24, 1987. Seventeen substantive responses to the solicitation of comments were received. 1 1 For a discussion of those comments, see the proposed exemption at 56 FR 11761 (March 20, 1991). On March 20, 1991, the Department published a notice in the Federal Register (56 FR 11757) of the pendency of a proposed class exemption from the restrictions of section 406(a)(1) (A) through (D) of the Act and from the taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of certain transactions described in section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code. The notice of pendency invited all interested persons to submit written comments concerning the proposed class exemption by May 20, 1991. The Department received nine public comments requesting, among other things, that the Department broaden the scope of the exemption to provide relief for transactions entered into pursuant to standing instructions. In view of those comments, the Department published a notice of public hearing in the Federal Register (56 FR 46806 (September 16, 1991)). The hearing was held on October 3, 1991. Upon consideration of all of the comments received and testimony offered at the public hearing, the Department has determined to grant the proposed class exemption, subject to certain modifications. These modifications and the major comments are discussed below.
