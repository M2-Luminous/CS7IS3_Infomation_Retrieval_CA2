A large number of peasants are conducting spring plowing in the vast areas of farmland in Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces. Even though it rained often and has been cold since the beginning of spring, peasants in south Guangdong still adhered to their farming timetable; carried out spring plowing; turned the soil and harrowed the land; and transplanted rice and sugar cane seedlings. According to the Agriculture Ministry's statistics, as of early March, Guangdong has completely sown 860,000 mu of paddy rice fields, or 57 percent of the total sowing area. Such progress was faster than in 1993. Guangdong has improved 6.3 million mu of farmland, or a third of the total acreage of farmland to be improved. Guangdong has planted 8.31 million mu of land with spring crops including sugar cane, groundnuts, and vegetables, including 2.9 million mu of sugar cane, or 70 percent of the planned target. It has been learned that various localities in Guangdong will pay attention to checking wasteland and multiple plowing tasks in an effort to ensure the implementation of grain planting plans. Many cities and counties will also try in every possible way to increase investments in the agricultural sector.
