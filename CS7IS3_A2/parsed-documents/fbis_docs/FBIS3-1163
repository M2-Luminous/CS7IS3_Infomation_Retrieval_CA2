The ultra right-wing organisation was reacting to the mandatory leave imposed on Generals Basie Smit, Krappies Engelbrecht and Johan le Roux, who had been implicated in a Goldstone Commission report of "third force" activities. In a statement, AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche said: (Mr Justice) Goldstone, that Boere-hater and African National Congress apologist has now, without corroborating evidence, used an anonymous, paid informant to throw our senior police generals to the communist wolves." Mr Terreblanche pledged his organisation's support to the police force and said his whole force would be made available to them to ensure that the country could be a peaceful home to "our children". "These generals and their troops, who have under life-threatening circumstances dedicated their lives to maintain law and order, are now being offered by (Mr Justice) Goldstone and Mr F W) de Klerk as criminals to the communist anarchists. "This is typical of the new approach that murderers, rapists, anarchists and other communist criminals have become heroes, while the police is being presented as thugs. How can any police force function if its own government turns against them?" Mr Terreblanche accused the government of having handed Bophuthatswana over to communist anarchists in the "most treacherous and cunning" manner, adding that it had now seemingly become kwaZulu's turn to be sacrificed.
