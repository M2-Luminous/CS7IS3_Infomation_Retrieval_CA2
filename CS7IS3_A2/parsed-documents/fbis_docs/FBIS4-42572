P. Dhimas from Washington] [Text] Speaking to ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Stephen Oxman, assistant secretary of state for European affairs, tried to play down the impression created last week from the statement made by U.S. State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry that Greek accusations for "systematic" pursuits against the Greek minority by the Albanian Government are "unfounded." According to Oxman, McCurry's statement, which led to two successive demarches to the State Department, was misinterpreted. He said: "The remarks were taken out of context." [previous seven words published in English] Actually, the more conclusive State Department statement notes: "Although it does not seem that the Albanian Government's policy is to suppress the Greek minority," concerns are being expressed about the situation that prevails on educational issues and other isolated incidents. Oxman, however, believes the state of human rights in Albania is an issue "that must be examined very seriously." As he told ELEVTHEROTIPIA, the U.S. Government "is in contact with the Albanian Government about the issues that Greece has raised." He said: "These issues must be examined seriously." It must be noted that according to Oxman, international human rights organizations made the evaluation that "they do not see any systematic violations" of the Greek minority's rights, thus indirectly justifying the U.S. position on this specific point. Oxman referred to two basic problems of the Greek minority, "the teaching of the Greek language outside the minority zones and the return of the church's property." Commenting on these issues, the U.S. official said Washington has taken relevant steps, conveying the Greek concerns to the Albanian authorities. The U.S. official said he "hopes" the two countries will overcome their bilateral problems and continue their "course," which was "cut off after the 10 April incident" with the murder of Albanian soldiers and the arrest of Greek Albanians, to improve their relations. Obviously, the United States is aware of the violations of the Greek minority's human rights, but based on the evidence available does not consider them as "systematic and the basis of an official policy." According to reports, the United States has asked the Greek side, other factors, and organizations, for additional information to reinforce the Greek claims.
