The Monday issue of the newspaper AL-MU'TAMAR, citing Iraqi opposition sources, adds that approximately 1,250 citizens have arrived at the Iranian borders in extremely bad condition after having escaped death from Saddam Husayn's attack on the southern marshes. The same sources add that the fleeing citizens include hundreds of children and elderly people. Some of the displaced persons perished during the journey to the Iranian border after being hit with large-caliber artillery shells that followed them. The paper adds that the number of casualties is not known, but eyewitnesses among the displaced persons have stated that during their journey they saw many scorched and torn bodies of defenseless inhabitants of the marshes.
