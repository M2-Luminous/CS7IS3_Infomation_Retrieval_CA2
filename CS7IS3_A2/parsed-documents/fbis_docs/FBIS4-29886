The top Japanese business lobby has prepared the report for presentation to the Finance Ministry, the Science and Technology Agency and other government departments, the officials said. The government should increase its annual space budget 2.5-fold to 500 billion yen and appropriate part of the budget from the public works investment program, the report says. Specifically, the report calls for the development of spacecraft for technical tests and a satellite-based earth observation system under the budget. It says science and technology for space exploration is essential for development of a wide range of industrial technology and useful as a bargaining chip in negotiating the introduction of foreign technology.
