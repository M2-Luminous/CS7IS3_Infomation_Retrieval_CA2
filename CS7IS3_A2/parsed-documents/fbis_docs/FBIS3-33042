The idea is to implement it once the Real Value Unit [URV] is transformed into currency. This will only occur if the government can substantially reduce inflation. The goal of the new plan is to implement an income distribution policy during President Franco's term in office. The economic team's main concern expressed during a meeting on 12 February was to ensure that none of the proposed measures modify the current income distribution. For the time being, the economic team does not want to touch anyone's money. Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso wants it clearly understood that the income policy has been left for another stage of the plan, thus avoiding the difficulties that made previous plans fail. The creation of the URV will not mean the workers will have more money in their pockets. The economic team does not want consumption to grow as this may entail problems of speculation with stocks and shortages. If the workers do not have more money at their disposal, they will not lose it either. That is why, at the 12 February meeting, the economic team once again discussed the need to end excessive price hikes and anticipated mark-ups that have taken place in the last few months in some sectors. The economic team believe by acting in this way they will give credibility to the economic program. Following the institution of the URV as currency -- which will take place during the first half of this year -- the problem will be preventing its "contamination" by the inflationary process occurring in real cruzeiros. Once this is achieved, the new program will speedily be implemented. The centerpiece of this new program is, for the time being, a mandatory profit-sharing scheme. Profit-sharing is contemplated in the Constitution and has already been implemented by many companies, especially the multinationals, and this may facilitate its acceptance by more conservative businessmen. Brazil has one of the highest income concentration ratios. It has always been President Franco's objective to correct this distortion and he has repeatedly said so to the economic team. Franco believes the new economic program is of paramount importance and must be implemented soon so that it can yield results during his administration.
