There follows the text of the statement: ``The EU Commission has decided to take the Greek embargo against the Republic of Macedonia to the European Court of Justice. ``On this occasion, I would once again like to reassert the constant course and interest of the Republic of Macedonia to achieve an overall development of relations and cooperation with the neighboring Republic of Greece. We therefore firmly believe that the lifting of the embargo against our country by the Republic of Greece would represent a substantial step toward the renewal of negotiations between our two countries, and an important contribution to the stability of the region in which we live. ``The lifting of the embargo would normalize the situation on the Macedonian-Greek border regarding the free flow of people and goods, which is of mutual benefit for both countries, for their economies and citizens. ``As a measure, the lifting of the embargo would have a significant impact on the intensification of mutual confidence and good will for the continuation of the Macedonian-Greek negotiations within the framework of the United Nations. ``We reiterate our commitment to continue the dialogue, on an equal basis, about mutual relations in disagreement, including the ones pointed out by the EU Commission of 6 April this year. We are convinced that only negotiations in good will and with mutual respect can lead to appropriate and mutually acceptable solutions for all questions. ``Therefore, we firmly believe that the lifting of the embargo is essential for the benefit of both countries and for stability in the region. Ultimately, bearing in mind the serious nature of these issues and our responsibility for our respective countries, we are called upon to do our best in a principled way and on an equal basis, to achieve normalization in our mutual relations, to intensify peace and stability in the Balkans.''
