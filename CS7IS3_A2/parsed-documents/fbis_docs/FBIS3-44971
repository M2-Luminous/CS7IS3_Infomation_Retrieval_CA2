The conferees held: Strict administration of justice by the people's courts has a direct bearing on the normal operation of a socialist market economic system and the stability of market economic order; as well as the dignity and integrity of the socialist legal system and the image of the party and the government. Therefore, it is a sacred duty of the people's courts to strictly administer justice. Courts at various levels must regard strict enforcement of law and improved quality of justice as a task of primary importance, and make relentless efforts to carry out this task. Ren Jianxin, member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and president of the Supreme People's Court, spoke at the conference. He said: To ensure strict administration of justice, courts at all levels must emancipate minds, seek truth from facts, make active exploration, be bold in practice, and further strengthen reform and construction of courts ideologically, organizationally, institutionally, and in their style of work so as to constantly perfect the socialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics. He demanded that courts persist in exercising their judicial functions independently and under the party's leadership, do things strictly according to the law, and resolutely correct failure to abide by the law, lax law enforcement, and letting law-breakers go free, so as to safeguard the unification of the socialist legal system. Meanwhile, it is necessary to train a contingent of court personnel who have a strong political orientation, professional competence, and solid style of work, and who are honest in performing official duties, and strict in administering justice. According to briefings, interference from local and departmental protectionism have affected the strict enforcement of law in the trial of a few cases by the people's courts in some localities, thus preventing the courts from bringing into full play their judicial functions, and undermining the dignity and integrity of the legal system. The conferees called for upholding the principle of open trial to effectively guarantee the right of litigants to file law suits. It is necessary to conduct open investigation, cross-examination, debate, and trial to place the entire judicial process under the supervision of the people. The conferees held: The strengthening of judicial supervision and enforcement of judicial discipline is an important means to guarantee strict administration of justice. Courts at all levels must further study and trial-implement a system of investigating wronged cases. Personnel liable for wrongdoings in handling cases must be affixed with administrative and legal responsibilities. Courts at the upper level must strengthen supervision over the judicial work of courts at the lower level, and must resolutely correct errors and unfair verdicts in law enforcement.
