At a joint press conference after the meeting, both leaders stressed that it was constructive and frank and voiced the hope that the first official visit to Spain by the president of Kazakhstan and the documents signed in Madrid will promote the development of ties between the two states in a wide variety of spheres. Replying to journalists' questions, Felipe Gonzalez noted the great potential for mutually beneficial cooperation with Kazakhstan in political, economic, cultural, and other spheres and also within the framework of international forums and organizations. Nursultan Nazarbayev spoke at the press conference about the economic reforms being implemented in the republic, the strengthening of democratic processes, and the activity of the CIS. Because of the forthcoming official visit by the president of Kazakhstan to Moscow, he had to answer many questions from journalists regarding present and future relations with Russia. Nursultan Nazarbayev said that Kazakhstan has had common bonds with the Russian people for over 200 years. Our policy is aimed at ensuring the very best relations with our large northern neighbor. We have a Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance that is the basis of stable relations between two neighboring friendly states. What is happening in Russia now, the president went on, is happening throughout the CIS. So it is the desire of the presidents of the countries of the Commonwealth for the transition from one condition to another and the reforms being implemented to be evolutionary and to prevent major interstate or other conflicts. The main thing now is to tackle the economy. Right from the start I have called for integration because I am well aware how a single economy functioned in the state that was the USSR, when some were suppliers of raw materials and others were consumers. This market remains the main market for us today. The euphoria of the initial years after independence is already passing. However, I said back in 1991 that sovereignty alone would not fill stomachs. But everyone thought that they would start selling their goods to the West. However the Western market was already full and only we needed those goods. So, the president said, Kazakhstan drew up the plan for the economic union and it was adopted in September. Unfortunately, the different approaches of different states is so far preventing this plan from being implemented in practice. If the economic union is to work, we will have to conclude a monetary union and a customs union and coordinate foreign economic policy at least on the export of raw materials, as well as create a common parliament to bring our legislation into line. In other words, we need to do what Western Europe has been doing for 30 years. Bearing in mind our considerable experience of living together, we could reach this more rapidly. Like all of us, Russia is now experiencing a difficult time in its history. The hopes of Kazakhstan and the hopes of the West should be linked primarily with the continuation of the process of democratization and socioeconomic reforms. All Russia's neighbors will benefit from the continuation of this path. I am confident, the president of Kazakhstan concluded, that no one will succeed in turning back the common trend towards progress.
