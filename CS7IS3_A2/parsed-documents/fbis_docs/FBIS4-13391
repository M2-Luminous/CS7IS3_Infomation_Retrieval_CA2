The ceremony, which was held at the Rawdat al-Shahidayn School, was attended by Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah, Deputies Muhammad Yaghi and Muhammad Barjawi, Dean of Sciences College Dr. Muhsin Jabir, and a number of Hizballah and Islamic resistance officials. Yusuf Nur-al-Din, current director general of the Voice of Light, delivered a speech in which he underlined the feats of the late director general. He criticized the cabinet's decision to ban the broadcast of newscasts and political programs. [passage omitted] Hasan Nasrallah said that the Voice of Light is not a militia radio, it is the voice of the honorable resistance. This radio has never been a tool to sow sectarian sedition. It is the voice of national unity, amity, and knowledge. He added: We regret that on this anniversary we have to mourn the loss of part of the freedoms in this country. The Voice of Light could be silenced for some time but it will certainly come back. This kind of voice can never be silenced, and nobody can silence the voice of right and justice. What we have heard so far of claims and pretexts concerning the procedures against the audio and visual media are not convincing. If the Lebanese authority had enough courage to dissolve the Lebanese Forces-Israeli party, it can silence the voices that are considered Israel's tools. The Hizballah secretary general said that the deliberations that took place during the recent cabinet's session were theatrical, stressing that such maneuvers could possibly be made in other countries but here it is difficult to fool anyone. Nasrallah urged the Lebanese to adopt a unified stance to curb this threat and to advise the authorities that the Lebanese people cannot accept such procedures that could harm peace.
