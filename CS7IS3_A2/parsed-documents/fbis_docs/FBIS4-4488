Pak Hung-tal who came over to the North last year said the people in the North now enjoy a happy life as the dear leader Kim Chong-il has brought the peculiar Korean-style socialist system into bloom and shapes good politics centred on the masses. He said: "By availing themselves of the setback of socialism in some countries, the imperialists and the South Korean puppets are resorting to every conceivable plot against the North, crying about the 'nuclear suspicion' and 'international cooperation system' in a bid to isolate and stifle the North. This is a daydream of fools. "No force on earth can match the invincible might of the singlehearted unity of the North which is making headway under the banner of socialism, firmly rallied behind dear General Kim Chong- il." Noting that dear General Kim Chong-il is the destiny and future of the Korean nation, a defector So Tok-su said: "Socialism of the North where the entire people are vigorously pushing forward the socialist construction, closely rallied behind the dear leader, is invincible, and it is exerting a great influence upon the world people. "Our dear leader Kim Chong-il who is steadily glorifying the people-centred socialism built in the North and wisely leading the struggle for the victory of socialism worldwide, is the great of great produced by heaven." Cho Won-taek who came over to the North with his whole family had this to say: "The dear leader, last year, resolutely smashed challenges of the enemy with his iron will and matchless grit, saving the nation's destiny and powerfully demonstrating the might of our republic to the whole world. "People in the South ardently long for the socialist system in the North where the nation's dignity and soul are exalted, and heartily wish to live under the system. "National reunification must be realized according to the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation at an early date so that the people in the South, too, may live in happiness under the loving care of the dear leader."
