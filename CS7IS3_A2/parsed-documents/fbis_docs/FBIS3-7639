In an interview with REUTER, Ambassador Kim insisted that the best way to resolve the nuclear issue is to hold high-level talks between North Korea and the United States. The third round of U.S.-North Korean talks was supposed to be held in Geneva last week but was canceled because North Korea did not allow the International Atomic Energy Agency inspection team to conduct an overall inspection of major nuclear facilities in Yongbyon.
