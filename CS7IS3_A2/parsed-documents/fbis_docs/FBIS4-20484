Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the length of the cloned fragment was 604 base pairs (bp) and the fragment contained a single open reading frame. It also revealed that the gene had its own promoter because it had typical ribosome-binding site (rbs), -10 and -35 promoter sequences. The amino acid sequence of CS3 deduced from the nucleotide sequence was composed of 168 amino acids. The first 15 amino acids were considered to be the possible signal peptide of the CS3 protein. Such protein was very hydrophobic because 46.5 percent amino acids of it were hydrophobic. Like CFA/I, CS1 and K88ab fimbriae, CS3 protein did not contain Cys residues. These results suggest that CS3 subunits are held together mainly by hydrophobic interaction. In situ hybridization test demonstrated that there were no homologous sequences between the gene of CS3 and the genes of CFA/I, CS4 and CS6.
