Deryabin begins his report by noting that a group of scientists from the central specialized design center and from the Progress works in Samara have been awarded Russian state prizes for creating a unique space station which, he says, is a state secret. "The new satellite is a state secret and we are unable to show you even a mock-up of it. Let us just say," he goes on, "that the wide-angle photographic equipment installed on board makes it possible to carry out observations of the Earth's surface with maximal precision. Designers joke that they will even be able to spot a matchbox," Deryabin says, adding that 150 discoveries and inventions were registered in the course of the design work. Deryabin then interviews V.M. Saygak, deputy chief designer of the central specialized design center, who says that the Russian Space Agency has now instructed the center to "conclude a contract to make use of this complex facility to serve the needs of the national economy." Deryabin concludes his report by saying that the facility is capable of cultivating crystals of especial purity while in orbit. The crystals could then be regularly delivered to Earth without any intervention by man. The video shows the design center and mockups of some equipment.
