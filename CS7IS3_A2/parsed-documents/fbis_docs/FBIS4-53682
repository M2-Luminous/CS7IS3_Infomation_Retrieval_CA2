FBIS4-53682 "dreas099_a_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-099 Daily Report 22 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Reactor Reaches `Critical' Stage Reactor Reaches `Critical' Stage OW2205052494 Tokyo KYODO in English 0459 GMT 22 May 94 OW2205052494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Fukui, May 22 KYODO -- Japan's new plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactor "Monju" on the Sea of Japan coast went "critical" through its entire core at 12:43 a.m. Sunday [22 May], the governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. said. Criticality is the point at which the neutrons produced in the fission process are sufficient to sustain a chain reaction without outside stimulus. The loading of Monju with fuel was completed Friday, when the last of the 198 fuel assemblies was installed in the core. Since then, the government agency has been gradually removing the neutron-absorbing control rods allowing the reactor to reach full criticality. The fast breeder reactor in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, reached criticality for the first time April 5, with 168 fuel assemblies installed. The reactor, which is fueled by a mixture of plutonium oxide and uranium oxide, is believed to have the potential to use fuel 60 times more efficiently than conventional uranium reactors. The 280,000-kilowatt prototype reactor will undergo further tests in this chain reaction stage before its output will gradually be increased in February next year. The 600 billion yen plant is scheduled to go on line generating electricity from April 1995 and become a commercially operating supplier by December the same year.
