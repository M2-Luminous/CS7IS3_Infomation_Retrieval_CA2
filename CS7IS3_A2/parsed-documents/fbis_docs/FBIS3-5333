"This could be a factor which softens the recent stiff bilateral relations (between Japan and the United States), and it's a stabilizing factor for the world economy," the source said. The labor department reported the U.S. jobless rate fell to 6.5 percent in February from 6.7 percent in January, with nonfarm payrolls growing by 217,000. The central bank source said the February increase in nonfarm payrolls was larger than expected despite cold weather for that month. "This points to a recovery of the U.S. economy and an increase in competitiveness in the U.S. Manufacturing sector," he said. He did not elaborate.
