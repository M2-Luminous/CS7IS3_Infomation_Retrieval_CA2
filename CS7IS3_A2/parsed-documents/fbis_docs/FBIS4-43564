You returned less than an hour ago from Africa. Can you tell us whether you think the United Nations Security Council will vote on Tuesday [21 June]? [Juppe] [break in transmission]...oppose such an initiative. I am confident about the first stage in establishing this difficult and dangerous operation. [Chazal] In any case, France cannot go it alone? [Juppe] To stress the humanitarian and international nature of this operation we hope to go in with others. You were saying that I have just come back from Africa: I visited Cote d'Ivoire and then Senegal. Senegalese President Diouf confirmed that he was ready to establish a contingent of Senegalese troops alongside the French ones. The unanimous reaction among African countries--I managed to see all our ambassadors in the region--is favorable. We are finding support on that principle among European countries. I hope that in the next few days we will manage to convince our partners to join with us. [Chazal] Could France go in even if no other European or western country went in with her? [Juppe] We hope that other European countries will come with us. Italy has said that it will put itself at our disposal. In the next few hours or days we shall exercise our diplomatic activity to try to convince those who recognize that something has to be done--the pictures we have just seen demonstrate this--and that France, of course, cannot do everything by itself. [Chazal] Concretely, once the decision has been taken, how long will it take to send the troops, and how many men can be sent there? [Juppe] I am sure you will understand that I will not give you details of a number of issues: how many men, or what the procedures will be, for an operation which, even its aim is exclusively humanitarian, is an operation which is putting soldiers' lives at risk. A certain amount of discretion is needed. So all this will be arranged if the resolution is passed on 21 June, or 22 June at the latest, and if we manage to get our various partners to move, I think things can move very fast, sometime next week. I would like to stress that we are making a lot of effort to convince the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] that the operation is not directed against them. This week we shall have contacts with the Rwandan prime minister appointed by the Arusha accords, in other words the one recognized by everyone. We also have contacts on the ground--the person we have just seen, Mr. Larome--who heads the crisis unit of the Foreign Ministry, is on the ground, to try to get our humanitarian aid through. We shall also have contacts in New York, and again in Paris, with RPF officials. [Chazal] If France sends soldiers to Rwanda, those troops will likely have a difficult mission. The rebels on the ground are hostile to the arrival of French troops. They accuse France of having helped the regime of President Habyarimana--who was assassinated on 6 April--for four years. [passage omitted] [Chazal] Mr. Juppe, it is true that this mission appears particularly difficult in this context. [Juppe] It is difficult, but I am astonished to see the number of lies you can read in the press about what has happened over the past few years. France is blamed for having supported President Habyarimana, as if he were responsible for what is happening today. I would like to remind you of a simple fact: he is dead. He was assassinated. Now we have the extremists, whom he was actually holding back, and on whom he had managed to impose the Arusha accord of July 1993--which was welcomed by everyone as an accord for reconciliation including by the RPF; it was thanks to him that this was done. I think that this way of assuming the worst about France, accusing it of being responsible, directly or indirectly, for what is happening, is intolerable, and has nothing to do with reality. [Chazal] Is it too late to intervene now, several months after the beginning of this terrible crisis? Could we have done it earlier, or have demanded this intervention before? [Juppe] First of all, throughout 1993, as I have just said, we gradually brought about the reconciliation process of July 1993. Then there were French troops preparing for the arrival of the RPF in Kigali to join the government--this has been forgotten. This all seemed to be working. Reconciliation was under way, power was being shared out. This assassination happened about two months ago and threw everything into turmoil. We reacted immediately with humanitarian aid, trying to get a cease-fire brought about by the major states of the region, and asking the United Nations to bring a force of 5,500 men. What did we see? That nothing happened. That the cease-fire was not respected, that the UN force was not coming. It was at that point that we said to ourselves: We can't go on waiting for these decisions to be implemented, France must set an example. People are saying it is too late. Who has done it before us? Who today is claiming to move faster than us? Not many people in the international arena.
