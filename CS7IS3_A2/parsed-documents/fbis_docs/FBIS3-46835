FBIS3-46835 "dreas004__a94013" FBIS-EAS-94-004-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX Japan DA Decides To Appoint Makoto Sakuma as Adviser OW0401141594 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 29 Dec 93 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0401141594 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Defense Agency [DA] decided on 28 December to appoint Makoto Sakuma, former chairman of the DA Joint Staff Council, as the agency's adviser effective 1 January. Sakuma will be the third man to fill this position, succeeding Haruo Natsume and Seiki Nishihiro, both of whom also formerly served as administrative vice minister of the DA. Sakuma will also be the first person from among uniformed DA officials to become DA adviser. Sakuma, who was among the first group of persons to graduate from the National Defense Academy, has served as chief of staff of the Maritime Self-Defense Force and as chairman of the Joint Staff Council. He retired in July 1993. In the DA, voices have been raised for some time strongly urging that advisers be chosen from among not only civilian officials but also from among uniformed officials. Sakuma has been chosen apparently in consideration of balancing the appointment of civilian and uniformed officials. Moreover, because active debate within the government is expected next year over how Japan's national defense program should proceed, including a reexamination of the "National Defense Program Outline," one senior DA official has stated, "We hope that Mr. Sakuma will make good use of his past experience as a top uniformed official in charge of managing national defense."
