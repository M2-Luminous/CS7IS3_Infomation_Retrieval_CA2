According to the ODA Political Board, it is a tragic error to assume that, when diplomatic means become exhausted, it is wrong to resort to the use of force. "This is the moment that has now come in the former Yugoslavia, and especially in Bosnia. We demand that our country support NATO's decision on vigorous military intervention in this area," says a statement issued by the ODA Political Board. ODA Chairman and Deputy Prime Minister Jan Kalvoda energetically raised their objections to Vaclav Klaus's statement of Wednesday [9 February]: "I am surprised by the information that the government is opposed to air strikes. If such a statement was made, I have to say that the government did discuss the issue, but without adopting any resolution." In an interview for CESKY DENIK, KDS Chairman Ivan Pilip also reacted to yesterday's statement of Vaclav Klaus: "We all saw the Sarajevo marketplace. What is happening there is very unfair." [allusion to Klaus's remark that air strikes against Bosnian Serbs would be "unfair"] For two reasons, his party advocates intervention in former Yugoslavia. "First, from the viewpoint of political morality. The world is globally interlinked, which is particularly true of Europe. The world made a mistake by addressing this problem by means of indecisive wavering and resolutions. This approach has evidently contributed a great deal to the situation being the way it is now." Citing the second reason, Ivan Pilip said that, in the course of its history, our country has repeatedly been in a position when it needed closer links to the world. "Therefore, we should not approach these problems by arguing that everyone must settle them on his own," the KDS chairman added. A statement approving of the NATO decision was issued yesterday also by the Club of Nonaligned Activists [KAN]. "We believe that, when women and children are being crippled and murdered, it is no longer war but genocide. Unlike Vaclav Klaus, we see precisely the shelling of the innocent as the unfair conduct of war," says the KAN statement.
