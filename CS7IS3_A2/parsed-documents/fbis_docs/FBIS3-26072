Clinton said the money would come from U.S. funds previously appropriated for peacekeeping operations this fiscal year. The President made the authorization in a memorandum to Secretary of State Warren Christopher that was released today by the White House. The Clinton administration has announced withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Somalia by March 31. Fears are increasing that Somali factions could be fighting again after U.S. forces and other nations' peacekeeping forces pull out.
