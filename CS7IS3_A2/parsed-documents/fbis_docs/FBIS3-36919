The meeting addressed, among other things, ways to combine commercial and state television services. No specific decisions have yet been made. At the same time, Poptsov told the meeting that Russia's Finance Ministry was demonstrating what he called "total hostility" toward state television. The VGTRK chairman said the Finance Ministry seemed to think that state television lives on a different planet, while the Ministry of Finance is the main planet--where policy is decided by Yuriy Dubinin. At roughly the same time, it was learned that Viktor Chernomyrdin had instructed the Finance Ministry to draw up a range of measures to ensure that the state television companies' 80 billion [rubles] in debts to the Communications Ministry are paid off in stages. At 0600 Moscow time, however, we received an ITAR-TASS report that Krasnoyarsk telecommunications personnel had switched off the transmitters immediately after Ostankino's "Utro" program. Russian television programs are not being broadcast in Krasnoyarsk either.
