Claes pointed out that the Belgian Government and the municipalities had no knowledge of the developing incidents, adding that the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] supporters would be deported tonight. The foreign ministers discussed ways to prevent such regrettable incidents.

Cetin indicated that PKK supporters congregate in areas heavily populated by Turkish citizens as a method of provocation. He added that Turkey expects the Belgian Government to show sensitivity on this issue. Cetin pointed out that the press statement issued by Louis Tobback, the Belgian interior and immigrant affairs minister, was unfortunate. He warned Claes not to meet with the supporters of the separatist terrorist organization. Claes, in turn, stated that these kinds of incidents were also not approved by the Belgian public.
