FBIS4-6926 "dreas080__a94013" FBIS-EAS-94-080-A Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Boeing `Hopeful' on Aircraft Development Project Boeing `Hopeful' on Aircraft Development Project OW2504134294 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 22 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2504134294 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The U.S. Boeing Company has become a hopeful candidate for partnership in the joint development project for the next-generation small civilian airplane (YSX) being undertaken by the Japanese Government and the private sector. This was disclosed by an informed source on 21 April. In the beginning, Boeing showed little interest in the YSX project because it manufactures large and medium airplanes such as jumbo jets, not small aircraft. However, due to a worldwide slump in the aviation industry, Boeing changed its attitude and decided to participate in the project. Japan, which so far has promoted negotiations mostly with European companies, also made changes in its original plan, such as a slight increase in the number of seats and the utilization of parts used in Boeing's existing aircraft. Japan is also studying the possibility of taking advantage of Boeing's global sales capability. In the YSX project, Japan aims to engage in independent development of small passenger airplanes (with 50 to 100 seats) as the aircraft to replace the YS-11. If Japan engages in a joint project with Boeing, the number of seats will be increased to approximately 90 from the original 75, and the YSX will be equipped with the same equipment and parts as those of the Boeing 737 (with 108 seats) which is currently in service. Identical cockpit designs will reduce the burden of training pilots, making it easier for existing Boeing customers to purchase the YSX. Japan had also been promoting another development project for a medium aircraft with 150 seats (YXX) in cooperation with Boeing. However, the project has been suspended since last June after Boeing announced it would give priority to the remodeling of existing aircraft. The two projects will be virtually integrated into one by enlarging the size of the aircraft to be developed under the YSX project. With regard to the production of the improved Boeing 737, which will replace the YXX project, those Boeing subcontractors engaged in parts production strongly opposed the participation of Japanese aircraft manufacturers.
