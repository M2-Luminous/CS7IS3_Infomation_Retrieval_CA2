Let us follow a report by our correspondent Zamira Koleci: [Koleci] PD leader Selami considered the changes that have occurred during these two years of Government in Albania to be unimaginable, in a positive sense. During the news conference, he defined the program followed by the democrats and its social-democratic and republican allies to be the best and only alternative to set the country on the road of pluralistic democracy, market economy, and integration with the world. Proceeding from the reality of the last two years and the transformations and progressive changes, as well as the present political reality, the PD considers the demand for new elections to be baseless and destabilizing. The PD leader expressed his regret that the Socialist Party and its leadership cannot dissociate themselves from the past and that the socialist leaders oppose justice to defend corruption. Meanwhile, he said that his party has continuously condemned corruption as a phenomenon that injures democracy. At the news conference Selami gave attention to the situation in the region, which he considered to be very complicated. According to him, the worsening of the situation in Bosnia and the fall of Gorazde [as heard] have cooled and weakened the hopes for peace and have shaken the stature of the United Nations and the people's belief in it. After the Serbs evicted the international observers, the situation of Albanians in Kosova is becoming increasingly worse. The news conference continued with reporters' questions. Asked about the government coalition, Selami answered that the PD assesses the results of this cooperation to be very positive. However, he said, in democracy it is natural not to agree with everything. Regarding the Council of Europe's reaction to the criminal incident of 10 April on the border with Greece, Selami, who was there heading an Albanian delegation, informed the reporters that the Albanian Government's note found complete approval and the problem has now entered the road of dialogue. Selami assessed the possibility of the creation of a right of spectrum party to be completely normal in democracy. Meanwhile, he mentioned the PD's strict stance against the right-wing extremist forces. The victory of Berlusconi is a very positive phenomenon for the PD and an advantage to expand cooperation with Italy. We are parties of the same spectrum, continued Selami, and that makes communication easier. After greeting the fact that Italy is presently going toward new political solutions, he said that Albania wants good relations with its coastal neighbor. Optimistic about the future, Selami assured them of positive relations not only at a party level, but also between the Albanian and Italian Governments.
