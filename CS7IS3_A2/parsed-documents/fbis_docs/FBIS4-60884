The reason for this are poor communications channels and antediluvian equipment at most telephone exchanges. Ordinary people simply have to somehow live with this. But this situation is totally unacceptable in the case of the president's office or the government apparatus. Official information must be transmitted instantly, otherwise normal administration of the country becomes impossible. This would be particularly dangerous during an exacerbation of the political situation. [B. Kosenkov, spokesman of the president's office, identified by caption] This is why the president's office has opted for the Faxnet network. This system makes it possible to transmit information to remote areas promptly, speedily, and with a high degree of reliability. [Budnikov] A purely Russian feature of this modern technology is the utilization of the channels of the former Iskra party-economic communications system which links some 500 cities in our country.
