This was reported today by the head of the Russian delegation, Sergey Zotov. Zotov explained that disagreements in the opinions of the two delegations on draft agreements on the status of the Skrunda radar, and the period for which it will remain in Latvia, as well as on social security for the Russian military personnel are the only obstacles that hamper the signing of the joint agreement on the withdrawal of the Russian Army.
