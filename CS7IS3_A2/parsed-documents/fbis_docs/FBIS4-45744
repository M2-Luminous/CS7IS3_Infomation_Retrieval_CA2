At the "People's Republic of China Soil Erosion Law Implementation Regulations" press conference held in Beijing on 8 September 1993, Ministry of Water Resources minister Zhou Wenzhi [0719 2429 2535] stated with fervor that severe soil erosion is posing a threat to our natural environment and national economy. Zhou Wenzhi said that China is losing an estimated five billion tons-plus of soil each year, equivalent to 17.5 million mu of land cultivated to a depth of one foot. The total amount of associated losses of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium nutrients far exceed total chemical fertilizer applications in China each year. According to incomplete statistics, during the past 40 years we have lost 40 million mu of cultivated land due to soil erosion, resulting in economic losses of about 10 billion yuan a year. Zhou Wenzhi pointed out that improvement along with destruction is an important cause of degradation of the soil erosion situation. He said that since Liberation, it has received a high degree of concern from the party and government, and through the arduous efforts of vast numbers of cadres and the masses, China has controlled an area of soil erosion covering more than 500,000 square kilometers and major changes have truly occurred in some places. However, at the same time man-made destruction of vegetation has caused soil erosion over an area covering about 20,000 kilometers each year, which is equivalent to the area where soil erosion has been controlled in China over the same period, basically offsetting achievements in control. As the pace of development and construction has accelerated and our population has grown, the rate of destruction to soil resources by people has grown at a huge rate and the soil erosion situation has worsened. To achieve a fundamental reversal of this situation, we must rely on the rule of law. Evidently, the newly-promulgated "People's Republic of China Soil Erosion Law Implementation Regulations" are important laws and regulations matched up with the "Soil Conservation Law" and they provide concrete provisions for the core regulations in the "Soil Conservation Law" and strengthen their operability.
