FR940705-0-00004 FR940705-0-00001 This interim rule amends §1421.18 to correct the following errors: (a) paragraph (b)(12)(iv)(B) has been amended to correct the spelling of ``green''; (b) paragraph (b)(13)(iv)(D) has been amended to correct punctuation; and (c) paragraph (b)(13)(iv)(D)( 5 ) has been amended to correct the spelling of ``inconspicuous.'' This interim rule amends §1421.19(b) to correct the spelling of ``Form.'' This interim rule amends §1421.20 as follows: (a) paragraph (a)(2) to correct two references; and (b) to add paragraph (e) to provide if a producer moves a commodity from storage without prior approval on a nonworkday, the producer will not be subject to administrative actions providing the producer notifies the county office on the next workday that the commodity has been moved and such movement is approved by CCC. Section 1421.22 provides the settlement provisions of price support loans. This interim rule amends §1421.22 as follows: (a) Paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) to correct the percentage of foreign material for peanuts; (b) paragraph (c)(4) to remove references to location differentials for rice because such reference is obsolete; and (c) to add paragraphs (e) through (i) to include provisions that: (1) CCC may pay to producers the cost for hauling commodities delivered to CCC beyond the producer's normal delivery point, (2) producers may deliver commodities to CCC directly to rail cars, (3) producers will receive storage credit for commodities delivered or forfeited to CCC in advance of the loan maturity date, and (4) producers will receive credit for prepaid warehouse charges for receiving and loading out for commodities delivered or forfeited to CCC. Section 1421.29 provides the provisions for LDP's. Section 1421.29 is amended as follows: (a) paragraph (b)(3) removes references to obsolete forms and corrects an incorrect reference; (b) paragraphs (c) and (g) adds references to rice for clarity; and (c) paragraph (h) is removed and paragraph (i) is redesignated as paragraph (h). This provision was included to allow producers delivering commodities to a buyer directly after harvest an opportunity to file for a LDP on the day such commodities were harvested and delivered. This required producers to report deliveries to the county office before the next loan repayment rate announcement. Since this provision was implemented, CCC developed a more workable procedure that allows producers to request LDP's in advance of harvest and delivery with the LDP rate based on the loan repayment rate announced and in effect on the day the commodity is delivered to the processor, buyer, warehouse, or cooperative according to redesignated §1421.29(h). Accordingly, the provisions in removed paragraph (h) are no longer needed. This interim rule amends §1421.202 to add a reference to wheat which was inadvertently omitted and corrects an incorrect reference. Section 1421.205 is amended as follows: (a) paragraphs (a) and (b) clarify that a reserve loan is approved rather than disbursed; and (b) paragraph (a)(2) clarifies the quantity for which the reserve agreement is approved. This interim rule amends §1421.206(b) as follows: (a) removes references to grain which grades ``sample grade'' because such grain is not eligible for a FOR loan; and (b) removes the provision that corn eligible for the FOR must be shelled corn. Currently, corn pledged as collateral for a FOR loan is restricted to shelled corn. CCC has determined that producers of ear corn should not be denied participation in the FOR and that the quality of the grain in the FOR would not be adversely affected if ear corn is permitted into the FOR. Accordingly, this interim rule removes the stipulation that corn must be shelled. Quantities of a commodity approved for FOR that are in approved storage earn storage credit and CCC pays producers storage payments at the end of each quarterly period. Producers with commodities stored in approved warehouse storage must pay or provide for the storage charged by the warehouse before CCC will pay the FOR storage payment. This interim rule amends §1421.207 to clarify these provisions. Section 1421.208 has been amended to remove a typographical error. Section 1421.210 provides the commingling and rotation provisions for FOR loans. Accordingly, §1421.210 is amended as follows: (a) paragraph (a) clarifies the provisions that are applicable to producers who commingle a quantity of an eligible commodity with the quantity approved for FOR; (b) paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4) add the provision that producers may rotate FOR loan collateral by replacing such collateral with grain from existing stocks. In the past, producers were only allowed to use grain from their most recent harvest as replacement stocks for rotated FOR loan collateral. CCC has determined that this requirement was unnecessary and that CCC would be at no risk by allowing producers to use grain from their existing stocks of harvested grain from any past harvest; (c) paragraph (b)(5)(i) corrects punctuation, paragraph (b)(5)(ii) removes an incorrect reference, and paragraph (b)(5)(iv) reduces the percent of liquidated damages for failing to replace the rotated quantity; (d) paragraph (c)(1) removes the reference to new grain to conform to the changes made in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4); (e) paragraph (c)(2) corrects a typographical error; (f) paragraph (c)(3) clarifies that storage shall not be earned for FOR collateral released for sale by the producer from the date of the rotation request until the replacement stocks are in place; (g) paragraph (c)(4) requires that the producer certify to the FOR quantity that the producer is requesting CCC to release for rotation that the producer intends to feed and clarifies that storage shall not be earned for such collateral released from the date of the rotation request until the replacement stocks are in place; and (h) paragraph (c)(5) removes the requirement to measure and inspect the grain to be released and the growing crop of the replacement stocks to conform to the changes made in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4), and clarifies that the replacement stocks, when such stocks are already in store on the farm, must be inspected and measured before the release of the FOR collateral. This interim rule amends §1421.211 to clarify that producers may repay FOR loans at any time at the marketing loan repayment rate if such rate is in effect.
