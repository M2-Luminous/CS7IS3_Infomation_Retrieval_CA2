FR940324-0-00015 FR940324-0-00005 14 CFR Part 25 [Docket No. NM&hyph;91; Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;82] Special Conditions: SAAB Model 2000 Airplane; Interaction of Systems and Structures AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. action: Final special conditions. SUMMARY: These special conditions are issued for the SAAB Model 2000 airplane. This airplane will utilize certain fully hydraulically powered electronically controlled flight control systems which are design features that are novel and unusual when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards of part 25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). These special conditions provide the additional safety standards which the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that provided by the airworthiness standards of part 25 of the FAR. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark I. Quam, FAA, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2145. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On April 28, 1989, SAAB Aircraft AB of Sweden applied for an FAA Type Certification through the Swedish Luftfartsverket (LFV) to the FAA, AEU&hyph;100, for the SAAB Model 2000 airplane. (The application for FAA Type Certificate was dated June 9, 1989.) The SAAB Model 2000 is a twin-engined, low-wing, pressurized turboprop aircraft that is configured for approximately 50 passengers and is intended for short to medium haul (100 nm to 1,000 nm). The airplane will have two new Allison GMA&hyph;2100 engines rated at 3650 shp. The propeller is a new 6 bladed Dowty Rotol swept shaped propeller. A single lever controls each prop/engine combination. An Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) will be installed in the tail. The fuselage cross-section will be the same as the SAAB Model 340. The fuselage skin will be thicker to handle greater pressures. The wing and empennage are new and larger in all dimensions and the fuselage is longer when compared to the SAAB Model SF&hyph;340B. The new cockpit will be a 5 or 6 screen CRT display with new Collins systems. There will be provisions for a Microwave Landing System (MLS), Global Positioning System (GPS), Selective Calling (SELCAL), Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS), and Traffic Collision and Avoidance System (TCAS). The landing gear system will be new. The airplane will have provisions for two pilots, an observer, two flight attendants, overhead bins, a toilet, and provisions for the installation of a galley. There will be a forward and aft stowage compartment and an aft cargo compartment. The airplane will have a maximum operating altitude of 31,000 feet. The SAAB Model 2000 will have a fully hydraulically powered electronically controlled rudder for initial certification and will have fully hydraulically powered electronically controlled elevators as a follow-on design modification.
