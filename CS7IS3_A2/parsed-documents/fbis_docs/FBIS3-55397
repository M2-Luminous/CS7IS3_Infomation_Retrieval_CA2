They Will Reinforce the First Russian UN Battalion of Peacemaking Forces"] [Text] Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne Forces, has said in conversation with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent that an additional Russian Army subunit is being sent onto Yugoslav territory along with hardware and armaments with the knowledge and consent of the UN Security Council following a petition from British [as published] Gen.

Podkolzin emphasized, that this additional contingent is joining the UN peacemaking force not to fulfill any separate task on Yugoslav soil but merely to reinforce the first Russian infantry battalion of "blue helmets," which is presently commanded by Col.

It extends for more than 100 km along the front and approximately 30 km deep. There are 24 checkpoints in the zone of responsibility of the battalion, which is in the "East" sector. Here the armistice is regularly violated, and there is shooting from both the Croatian and the Serbian side. Unfortunately, there have been casualties. To date two men have died in the battalion, and 19 have received injuries of varying degrees of severity. In short, Col. Gen. Podkolzin said, it is becoming increasingly difficult to fulfill the task in this region with the former forces, and our "blue helmets," moreover, only have small arms. This is why the decision has been made to reinforce the Russian UN battalion with men and combat hardware. Its task is as before -- to bring peace to the Balkans....
