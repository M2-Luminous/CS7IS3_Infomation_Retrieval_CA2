Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, a nation that belongs to the Group of Three [G-3], along with Mexico and Colombia, which tomorrow will become members of the AEC, will be the site of a new regional initiative that intends to group 37 states and territories in the Caribbean Basin. The Caribbean Sea, a geographic, historical, and cultural confluence once in the sight of extraterritorial nations, is getting ready to become the center of an extended region of cooperation in view of the challenges posed by the international arena. Andres Serbin, director of the Venezuelan Social and Political Studies Institute (Invesp) and one of the advocates of the integrationist initiative, said here today that the creation of the AEC constitutes an important regional step toward internationalization and the emergence of economic blocs. In a conversation with PRENSA LATINA, Serbin maintained that the association is a response to common fears of being excluded and neglected by the international economic system. The expert believes the search for methods to include civilian society in the integrationist movement is one of the main challenges of the AEC, which will group more than 200 million people. He explained that the integration cannot be seen from a short-term point of view; the participation of society in an association where heterogeneity is the basic characteristic, in addition to government and business agreements, is essential. According to the initiative, the AEC is attempting to group the English-speaking community (Caricom) [Caribbean Common Market], Central and South American countries with coasts on the Caribbean Sea, the West Indies (France), Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles (Holland), Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (United States), and British dependencies under a "broad and flexible" system. Contrary to the G-3, the Central American Common Market, or Mercosur [Common Market of the South] (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay), the AEC will be formed by a number of mostly small countries, which in some cases have different interests, development levels, culture, and languages. If we want the emergence of a regional entity, Serbin said, we have to establish the mechanism to get the people to contact each other and to participate in the decisionmaking process. It should not just be left up to the governments. For the creation of a free trade zone, the AEC will also face the challenge of making the economies of independent states compatible with that of 12 dependent states, which have also shown an interest in participating in the association. The participation of France, as an observer, involves a very powerful actor, which opens up a crossword puzzle for the regional participants. Such a situation also raises the question of whether the creation of an AEC free trade zone will also open up to the European and U.S. markets with a direct presence in the Caribbean basin, the expert indicated. In this regard, the AEC must be a convergence of regional interests that can iron out differences with regard to other regional blocs, such as the NAFTA (United States, Mexico, and Canada). Drug trafficking, immigration, cultural integration, and regional security are priority elements on the Caribbean agenda, and a concerted regional effort must be made to approach these issues, Serbin said. On Monday and Tuesday, experts from 30 countries will give the final touches to the draft charter of the AEC, the consultations of which will conclude with a ministerial meeting at the headquarters of the Latin American Economic System (SELA) on Wednesday. On 4 July, in Barbados, a new integrationist bloc, with a gross domestic product of $500 billion, will be announced to the international public. Its stage will be the Caribbean Sea.
