Seventy-seven fighter planes, 11 helicopters, 20 training planes, 10 transport and special planes, and 20 transport helicopters will be withdrawn from service. In 1994 and 1995, the Czech Army will operate at six airports, later at five airports, General Strubl added. Asked by journalists what the fate of the Soviet-made turbo-jet fighters MiG-29 would be, Strubl said that the command of the Czech Army decided not to buy any more aircraft equipment from the countries of the former USSR. "It would be uneconomic to operate only 10 MiG-29 planes," Strubl said. All transformation intentions within the army are built mainly on present economic possibilities, he added. The transformation of the Air Force will afflict some 250 pilots. "We will do our best to provide them with jobs in the aircraft area," Strubl stressed. He added that he held negotiations with several firms, including Czechoslovak Airlines, which showed interest in the pilots. The gradual modernization of Czech Air Force will be launched this year by a purchase of training aircrafts Z-142. Airplanes L- 159, helicopters and transport planes are to be bought after 1997, and multi-purpose super sound planes after the year 2000, Strubl said. The Czech Air Force should be completely re-equipped by 2005, Strubl said.
