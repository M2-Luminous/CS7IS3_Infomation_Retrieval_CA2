Therefore, LIDOVE NOVINY asked Ortman several questions. [LIDOVE NOVINY] What is the reason for your concern? [Ortman] I believe that the Civic Democratic Party [ODS], which advocates the one-seat wards for the Senate elections, wants to assume complete control over this body. It depends on its unrivalled position confirmed by public opinion surveys. If other parties of the coalition want to work their way into the Senate, they must endorse the three-seat alternative--namely, if a joint slate of the coalition parties is not established, the Civic Democratic Alliance, the Christian and Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, and the Christian Democratic Party have no chance of having senators. [LIDOVE NOVINY] Is the position of the opposition parties any different? [Ortman] In the example of the one-seat wards, the opposition would also remain without senators. The clash over the number of seats, however, will be a bone of contention for most of the coalition parties. [LIDOVE NOVINY] Are you in favor of introducing candidate deposits in the elections? [Ortman] The deposits contradict Article 18 of the Czech Constitution on the principle of equality. Our state abandoned property censuses with the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Property censuses do not belong in modern legal systems. If 20,000 korunas per candidate is being considered now, this amount over time could climb to a million, and then it certainly would be discriminating. The censuses principle is a catch placed like a time bomb in the election law. [LIDOVE NOVINY] Are you worried about the reduced number of local administration members following the local elections? The government has proposed a reduction by as much as one-half. [Ortman] Imagine that small communities would have just three aldermen who must choose one of them to be the mayor, whether the communal property is to be released, some cultural object is to be sold, etc. In a town with a population of tens of thousands, there might be just seven aldermen. These people would concentrate in their hands an unbelievable power. For the coalition parties, I would use the slogan "Oh Lord, how low I have sunk." Just to fill their slates, they are willing to sacrifice the number of members of the administrations. In principle, the status quo should be preserved. [LIDOVE NOVINY] It is well known that the Left Bloc deputies would best like it if the Senate were removed from the Constitution. Do you not believe it occasionally necessary that the poor laws adopted by parliament be caught in time by the Senate and thus prevent unnecessary amendments? [Ortman] The Senate would really play the role of a guard dog. We have, however, other insurances--namely, the president with the power to return the laws and the Constitutional Court. The poor laws are, above all, the result of hasty and inferior work in parliamentary committees. In this respect, the decisive factor is the composition of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee, the present expert knowledge of which does not provide any guarantee of quality. Some parties even assigned people who are not lawyers to this committee.
