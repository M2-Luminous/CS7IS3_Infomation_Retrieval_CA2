This is the first visit by a Romanian defense minister to the United States since 1989 and the second in the history of Romanian-U.S. relations after World War II. Tinca made the following exclusive statement to Radio Romania Actualitati correspondent Nicu Popescu: [Begin Tinca recording] The visit I am to begin today in the United States is a very important one for Romanian-U.S. military relations and the cooperation between the two countries. It would mean a great deal if at least the majority of the goals I set for myself -- even if not all of them -- could be achieved so that I could return home with the certitude of a genuine progress in the Romanian-U.S. relations. I hope I will be able to present as convincingly as possible the concrete steps taken by Romania on its way to democratization of Romanian society, the stabilization of the economic situation, and the increasingly dynamic implementation of the economic reform in our country. I also hope that I will be able to convincingly demonstrate the clear readiness of the Ministry of National Defense in view of carrying out certain specific actions together with the United States and with other countries within the Partnership for Peace initiative, as well as our readiness for Romanian-U.S. cooperation with respect to our efforts to modernize and re-equip the Romanian Armed Forces. I hope very much that my visit, and the results it will yield, will contribute not solely to the consolidation of our country's internal stability, but also to the strengthening of the feeling of security in our entire region and, why not, in the whole of Europe. I begin this visit with a very strong sense of responsibility, but also optimism, having in view the United States' increasingly pronounced readiness to further relations with Romania and the consensus existing among our political forces with respect to the importance of Romania's ties with the United States.
