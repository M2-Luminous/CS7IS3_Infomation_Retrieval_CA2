FR940705-0-00026 FR940705-0-00002 (11) Factory splices of fibers are allowed provided that prior acceptance from REA is obtained for the splice technique, that all splices are documented and reported to the customer and that the spliced fiber meets all requirements of this section. (12) The optical fiber must be coated with a suitable material to preserve the intrinsic strength of the glass having an outside diameter of 250 # 15 micrometers when measured in accordance with either EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;55B or EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;173. (13) The maximum force required to remove 25 millimeters of protective fiber coating must not exceed 13 newtons when measured in accordance with EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;178. (14) All optical fibers in any single length of cable must be of the same type. (c) Buffer/coating. (1) The optical fibers contained in a tube buffer (loose tube), an inner jacket (unit core), a channel or otherwise loosely packaged must have a clearance between the fibers and the inside of the container sufficient to allow for thermal expansions without constraining the fibers. The protective container must be manufactured from a material having a coefficient of friction sufficiently low to allow the fibers free movement. (2) Optical fibers covered in near contact with an extrusion (tight tube) must have an intermediate soft buffer to allow for thermal expansions and minor pressures. (3) All protective coverings in any single length of cable must be continuous and be of the same material except at splice locations. (4) The protective coverings must be free from holes, splits, blisters, and other imperfections and must be as smooth and concentric as is consistent with the best commercial practice. (5) Repairs to the fiber coatings are not allowed except at splice locations. (6) Both loose tube and tight tube coverings of each color and other fiber package types removed from the finished cable must meet the following shrinkback and cold bend performance requirements. The fibers may be left in the tubes. (i) Shrinkback. Testing must be conducted in accordance with ASTM D 4565&hyph;90a, paragraph 14.1, using a talc bed at a temperature of 95 ○C. Shrinkback must not exceed 5 percent of the original 150 millimeter length of the specimen. The total shrinkage of the specimen must be measured. (ii) Cold bend. Testing must be conducted on at least one tube from each color in the cable. Stabilize the specimen to ^20 # 1 ○C for a minimum of four hours. While holding the specimen and mandrel at the test temperature, wrap the tube in a tight helix ten times around a mandrel with a diameter not greater than five times the tube diameter. The tube must show no evidence of cracking when observed with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Note: Channel cores and similar slotted single component core designs need not be tested for cold bend. (d) Fiber and buffer tube identification. (1) The colors designated for identification of loose buffer tubes, tight tube buffer fibers and individual fibers in multifiber tubes, slots or bundles are shown in the following table: ␣ 1Buffer tube and fiber No. 1Color 1 Blue. 2 Orange. 3 Green. 4 Brown. 5 Slate. 6 White. 7 Red. 8 Black. 9 Yellow. 10 Violet. 11 Rose. 12 Aqua. 13 Blue/Black Tracer. 14 Orange/Black Tracer. 15 Green/Black Tracer. 16 Brown/Black Tracer. 17 Slate/Black Tracer. 18 White/Black Tracer. 19 Red/Black Tracer. 20 Black/Yellow Tracer. 21 Yellow/Black Tracer. 22 Violet/Black Tracer. 23 Rose/Black Tracer. 24 Aqua/Black Tracer. (2) Standards of color. Except for the aqua color, the colors of fibers and tubes supplied in accordance with this section are specified in terms of the Munsell Color System (ASTM D 1535&hyph;89) and must comply with the color limits as defined in EIA/TIA&hyph;598. (A visual color standard meeting these requirements and entitled ``Munsell Color Charts for Color Coding,'' may be obtained from the Munsell Color Company, Inc., 2441 North Calvert Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21218. The latest edition of the color standard should be used.) (i) The aqua color limits using the Munsell Color System must be as follows:
