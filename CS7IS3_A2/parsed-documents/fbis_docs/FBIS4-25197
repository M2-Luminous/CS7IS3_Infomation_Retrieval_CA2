Suen has gone on record to say that plans are indeed in place for combating sexual harassment, protecting pregnant workers, and combating discrimination on grounds of marital status. Over the weekend he appeared to be saying the new Equal Opportunities Bill was the last word on this matter and he was not aware of any other anti-discrimination legislation in the pipeline. If the Secretary for Home Affairs, who gives every impression of performing a distasteful task, is confused, it is little wonder that the public also is wondering what on earth is going on. A knee-jerk reaction would be to blame Michael Suen for not being on top of the job. This may turn out to be the case but the lack of clear signals on human rights matters comes from the top. The government's hesitation in implementing anti-discriminatory legislation and access to information proposals, currently the subject of private members bills, gives rise to the suspicion that the commitment to a full-scale human rights agenda is lacking. In private, the government has indicated it is preparing to move in the right direction but is taking care to avoid littering the path with symbolic gestures which would only serve to raise Chinese government objections. The government's stance is naive on the one hand, and dishonest on the other. First, it is naive to assume that China will not object to so-called nonsymbolic human rights gestures, such as an access to information bill. Surely, it has become clear there are highly trained human rights sniffers in Beijing who can detect the slightest hint of human rights reform, however it is dressed up. Whatever steps are being taken to enhance the human rights regime, China will object and do so with vigour. It is therefore essential that the government comes clean on its human rights agenda and clearly explains measures to be taken and why. If the government believes these measures are right and just, it should say so. If it behaves in a furtive manner, suggesting that there is something to be ashamed of in its actions, it will only convey the impression that it is trying to sell shoddy goods. Some members of the administration are opposed to legislation that eliminates discrimination and are even more violently opposed to laws that give the public the right to know what officialdom is doing. They are fighting a rearguard campaign to stop the spread of what they see as the human rights virus. The time has come for leadership. Either Governor Chris Patten bows to their wishes or he must tell them that government policy is irrevocably set in the direction of enhancing the rights of the people of Hong Kong. There is no halfway house in sight. Not only should the government come clean about its intentions but it should also campaign vigorously for what it believes. Some faint hearts in the administration fear a human rights campaign would not win public support. We challenge them to point to a single demonstration that has called for less human rights. Sure, there will be and have been protests in favour of retaining privilege, as witnessed by the New Territories inheritance issue. Yet, such is the strength of feeling in favour of securing and extending the rights of the people that practically no one would come out and openly argue the case for less human rights. At most, the doubters will advance the view that human rights cannot be extended because China might object. The Government should capitalise on public sentiment, rather than cower in the shadow of human rights opponents. It should also provide concrete examples that show why human rights is not an abstract concept. In Hong Kong, it means the right to determine if officials are gathering information about residents of the territory that may be incorrect and damaging. It means that female workers do not have to tolerate sexual harassment in the workplace. It also means that the right to housing and other essential services cannot be denied on grounds of race, religion, or other considerations of a discriminatory nature. These are real issues, affecting everyday life. The Patten administration has led the public to believe it is concerned about matters of this kind. It is hard to overstate the disappointment and disillusion that will ensue in Hong Kong if the administration starts to back track on these issues. We are used to the cynicism of politicians who judge policy, on whether it will enhance their popularity. We see no reason to make Hong Kong an even more fertile ground for nurturing this kind of cynicism.
