Presidents of business organizations and exporting firms are proposing a package of measures to overcome problems of infrastructure and bureaucracy that are afflicting the enterprises. These measures include: - To establish a single 3.4-percent sales tax and eliminate other taxes. - To reduce financing costs and eliminate financial intermediation for exporters. - To privatize the country's railroads and ports. - To extend the deadline for the construction of roads. - To put together a catalog and distribute it among exporters to take advantage of the opportunities offered by international businesses. - To improve the quality of export products. - To stop at the border foreign products that are subsidized or that enter the country with prices that are below their cost to produce. - To create a single document to process export documents. - To integrate productive chains so that the country will export final products instead of intermediary parts. According to research conducted by EL FINANCIERO among leaders of the business sector, Mexican businessmen face many barriers in their effort to compete abroad. Too much bureaucracy, administrative incapacity, scarce knowledge about trade agreements and business opportunities, the lack of access to low-cost financing, and poor infrastructure make foreign trade a difficult task that only a few businesses can challenge. Private sector sources noted that a program to develop trade in the next six-year term is needed if the objectives are to take advantage of international commercial negotiations and to increase the flow of foreign exchange for the country in order to balance the trade deficit. Mexico already has a basis to increase its exports, however, it lacks a specific support program and the difficult economic situation a large number of firms are going through, make it difficult to reduce the trade deficit with the United States. According to figures released by the private sector, Mexico's trade has increased, especially with the United States. Seventy-five percent of Mexican products are exported to the United States. Trade between these two countries totalled $26 billion in 1986 and in 1993 it was $82 billion which represents an annual growth of $8 billion in market value. It is estimated that with NAFTA and a good dissemination of market opportunities, however, trade with the United States could be accelerated and increased, in the medium term, by between $15 billion and $20 billion per year. The sources that were consulted noted that the macroeconomic and legal conditions (agreements and commercial treaties) are present for Mexico to increase its exports by more than 24 percent. They added that what needs to be done and what should be done by the next government is to increase support for small and medium businessmen, which are the ones with the greatest export potential. The private sector's proposals include the modernization of the tax collection system through a "single tax" so that businessmen will not be hindered by the red tape and, at the same time, will not become victims of a single inspector. Over two years ago, U.S. tax experts presented this single tax idea to the Finance and Public Credit Secretariat. It is a tax that works the same way as the value-added tax and they guaranteed that it would not drop but increase tax revenues. The proposal suggests that the single tax be set at 12 to 14 percent or between 3 and 4 percent over sales. The advantage is that the 2-percent tax on assets, the 34 percent income tax, the 5-percent Institute of the National Housing Fund for Workers tax, the 2-percent educational tax, the 2-percent Retirement Savings System tax, and the 1-percent Federal District tax would disappear thus simplifying the paperwork businessmen have to do. The flexibility proposed for these enterprises would not affect any of the macroeconomic variables attained during Salinas' six-year period. They said the fiscal surplus must be used to activate the economy because, with liquidity, the businesses can buy supplies to make their export products. Lowering the cost of financing is another point they highlighted. Private sector members complained that high-cost financing affects their costs and eliminates their possibilities to export. Consequently, they propose the channeling of soft loans without intermediation. According to private sector sources, the dissemination of market opportunities and the promotion of an exporting culture are part of the package to foment foreign trade. A greater deregulation will increase private investment in the development of the country's infrastructure. Deficiencies in transportation make goods more expensive, therefore, the business sector proposes the privatization of railroads and ports, as well as the extension of deadlines for the construction of roads. With regard to a single document, it suggested that the government create this prerequisite and eliminate all others and if exporters fail to tell the truth in it, an exemplary form of punishment must be implemented. The private sector sources concluded that Mexico will have its export boom when businessmen engage in the terminal industry [industria terminal].
