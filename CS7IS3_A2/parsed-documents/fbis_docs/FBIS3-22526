It was the first time we were able to go inside an AIDS ward and talk face to face with Egyptians who have AIDS. It was the first time we were able to hear their voices and take their pictures. We used to deal with them as though they were phantoms: we heard about them, but we did not see them. We watched them, but we kept our distance. Now we are able to ask AIDS patients questions, and it is now possible for them to answer. We can take their pictures, but from behind, due to humanitarian, family, and social considerations. After all, society still rejects people who have AIDS and holds them responsible for their disease even though some AIDS patients have nothing to do with the fact that they contracted this disease. Here is an account of the tour from the beginning. It is a tour of the unit where AIDS patients are treated. These patients, out of love and compassion, share a concern about not transmitting their disease to others that is greater than the physicians'. Nowhere else can one see human relationships like those we saw in that unit between the people who work in it and their patients. Let us start with the picture in the heart of Egypt. We are told every year that the figures that tell us how many people have AIDS are estimates, and we are also told that the sample is a random sample. This then is the question, and it is also the issue: When will we know precisely the number of Egyptians who have AIDS? The only center in Cairo that provides dialysis services to patients who have kidney disease and who also have the AIDS virus is located in al-'Abbasiyah Hummiyat Hospital. Service at that center started in November 1990 with six machines serving 22 patients, including seven women. Three of those women and eight men have died. The cause of death was kidney failure and not infection with the AIDS virus. And even this week the center, which is staffed by two specialists, seven interns, and 12 female nurses is offering its services to 21 patients, including six women. [We met] two patients the moment we entered the unit. One of them was a 53-year old farmer from Suez. That man, who is married and is the father of six children, two of them girls, was referred to the dialysis unit in al-'Abbasiyah by the medical commission in Suez. Because he is the only dialysis patient in the governorate who has the virus, it would not be possible to designate a dialysis machine in his governorate for his exclusive use. He endures the commute to Cairo twice a week to undergo dialysis at the al-'Abbasiyah unit. A decree from the Ministry of Health requires that every governorate that has a number of patients who suffer from kidney disease and who are HIV positive set aside a certain number of dialysis machines for the use of those individuals. If, however, a governorate has no more than one or two such patients, they would be referred to the closest dialysis center treating similar patients in another governorate. The patient from Suez does not know how he became infected with the AIDS virus. The second patient was a 45-year old unemployed woman who is the mother of two daughters and two sons. She too does not know how she became infected. This woman who has kidney disease and undergoes dialysis at the dialysis unit in al-'Abbasiyah, infected her husband whose infection was discovered when samples were taken from him and tested in one of the tests that are conducted periodically on those who have contact with HIV positive patients. The female nurse who watches the dialysis machine is wearing medical gloves. Her face is covered with a mask, and her hair is covered with a sterilized cap. She is wearing an apron to protect her chest, and she is also wearing disposable shoes, which are worn only once. Anyone entering the unit has to be wearing protective clothing similar to that which she is wearing. Fear of AIDS, however, is not the reason for that. Protective clothing is required for those who work with dialysis patients to prevent contamination. These articles of clothing are destroyed as soon as one exits the unit. I asked the nurse, "Aren't you afraid of becoming infected?" The immediate reply coming from the nurse who declined to mention her name or have her picture taken was this: "The patients are more careful than we are about not infecting us because they are certain that if there is a single case of infection in anyone working in the unit, everyone will stay away and no one will have anything to do with them." Dr. Khalid Salamah, a dialysis specialist, interjected, "Samples are taken periodically from physicians and nurses who have contact with the patients to ascertain that they are not infected. The real problem does not lie in the contact we have with the patients in the unit, but it lies with the patients having to face other people. "For example, the surgeon who receives a certain fee for the permanent incision he makes in a dialysis patient asks for thousands of pounds when he knows that the patient has AIDS. "Also, if a patient outside the unit has to see a dentist, he hesitates to tell that dentist about his disease, and he waits until he comes to us. Some of those patients will see a physician because of persistent pain, but they don't tell that physician about their infection. The burden then falls on physicians who must be cautious and careful in dealing with all patients. They must continuously sterilize all the equipment and tools they use to protect themselves and their patients from the possibility of infection." We asked Dr. Qadri 'Imarah, director of al-'Abbasiyah Hummiyat Hospital, about the procedure that would be followed with a person who is found to have the AIDS virus. Dr. 'Imarah said, "If infection with the virus is confirmed, the infected person registers his name in the Health Office of his governorate. The patient is monitored, and his condition is checked every three months. The Communicable Diseases Section of the Health Department offers health awareness and education services to the patient and his family and to those who have contact with him. The symptoms of immune deficiency disease do not usually become evident in a person who has the virus until some time after he is infected. And that period of time is determined by the ability of that person's immune system to resist infection. When that person's resistance fails, his condition deteriorates, and it becomes incumbent upon him to go to the Hummiyat Hospital for assistance. "In previous years fear of infection among workers in any hospital admitting such patients was so strong, it approached terror. Now, however, the situation is different. As more information about the virus became available through scientific advances, those working with patients whose disease is advanced have become more careful and more relaxed. This is because the Ministry of Health has sent people abroad for training on how to work with AIDS patients. The ministry also holds courses for those who work in the field of communicable diseases." Dr. 'Imarah then added, "The first case of AIDS in Egypt was discovered in November 1986, and the patient, who was a foreigner, was isolated in al-'Abbasiyah Hummiyat Hospital and then deported to his country. There were also three childbirth procedures for three women who had the virus. These were accompanied by considerable turmoil, because physicians and nurses were fearful about becoming infected as a result of their involvement in those procedures. "In the past we used to destroy everything that was used by patients, and we used to disinfect the entire room because we did not know for sure how the disease was transmitted. The unit where patients were kept in isolation used to be treated as though it were an awful place. Now, however, patients are not kept in total isolation. They are monitored, and they are not isolated unless their health deteriorates and they require total supervision. In most cases patients die in the hospital." I asked the director of al-'Abbasiyah Hummiyat Hospital about the patients. I asked him what kind of people they were and what were their occupations. He replied, "Most of them were employed abroad. Some of them underwent surgical procedures that required blood transfusions, and the blood they received was contaminated. The rest became infected as a result of having multiple sexual partners and using contaminated syringes for drug use. "These people are sailors, pilots, and employees of travel bureaus who have contact with groups of tourists. "The most recent hospital death of an AIDS patient was that of a sailboat owner who operated his sailboat on the Nile. This man had sexual relations with female tourists." AL-MUSAWWAR: Do you have an AIDS patient who is being detained in the hospital at the present time? Dr. 'Imarah said, "We have an Italian national who is in custody pending a court case. We asked that he be isolated so that those who have contact with him in detention do not become exposed to infection." AIDS in Egypt We leave al-'Abbasiyah Hummiyat Hospital, which is considered a model hospital for the treatment of AIDS patients, to explore where else the disease can be found in Egypt. The first AIDS case in Egypt was discovered in November 1986. Since then the national program to fight AIDS has been operating in conjunction with the World Health Organization [WHO]. By the end of 1987 there were five cases of AIDS in Egypt: four were Egyptians and one was a foreigner. Other AIDS cases were subsequently found, and eventually the number of cases rose to 68. In 1990 some of those patients became symptomatic. By the end of last October the total number of persons who were found to have the AIDS virus and to have full-blown AIDS had amounted to 313 Egyptians: 150 of them died. The number of foreigners who were found to have the disease was 210, and they were returned to their countries. Dr. Muhammad Subhi 'Abd-al-Rahim, first undersecretary minister for preventive medicine at the Ministry of Health, said, "All the Egyptians who have the virus became infected while they were abroad. They were infected by receiving contaminated blood after a surgical procedure or by having sex with a sexual partner who had the virus. There are exceptions to this generalization. There are some singular cases like, for example, that of the young woman from Dikirnis who unwittingly married a man who knew he had the AIDS virus. In that case the woman and her fetus became infected. "There is also the al-Gharbiyah man with kidney disease who used to undergo dialysis without knowing that he was infected with the virus. Negligence at the center where he was receiving the dialysis treatment was responsible for infecting 30 persons. "Dialysis centers have been given strict instructions to examine patients and to ascertain that they have no infectious diseases before placing them on dialysis machines. Another basic rule also has to do with the machine, which must be sterilized, and as a preventive measure, the filter must be changed after each patient so that the safety of its use can be completely assured. Health departments check on dialysis patients every three months to ascertain that they are free of the virus. We are the ones who found the virus in the al-Gharbiyah patient in the course of conducting this periodic testing on patients." He added, "Several locations in the various governorates have been designated for monitoring the disease among those groups that are most vulnerable to infection, most importantly, the people who have venereal disease, drug addicts, prison inmates, pregnant women, foreigners residing in Egypt, people who are employed in the field of tourism, people who have blood diseases, and prostitutes. By 1992 the total number of blood samples drawn from these groups and tested came to approximately 365,577. The total number of cases found to be positive was 48." AL-MUSAWWAR: With regard to the blood bags, is each bag tested to ascertain that the blood in the bag is virus free?" Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahim said, "The ministry supplied 213 blood banks -- these are main as well as branch offices -- with the necessary equipment for testing blood bags for possible contamination with the AIDS virus, hepatitis, and also syphilis. More than 939,000 bags have been tested since 1986. In addition, the ministry has oversight authority over all the blood banks. And we would not think twice about shutting down any blood bank that does not follow instructions." AL-MUSAWWAR: How old were those Egyptians who are carrying the virus when they became infected? Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahim replied, "Most people who carry the AIDS virus are between the ages of 15 and 40 years. They represent 61 percent of AIDS patients. There are eight people who have the virus who are under 15 years old. They were being treated for their blood diseases, and they were being given the eighth coefficient [as published] that we used to import before 1986. They represent 2.6 percent of the total number of AIDS cases, 81 percent of which are male, and 19 percent are female." Dr. Subhi 'Abd-al-Rahim had this to say about the ministry's role in protecting citizens from infection with the AIDS virus: "We are trying to spread health awareness among all groups of citizens. We want them to know how they might become infected so they can avoid infection. In addition, we are monitoring the spread of the disease, ensuring the safety of the blood supply, and using disposable plastic syringes when immunizing people. "Educating people about how infection is transmitted is the most that the ministry can do. AIDS is a disease that afflicts a healthy person who willfully fails to avoid the poor conduct that results in his infection. AIDS is a disease that no one can get in spite of himself." Foreigners AL-MUSAWWAR: With regard to foreigners in Egypt, how do you ascertain that they do not have AIDS? Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahim replied, "A foreigner who comes to Egypt [and intends] to stay for several months or longer to study or to work is not given a work permit or a residence permit until he has been examined and a clean bill of health is issued to him by the central laboratories of the Ministry of Health. "With regard to transit tourists, however, no one has the right to examine them to ascertain that they are free of the virus. Their temporary residence does not pose a threat because the disease can only be transmitted through blood or sexual intercourse." In order to have the full picture about AIDS, one would naturally take a look at what is happening with AIDS in the world around us and also in the East Mediterranean, the area set off by the WHO. The WHO estimates that more than 10 million adults and children worldwide have been infected with the AIDS virus since it was first discovered. Approximately two million persons are now in an advanced stage of the disease, which starts, on the average, 10 years after a person is infected with the virus for the first time. The organization estimates that the total number of men, women, and children infected with the AIDS virus by the year 2000 will be between 30 and 40 million persons. Between 12 and 18 million persons will have full-blown AIDS by then, and approximately 90 percent of the people who are expected to become infected with the AIDS virus during this decade will be in developing countries. The WHO expects developing countries to suffer more from the spread of this disease because the supreme political authorities in those countries do not provide adequate support for the efforts that are necessary to prevent this disease and to fight against it. There are also other fundamental obstacles to the effective prevention of this disease. There is, for example, ignorance about the nature of the disease, and there is denial that a relationship exists between AIDS, on the one hand, and an individual or society, on the other. Another obstacle is the failure to deal seriously with the disease or the inability to do something about its enormously catastrophic nature. Other obstacles include the low social and economic status of women, the traditional and cultural practices that make transmittal of the disease easier, and the avoidance of informed and frank discussions about sexual matters. Dr. Muhammad Hilmi Wahdan, director of prevention at WHO's East Mediterranean regional office, said, "Incontrovertible evidence has proved that the AIDS virus is transmitted basically through the vehicle of individual conduct. In some societies risky factors and practices are widespread, quite openly. People do not think twice about engaging in such practices, and they do very little to prevent them. In such cases society has to play a significant role, and it has to intervene if it really wants to protect individuals' health as well as public health from an AIDS invasion. In other societies where risky factors and practices are rejected outright by society, these factors and practices take place in secret, and governments cannot do much to affect them. It is in those instances that the role of society becomes important: to confront what is being done in secret and to discuss it candidly and unequivocally. The Features of the Epidemic The WHO identifies the features of the AIDS epidemic in the East Mediterranean region. The most important of them are: - Infection came into the region late. At first people became infected by imported blood or as a result of sexual intercourse with persons from areas where the virus was widespread. - Prostitution is illegal [in the region], but it is secretly practiced even though the extent to which it is being practiced is not known. - The extent to which drugs are administered by injection is not known, but the problem is not a simple one. - These countries attach significant importance to the ethical values that are imposed by religion and society. By September 1992 the total number of cases reported [to the WHO] from 20 countries in the East Mediterranean region had amounted to 1,399. In addition, there were 308 cases of illnesses that occur with AIDS and are associated with it, and there were 4,641 cases of people who had been infected with the AIDS virus but who had not shown symptoms of the disease. It is estimated, however, that the real number of cases exceeds these figures, because in many countries diagnosis remains inadequate and cases are under-reported. The East Mediterranean region is an area that extends from the Maghreb [to the west of that region] all the way to Afghanistan in the east. Seventy-five percent of those who have AIDS are male, and 25 percent are female. The age group that has the highest number of reported cases is that group that is between the ages of 30 and 39. Those between the ages of 20 and 29 are the group with the second highest number of reported cases. That is followed by the group that is made up of those between the ages of 15 and 19. Almost nine-tenths of the cases occurred among those who are between 15 and 39 years old. Sexual intercourse is the leading way of transmitting the virus. It is the cause of infection in about 77 percent of reported cases. Whereas heterosexual sex, which is the prevalent form of sex, accounted for 69 percent of those cases, it was also noticed that homosexual relationships accounted for eight percent of the sexually transmitted cases of the disease. Blood transfusions and blood products accounted for 15 percent of the cases; intravenous drug use accounted for six percent; and finally, two percent of AIDS cases became infected during childbirth. Sex Education If these are the most important characteristics of how AIDS was spread worldwide and in the East Mediterranean region, what might be the true picture of how the disease was spread in Egypt, which is located in the heart of the Middle East? Do we have a civilized, scientific approach for dealing with this danger that is coming our way? Is our approach based on confronting the facts and acting on the basis of those facts, or are we burying our heads in the sand in an attempt to escape and delay the danger? WHO figures indicate that sexual activity is one of the leading causes of infection with the AIDS virus in the East Mediterranean region. It is the cause of infection in 77 percent of all cases. People who are uptight will undoubtedly speak up here and declare that homosexual activity, which is the main cause of infection, is prohibited by our religion. Unfortunately, however, sexual activity among homosexuals accounts for no more than eight percent of the cases of infection, whereas normal sexual activity accounts for 69 percent of all cases of infection with the disease. It is that which is making sexual conduct the focus of direct attention. That is where the emphasis must be placed to stop the infection with the disease. This can be done by devoting attention to the fact that all young people have to be educated. A scientific program to teach sex [in school] during the preparatory stage of education has to be devised. Sex is to be taught in a simple manner that would be compatible with the students' ability to absorb and understand. The religious and spiritual sides of these young people is also to be nurtured. In addition, emphasis must be placed on men and women abstaining from illegitimate sexual relationships that would expose both husbands and wives to the risk of infection. The responsibility of implementing this role does not rest solely on the shoulders of the Ministry of Health. It rather falls on everybody's shoulders: physicians, people in the media, teachers, scientists, and clergymen. Everyone in society has to take part in an informed, educational campaign that would be based on clarity, candor, and disclosure of the facts. This is especially important given the fact that the man who is responsible for the health of all Egyptians proclaims the notion that the credibility of any official is determined by that official's knowledge of the truth and [the extent to which] he proclaims it. Dr. 'Ali 'Abd-al-Fattah, the minister of health said, "It has been proved that the AIDS virus is spreading. People have to be made aware of the need for abstinence and the need to adhere to proper, moral conduct so that disease can be avoided. We have to call attention to the fact that there are AIDS cases in Egypt. At the same time, we have to give people adequate instructions so they can avoid infection. It is up to each AIDS patient to fear God and to tell his physicians about his disease so as not to infect others."
