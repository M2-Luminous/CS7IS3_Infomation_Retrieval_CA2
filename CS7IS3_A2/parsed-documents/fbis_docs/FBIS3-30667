"Europe -- its present, its so-called `expansion' and its future -- were high on the agenda of the forum," says Klaus. "I must admit that I had to oppose a bit the ideas regarding the expansion since I am convinced that no one can ever extend (or narrow) it (Europe)." "Our experience says that Europe's success (or failure) does not depend so much on the existence, extent and activities of multilateral European institutions, but to a much greater degree on the type and structure of the political, social, and economic systems that exist in European countries," Klaus says. He notes that "we know very well that the reason we lag behind (Western Europe) and for our not quite happy life in the past four decades was not the existence of the (now defunct) Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), but the communist regime (toppled in Czechoslovakia in November 1989). Symmetrically, this is true also in the opposite direction: Western Europe's success did not depend on institutions of the European Community but on a free society, private ownership, and a free market," Klaus says. He adds that "this was true in the past, is true now, and will be true in the future, too." "These days, it is being decided whether or not Eastern Europe will preserve this system and will not let it degenerate into a new form of collectivism.... The success of Europe is dependent on the degree of freedom of the individual, free market and trade, on the ability to get rid of the state's useless interference in the lives of people and their economic activities, on the elimination of bureaucratic manipulation with all of us, on our resolve and courage to suppress the strength of the powerful ... lobbying groups and on our ability to put in order fundamental economic attributes, especially our work with awards which we get for it," Klaus says. "In these attributes it is necessary to carefully specify the conditions of a potential favorable impact of multilateral European institutions on our future," Klaus says. However, he fears that "the careful formulating of these conditions is being forgotten due to the simplified and a priori accepted argument that without Europe's unity we shall be 'small' and 'weak' and 'unable to compete' with other regions in the world." "The Czech Republic claims that Czech lands have always been part of Europe and therefore they do not want to be deprived of various advantages ensuing from partnership in European institutions. We wish to be an 'equal partner' who does not only seek to obtain something, but we are also ready to give," Klaus says.
