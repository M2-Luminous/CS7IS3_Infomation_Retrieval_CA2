This will change the traditional pattern whereby the customs over-concentrate manpower, material resources, and supervisory means in ports that are crowded and so have little time for inspection; establish the customs supervision of imports and exports on the basis of enterprise management and accounts checking; expand the time and space for supervision and management so as to speed up passage through customs and make supervision more scientific and effective, which suits an increased degree of openness to the outside world and the development of an open economy. -- Deepen reform for passage through customs and establish a new order for passage through customs. This will, first, reform the customs declaration structure and foster a service market for customs declaration. Second, it will study and gradually establish a categorized management system for the passage through customs of the consignor and consignee or its agent of import and export goods, and will study and formulate categorized management standards -- based on risk analyses -- for passage through customs. -- Reform the bonded system and promote the development of an open economy. As a nationwide unified and open large market gradually is being formed, the customs bonded system will become an important means whereby the customs supports the development of an open economy and promotes the mutual supplementation of the international and home markets and the two types of resources. Therefore, it is necessary to reform and improve the bonded management method and increase the legal responsibility of bonded managers and come closer to international standards. -- Establish and perfect a customs inspection and estimation system, and improve professional expertise in the collection and management of customs and excise. It is necessary to reform the procedures and methods for goods inspection, price estimation, goods categorization, and tax calculation and collection; establish a keen and accurate price information system; increase the number of laboratories and establish their legal status; train a vast number of high-caliber and high-level experts on customs inspection and estimation. -- Accelerate the integration of customs with science and technology. This year, the customs should use the opportunity afforded by the linking of the computer networks of customhouses all over the country to consolidate, improve, accelerate, promote, and apply the automatic customs declaration system; step up the establishment of comprehensive data banks for customs operations management and a variety of special data banks; and link the computer networks of relevant departments such as banks, foreign enterprises, and taxation departments.
