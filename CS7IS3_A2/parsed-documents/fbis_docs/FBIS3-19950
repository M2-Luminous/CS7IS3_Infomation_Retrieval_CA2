The new phase of the battle surrounding the EU was marked in earnest yesterday with Gro Harlem Brundtland's report to the Storting. After 11 months of negotiations, she was able yesterday to brief the Storting on the agreement and make her formal recommendation: yes to EU membership. In the course of the spring Storting session, the government will put forward its own report to the Storting on the agreement and an Odelsting bill for a referendum. The prime minister warmly defended the European Union's "central idea" of "committed cooperation among independent countries," before she turned to the contents of the agreement. "Our point of departure was not to demand lasting exemptions from the EU's body of regulations. In the negotiations the government had more ambitious goals -- we have worked for peculiarly Norwegian features and conditions to become part of the EU and not for them to be exemptions," she said. The government takes the view that Norway's "vital interests" have been met with understanding. The prime minister pointed to the detailed statement on sovereign rights over energy resources, new arrangements for northern agriculture, and the fact that Norway's arrangements for the administration of fisheries resources will form the basis for the EU's fisheries policy in northern waters. On the subject of the controversial fisheries agreement, she said that Norway has ensured "its right of ownership over our share of fish resources," that the administration policy in northern waters will be continued after a transitional period, and that there will be duty-free access to the EU market for fish and fish products. The prime minister categorically rejected the notion that Norwegian fishermen will have competition in their fishing waters: No one will be allowed to fish for fish to which Norway has the rights today. As in the past we will own over 98 percent of our share of cod in northern waters, and it is therefore not the case that Spaniards or others can threaten the resource base of Norwegian fishermen, she said. Only on one point did she declare herself "not fully satisfied" -- Ireland's freedom to fish its mackerel quota in the North Sea for part of the year. Around 85 percent of the land under agricultural cultivation in Norway has been classified as production areas with special difficulties. The prime minister also stressed the new system of support for northern agriculture, which embraces the whole of northern Norway and parts of southern Norway. The government is "confident" that it will be possible to carry out the necessary reorganization of Norwegian agriculture in such a way that "new development possibilities" are guaranteed. A basis for Norway's membership application was the Maastricht Treaty's goal of political, economic, and monetary union. Yesterday the prime minister focused on the goals of a reduction in the public budget deficit, low inflation, low interest rate levels, and a stable exchange rate. She called these central elements in an economic policy for full employment. According to the government, a common currency will prevent speculation against individual currencies. Yesterday Gro Harlem Brundtland concentrated on individual elements in the agreement, but she also stressed her fundamental argument for saying yes to the EU -- Norway will have greater influence if it is a member than if it remains outside. "We are not giving away our right of self-determination if we become an EU member -- we strengthen our self-determination in relation to forces over which we today have too little control," she said. She stressed in particular the security policy challenges in Europe and said that no individual country can secure security and peace alone.
