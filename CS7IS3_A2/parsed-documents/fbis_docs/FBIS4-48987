Economics Minister P.K. Chiang, who just returned from Penang, Malaysia, where on Saturday [23 April] he attended the first meeting of the Council of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce in Asia, said his ministry will do its best to push for the signing of bilateral investment guarantee pacts and agreements to avoid double taxation with every Southeast Asian country. It will also seek to set up formal channels of dialogue and communication with governments there. The Economics Ministry estimated that at least 3,200 production lines of local manufacturers have been relocated in Southeast Asian countries. Two-way trade between Taiwan and those countries reached US$6.62 billion in the first quarter of the year, a 9.3 percent increase over the same period last year. According to statistics released by the cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the number of ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia has surpassed 30 million, which accounts for 86 percent of the total number of overseas Chinese. In view of the huge number of ethnic Chinese in the region, Chiang urged both state and Koumintang run enterprises to invest in Southeast Asia to match the government's "southern strategy," which encourages local business people to invest in Southeast Asia rather than in Mainland China. THE ECONOMIST, a British news magazine, recently reported that the economic strength of ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia is of vital importance to the region. Ethnic Chinese in Malaysia only make up one third of the total population there, but they hold nearly 50 percent of listed stock shares. Likewise, the Chinese minority in Indonesia accounts for only 3 percent of the total population, but owns 70 percent of all companies in the country. Except for the petroleum industry and state-owned corporations, ethnic Chinese control about 50 percent of Indonesia's economy, the magazine said. In Thailand, Chinese make up 12 percent of the population, but control as much as 90 percent of the entire country's capital. Fifty percent of Thailand's financial and banking institutions are also under control of ethnic Chinese. Given the prevailing economic strength of ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia, the government has begun paying attention to its relations with ethnic Chinese population there while trying to sell its "southern strategy." In an effort to build warm relations between Taiwan investors and ethnic Chinese businessmen, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Huang Kun-hui and his deputy, Kao Koong-lian, will soon visit countries in Southeast Asia to promote the southern policy. By explaining the government's position and its strategies, Huang and Kao hope to start a formula under which Taiwan enterprises and ethnic Chinese communities in those countries can break into the mainland Chinese market hand in hand. The Mainland Affairs Council and the Economics Ministry will also draw up new plans to jointly encourage more local investments in southeast Asia. Chiang said the government's southern strategy was not designed to curb Taiwan investments in Mainland China, but is meant to offer an alternative for Taiwan industries keen to expand into overseas markets.
