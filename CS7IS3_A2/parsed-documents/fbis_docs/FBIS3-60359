Declaring their common position and their intention to assist each other fully in the application of coordinated environmental measures, Bulgaria and Romania make a request to the European Union [EU] to provide funds for the implementation of a regional project for the protection of environment along the lower Danube. A month ago the two ministers of the environment considered the development of the project stating that its implementation was only possible if the intellectual and financial aid was provided by the EU. The project envisages joint activity aimed to improve the quality of waters in the Bulgarian-Romanian section of the Danube, to raise the level of nuclear safety and protect the air against transboundary pollution. Your request to the European Union is going to be the superstructure of good cooperation between us and your ministry, ambassador O'Sullivan said on accepting the memorandum. He described the EU cooperation with the Bulgarian Ministry of the Environment as an excellent model for all countries to follow in the implementation of operation PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid For Poland And Hungary] programmes. Ambassador O'Sullivan promised further support for environmental protection activities, especially those aimed to resolve Bulgaria and Romania's common problems.
