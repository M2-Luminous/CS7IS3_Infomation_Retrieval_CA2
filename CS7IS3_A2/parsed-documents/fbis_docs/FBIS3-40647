Members of both benches trooped into the well of the house and created unruly scenes, compelling the speaker, Mr Gulam Sarwar, to adjourn the house for the post-lunch session. While the opposition members, mainly the Congress, rushed to the well of the house, shouting slogans to press for the introduction of the Jharkhand development council bill in the current session, the ruling party members also followed suit and vociferously demanded discussions on the Dunkel draft. Significantly, the chief minister, Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav, was seen encouraging members of the treasury bench to join the agitation in the well of the house for such a discussion and press for a resolution, censuring the Centre for signing an agreement on the Dunkel draft. They accused the Centre of ruining the economic structure of the country by accepting the draft under pressure from the United States, the IMF and the World Bank.
