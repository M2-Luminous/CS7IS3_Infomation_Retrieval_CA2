Federal Acquisition Regulation; Past Performance Information; Proposed Rule Federal Register / Vol. 59, No. 33 / Thursday, February 17, 1994 / Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE General Services Administration National Aeronautics and Space Administration 48 CFR Parts 9, 15, and 42 [FAR Case 93&hyph;2] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Past Performance Information AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC) and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (DARC) are proposing a change to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to address requirements for use of past performance information in the contractor selection process. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before April 18, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 93&hyph;2 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Shirley Scott at (202) 501&hyph;0168 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, room 4035, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405; telephone: (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 93&hyph;2. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background This proposed rule implements Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter 92&hyph;5, Past Performance Information, which was published in the Federal Register at 58 FR 3573 on January 11, 1993. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed changes to FAR Parts 9, 15, and 42 may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because the requirements for use of past performance information in contract award decisions may preclude award to otherwise successful offerors. The extent of the impact is not known. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared and is summarized as follows: The proposed rule implements Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter 92&hyph;5, Past Performance Information. The OFPP policy letter requires Federal agencies to evaluate contractor performance on all new contracts over $100,000, to use past performance information in making responsibility determinations in both sealed bid and competitively negotiated procurements, and to specify past performance as an evaluation factor in solicitations for competitively negotiated contracts expected to exceed $100,000. The rule establishes procedures for use of past performance information in the contractor selection process. A satisfactory performance record is a prerequisite to being determined a ``responsible source'' pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 403. The rule will apply to all large and small entities who perform or are interested in performing Government contracts. The rule will impose no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements on large or small entities. The rule implements OFPP Policy Letter 92&hyph;5, but does not duplicate, overlap, or conflict with any other Federal rules. There are no known alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of OFPP Policy Letter 92&hyph;5. A copy of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. A copy of the IRFA may be obtained from the FAR Secretariat. Comments are invited. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite FAR case 93&hyph;2 in the correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed rule does not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 9, 15 and 42 Government procurement. Dated: February 14, 1994. Albert A. Vicchiolla, Director, Office of Federal Acquisition Policy.
