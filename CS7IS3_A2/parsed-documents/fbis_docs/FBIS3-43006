The golden years of Russian science were the end of the 1940's and the beginning of the 1950's. Salaries, provisions and equipment were all of the very best quality. In retrospect, this had its good and bad aspects, but the fact remains that scientists were well looked after. The results were positive: for years the world has been using a particle accelerator which was designed and made by Soviet scientists during those glorious years. It was at that time too that work began on developing the laser principle of producing high-intensity radiation, for which the author of this article, together with Nikolai Basov and the American Charles H. Townes, was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics. In those years research began into space and astounding progress was made. The list of examples goes on. Western scientists who are aware of the collapse of Russian science are tempted to ask, ``How is it then that the Soviet Union managed to break ahead?'' American colleagues remark how the successes of the USSR influenced the policies of the U.S. Congress and administration on basic science and scientists in that country. In Russia, the situation has deteriorated, a process which began under Nikita Khrushchev. The policy of ``uniting science and practice'' was carried out ruthlessly. Whole institutes which carried out academic research were handed over to industry, including the Institute of Computing and Mathematics, the Institute of Oceanology and others. Fundamental research was placed on the back burner. The result in a number of important branches of science was lamentable. Specialists attracted by the ``introduction into industry'' abandoned a number of ideas in the field of microelectronics. No attention was paid to the idea of ultra-pure materials or to high-quality diagnostic equipment. As a result, the computer Pamyat, which was way behind those being made abroad, was developed. Now, Russia is so ``successful'' that her scientists wonder whether they will ever catch up with the Americans and the Japanese. It is true that even in bad times there have been people in government who have well understood the importance of basic science. Many significant developments were made under the patronage of the military, but secrecy problems arose. As a scientist, it was clear to me that without exchanging information it would be impossible for science to move forward. I managed to stop many feeble attempts to make research work at the Institute of General Physics secret. It is curious to remember the complaint of one Russian who bemoaned the fact that he, who had the power to classify any of a scientist's projects as "top secret" and forbid him to travel abroad, was unable to classify his thoughts. CATCH 22 The deterioration which is taking place in Russian science has already caused the country to be relegated to the third world, and in five years this process will be irreversible. Within the Academy of Sciences, a fall in scientific and labour discipline has become commonplace, as has the desertion of scientists for other spheres and the attempt to move abroad at all costs. The Presidium of the Academy has increased the salaries of scientists, but mostly this remains true only on paper, as the government cannot fund it. A stratum of self-styled ``pensioners'' has already formed amongst scientists. These scientists appear at their institutes mainly on the days when their allowances are paid (they cannot be called salaries), while in the rest of their time these candidates and doctors of science earn extra money by building dachas for businessmen, quietly growing crops on their plots of land, or turning to business. Of course, a number of institutes, including the Institute of General Physics, retain their former glory: the group of those devoted to science remains intact; foreigners come, offering contracts and joint projects. However, the West sees Russian scientists as cheap labour. Leading Russian scientists are being offered salaries on a par with those in Malaysia or Mexico. Proposals have been made to buy out laboratories or even whole institutes and, naturally, to dictate the research programme. Russian science has been forced to sell its most important files, expensive equipment and materials, and designs which are the last word in scientific thought and which any other country would not sell at any price. In saying this, I do not wish to give the impression that I am against partnership or cooperation with foreign scientists. I myself was born in Australia, and have lived abroad and enjoyed the hospitality of foreign scientists. The Institute of General Physics is working on a number of joint projects, including with the U.S., South Korea and France. Yet the sale of scientific developments and strategic supplies in the hope of saving what little remains signals the beginning of a collapse. However, even these necessary sales cost the Institute dearly. It is told, ``You earn hard currency, therefore you must be a commercial organization, and references to your research do not give you the right to request a discount on electricity, water or materials,'' which are needed in great quantities for carrying out the work. Incidentally, references to our research, or to the need to keep up scientific funding are not even heeded at government level. Several appeals on the part of scientists, including the president of the Academy of Sciences, to both the Gaidar and the Chernomyrdin governments, had no success. The matter is usually dealt with by petty clerks who take care to remind representatives of institutes that there are many mouths to feed. Although the current powers include, as never before, many people with scientific degrees--there are even correspondent members and academicians--such an attitude reflects the lack of understanding regarding the scope of basic science which, given the chance, could make breakthroughs in high technology. Even in former times, advanced, promising ideas were not always taken on board. At the time when laser technology was being developed, a director of industry had to be invited to the Institute to attend seminars describing the future for laser technology. At least then scientists were trusted, but now the lack of understanding is deepening, as is the economic crisis. RICH MAN, POOR MAN In this situation, all that remains to do is to fold one's arms and wish success to those who find a work placement abroad and sign a long-term contract. What else can one do, if the average salary at a scientific institute is 25,000 rubles (25 dollars at the beginning of September). How can these people and their families survive in comparison, newspapers advertise jobs for painters with a salary of R150,000. Comments to the effect that science must be reorganized and freed from its excess weight are disturbing. What is needed is a normal level of financing, the provision of equipment and materials, and of course, control over the results. The fact that Russian science is lagging behind is growing more noticeable by the day, and, what is more, the advance of scientific knowledge in the rest of the world is accelerating. It is cause for concern that Russian scientists have nothing to report to world conferences on technology. Russia might once again miss the boat, for instance in nanotechnology, where scientists are working on the level of atomic structures. A new era of laser technology is about to begin, and here Russia is behind: there is no money available to finance this work, and nothing, as is known, will come of nothing. One cannot even order foreign science magazines--there is no hard currency. At the Institute of General Physics work has been stopped on crystal growth. The effect this will have on microelectronics is clear: all materials will have to be imported. Indeed, even Russia's own manufacturers are driving her towards this. For example, zirconium oxide, which is used in the manufacture of fianite currently costs so much that it is cheaper to buy it abroad. Yet due to the shortage of hard currency, work in this field will also have to cease. Financing in the field of fiber-optic communications, laser physics, solid-state physics and optics, where Russian institutes have high-class designs attracting the interest of foreign countries, is nowhere near sufficient. Thanks to a number of contracts with foreign firms, some of them are still managing to get by. If developments are not made in the field of fiber-optic technology, the country as a whole will be unable to make any progress. People wrongly believe that cellular communications are an alternative, but one of the disadvantages of such systems is the ease with which conversations can be overheard. With fiber-optic systems, however, it is impossible to listen in on conversations: i.e., not only military, but any commercial secrets will be better protected. I believe that Russia has all that is necessary to create a fiber-optic network herself. Russia is a country rich in talent and ideas, but most of all it must be hoped that she does not destruct science herself. It can be saved today, but tomorrow will be too late.
