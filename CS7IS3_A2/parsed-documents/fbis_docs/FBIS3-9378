The convoy was stopped and all personnel were warned that the road was mined. The drivers and crew left the vehicles, and the Srpska republic army provided safety for the convoy to avoid the possibility of theft and plunder. According to Serb military sources, claims published by foreign media that the Srpska army plundered the convoy were incorrect. This is yet another attempt at vilifying and accusing the Serb side of a lack of cooperation, the Srpska republic army sources say.
