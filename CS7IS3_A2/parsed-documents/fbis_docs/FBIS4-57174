Specialists and professionals from all over Cuba gathered in Matanzas and met in two committees: one on waterproofing; one on road maintenance. This gathering was chaired by engineers Jesus Perez Othon and Ramon Rodriguez, respectively first vice minister of Basic Industry and first vice minister of Construction. Perez Othon discussed the current situation of Cuban heavy crude and the possibilities for making deliveries to construction enterprises. Rodriguez, for his part, talked about the need to generalize experiences with using Cuban crude because the results are very good if these experiences are properly applied, if the proper technical controls are observed. The results in waterproofing road surfaces in Matanzas have been very good. Matanzas has been applying what is known as Varadero Asphalt for over 15 years now, and these experiences are already being successfully implemented in other provinces, like Havana City Province. The road infrastructure must be repaired and given maintenance immediately, and Cuban crude is being used on stretches of the central highway, such as the stretch of road linking Camaguey and Ciego de Avila. This product is also being used to repair the Via Blanca, and it will be used to (?tackle the potholes) in the cities. Upon closing this event, engineer Jorge Revuelta, vice minister of Construction, said all the nation's provinces will have to work hard at using Cuban crude, and that the technicians of the different provinces will seek better variants so as to become more efficient and improve quality.
