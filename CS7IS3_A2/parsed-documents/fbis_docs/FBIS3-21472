On page 4, the journal reports that the F-16 will be equipped shortly with a new system that will enable it to be refueled in-air by Hercules aircraft. Other warplanes will also similarly be equipped. This will increase the in-air refueling capaability beyond that currently being offered by Boeing aircraft. On page 8, the journal quotes Professor Valentin Proyalyiker, director of the new center for satellite information research at Bar-Ilan University, who says, "For the first time in Israel we will be able to receive real-time satellite imagery without depending on the approval of foreign elements." The official name of the center is "The Center for Remote Sensing." This is possible because of a unique cooperation agreement with the Institute for Radiophysics and Electronics at Krarkov in the Ukraine. The center receives broadcasts from the Ukrainian satellite Okean, which was launched last December. A microwave radar (3.2-cm wavelength) and television camera were mounted on the satellite. The radar resolution is not high (500 meters) and the camera sweep area is 500-2,000 km. The resolution of the next satellite radar (SICH), which will be launched in 1995, will be much higher with underground search capability. Information is easily accessible because Kharkov and Israel are on the same longitudinal line along which the satellite moves. On pages 24 and 25, the journal reports that Israel will need a new fighter aircraft for the next decade to replace the F-15. The only existing fighter expected to remain in competition will be the F-18. Three planes are expected to lead the combat aircraft market at the start of the 21st century: the American F-22, the European Eurofighter, and the French Rafal. Due to technical and budgetary problems with the Eurofighter and the Rafal, the F-22 is expected, for now, to be the fighter plane of choice. It meshes well with the philosophy of the Israel Air Force with its maneuverability, low-radar signature, ability to carry lethal air-to-air missiles, and its air-to-ground smart weapons capability.
