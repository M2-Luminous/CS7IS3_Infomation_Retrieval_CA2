Many people, mostly young, have fought these last years on battlefields, some as volunteers and others as members of military units, where they have witnessed horrors, massacres, killings and destruction. When some of them return from the battlefield, they face unsurmountable problems of unemployment and feelings of rejections and of being unable to fit into society, so that many often decide to try their luck at fitting in by operating outside the law. Many have been charged and convicted of serious crimes in our country: murder, grand larceny, unlawful possession of firearms. The most recent example is that of Ilija Vujic, accused of having murdered Vera Zidic and her son in an apartment in Pohorska Street in Belgrade. The Pohorska Street case stirred up the public, especially after Vujic's statement in the investigation that he fired at Vera Zudic without reflection, deliberately wounding her so that she would tell him where the foreign currency was. From what we have learned in the Palace of Justice, he has stated that he fired at Vera Zidic's son without deliberation, as soon as he saw him. This is only one example but the experts, the legal theoreticians and practitioners, say that a new and still more cruel crime wave generated by the Vukovar syndrome we mentioned threatens our country only when the war is entirely over. Unaware of Crimes "I think this Vukovar syndrome has grown beyond the limits of the post-Vietnam syndrome, since these boys, at least those whom I have defended before the court, are not even aware that they have committed a crime. I think we are dealing with a big problem of society here, and I think we ought to organize collective treatment of many volunteers and members of the military who took part in this war. They have witnessed horrifying massacres. The problem is that the police meet many of these returnees from the war at the border, take away their weapons and question them, although they have a permit from the Srpska republic to carry them. It is no wonder that they are often charged with the crime of assaulting an official. A large number have also been convicted of unlawful possession of firearms and of creating a general hazard. There have been frequent examples of shots being fired in restaurants and the like," says lawyer Borivoje Borovic. According to him, there are even examples of disabled returnees from the battlefield being convicted of some of these crimes. Since many of them, Borovic says, do not have a job or anything to live on, they feel rejected and are unable to adapt. There have been many cases, Borovic says, when those who have been convicted, wounded and disabled unfortunates, go back to the battlefield after serving their sentence and lose their lives there. "All the lads I have defended were actually real heroes on the battlefield. However, the horrors they experienced and the welcome they received from our authorities had such an effect on them that they have rebelled. I feel that the weapons permits issued to the boys in the Srpska republic should be honored here in the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] as well. However, the view of the court applying the famous Article 33 of the Law on Firearms is that those permits are not valid, and thus many of them have been convicted of this. The police do not issue weapons permits to many of these lads, and they take them into custody for questioning. There is the well-known case of Zvonko Osmajlic, whom the police in Subotica tried to frame in a murder case. Even when he was released and the charges dropped, the police took away his passport, supposedly because they were unhappy with the court's action," Borovic says. Sad Tales He says that the penalties for the crimes of inflicting serious and light physical harm are increased in decisions of, say, the Superior Court when returnees from the battlefield are involved. Borovic says that under the influence of the Vukovar syndrome the young men commit serious crimes with elements of violence, and he says that in these cases forensic psychiatric evaluation often finds that they were in a pathological emotional state at the time they committed the crime. In the past few years "blunderbuss" grenades have flown around in Belgrade, immense quantities of arms have been found, and many serious robberies have been committed. The question is what is the main reason for this. "These lads are returning from the battlefield, but actually they have nothing to come back to. The first contact with the state is in practice the encounter with the police. They are treated as though they have come from another country. The case of Nebojsa Markovic, for example, is interesting. He is a volunteer who returned from the battlefield and was sentenced to 4 1/2 years in prison for involuntary manslaughter in the death of his friend Vladimir Tadic. They were together in a group, there was drinking, there were some verbal exchanges. Nebojsa had a Scorpion automatic pistol and that is how this tragedy occurred. Those returning from the battlefield should be told as soon as they enter the country what awaits them here with respect to the law, the possibility of fitting into normal life, and weapons regulations. One man who was convicted provides a typical example. He was carrying a grenade because he did not know where to turn it in. He did not dare to leave it at home, fearing someone might get hurt, and so in the end it was activated when he was carrying it around and caused an accident," says Miroslav Todorovic, judge at the Belgrade District Court. According to Todorovic, the veterans are usually convicted, and the crimes are usually serious cases of robbery, murder and unlawful possession of firearms. He emphasizes that the Law on Weapons treats this area too severely, since an individual need only have in his possession a pistol planted on him by someone else, say, or one he is carrying, say, with papers from the Srpska republic, and he will be convicted and punished very severely, although it has not been established whether he had any intention of using it for any purpose whatsoever. All of these problems -- the legal confusion, war in the vicinity, the disorganized state of society, and the insufficient attention paid to the many young people who through no fault of their own were compelled to take up arms and participate in a bloody war with the blessing of the state -- threaten, once the civil war is over, to engender a still larger number of crimes and turn many sound and able young men into potential criminals on the wrong side of the law.
