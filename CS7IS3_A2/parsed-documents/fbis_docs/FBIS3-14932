The statement was made after his meeting with Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, following the State Duma decision on amnesty for the leaders of the 1991 August failed coup, May Day riots and the October 1993 revolt in Moscow. Filatov said that the recent events have revealed the lack of proper interaction between the two branches. He noted that both sides will set up working groups to iron out disagreements before March 10 when the Duma, the lower house, will reconvene. However, he refused to say in what particular directions the groups will be working, adding that the State Duma, as a collegiate body, should first "hold an internal discussion of what has happened." Speaking about reports that Yeltsin was planning to address the nation on television tonight, Filatov said he did not know anything about it. "It is most important to understand that the Duma's resolution means amnesty for only some people, but the investigation should be carried on," Filatov said. The meeting was also attended by Acting Public Prosecutor Aleksey Ilyushenko, Yeltsin's representative in the State Duma Aleksandr Yakovlev and his senior aide Georgiy Satarov.
