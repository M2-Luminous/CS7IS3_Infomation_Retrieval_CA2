Earlier it was said at the Sejm that the debate on the concordat would be held on 2 July. Kwasniewski said that this step was not directed against the church or the believers, and it was not aiming at stirring up a war over outlooks on life. He added that it intended to lead to the situation when the concordat "will be freed from public doubts, also expressed during the campaign before the 19 September general election."
