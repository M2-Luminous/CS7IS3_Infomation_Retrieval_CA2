This call for the protection of relics was made by many members of the national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at its current session. Bi Keguan, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Arts, said that it is a common understanding of Chinese at home and abroad not to destroy, over one morning, cultural legacies left over by their ancestors. Referring to the Three Gorges Dam Project in particular, Bi said the government should adopt proper policies and put in enough funds to rescue cultural relics in the area before a huge reservoir begins to emerge behind the dam. He cited for protection such cultural sites in the area as an ape-man fossils site, stone-age ruins and residential buildings of the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368-1911). He urged relevant departments to try every means to detect relics still buried underground. Relevant departments should also seek financial aids from Chinese people at home and abroad and from the international community. Jin Shangyi, professor of the Central Academy of Fine Arts and a noted oil painter, pointed out that the smuggling of antiquities is running rampant on the mainland and so is ancient tomb robbery. In some areas, he added, people even used explosives in tomb robbery and some workers charged with legacy protection even took part in such criminal activities. He called on all social sectors to make joint efforts to curb such evils which, on the part of some people, result from poverty, ignorance and lack of scientific knowledge. Jin suggested the building of a national art museum as a way to protect cultural relics. Bi Keguan said, however, that at present museums on the mainland are afflicted with fund shortages. For instance, due to a lack of money, he said, the China Arts and Crafts Gallery which cost 200 million yuan to build was leased to a foreign company after two years of operation. Wu Guanzhong, a noted painter, said that in recent years some areas paid no attention to the protection of relics, but spent huge sums of money constructing replicas of ancient buildings. "We should draw on the successful experience of foreign countries in building museums and protecting cultural legacy," Wu said.
