The department's statement says that Meciar's repeated statements about the existence of secret agreements within the current government coalition -- according to which the Jozef Moravcik cabinet is alleged to have assumed the obligation to fulfill the demands outlined in eight points by the political entities representing the Hungarian national minority -- have revealed that the HZDS is completely under the influence of demagogic lies. In its statement, the Press and Information Department of the Slovak Government Office once again stresses that there are no secret agreements obliging the current government to fulfill the above-mentioned number of demands. What does exist is the government program statement adopted by the National Council. The statement goes on to stress that the HZDS chairman's criticism of the course of privatization is equally self-serving and demagogic, as it was his cabinet that slowed down the transformation of the economy -- something that resulted in last year's results of the Slovak economy being worse than those of the Czech economy. The Press and Information Department of the Government Office concludes its statement reacting to some statements by Vladimir Meciar by pointing out that his statements are creating preconditions for a radicalization of our society.
