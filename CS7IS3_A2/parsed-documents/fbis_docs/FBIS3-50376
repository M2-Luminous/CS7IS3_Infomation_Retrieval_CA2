As is known, the first to oppose the declaration was the SDA [Party of Democratic Action] of Bihac, then Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, declared the act unconstitutional, and finally asked the 5th Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army to put an end, by military means, to what in his opinion was a short episode of his political opponent, with whom he separated soon after the SDA won the elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Fikret Abdic replied with the proclamation in which he invited "all the citizens, especially the fighters, to defend the people, freedom, democracy, and human dignity with weapons and other means." The national defense of west Bosnia was founded, and it prevented the 5th Corps from controlling the entire territory. The present demarcation line between Izetbegovic's and Abdic's army is somewhere between Cazin and Velika Kladusa. Croatian president Tudjman supported Abdic's idea of autonomy; shortly after Abdic concluded another agreement with Radovan Karadzic concerning free trade in the Serb-controlled territory, trucks loaded with goods and buses carrying passengers started taking the road connecting Kladusa and Karlovac. The reporters in the area say that the prices are indeed high, but that there are no shortages. There is Franck coffee [Croatian] as well as Pancevo beer. Abdic trades with everyone and he makes no secret of it. On the contrary, he often points out that this form of cooperation with the neighbors who were at one time his war enemies is the only way to survive. The cochairmen of the peace conference on the former Yugoslavia, Owen and Stoltenberg, also acknowledged his project by inviting him to participate in the talks and by giving a positive assessment of his political initiative. According to his own statement, Abdic's basis for establishing autonomy comes from the Geneva peace package for Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to which this state is to be organized on the basis of constituent units. The authorities in the province were established through autonomous acts and laws, the purpose of which is "to secure constitutionality and rule of law, human rights and freedom, market economy, and the equality of all peoples, cultures, and religions." The Muslim Island According to the 1991 census, 245,435 people lived on the territory of the autonomous province of west Bosnia (Bihac, Cazin, Velika Kladusa, and Bosanska Krupa, which is now partly under the control of the Bosnian Serbs). Muslims were 80.05 percent of that figure, 13 percent were Serbs, 3 percent Croats, and the remaining 3 percent others. The territory covers a little less than 2,500 square kilometers. The Zagreb-Split railroad passes through Bihac, being the only connection between northern Croatia and Dalmatia; there is also an important road connecting Banja Luka with Knin and Split, and the road connecting western Herzegovina with Zagreb. The most important road for the province is the Bihac-Cazin-Velika Kladusa-Karlovac road, continuing toward Rijeka or Zagreb. If this road is not open, West Bosnia cannot exist, because the road is also the connection with the sea, where, as geopolitician Topalovic says, it exercises its transit rights in the free zone of the port of Rijeka, rather than its territorial achievements. The autonomous province of west Bosnia is, by its geopolitical position, a Muslim island, which is, in the east, separated by Karadzic's state from Travnik by over a hundred kilometers. Travnik is controlled by Izetbegovic's Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. There are, therefore, no possibilities of creating a corridor by the assumed war operations that would connect these two distant territories. In peace time, Bihac and Kladusa had more connections with Zagreb than with Sarajevo. Businessmen say that the province, due to its natural orientation toward Karlovac, Rijeka, and Zagreb, was in fact part of the Croatian economic territory. Therefore, at the east of the province are the Bosnian Serbs, while its other three sides have, from the Serbian aggression against Croatia, been controlled by the Croatian Serbs. The international community calls the territory of the "Krajina" parastate the "Croatian UNPA's" (north and south). If, according to the Vance plan, which is a supplement to the Security Council resolutions, the UNPA's are reintegrated in the Croatian constitutional and legal system, then the Glina district would be in the north of west Bosnia, the Knin district in the south, and the territory of the municipality of Slunj, which, until the occupation, had a Croat majority, would bear on the province from the west. According to geopolitician Topalovic, the main points of support that permit control of the Autonomous Province of West Bosnia are mountains: Petrova Gora (Kordun), Zrinska Gora (Banija), Grmec (Bosanska Krajina), and Pljesivica (Lika). All these mountains are controlled by the Serbs, and there is no realistic support for the claim that the Muslim forces from West Bosnia would have any success in a war conflict with the Serbs. Thanks to the military aid that arrived in these territories through Croatia, the Muslims managed to defend themselves -- with more or less success (they lost Prijedor, Sanski Most, and parts of Bosanska Krupa) -- probably because the Serbs were satisfied with the territories they had occupied. According to military estimates, the Muslims from west Bosnia have no chance of retrieving the lost territory by military means -- because they are isolated and because of the balance of power. The Agreement With the Croats and the Serbs As opposed to Izetbegovic, who, despite the circumstances, forces the Muslim conflict with the Serbs, who completely surround them, Abdic seeks a different solution. Realizing that he is the inferior party, and that, without free roads, his enclave would be doomed to a quiet death, while wanting to keep the people and the territory under his rule, Abdic offered agreements to the Serbs and Croats on the principle of "I give to you, you give to me". He offered the Serbs transit through the railroad to Knin in return for the passage through the road to Karlovac, and the Croats the transit expenses for the free zone in the port of Rijeka. Abdic has already announced the consequence of such agreements: "The future west Bosnia will be a free customs country with the stable economic support of the great Croatian port of Rijeka, which is to function as a free customs zone." Zlatko Jusic, prime minister of the autonomous province of west Bosnia, tried to clarify this statement during a short talk in Zagreb: "The free customs zone would be introduced for a period of two years. What we do not have would arrive in the province under favorable conditions, and what we do have would be easier to transport abroad. Consequently, we would not be isolated, our people would not leave, and an economic environment favorable to development would thus be created. As soon as conditions allowed, we would carry out the privatization of ownership; we would do it even through decrees, since we see that the democratic system slows down the process. We are aware that the finishing of the process, with the free transit of people and goods, is the precondition for our joining Western, that is, the European civilization. This is our goal, and we will not give up on it." The differences between the two concepts of organizing West Bosnia are now clearer. Izetbegovic's consists of a long-term war and the population surviving thanks to humanitarian aid and hoping for international military intervention, which creates favorable conditions for religious extremism, while Abdic, aware of the circumstances, is trying to preserve the people through negotiations and provide not only an existence for them, but also a living in accordance with the European standards. Whom Does West Bosnia Belong To? Looking at Croatian history, one can see that the diplomacy of the Republic of Dubrovnik made moves similar to Abdic's. This little oasis of Croatian statehood was for centuries building its prosperity by negotiating rather than employing its military forces against its powerful neighbors (Venice, Turkey....). Naturally, it paid for its freedom, but it in turn earned the money from those it gave money to, since every Dubrovnik contract included a clause stating that the Dubrovnik tradesmen had free passage through a certain empire or kingdom (naturally, a comparison with Apolonije's recent attempt at founding a Dubrovnik republic would not be valid, since Dubrovnik is connected to Croatia by continuous territory, and because a separate Croatian state did not exist at the time of the founding of the Republic of Dubrovnik). However, Abdic is in an even worse position than the people of Dubrovnik, as they at least had an open passage into the world through the sea, while his West Bosnia is completely surrounded. His policy therefore has no alternative if there is a desire to preserve the people and the territory. If there is the desire to be the victim, all it takes is to yield to the myths of the past and to unrealistic ambitions. Everything will be over very soon. "Izetbegovic is still trying to make the Cazin Krajina a mass grave of the Muslim people, as he has done in other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina," said Abdic, aware of what disaster this policy would lead to. However, it seems that this policy cannot come about in West Bosnia. That is, it is almost completely unimportant who is going to win in the inter-Muslim conflict in West Bosnia. If Abdic wins, he will carry out his planned policy of alliance, and should by any chance Izetbegovic's forces win, they will also have to carry out Abdic's policies if they want the people and the territory to survive. Through history, this province had leaders who easily changed military uniforms and allies, keeping in mind only the existence of the enclave. This is what Huska Miljkovic, the leader of the Muslim militia of the time, did during World War II. For a while he was an Ustasha, and the next moment he was a partisan. However, he preserved the people. This spirit of an autonomous enclave is at the same time the message to those who believe that the autonomous province of west Bosnia will take either the Serbian or the Croatian side. It will take the side of whoever is at its borders, unable to change its neighbor, but, weaker in military terms, capable of making a bearable ally out of them. However, in doing so, it will always remain its own, as it has for the past several centuries. Therefore, the thesis offered the Croats -- "central Bosnia for western Bosnia" -- is nothing but an unfounded evocation of something that will never happen.
