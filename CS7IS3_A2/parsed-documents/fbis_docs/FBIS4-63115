These are not the best of times. On the barren earth outside the city's Kiev station -- which daily disgorges economic refugees from the hyper-inflated poverty of the Ukraine -- Moscow council' s perennial workforce of shabby, prematurely aged, thirtysomething women empty rubbish bins on to dirty plastic sheets, drag the contents to a dusty patch of dried mud amid bare trees, and set fire to them. In the background stands the Slavyanskaya, the Russian flagship of an American hotel chain and host to President Bill Clinton during his Moscow visit. Only three years old and an emblem of the new world order in the heart of the old evil empire, its bathtaps now spit brown water speckled with grit. An entire floor is undergoing major renovation, as if even the hotel's concrete casing has fallen victim to Russia's incurable ailment: attrition of the soul. This has been a long, cold winter, spring has been late in coming and nobody knows what the summer may bring. The furthest east of Europe's great cities, schizophrenically straddling the invisible fault line with Asia, Moscow today is being devoured by its inhabitants: a metropolis in the grip of gangsters, drug-pushers and pimps. A society where the state once ruled by fear, and commerce was a crime, has been replaced by a jungle in which commerce is ruled by fear and anyone who indicts crime is blown away by a shotgun-wielding hitman on his doorstep. Russia today is trapped in a moral miasma, a fin de siecle social and cultural wasteland; the old idols have fallen, but no new order has emerged to take the place of the toppled totems; in the maw of chaos, there is only one fixed point -- demigod or demagogue -- Boris Yeltsin. In four years, the big man has slowed down. He may be 63, but his build is as imposing as ever, his bearing as erect, though now it hints at stiffness, even arthritic pain. The blue eyes are no longer as bright or as penetrating, more inclined to glaze over on a warm afternoon. These have been a world-shaking four years by anyone's standards. In the spring of 1990, he was still a wild card on the fringes of Russian politics: a former Gorbachev ally ousted from the ruling Communist party politburo and cast into disgrace, but against the odds he climbed slowly back up the moving ladder of the crumbling Soviet power structure. He operated from a nondescript office on a high floor of one of the drab tower blocks on the broad thoroughfare then called Kalinin Prospect (after one of Stalin's stooges), but has since been renamed New Arbat Street. Yeltsin then was a man in the grip of obvious ambition: for power and for revenge on those who had humiliated him. Today, behind a formal gilt desk in the opulent splendour of the Kremlin palace, with a chess clock in front of him to dictate his timetable, he shows the stress left by the intervening years. Years that saw him become Russia's first democratically elected president, the crucial step in the quiet internal coup that stole the heartland of the Soviet empire from under Mikhail Gorbachev's feet. Unexpectedly, he became a global symbol of freedom and bravery as he stood on top of a tank to defy plotters who wanted to turn back the clock. Last October, though, it was Yeltsin who gave the orders to spill blood on Moscow streets, sending in tanks and reluctant troops to storm the parliament building he had once defended, and end a stalemate with the remnants of the old regime. He has a right to look tired. He becomes animated only when asked if he might ever be forced to revisit that dark hour last October when he had to go cap in hand to the military and beg them to follow his orders, uncertain how they would reply. "Today," he suddenly booms, grasping a pair of pencils like the hilt of a sword and banging on the table, "today, the army, the security service, the foreign intelligence service, the ministry of internal affairs are all loyal to the president and to the nation. They are marching behind him." He pauses for dramatic effect before adding in a low growl: "And they will continue to march behind him." So would he ever again doubt his grip on the forces of law and order? The answer is a brusque, definitive "Nyet". Then, with the glimpse of a half-smile that remains part of the man's charm: "At least I hope not." The question today is what did he save, and for whom? His very assertiveness has created a vacuum of reasonable men around him, an absence of obvious successors. In a quiet, serious voice, he concedes: "I am very troubled by this. Two or three years soon fly past. It is a very difficult and complicated task in this time to bring up a president who would be supported by the whole people, by all 120 million voters." He is dismissive of the man the West has demonised, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the extreme right. "Zhirinovskiy has no hopes," he said. "Russians have been suffering for seven decades with totalitarian regimes, so they are not likely to be seduced by right-wing dictators. I'm sure of that." It is not so easy to dismiss the Zhirinovskiy cocktail: a well- stirred, fervent pan-Slav patriotism that embraces outspoken nostalgia for the Soviet Union as a Russian empire and has managed to unite new fascists and old communists marching together under red banners and orthodox icons. Yeltsin's dilemma remains his obligation to keep a weather eye on Western reaction to any crackdown that could be considered a slip back towards repression, yet still pre-empt politically organised disturbances that could hide a fresh attempt at revolution. "It's high time we made these parties obey the force of the law," he snarls. Yet the unexpected success of Zhirinovskiy's faction in the December elections and the surprisingly solid showing of the communists have influenced Yeltsin's rhetoric, reintroducing hints of old cold-war-speak to reassure those who believe the country has been sold out to the West in exchange for a delivery note for a mess of pottage. Yeltsin had implied he would sign Nato's "partnership for peace" pact by the end of March, but is now dallying: "There are no political reservations... but some technical problems still need clarifying." Despite a personal appeal by William Perry, the US secretary of defence, Yeltsin has ordered the postponement of the first joint Russian-American military manoeuvres, which would have been held on Russian soil, to avoid jeopardising an accord reached with his opponents in parliament to allow the easy passage of much-needed economic legislation. This is a man who cannot be seen to be cowed. The suggestion that biological warfare research, which The Sunday Times revealed had been continuing behind his back, might still be going on, is rejected testily. "I can be sure," he says, "because my decree set up a very serious commission that checked all the points and the whole programme has been shut down. We suggested to the Americans that they join the commission to go to see any points they like." Yet the increasingly common public perception that once-mighty Russia has become an American client state is one that rankles not just with Yeltsin's concerns about voting patterns but with his patriotism. In a private meeting with chiefs of his Foreign Intelligence Service (the overseas espionage wing of the former KGB) 10 days ago, he called for increased vigilance against the CIA, accusing the American intelligence service of continuing to try to recruit agents in Russia, adding that "certain powers" had an interest in "keeping Russia paralysed". There is no doubt that the man who has consistently played the Western card in Russian politics is bitter that the West has not yet come up trumps in terms of material support: "Such sums aren't coming. In Tokyo (at the G7 economic summit) they said $44 billion. We received $1.5 billion. I don't know what will happen in Naples. I think they are more interested in their own difficulties, even though we are all in one boat." It is with obviously sad pragmatism and no small touch of self- conscious irony that the first Russian leader since 1917 to see and accept his country's interdependence on the global economy finds himself forced to criticise the short-sightedness of others. Of Moscow's Western partners he has words of praise only for Germany and dismisses Britain's contribution to the Russian reform process as "one of the last". Yet he clearly expects little else. "What we want is an end of discrimination against Russia in terms of trade, economic co- operation, membership of international organisations and so on... We don't want special conditions, but we also don't want to be subject to discriminatory clauses." External discrimination and insufficient aid are not the root of Russia's problems. The transition from dictatorship to democracy, from sick centralised superpower to healthy, wealthy market economy remains wrapped in trauma. At the heart, with tentacles embracing every aspect of the embryonic economy from small shops to banking, is a home-grown mafia with no conception even of what the law ought to mean in a society that has been turned on its head and shaken. Yeltsin's analysis and prognostications sound glib at best, at worst over-optimistic and ill-informed, reminiscent of the most fatuous of old-style Soviet statements, as if his presidential absolutism gave him the power to halt crime by making it illegal. "We have passed a decree on reinforcing the struggle against organised crime in the country and it has produced positive results. At present the rate of increase in criminality has been contained. It is down five times compared to the same time last year." Thankfully, realism intervenes: "But we cannot say we are satisfied... We are recruiting more policemen, we are producing more of our own equipment and importing from abroad to furnish our police up to the level of other countries." His grounds for optimism, though, are those of socialist utopians down the ages: "I think that changes will be seen here. With the improvement of the economy and the material standard of living, crime will decline." Maybe, Boris, maybe. Meanwhile the wages of sin are good enough for the new rich of Russia; on a late midweek evening in the Teatro grill at the back of the Metropol Hotel next door to an electronically protected, used- car lot that clogs the once proletarian pavements, sharp young men in designer sports jackets brandishing mobile telephones like the fly whisks of oriental despots are ordering Canadian lobster and French champagne. There is something of egalitarianism left: they share their table with burly minders in leather jackets. The moll is there too, complete with tumbling Barbie doll peroxide locks and a crotch-hugging micro skirt. The cynical view is that not only has Russia's moral and social switchback ride made the mafia inevitable, but also in the medium term it may even be necessary. Its single-minded dedication to the individual profit motive makes it an armed and lethal third force against those who would restore state collectivism. A period of anarchic semi-lawlessness -- like the American west in the 1880s or Chicago in the 1920s -- may be the purgatory that Russia will have to go through to emerge with any semblance of sanity. How long it will last is anyone's guess, but it will last longer than Yeltsin. To paraphrase John Reed, the American chronicler of the last Russian revolution, the wrong-headed one of 1917: I have seen the future, and it scares me like hell.
