Major General Ze'ev Livne, commander of the Home Front Command, said that the command manufactured a missile containing hundreds of kgs of explosives, similar to the Scuds owned by Syria and other Arab countries. The missile was detonated in an open training range strewn with reinforced structures. The explosion was designed to test the efficacy of Israel's security concept with regard to the home front: the "reinforced structure," which is a thick-walled room. The Americans who observed the experiment checked the resistance of various types of windows in light of the conclusions drawn from the World Trade Center explosion in New York, as well as for other U.S. defense components. The results of the experiment will be sent today to laboratories in the United States, and the findings will be relayed to Israel. This joint experiment is part of a series of tests conducted over the last two years to prepare the Home Front Command. Gen. Livne stated that 100,000 building containing "reinforced rooms" have been built to date in Israel. These buildings offer a solution to 300,000 Israelis, he said, and within five years most buildings in Israel will be similarly equipped.
