Even considering that the attacks on Goradze, according to the information available yesterday evening, are merely a warning -- only two U.S. planes took part in the operation -- the conflict in Bosnia has just undergone a major change. Last February, to get Serbian artillery to pull back from Sarajevo, the allies issued an ultimatum to [Bosnian Serb leader] Radovan Karadzic's troops, threatening them with selective air strikes. Nothing like that was seen in Goradze: no ultimatum, and probably no selective strikes, but what the military calls close air support; in other words support for endangered ground troops. Now, since UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force in former Yugoslavia], has no blue helmets in Goradze other than one or two observers, we can only conclude that the air support was carried out for the sole benefit of the Muslim troops. That is where the change lies, and it is a major change since it implies that the Atlantic alliance has chosen sides in Bosnian conflict which has been raging for the past two years. It is known that NATO and the majority of its member states have been eager to dampen Serbian ardor -- to put it mildly -- and it is now also clear that, after vascillating for so long, they are ready to use force to achieve that end. This is especially true of the Americans, since it was two of their planes which intervened and they were the first to announce the raid. Over and above the circumstances which lend legitimacy to yesterday's actions -- the inhabitants were in mortal danger and there is a UN resolution which designated Gorazde and five other towns as protected areas back in spring 1993 -- the U.S. attitude raises a few questions. Washington has always pleaded the Muslim cause in Bosnia, but hitherto that pleading has always been of a completely platonic nature. Only last week the secretary of defense and the Army chief of staff [as published] stated unambiguously that they had ruled out any strikes over Gorazde. So what on earth could have caused the Clintom administration to change its mind? Could it be the pressure exerted by public opinion? Or could it be the pressure exerted by certain European countries, like France? It is interesting that yesterday afternoon, shortly before the air strike, the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] stated that it was prepared to shoulder its full responsibilities. Yesterday, the war in Bosnia took on a new dimension. It made a huge step toward the internationalization of the conflict.
