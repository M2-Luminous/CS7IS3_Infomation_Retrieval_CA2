The committee is discussing a report on the state of Poland's defense prepared by the Ministry of National Defense. Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said before the meeting that it would be a bad thing if the NATO states give Russia a privileged position in the Partnership for Peace program. [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] Such a solution would contradict the idea of the Partnership. It is true that Russia still remains a superpower and has the right to negotiate various treaties with the United States and with NATO as a whole, but not within the framework of the Partnership for Peace initiative, which would then become doubtful. [end recording] According to Minister Kolodziejczyk, the reduction of Russian troops from 200,000 to 25,000 in the Kaliningrad district may be carried out soon.
