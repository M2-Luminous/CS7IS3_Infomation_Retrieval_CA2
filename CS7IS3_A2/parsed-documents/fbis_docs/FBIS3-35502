[Shahal] I have been in constant contact with the police commissioner since the moment the incident was first reported. Together with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], we are investigating and checking all the circumstances of the incident. First of all, I would like to express my sorrow at the loss of life and at this horrendous murder. I categorically denounce the slaying of human beings, whatever their nationality may be. The Israel Police and the security forces will make every possible effort to bring the people responsible for this act to trial. I call on all the sides to evince restraint and not to succumb to provocations on either side. [Landau] Sir, the details in our possession are quite sketchy and we would like you to fill us in. When did the incident start? [Shahal] I received the first report before 0600 [0400 GMT] this morning from the police commissioner, but I assume that the incident began earlier. Other details are currently being investigated. At this point, the picture is not yet entirely clear. We know that there were quite a few fatalities, and the toll reported to me was from six to eight dead. To repeat, I am in constant contact with the police commissioner, and I believe the picture will become clearer soon because an investigation is currently under way. [Landau] Do you know the identity of the Israeli from Qiryat Arba' who opened fire at the Arabs? [Shahal] We have the name of a Jew who was found there, who is either wounded or dead. We do not yet know what his role was in the incident, and we are currently collecting testimony from eyewitnesses to ascertain what exactly happened. [Engel] From the initial details in our possession, we realize that the incident did not start this morning but last night, when Jewish and Muslim worshipers converged at the Cave of the Patriarchs, respectively for their Purim and Ramadan prayers, and clashed with each other. Were the police ready for such an eventuality? How many troops did you have on the spot? [Shahal] You must understand that the Israel Police are not responsible for order and security in the territories, and it is only an auxiliary force helping bring lawbreakers to court. Israel Police and Border Police troops are under IDF command and are part of its deployment. They tried to calm down and deal with the situation. As said, I do not think I can comment about what happened this morning before I receive more accurate information. [Landau] As far as we know, the Arabs attacked by the Israeli caught him, beat the hell out of him, and actually killed him. [Shahal] You know more than I do. We have not yet confirmed those details. Therefore, it would be irresponsible on my part to comment on something about which I have no accurate information from an authoritative source. [Engel] Could you tell us what is going on now in Hebron? We understand that serious riots erupted there in the wake of the incident. [Shahal] There is a great deal of tension. Consequently, I call on the entire Arab and Jewish population to evince restraint and not to succumb to any provocations on either side. We have experienced the murder of Jews at the hands of Arab terrorists. Unfortunately, we are faced with an incident whose specifics are not yet clear. A measure of restraint will serve those who want to uphold the peace and save human lives. The security forces, the IDF, the Border Police, and the Israel Police are prepared to deal with the incident. To repeat, all these bodies are in constant contact to prevent a deterioration of the situation in the wake of this horrendous act. [Engel] Has the prime minister been briefed on the details of the incident? [Shahal] Absolutely, he is being briefed all the time. All the pertinent elements are being briefed almost in real time. [Landau] Are you contemplating the possibility of declaring the area a closed military zone? [Shahal] I cannot answer this question, which is being dealt with in ongoing consultations. We must first check the incident to ascertain exactly what happened. [Engel] Minister Shahal, thank you very much.
