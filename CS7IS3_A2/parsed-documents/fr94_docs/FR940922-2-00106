FR940922-2-00106 FR940922-2-00072 [Docket No. 50&hyph;461] Illinois Power Company, et al.; Withdrawal of Application for Amendment To Facility Operating License The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of Illinois Power Company (the licensee) to withdraw its February 17, 1993, application for a proposed amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;62 for the Clinton Power Station (CPS), Unit No. 1, located in DeWitt County, Illinois. The proposed amendment consisted of three proposed partial exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J regarding containment integrated leakage rate testing, three proposed changes to associated CPS Technical Specification 3/4.6.1.2, ``Primary Containment Leakage,'' and changes to the CPS Technical Specification Bases and Operating License No. NPF&hyph;62. One of the three requested exemptions was granted. A partial exemption from the 10 CFR 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.1.(a) requirement to perform the third Type A test of each 10-year service period when the plant is shut down for the 10-year plant inservice inspection was granted in Amendment # 83 dated September 8, 1993. However, requests for partial exemptions from the requirements of Section III.A.1.(a) (the requirement to stop a containment integrated leak rate test if excessive leakage is detected) and Section III.A.5.(b) (acceptance criteria for containment integrated leak rate tests with respect to determining the frequency of conducting future tests) was deferred pending resolution of ongoing rulemaking activities associated with Appendix J. SECY&hyph;94&hyph;036 dated February 17, 1994, described the staff's plans for completion of rulemaking on Appendix J and how plant-specific requests for contingency and performance based exemptions would compete for limited staff resources. The SECY paper further stated that the availability of staff resources for reviewing such exemptions would be extremely limited. Subsequently, by letter dated August 15, 1994, the licensee withdrew the amendment request. The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the Federal Register on March 31, 1993 (58 FR 16864). However, by letter dated August 15, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed change. For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated February 17, 1993, and the licensee's letter dated August 15, 1994, which withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Vespasian Warner Public Library, 120 West Johnson Street, Clinton, Illinois 61727. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 15th day of September 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Douglas V. Pickett, Acting Director, Project Directorate III&hyph;3, Division of Reactor Projects&hyph;III/IV, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
