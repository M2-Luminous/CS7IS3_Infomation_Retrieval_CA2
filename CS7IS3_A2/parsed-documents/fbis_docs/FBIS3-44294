Li Peng gave the interview in his Zhongnanhai office. He outlined the trend in China's economic development for 1994 in two sentences: "Reform will push ahead with major steps. The economy will develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner." He said: Specifically, the major reform steps will come in establishing the modern enterprise system and a restructuring of the finance, tax, monetary, investment, and foreign trade fields. All these will be oriented to building a socialist market economy. The State Council has proposed setting this year's economic growth rate at 9 percent, lower than that of last year, he said. With two successive years of high growth, some sectors of the economy are considerably burdened, with such "bottlenecks" as energy and communications presenting greater restrictions on economic growth. A relatively relaxed environment is necessary for sustained economic growth, he said. As compared with the economic growth rates in other countries in the world, 9 percent still represents a rather high growth rate. There may be many interpretations of "healthy development" but, for the present, it should primarily be defined as improvement of industrial structure and enhancement of economic efficiency, he said. During the nearly 90-minute interview, Li went to great lengths to expound the policy of price reform, saying that this will be in coordination with reforms in other fields, with the goal of keeping the price system in line with the rules of the market. Price reform must be carried out in a positive and prudent way, he said. In the past decade and more, China has taken major steps to reform the price system and has freed the prices of most commodities as planned, accumulating a wealth of experience. So far, 90 percent of commodities are regulated by the market, with only the prices of a small number of commodities which have a direct bearing on the national economy and people's livelihood, still under state control. The small number of commodities is mostly from the basic industries. The unreasonably low prices of these commodities have encouraged consumption and prevented the relevant industries from being developed. Readjusting these prices will involve greater difficulties, Li said. For example, the oil industry could not possibly be developed without readjustment of oil prices but the readjustment of oil prices would certainly affect the prices of oil products. So, we must readjust the prices step by step and in a very prudent manner. As China's markets are not yet fully fledged, a spontaneous and blind tendency tends to develop in the market. It is necessary for the state to practice macroeconomic control at the right time to protect the interests of the general public, he said. With every major reform measure we will take into account the capacity to bear of the country, enterprises, and people and adhere to the principle of step by step. If we take too drastic measures, they will certainly affect enterprise production costs and the people's livelihood. Li referred to the recent price fluctuation of grain in certain regions, which he said arose from a variety of reasons. As the government has sufficient grain reserves and state-owned grain sales departments function as the main channel, the fluctuation has gradually calmed down, he said. While this shows the strength of state macroeconomic control, the fluctuation should serve as lesson: That is, even with a good economic situation, we can never afford to lower our guard on the issue of prices and the governments at all levels must not wash their hands of the business, he said. Asked whether reform of the fiscal and tax systems, which might affect the interests of some localities and enterprises, will be carried out smoothly, Li Peng pointed out: In carrying out the fiscal and tax system reform, we mainly follow the principles of unifying tax laws and fairness of tax burden and change the fiscal contractual responsibility system into a tax-sharing system. The reform represents a restructuring of the interests mix and will not levy more tax or increase burdens on enterprises in general, so the reform will be in the interests of various quarters. The chief purpose of the reform of the fiscal and tax systems is to build up a reasonable tax system that will be in keeping with international practices and the demands of the socialist market economy. The tax-sharing system is a fiscal management system widely introduced by other countries practicing the market economy. With the introduction of the tax-sharing system, the government will certainly strengthen its capacity for macroeconomic control but most of the central government's increased revenues will return to localities in different ways, he said. Taking the ability to bear of localities and enterprises into account, and to ensure that the old and new systems dovetail, a transition period has been arranged during which the current pattern of interests distribution will remain unchanged. Even after that, the central government will only gradually raise its ratio of revenues from the increased portion of taxes, he explained. Concerning the relationship between the reform of the fiscal structure and the reform of the investment structure and that between the reform of the foreign exchange structure and the reform of the foreign trade structure, Li Peng said: The reform of the fiscal structure will promote the reform of the investment structure. The current practice in a society under the market economy shows that investment is regulated by the financial market, that the number of projects is determined by the amount of money available, and that the investment plan is determined by the industrial policies. On unification of the rates for yuan and the establishment of a single, controlled, and floating foreign exchange based on market supply and demand, the premier said this will be conducive to China's opening up and the development of its foreign trade and economic cooperation with foreign countries. This will also produce a positive impact on the process of gradually converging China's economy with the world economy, he said.
