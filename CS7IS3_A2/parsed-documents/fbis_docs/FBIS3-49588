"We have been threatened for two years and these threats are unworkable," General Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of staff of Bosnian Serb forces, told AFP. "Before bombing the Serbs, they would first have to distance them from Moslem positions," he said, stressing the close proximity of Moslem and Serb positions on the ground in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA meanwhile said as long as French peacekeeping forces are in Bosnia, "we can say with certainty that the French will not support any military intervention" against the Serbs. "These new NATO threats of bombing are a storm in a teacup," the agency said. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels on Tuesday said the Alliance was ready to launch if necessary -- under the authority of the UN Security Council -- air strikes against Bosnian Serbs, notably to open up the airport in Tuzla in the northeast and to give tactical support to allow some 300 Canadians blocked for six months by Serbs in the eastern Moslem enclave of Srebrenica to be relieved. A NATO bombing would force the Serbs to "re-examine all concessions made to the Moslems," Bosnian Serb strongman Radovan Karadzic had said Monday [10 January]. The speaker of the Bosnian Serb self-proclaimed parliament, Momcilo Krajisnik, meanwhile hailed NATO's decision to "give priority to the negotiating process" on Bosnia, without even bothering to comment on the new threats of bombing. Though NATO has on earlier occasions threatened possible air strikes to free surrounded civilians, get through humanitarian aid or protect UN troops, the Alliance has never carried out the threats. On each occasion, Karadzic has reported that any foreign bombing in Bosnian would turn each UN soldier into a potential target for Serbian reprisal attacks. There was no immediate reaction from Belgrade Tuesday on the NATO warnings against its allies in Bosnia. But it was seen among Belgrade circles as new pressure on Serbs prior to the negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina due to resume on January 18 in Geneva with the Moslems, Serbs and Croats to try to reach agreement.
