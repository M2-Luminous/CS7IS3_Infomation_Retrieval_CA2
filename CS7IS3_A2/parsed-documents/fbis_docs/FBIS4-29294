"With the adoption of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the quota system, which is against the spirit of GATT, will certainly be scrapped," Assistant to the coordinating minister for industry and trade Kosim Gandataruna said in Nusa Dua (Bali) Wednesday. After closing the 10th convention of the International Apparel Federation (IAF) here, he said: "If the negotiations have become stalled because of certain problems, this will not last for longer than a decade." He said that in the short-term Indonesia's exports of textile and textile products to the U.S. will continue despite the failure of negotiations. In reply to a question asking why the U.S. stubbornly maintained its uncompromising stance during the negotiations, he said that the U.S. side continues to link trade with, among other things, human rights practices in Indonesia.
