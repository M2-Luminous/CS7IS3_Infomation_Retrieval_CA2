Slovakia backs any joint initiative by the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland), Sitko said. But he added that Slovakia did not consider it a sole basis for all activities and tolerates the individual partners' right to their independent approaches. Sitko said Slovakia fully supported the U.S. Partnership For Peace project and would seek to develop good bilateral as well as multilateral relations with its neighbors. Asked whether the problem of the Hungarian ethnic minority in southern Slovakia would be on the agenda of the two countries' talks in Prague, Sitko said that this problem was intentionally dramatized. He said that ethnic Hungarians in southern Slovakia enjoyed standard rights and that relations between Slovak and Hungarian residents in the area were not conflicting. In his opinion, the problem serves certain Slovak and Hungarian politicians as a pretext for increasing their popularity.
