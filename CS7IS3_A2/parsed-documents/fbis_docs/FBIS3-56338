It has now become clear that the Federal Investigation Service is putting together a file on him. It is now known who invited "Adolfovich" (as one local paper said) to a mythical "European conference" in Berlin. The names of industrialists who have established cooperation with Zhirinovskiy have also found their way into the press. The news story about the sources of the Liberal Democrats' capital seems far more convincing than the conjectures about aid from Saddam Husayn and Gerhard Frey [name as transliterated]. So, what is the source of the Zhirinovskiy party's capital, according to the new version? His relations with the well-known Netherlands firm Global Money Management, and with GMM in Russia, which is headed by Anton Nenakhov, continue to be discussed. A Dutch journalist spoke about this in an interview with Radio Liberty. At the beginning of January, FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE wrote about Netherlands sources of the LDP's money, citing the Dutch newspapers DE VOLKSKRANT and ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD. The weekly WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE reported that Austrian police and German intelligence service personnel photographed Zhirinovskiy and his entourage in Austria. The magazine prints photographs of Zhirinovskiy, Vedenkin, Stoilov, and Neuwirth. Nenakhov was among the industrialists who were hovering around Zhirinovskiy in the Reinsberg hotel in Reichenfels (Austria), WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE writes. German intelligence has corresponding photographs received from Austrian police, whose agent, disguised as a skier, secretly filmed what was going on in the hotel. In Austria Zhirinovskiy's financial interests are represented by 23-year old Dmitriy Klinkov, who calls himself the commercial director of "IBS GmbH" and is constantly traveling between Moscow and Klagenfurt, WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE writes. One firm which is involved in trade with the East belongs to a former timber dealer, Josef Hambrusch, who is known to have maintained close contacts with Zhirinovskiy's partner Aleksey Vedenkin for a long time. According to the periodical PROFIL, he stated in Austria: "I am concerned that the party should have enough millions of dollars at its disposal. We are trading with this aim in mind, and this includes trade with local businessmen." The objects of trade are -- "petroleum, lumber, and everything that brings a profit." With Hambrusch's help Zhirinovskiy has established connections with another entrepreneur -- Edwin Neuwirth, a man with a very curious biography. At 16 he voluntarily joined the SS and to this day remains a member of "Fellowship No. 4," which brings together former SS men. In 1950 he obtained Austrian citizenship and started to trade in lumber; he traveled to Russia and Yugoslavia. It is believed that the LDP conducted its financial transactions in Austria through him. The third thread runs through Austria to the Balkans. A Bulgarian with an Austrian passport, Svetoslav Stoilov, is acting as middle-man for Zhirinovskiy; they met in Moscow a few years ago. He has a warrant personally signed by Zhirinovskiy 28 December 1993. It says (I cite the translation from the German): "I hereby confirm that Mr. Svetoslav Stoilov is my adviser on questions of economics and entrepreneurship." An Austrian police camera also captured Stoilov the consultant. However, he does not even hide his relationship with Zhirinovskiy. He willingly admits to journalists, for example, that he flew with him illegally (without a visa) from Austria to Greece, to Salonika, where "Vladimir bathed in the Aegean, and told him (Stoilov) there that he would be a most suitable president for Bulgaria, WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE writes. Through Stoilov Zhirinovskiy maintains ties with Balkan entrepreneurs. One of them is the Serb Petar Ivanovic, who has lived in Austria since 1968 and owns the OWK petrochemical company. Finally, another thread runs through Germany, to Berlin. There, on Kaiserin Augusta Allee, is the "Society for the Organization of Guardianship and Administration," which is officially involved in buying up enterprises in the former GDR and belongs to Werner Girke [surname as transliterated] and Werner Neumann. Both of them came to Austria in order to meet Zhirinovskiy. In actual fact the firm is involved in something quite different. It has become known that until May 1990 it belonged to the Swiss holding "ORVAG AG," which laundered Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] money in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, multiplying the wealth of the GDR's party-state leadership. Following unification, the legacy of the SED fell to the Party of Democratic Socialism, the richest of all the FRG political parties. FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU writes that Girke is suspected of laundering SED party money and that his contacts with Zhirinovskiy have seriously alarmed the Guardianship Council. The same newspaper writes that the Berlin police have searched the premises of Girke's firm. According to its reports, Zhirinovskiy received at least 3 million German marks for the election campaign with Girke's help. Proof of this is provided notably by bank accounts and receipts seized by the Berlin police during the search. According to these documents, Zhirinovskiy received this money via transfers into bank accounts in Moscow and Prague in the form of payment for "consultations."
