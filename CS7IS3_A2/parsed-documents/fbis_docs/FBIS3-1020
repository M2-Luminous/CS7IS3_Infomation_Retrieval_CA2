Dhlakama said Maringue residents are experiencing a bad period and if there is no urgent assistance, many people will die. The Renamo leader was speaking to reporters after landing at the Maputo International Airport, coming from Maringue, his movement's general headquarters. Afonso Dhlakama said the World Food Program [WFP] will stop assisting Maringue residents as of next month. This morning Radio Mozambique contacted the WFP to hear its stand in view of the statement made by the Renamo president. WFP Director Philip Clark has denied the allegations and says that civilians in areas under Renamo control have been receiving assistance without restrictions. [passage omitted]
