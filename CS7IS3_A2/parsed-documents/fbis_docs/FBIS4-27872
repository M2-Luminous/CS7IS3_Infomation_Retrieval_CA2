It decided to take all necessary countermeasures at home and abroad based on a firm policy to prevent by all means North Korea's nuclear development situation from causing public uncertainty or threatening the stability of the people's livelihood. At today's meeting, presided over by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, the government analyzed North Korea's recent responses and military movements, checked our Armed Forces' preparedness and the government's readiness for an emergency, and discussed ways to consolidate a pangovernmental preparedness for national security by unifying the national view. At today's meeting, the government decided to take all necessary countermeasures at home and abroad to prevent the situation which might cause public uncertainty or threaten the stability of people's livelihood in the midst of the rapidly developing situation, including the international community's move toward imposing sanctions against North Korea. The government will also continue to maintain close cooperation with the United States for establishing a quick military preparedness in the event of an emergency, while increasing an all-time capability of gathering information by operating at full capacity the national security-related permanent consultative system between the ROK and the United States. In the meantime, the government will concentrate on making diplomatic efforts to see our position accomplished in the international community based on the successes of President Kim Yong-sam's diplomacy through his visits. At the same time, the government will focus on establishing in-country public security by strongly dealing with, and taking legal measures against, those pro-communist forces that sympathize with or praise North Korea's allegations as seen at the ceremony launching the activities of the Korean Federation of General Student Councils [Hanchongnyon].
