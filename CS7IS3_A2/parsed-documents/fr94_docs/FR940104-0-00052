ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing a final hazardous waste listing determination for wastes generated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations in wood surface protection processes. Upon reviewing the public comments received on its proposal of April 27, 1993, the Agency has decided not to list wastes from the use of chlorophenolic formulations in wood surface protection processes. As a result of this determination, EPA is not mandating in this rule any specific operating or information collection requirements for owners/operators of wood surface protection plants. If, however, use of chlorophenolic formulations resumes in the future, the Agency would very likely re-evaluate this decision not to list. This rule also finalizes the proposed amendment of SW&hyph;846 (``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods'') to include Method 4010 (Immunoassay Test for the Presence of Pentachlorophenol). In addition, the Agency is adding the following four chemicals to 40 CFR part 261, Appendix VIII: Sodium and potassium salts of pentachlorophenol and tetrachlorophenol. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 4, 1994.
